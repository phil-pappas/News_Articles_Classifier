The personal life of the 'Partridge Family' star has been sliding dramatically since at least 2008, when he publicly acknowledged his alcoholism. By Jennifer Karmon - Yahoo US Homes   12 hours ago Print David Cassidy as Keith Partridge in 1972. David Cassidy, the 1970s Tiger Beat heartthrob who starred on the hit TV show \"The Partridge Family,\" sold his Florida mansion at bankruptcy auction Wednesday for $1.8 million (£1.1m), the Sun Sentinel reports — just under its $1.9 million appraisal value. \nFour people registered to bid. The winner was an investor who will probably rent it out and then resell it, according to the bidder's real estate agent. \"He looks for good deals, and he actually got a really good deal on it,\" the agent told the Sun Sentinel. \nAs Yahoo Homes reported in July, Cassidy has been experiencing daunting personal challenges for the past several years. He publicly acknowledged being an alcoholic in 2008, two months after his release from the Betty Ford Center for addiction treatment. In 2010, 2013 and 2014 he was arrested for drunken driving — and a month after the third arrest, his wife of 23 years filed for divorce. He filed for bankruptcy early this year. \nThe two have been trying to sell the house since August 2013, when they listed it at $4.5 million (£2.9m). The 7,000-square-foot Fort Lauderdale mansion has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, and it sits on a waterfront lot of nearly half an acre. Another real estate agent told the Sun Sentinel: \"It's a beautiful piece of land ... but the design is very, very dated.\" Some agents speculated that the structure would be torn down. \nThe couple bought the property in 2001 for $1.1 million (£710k) and spent about the same in renovations and additions. \nCassidy plans to move on with his girlfriend, he told the Associated Press in July: \"If you were alone in my situation, I think you'd be very unhappy.\" \nAll of the contents of the home were up for sale as well — but the guitars and pianos were exempt, because Cassidy is working on a Christmas album and on an album of songs he learned from his father.

This photo and the seven that follow were shot on July 22, 2015, when Cassidy took the Associated Press on a tour of the home in advance of the auction. Click here to see the video, which is at the bottom of Yahoo Homes' article. Here, he's shown in the family room holding one of his favorite guitars. All of the home's contents were auctioned off as well, but the guitars and pianos were exempt because he's working on two albums: one with Christmas music, and the other of songs that he learned from his father, the actor and singer Jack Cassidy.
