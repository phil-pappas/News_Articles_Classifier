He added that the Australian office had not been contacted by local police or government agencies.\n\"SCREWED UP\"\nOvernight, VW's U.S. head Michael Horn, who was attending a lavish event in New York to promote the 2016 VW Passat, admitted the company had \"totally screwed up\" and vowed to make amends.\nHorn's presentation did not promote the environmental efficiency of the Passat's \"clean diesel\" model, focusing instead on the vehicle's new sensor technology to assist with parking and avoiding accidents.\nIt is unclear what will be the ultimate cost of the scandal to VW, which also faces a class-action lawsuit from buyers, but sales of affected versions of the relevant models have already been suspended in the United States and Canada.\n\"I had to back out of a couple deals the same day,\" said a dealer attending Horn's event in New York. \"That hurt me because we found out in real-time. What are you going to do?\"\nGerman Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has expressed concern that the scandal could damage \"the justifiably excellent reputation of the German car industry\", and South Korea, where two thirds of all car imports in the first half were diesel, could be a significant early gauge of customer response.\nGerman car sales in South Korea have soared since a 2011 free-trade deal eliminated duties on vehicles imported from Europe. Vehicle imports from Germany rose 18.2 percent to $4.5 billion in the first eight months of 2015, South Korean customs data show, following a 42.5 percent increase for all of 2014.\nVolkswagen and Audi accounted for 28.2 percent of all foreign cars sold the in the first eight months, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association.\nSuh Sung-moon, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said local brands such as Hyundai and its sister firm Kia Motors would benefit.\n\"South Korean consumers are very sensitive to news, and this emission news will have an impact on the import market,\" he said.
