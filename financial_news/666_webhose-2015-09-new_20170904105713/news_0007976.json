A Commerce Department report at 1330 BST on US durable goods orders is forecast to show a 2.3% drop in August, compared to a 2.2% increase a month earlier. \nSeparately, the Commerce Department's new home sales data at 1500 BST is expected reveal a 1.6% rise in August after a 5.4% gain a month earlier. \nInitial jobless claims are projected to increase 275,000 in the week to 19 September, according to analysts' estimates ahead of the Labor Department's figures at 1330 BST. \nAfter the markets close Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will speak in Massachusetts at a lecture. \nLast week, Yellen said she was taking into account a wide range of economic data in determining when to raise rates. Her remarks came as the Federal Open Market Committee decided to hold rates at 0.25% amid weak inflation and market volatility in the wake of heightened concerns on how China's slowdown will impact the US economy. \n\"We believe that the zero interest-rate policy and quantitative easing approach has proven inefficient,\" said SwissQuote Research market strategist, Arnaud Masset. \"We predicted that no rate hike would happen as data has been coming in mixed and still believe that quantitative easing 4 is not far off.\" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda , said the Fed has left the market \"more confused than ever\" on when it will raise rates. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's as though a straitjacket has been applied to the markets,\" he said \"We're seeing the occasional struggle but ultimately the energy that was helping sustain markets at the elevated levels earlier this year is being drained. With so many markets in correction territory now I'm sure we'll soon break free from this and I think that would have happened last week had the Fed hiked rates.\" Meanwhile in the Eurozone, GfK (Swiss: GFK.SW - news ) 's forward-looking index on German consumer confidence fell to 9.6 in October from 9.9 a month earlier, missing forecasts of 9.8. \nThe IFO's business confidence index, however, rose to 108.5 from 108.3, beating estimates of 107.9. \nIn company news, Poundland plunged after making an application to place new shares on the market and raise approximate £50m ahead of its acquisition of 99p Stores. \nSmiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) was on the back foot as CEO Philip Bowman prepared to step down after announcing the full-year results. \nRolls Royce (LSE: RR.L - news ) jumped on news it will take a major share of £100m worth of contracts to supply the new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. \nRoyal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BP rallied as Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude ticked higher. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,020.63 -0.06% FTSE 100 6,023.57 -0.14% FTSE 250 16,662.73 +0.02% FTSE 100 - Risers Relx plc (LSE: REL.L - news ) (REL) 1,091.00p +1.96% Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) (LLOY) 74.15p +1.65% Next (EUREX: NXTI.EX - news ) (NXT) 7,615.00p +1.60% easyJet (EZJ) 1,783.00p +1.36% Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,409.00p +1.30% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 263.80p +1.15% Whitbread (WTB) 4,651.00p +1.15% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,219.00p +0.91% Compass Group (Other OTC: CMPGF - news ) (CPG) 1,034.00p +0.88% British Land Company (BLND) 830.00p +0.79% FTSE 100 - Fallers Smiths Group (SMIN) 1,000.00p -3.75% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 187.00p -2.71% Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.) 669.00p -1.55% Royal Dutch Shell 'B' (RDSB) 1,556.00p -1.24% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,542.50p -1.19% BP (BP.) 325.80p -1.11% Meggitt (MGGT) 467.70p -0.93% Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 226.60p -0.92% BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) (BG.) 960.60p -0.89% Tesco (TSCO) 167.15p -0.83% FTSE 250 - Risers AO World (Other OTC: AOWDF - news ) (AO.) 163.90p +4.59% Thomas Cook Group (TCG) 120.70p +4.14% Tate & Lyle (LSE: TATE.L - news ) (TATE) 568.50p +3.08% Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) (CHOO) 140.20p +2.64% Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) (MAB) 340.90p +2.37% Genus (GNS) 1,453.00p +2.25% Zoopla Property Group (WI) (ZPLA) 208.30p +1.71% Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group (JLT) 1,009.00p +1.56% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 157.70p +1.48% Mitie Group (Other OTC: MITFF - news ) (MTO) 281.70p +1.29% FTSE 250 - Fallers Petra Diamonds Ltd (LSE: PDL.L - news ) .(DI) (PDL) 91.95p -7.12% Euromoney Institutional Investor (ERM) 1,000.00p -6.01% Poundland Group (Other OTC: PDLDF - news ) (PLND) 293.90p -5.07% Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) (DRX) 247.60p -4.51% Circassia Pharmaceuticals (CIR) 297.90p -3.84% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 64.95p -3.78% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 78.80p -3.61% Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (LSE: MLC.L - news ) (MLC) 507.50p -2.22% Kier Group (LSE: KIE.L - news ) (KIE) 1,359.00p -2.09% Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) (ALM) 433.10p -1.79% FTSE TechMARK - Risers RM (RM (LSE: RM.L - news ) .) 175.00p +2.94% Oxford Biomedica (LSE: OXB.L - news ) (OXB) 9.07p +1.91% Ricardo (RCDO) 914.00p +1.33% Dialight (DIA (Amsterdam: DI6.AS - news ) ) 627.50p +1.13% NCC Group (LSE: NCC.L - news ) (NCC (BSE: NCC6.BO - news ) ) 268.75p +0.66% Skyepharma (SKP) 349.50p +0.58% SDL (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 335.75p +0.37% FTSE TechMARK - Fallers Sarossa (SARS) 1.77p -6.10% Oxford Instruments (Other OTC: OXGGY - news ) (OXIG) 558.50p -1.15% Spirent Communications (Other OTC: SPMYY - news ) (SPT (Taiwan OTC: 8431.TWO - news ) ) 76.75p -0.97% Innovation Group (Other OTC: INVGF - news ) (TIG) 39.50p -0.63% Sepura (SEPU) 173.50p -0.57% E2V Technologies (LSE: E2V.L - news ) (E2V) 230.00p -0.11% IShares Euro Gov Bond 7-10YR UCITS ETF (IEGM) € 202.18 -0.09%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:56:50.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
