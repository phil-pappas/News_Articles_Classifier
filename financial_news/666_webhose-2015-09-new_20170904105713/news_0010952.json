Anna Kucera by Ewin Hannan Lucille Keen Unions are downplaying the prospect of a legal challenge to remove the head of Royal Commission on Trade Union Governance and Corruption, Dyson Heydon, because they fear a court defeat would undermine their attacks on his credibility.\nAs the Abbott government criticised Labor's plan to have the Senate ask Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove to remove Mr Heydon's commission, senior union figures said on Tuesday that they could see \"little upside\" in pursuing court action.\nUnions, which have already been forced to spend millions of dollars defending themselves in the commission, are concerned that further legal action would be expensive. Officials said they believed unions had been successful in eroding the public standing of Justice Heydon and a court loss would be seized on by the Abbott government to try and restore the credibility of the commission.\nUnion leaders said a legal victory could prove counter-productive as the government might be forced to extend proceedings, which are likely to finish in about two months, ahead of Mr Heydon's scheduled report in December. They said the forced replacement of Justice Heydon could extend the commission into an election year.\nThe ACTU and unions leaders are unlikely to finalise their decision on any legal action until the Senate votes on Mr Heydon next week.\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz said the Senate motion was a \"stunt\" and would have no legal consequence. He said if the Labor Party had a problem with Mr Heydon's ruling \"they have the right to go to the courts to appeal that decision\".\n'Disgraceful, beyond belief' \"It is disgraceful. It is beyond belief that the Labor Party has become so unprincipled in their defence of corrupt union activity that they would go down this track and I trust that the independent senators will not fall for the stunt by Labor,\" he told ABC radio.\n Labor leader Bill Shorten said on Tuesday that the issue was sufficiently important to be put to a Senate vote.\n\"It sort of speaks volumes for the political nature of Tony Abbott's royal commission [that] the man in charge of the inquiry says it is okay to go to the Liberal Party events â€¦ What's next? Will Eddie McGuire declare himself okay to be the umpire in a Collingwood Grand Final?\" he said.\nThe commission on Tuesday resumed its hearings into the conduct of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in the Australian Capital Territory.\nCFMEU ACT organiser Anthony Vitler told the hearing he had heard on building sites that a union organiser \"was doing something not right\" and taking money from developers.\nBut he denied he knew it was Halafihi Kivalu, who was charged in July with blackmail.\n\"I had no idea who it might've been,\" Mr Vitler said, adding that \"smug remarks\" were sometimes made on building sites about the allegations. \"You cop it,\" he said. \"Take it with a grain of salt.\"\nIn hearings in July, the commission heard claims Mr Vitler was at a meeting with scaffolding subcontractors and the union attempted to pressure companies to sign workplace agreements in return for a price being set for all work.\nIn his witness statement he claimed to have: \"no recollection of anyone referring to agreeing on a minimal price for jobs or 'price fixing'.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:19:35.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
