Stefan Polates Share on twitter by Tony Walker Ambush: the faceless men who stalked Abbott\nBehold Malcolm Turnbull, the born-again conservative.\nOn the day after he cut Tony Abbott down in one of the more ruthless gambits witnessed in Australian politics in a very long time we were assured by one of his media acolytes the dreaded \"progressives\" would not be taking over the Liberal Party.\nThe member for Wentworth might be a progressive politically by every definition of the word, but he would curb his natural tendencies, put his progressive animal instincts in check in the interests of party unity and his own survival, according to this trope.\nThus Turnbull – a closet leftist, according to his detractors – has been put on notice that he had better not stray too far from the path of conservative righteousness or he will meet a fate similar to that of his predecessor, whose folly was not so much to stray as to blindly follow a course that was in danger of taking his party over a cliff.\n\"When did we become the left of the Liberal party,\" one of the smarter young conservative, right-leaning members of Parliament told AFR Weekend .\nThis individual, whose natural home might have been alongside a conservative leader, had concluded – reluctantly -- Abbott was beyond redemption, a victim of his own inability to make the transition from a sloganeering opposition leader to government.\nIn the days since Turnbull's late night putsch, AFR has canvassed Liberal views widely about where a smiling political assassin might take the party, and whether, under his direction, to what extent it would be less conservative and more liberal.\n Or, put another way, will it be more conservatively liberal in the tradition of John Howard and Robert Menzies , or more liberal still in the mould of Alfred Deakin, arguably Australia's greatest prime minister and, like Turnbull, someone who dabbled in journalism?\nOn October 8, 2012, Turnbull delivered the annual Alfred Deakin lecture at the University of Melbourne , as shadow minister for communications and broadband, in which he focused on freedoms associated with a digital revolution.\nIn this speech Turnbull did not stray, as he did on previous – and subsequent – occasions from his portfolio responsibilities beyond associating himself with Deakin as \"political liberals\".\nIn various speeches and interviews Turnbull has struggled to define liberalism with a small 'l' in his case, as if he could not accommodate the platitudes associated with such definitions.\n\"I think the best way I've been able to really distil it is that the liberal view of the role of government is to enable the citizen to do his or her best,\" he told The Monthly in 2012 .\nIn 2009, before he was cut down by his colleagues as opposition leader, Turnbull delivered the Menzies lecture in which he Quote: d the party founder as having said during the 1949 election campaign. \"Are we for the Socialist State, with its subordination of the individual to universal officialdom of government … or are we for the ancient British faith that governments are the servants of the people\".\nIn 2010, two years before Turnbull, Abbott delivered the Deakin oration in which he had sought to distance himself from Deakin while paying him his due as an early inspiration of Australian liberalism.\nAbbott and Deakin cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Turnbull and Deakin, on the other hand, share similar impulses, including a certain nationalism given expression by the former's republicanism.\nOf all the founding fathers, Deakin was probably the most nationalistic.\nThe question is whether these tendencies will be allowed to flourish in an environment in which the Liberal Party has steadily tacked to the right over the years – and lurched, in Abbott's case – to the point where he found himself in danger of becoming a political fringe dweller.\nHe found himself not only out of step with mainstream Australia on issues like gay marriage and climate change, but with some of his closest allies in the Liberal Party.\nHis disconnect with confidante Christopher Pyne, the Education Minister and Manager of Government Business in Parliament, on the same-sex marriage issue is one example. His war cabinet colleagues on moves to strip Australians of their citizenship without due process is another.\nCabinet colleagues were also uneasy about messianic national security stance when it came to dealing with an Islamic State \"death cult\". His pugilistic instincts needed to be restrained.\nThe consensus view among Turnbull's fellow Liberals is that he will \"stick to the script\", as one put it: that means no departure for the time being from a Direct Action Plan to mitigate climate change, even though he knows this is a highly imperfect – and economically illiterate – response to the problem.\nTurnbull will not rock the boat on socially sensitive issues like gay marriage. He has indicated he will honour Abbott's pledge to hold a plebiscite, even though he has derided such a course of action.\nHe will sheath his republicanism for the time being.\nHis mission will be to unite a fractured party, some of whose conservative elements are threatening to break away.\nEven more than normal, what will really define a Turnbull prime ministership is what he does about the economy. He will stand – or fall – politically on his success in re-establishing an economic narrative, restoring battered confidence and restarting the reform process.\nTurnbull might have encouraged a belief that under his stewardship the country will be back in business in the blink of an eye. But at risk of being intoxicated by his own political perfume he should know there will be no easy choices.\nIn the midst of the global financial crisis Turnbull, as opposition leader, showed good judgment when he decried Labor's profligacy: rightly, he questioned the need for panicky – and wasteful – expenditure to maintain growth.\nIn government, he will need to apply that rigour in ordering priorities, and, perhaps more to the point, selling them.\nFinally, we come to the issue of personality, which cannot be detached from politics, or ideology for that matter.\n\"Ninety per cent of politics is personality despite what people say,\" a senior former minister tells AFR Weekend.\nLike Kevin Rudd, Turnbull, for all his charm, has a difficult, mercurial, enigmatic, impulsive, self-regarding and manipulative personality. In the end it may not be managing the processes of government and establishing a Liberal narrative that brings him unstuck: rather it may prove to be his own idiosyncrasies.\nAs opposition leader he exhibited extremely poor political judgment on occasions.\nIn the end, the question may prove to be not whether he is too progressive, or not progressive enough, but whether he is able to curb his less appealing tendencies, which would have nothing to do with the direction of his party or the country.\nRead next: Morrison says Abbott offered to 'throw Hockey under a bus'", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@tonywalker1", "https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2012/april/1337744204/robert-manne/one-morning-malcolm", "http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/free-at-last-or-freedom-lost-liberty-in-the-digital-age-2012-alfred-deakin"], "published": "2015-09-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:06:50.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
