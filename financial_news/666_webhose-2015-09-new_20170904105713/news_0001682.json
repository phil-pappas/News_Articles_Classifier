She argued in favor of hiking interest rates this year, giving more clarity to Fed watchers.\nSigns of weak growth overseas won’t prove large enough to have a significant impact on policy, said the Fed chairwoman, whose remarks were briefly upstaged when she faltered and appeared to fall ill . Stocks world-wide have been mostly slumping since Yellen and other Fed officials last week flagged fears about the global economy as a reason to hold off on raising rates.\nOn the other hand, some analysts have predicted her latest speech could add to jitters.\nWithout further ado, here are some of the initial reactions:\n“Fed Chair Janet Yellen used a speaking opportunity at the University of Massachusetts to give out far more accurate guidance than all of the Federal Open Market Committee members and Fed officials have put together over the last week.…[A]fter all of that, one speech at a university answers the question the market wanted to know all this time. Bizarre.” — Scott Schuberg, CEO of Rivkin Securities in Australia\n“By nailing down the fact she still expected the FOMC to raise rates sometime this year she appeared to assuage some concerns in the market that the Fed had gone cold on the idea for a move in 2015.…but ultimately she hasn’t really said anything new, and last night’s speech appears to have been nothing more than a sop to the market, which continues to behave like a petulant child that constantly needs parental reassurance. She went on to play down the risks emanating from a China slowdown in contrast to last week’s statement and the markets appear to have liked the more upbeat tone, but she still left plenty of wiggle room…” — Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K.\n“It was a much more hawkish speech than the presser just last week and may have been a response to the wide criticism of the Fed for staying too dovish in the face of generally positive U.S. economic growth. It may have been also an attempt by Ms. Yellen to clarify the FOMC position and make sure that the market fully appreciates that the Fed intends to normalize policy over the near term horizon.” —Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign-exchange strategy at BK Asset Management in New York\n“Yellen’s comments will send jitters across the market, prompting traders to stay in a risk-averse mode.” — OCBC economist Barnabas Gan in Singapore\n“While her message was broadly the same as last week, she did add that she is among those that expects a rate hike this year which given her typically dovish stance is an important point. Risk sentiment is much improved so far in Europe today on the back of these comments and we’re seeing a similar pattern in U.S. futures.” — Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:03:40.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
