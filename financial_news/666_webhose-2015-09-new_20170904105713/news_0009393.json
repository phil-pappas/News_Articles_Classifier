The lessor will manage the aircraft leased to AirAsia’s associate carriers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and India, and will also market aircraft leaving the group’s fleet.\nAscend shows that the AirAsia group operates a fleet of 153 A320s, with orders for a further 311, including 304 of the re-engined neo variants.\nRelated Content PARIS: AirAsia ramps up leasing platform PARIS: AirAsia launches Airbus Smarter Fleet flight folder AirAsia to launch Kuala Lumpur-Goa service in August 'More rational' Malaysia market to be catalyst for AirAsia AirAsia posts 20% rise in Q1 operating profit AirAsia X eyes second half recovery", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:16:37.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
