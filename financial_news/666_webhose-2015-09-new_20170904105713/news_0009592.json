More Thousands of women lose on state pension \nBut a survey of more than 100 FTSE 350 employers has found that less than half, or 43 per cent, plan to offer their pension scheme members drawdown — which allows members to access their cash as they wish. \nThis is in spite of the same survey finding that most FTSE 350 employers surveyed — or 87 per cent — believe their staff want to access some or all of their savings using drawdown. \nAbout two-thirds of trust-based schemes, or those overseen by trustees, continued to target annuity purchase as the default option for their members, the survey found. \n“Based on our research, the ability to use drawdown is as important as the option to purchase an annuity for many members,” said Fiona Matthews, managing director of LifeSight, an arm of Towers Watson , the pension consultants. \n“It was inevitable there would be a trade-off between bringing the reforms in quickly and having everything working perfectly smoothly from the start. However, now the new rules are in place, the pensions industry must respond quickly to meet demand and agree best practices for drawdown.” \nThe research also found that some schemes had done little to make their members aware of the new pension freedoms. Just over half, or 51 per cent of trust-based schemes, had not sent targeted communications to members aged over 55 “leaving trustees with a significant risk that retirees select an annuity”, said Towers Watson. \n“Ultimately, people should be well-informed about their options, and be able either to access drawdown within their own schemes or have the option to transfer their pots cheaply and easily so they can access flexibility via an alternative arrangement,” added Ms Matthews. \nThe new flexible rules, which came into force in April, only applied to defined contribution pension schemes, not to the millions saving or drawing pensions from final salary or defined benefit plans. The government did not force insurers or pension providers to offer the full range of pension freedoms, including drawdown, but is currently consulting to ensure people are “treated fairly” when moving their pension to a company that offers them flexible options to access their savings. \nBlack Monday prompts rise in calls to pensions helplines \nPension advisers have reported a rise in enquiries from investors concerned about how the recent market volatility could affect their retirement savings. The pensions freedoms rules introduced by the government in April mean that an increasing number of retirement savers have chosen to keep their pension pots invested in the stock market, while drawing an income, rather than buy an annuity. \nContinue reading \nHowever, some experts said that rather than failing to respond, some trustees may be cautious, or concerned about the possibility of mis-selling claims in the future. \n“Trustees are conservative creatures and generally don’t rush to introduce new features,” said Duncan Buchanan, president of the Society of Pension Professionals. \n“There are also concerns about future mis-selling claims from employees who later feel they made the wrong decision to take their pension as a cash lump sum. \n“I suspect as the market settles down, we may see more trustees embrace drawdown.” \nMeanwhile, a separate study has suggested that most employers had not adapted their investment strategies to make them relevant for the majority of pension savers. \nThe survey of leading UK companies found that less than half or 44 per cent of respondents were able to confirm their company had adjusted the default strategy of their defined contribution (DC) scheme in light of the new pension rules. \nJLT Employee Benefits, the pension consultants who conducted the survey, said the absence of DC default fund reviews may present real risks to members as default fund investment strategies had historically targeted an annuity purchase at retirement. \n“A fund that continues to employ a seemingly safe strategy of investing into long-dated gilts and corporate bonds to track the price of annuities more closely becomes quite risky if members do not plan to buy this type of longevity insurance,” said Maria Nazarova-Doyle, deputy head of DC investment consulting with JLT. \n“For instance, pension savers looking to withdraw cash lump sums or use income drawdown could be left open to the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations without much of an upside.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
