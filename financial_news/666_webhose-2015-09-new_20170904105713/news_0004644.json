But I do like to look back.” So says Francesca Amfitheatrof, the infectiously energetic creative director of Tiffany & Co.\nShe is holding court at the American jeweller’s Champs-Élysées store in Paris to launch two new jewellery collections as part of autumn 2015 Haute Couture Week: Masterpieces, a new range of diamond jewellery (which sadly won’t be coming to Australia but will be available in Singapore from October) that was inspired by Manhattan’s art deco skyscrapers at night; and V.I.B, which is made up of three existing lines (Victoria, Infinity and Bow) that Amfitheatrof has dusted down and updated, to be launched in Australia this September.\n“We have an incredible archive at Tiffany and so we keep finding these sleeping treasures that just need waking up. We don’t copy them but each one leads us to create something new,” explains the 40-something American-Italian as she snacks on fresh pineapple. “With Masterpieces I am still playing with some high-end, dreamy jewellery but at the same time I am also introducing things that can become iconic Tiffany pieces.”\nBvlgari hidden treasures earrings. Antonio Barrella For future icons, see an 18-carat gold, $US275,000 ($372,000) necklace from the Masterpieces range, whose swags of rose-cut diamond chains are caught up in a side-fastening clasp, its diamond-studded, ball-ended tassels nothing short of delicious; or the instant wearability of a pair of Infinity sterling silver stud earrings, which, at $US230, sits at the other end of the spectrum.\nIndeed, it seems Amfitheatrof has mastered the biggest challenge for any creative director of a luxury goods house: to balance paying homage to the brand’s heritage while boldly looking forward in a way that doesn’t alienate existing clients but also appeals to a new generation of consumers seeking something more casual but no less spectacular.\n“For me this balance is not so difficult,” Bulgari creative director Lucia Silvestri says. She is in Paris at the same time to unveil Bulgari’s new collection of high jewellery, Italian Gardens. “I feel the heritage all the time because in Rome we have the archive and a museum, and I have an office with a table full of gems. But my focus is on the contemporary. I am projecting towards the future for a modern woman who is independent and self-confident but at the same time feminine and romantic.”\nBlooming in Silvestri’s imaginary Italian Renaissance garden are graphic, Buxus‑hedged flower beds captured in a whopping great pair of 143.1-carat emerald earrings (“We sold them immediately”) and the blue of a formal garden fountain reflected in a necklace with a 45.57-carat sapphire at its centre (“again, sold immediately”).\n From Tiffany's Masterpiece collection. There are also nods to Bulgari’s glorious past in a teardrop emerald necklace (molto Elizabeth Taylor, Bulgari’s most famous client); bejewelled snakes from its signature Serpenti range; and collars that drip lolly-coloured cabochon jewels.\n“My biggest inspiration is the actual gems,” says Silvestri, who was just 18 when she followed in her father’s footsteps and began her career in Bulgari’s gemmological department in Rome. “I am inspired to create the moment I see them. My other source of inspiration is travel – like when I went to the Royal National Park in Australia. It gave me a big inspiration for a necklace of aquamarines and tourmalines.”\nOld techniques, modern spin Tiffany and Bulgari are just two of the high-end jewellery brands that are now showcasing new haute joaillerie collections in conjunction with the Paris haute couture schedule.\nTreasures from Tiffany & Co's Bow collection will be launched in Australia this September. Chanel and Christian Dior, cornerstones of Paris’s haute couture dressmaking tradition, also present high jewellery collections alongside their hand-beaded gowns and made-to-measure suits, similarly applying a 21st-century vision to 19th- and early 20th‑century handcrafts.\n“It’s in the high jewellery collection that we can really use the Métiers d’Art [Chanel’s annual artisan showcase] know-how and put a modern spin on old techniques,” says Benjamin Comar, Chanel’s international fine jewellery director.\nHe picks up a matching set of jewels from the brand’s new Talisman collection, made of pavé diamond chain links from which are suspended painted, white-gold medallions in the shape of camellia flowers. “That technique is called grisaille,” Comar says of the nearly forgotten way of painting entirely in a monochrome palette, usually in shades of grey. “It’s not a new technique but I haven’t seen it used in fine jewellery before.”\nComar’s pièce de résistance is the €2 million ($3 million) Lion Mosaique necklace, which weighs a featherlight 80 grams despite being packed with 106 carats of diamonds – a labour of love more than 800 hours in the making. “This piece is key to Chanel jewellery’s craftsmanship,” Comar beams.\nChanel's Benjamin Comar. And yet for all of the super-modern technical abilities that each jewellery house has been relishing, the dominant aesthetic themes have been nothing more futuristic than old-fashioned bows, ribbons and flowers.\n“The archive at Tiffany & Co is filled with bows in every possible permutation, so it was nice to play with that idea and bring them back,” Amfitheatrof says. “Plus, after the launch of the Tiffany T collection, which is much more modern and urban, it was important for us to address, through our diamonds, a more feminine vocabulary within our jewellery.”\nNot that Amfitheatrof’s bows are anything other than cool. “They’re more of a lasso knot,” she says of the bows, which perch on slim bangles and torque necklaces at a jaunty, carefree angle. “Yes, you want to be feminine but you also want to be relaxed about it. There shouldn’t be this uptight, prissy puritanism.”\nOver at Chanel, ribbons come lacquered and bejewelled in the rich Byzantine colours that Mademoiselle Chanel loved so much (“Why does all that I do become Byzantine?” Chanel herself once asked.)\nChildlike wonder Meanwhile at Dior, ribbons are testament to the skill of the jeweller’s engineering craft, capturing the shimmer, ripple and drape of grosgrain ribbon in white gold and baguette diamonds for necklaces, bracelets and rings.\n“When you play with a ribbon, it’s instinctive and ephemeral,” says Victoire de Castellane, creative director of Dior’s fine jewellery division. “I wanted to keep that notion of freedom in this collection.”\nIt is perhaps de Castellane who has, more than any other haute joaillerie designer, given such unashamed feminine prettiness a hefty dose of cool through her modernist sense of proportion (bigger is best) and colour (think kaleidoscopic on LSD). As such, Dior’s diamond ribbons pop with bright green emeralds, electric blue sapphires and orange diamonds.\n“Who said that real jewels have to be boring? I don’t like the vulgarity of jewellery where is there is no creation, just a price,” de Castellane told me in London, just after creating her first Jardin de Milly-La-Forêt collection. “I prefer huge coloured stones and I like to wear big things that look fake, like costume jewellery, but which are in fact real.”\nAnd herein lies the clue to de Castellane’s success: she creates fine jewellery with the eyes of a child. It’s an instinct fed by a form of nostalgia more potent than that of yesteryear aesthetics: personal memories.\n“My grandmother was Sylvia Hennessy,” reminisces de Castellane about the lady of Hennessy Cognac fame who famously changed her baubles three times a day to match her outfits. “Her best friend was [the American heiress] Barbara Hutton. One day my mother took me to see Barbara, who looked fabulous in a caftan and a tiara of huge emeralds. I was just transfixed.”\nA sense of childlike wonder also remains a vibrant source of inspiration for Tiffany & Co’s Amfitheatrof. “My mother and family have always worn a lot of jewellery and I remember my grandmother had this beautiful gold chain with a big amber pendant which had a fly caught inside of it,” she says. “I used to lay on her lap and look up at that big pendant and think that it was going to drip honey in my mouth. It was always so inviting.”\nThere can be no denying that Tiffany, Dior Fine Jewellery and Bulgari have the advantage over their competitors. With a female creative director at the helm (each is the first woman to hold that position within their respective companies), the integrity and authenticity of the jewels they create as women for women inevitably trickle down to the retail level, where more and more women are buying jewels for themselves.\n“If you buy yourself an expensive handbag or a suit, then why not a ring?” de Castellane asks. “After all, you make your own luxury and luxury is when you spoil yourself. And jewellery never dies. You can pass it on to your daughter or son. It’s with you for eternity.”\nComar nods: “There is a new dynamism within the fine jewellery market because women want real jewels that are easy to wear, comfortable and creative.”\n“I don’t like jewellery that’s heavy and where it feels like there’s too much going on,” Amfitheatrof agrees, bedecked in a simple Tiffany T chain necklace and the jingle-jangle of her favourite cuff bangles as she excitedly walks me through the other two collections that have been subjected to her tinkerings – Victoria and Infinity.\n“Victoria was an existing collection made from marquise-cut diamonds set at an angle but I wanted to update it by mixing in different cuts of diamond [pear-shaped and round brilliants] and it immediately feels more relaxed and more playful,” she says.\n“As for Infinity, well, that was a symbol we had used before and I wanted to update it and to make it more a part of the vocabulary we are creating now. I think that it’s important to not only launch new collections but also to sprinkle some magic on existing ones.”\nNostalgia never looked so good.\nRead next: These nostalgic watches point to the future", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:11:07.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
