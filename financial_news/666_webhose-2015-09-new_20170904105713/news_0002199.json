David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Australia's parochial regional banking market must look attractive to former Bank of Queensland chief executive Stuart Grimshaw as he grapples with a seemingly endless stream of problems in his new career in pawnbroking.\nGrimshaw left BoQ last year to undertake a turnaround at United States pawnbroking group EZCORP. He left a secure banking job paying $3 million a year to take up a highly risky role based in Austin, Texas.\nThe risk is recognised in his generous share options package which has the potential to deliver Grimshaw up to $50 million over five years if he delivers what is promised. That is about as much as the chief executive of a major Australian bank would earn over the same period.\nGrimshaw knew the EZCORP job would be tough. EZCORP's owner, Australian-born private equity investor Phillip Ean Cohen, had recently ousted almost the entire board. Also, the company was the subject of an independent investigation into potential breaches of fiduciary duties by directors and it was caught up in a broader federal investigation into US payday lenders that charge usurious interest rates.\nGrimshaw, who was highly respected in the banking community in Australia, quickly got his mind around the unique profit drivers in pawn shop lending.\nAfter a six-month review of the business, Grimshaw was forced to sack 1300 people as part of pulling out of the company's US financial services business.\nThis was a pragmatic solution to the increasingly aggressive stance of US regulators against payday lending. But it had short-term costs of $US85 million in charges and costs.\nThe new strategy was to focus on the company's best growth areas, which are pawnbroking in the US and Mexico and payday lending in Mexico. The Mexican payday lending business is less of a problem because it focuses on public servants who pay their interest obligations from salary deductions.\n It is one thing having a new strategy but Grimshaw's efforts to sell it to the market were hampered by an accounting scandal.\nIn July, Grimshaw announced that EZCORP would \"restate its financial statements for fiscal 2014 (including the interim periods within that year) and the first quarter of fiscal 2015\".\nThe restatement related to the Mexican lending business called Grupo Finmart. It had to reverse profits earned on the sale of certain loans.\nThis was a messy readjustment because the company was unable to quantify the effect of reversing the sale accounting treatment.\nThe company was already reviewing its Grupo Finmart loan portfolio at the time of the restatement. That involved potentially material disclosures but these were not fully quantified.\nThe bottom line was that Grimshaw was restricted in his ability to talk to the market about the financial impact of his strategic changes. This week Grimshaw announced that EZCORP had taken control of Grupo Finmart.\nHe told Chanticleer that the economics of pawnbroking were very attractive. Customers who lodged goods with pawn shops in return for cash were charged interest of 65 per cent. He said bad and doubtful debts were about 5 to 6 per cent.\nSince he arrived as CEO of EZCORP Grimshaw has being steadily expanding the company's pawn store network. The company bought another 13 stores this week in Arizona and Oregon for $US12.5 million in cash.\nGrimshaw has brought in a new chief financial officer, Mark Ashby, who was CFO at Myer.\nBoth Ashby and Grimshaw will probably have to wait some time to enjoy the fruits of their generous equity options plans. EZCORP shares have been weak, underperforming the market this year.\nEZCORP is expected to lift earnings strongly over the next two years according to consensus estimates published by Capital IQ. The consensus is for EZCORP earnings to rise by 18 per cent in 2016 and 20 per cent in 2017.\nHowever, Grimshaw's latest thorny problem is in Australia, which is home to EZCORP's 32 per cent subsidiary Cash Converters.\nOn Thursday, Grimshaw announced he was taking over as chairman of Cash Converters and launching a strategic review of the business with the assistance of consulting group CACE Partners.\n\"As an outcome of this review, CACE Partners and the company will formulate its three-year strategic growth plan â€“ the scope of this work is expected to take around 16 weeks to conclude,\" the company said.\nThe good news for Cash Converters shareholders was that Grimshaw had managed to persuade former Bankwest CEO of retail banking Mark Reid to become CEO of Cash Converters.\n\"His operational experience in retail banking and people leadership will greatly enhance our Australian business, in particular the financial services business and products,\" the company said.\nReid was previously CEO of Greenstone, the insurance sales group that pulled its initial public offering earlier this year.\nGrimshaw took a big risk heading to the US to run a business in an industry that was completely different to banking.\nBut his view is that lending through pawn shops requires the same disciplines as those used in banking, including credit risk management, margin protection and customer segmentation.\nShort sellers hit The decision by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to target the short sellers who have built up positions of about $2 billion in the company has echoes of the global financial crisis.\nOne market observer said it had echoes of the action by Chinese authorities to suppress short selling.\nBut the CBA move should not be seen as a blanket ban on short selling.\nThe bank is simply saying to the market that it will not allow short sellers and prime brokers to have a free ride and profit from a bookbuild for selling share entitlements.\nShort sellers provide liquidity and have no trouble borrowing stock from long-only investors.\nBut the requirement on them to declare their short positions before being allowed to participate in a bookbuild is quite unusual.\nFuture Generation gives back Fund manager Geoff Wilson from Wilson Asset Management is arguably one of the most persuasive individuals in financial services.\nHis powers of persuasion are evident from the long list of international fund managers who were convinced to back his concept of an internationally focused listed investment company that handed all fees to various charities and not-for-profit groups.\nIt says a lot about the quality of the fund managers that the Future Generation Global Investment Company is the largest LIC capital raising in 2015 at $302 million.\nIt listed on the ASX on Thursday and closed at $1.05, a 4.5 per cent discount to the issue price of $1.10 a share.\nWilson first tested and proved the pro-bono fund manager business model with the launch last year of the Future Generation Investment Company. It charged shareholders zero management fees and zero performance fees. This arrangement allows the fund to donate 1 per cent of its net tangible assets each year to not-for-profit groups.\nBased on its current assets, the Future Generation Global Investment Company will be able to donate $3 million a year to worthwhile causes.\nWilson has a quality board including chairman Belinda Hutchinson, chancellor of the University of Sydney.\nThere are two aspects to the Future Generation funds management concept. Apart from the involvement of fund managers who work for free, there has been strong support from leading Australian philanthropists, foundations, corporations and individuals. At Sydney's Thursday launch, prominent financial services figure Paul Clitheroe said he and his wife Vicki bought $1 million worth of shares. Other major investors were the Smith Family, Peter Scanlon's Scanlon Foundation, the KordaMentha Partners consortium led by Mark Korda and David Winterbottom, and QBE Insurance, which invested $30 million.\nWilson said it was appropriate the fund had been listed on World Suicide Prevention Day given the focus on assisting people with mental health issues by the charities and not-profits benefiting from the company's annual donations.\nThe fund managers involved are: Magellan Asset Management, Ironbridge Capital, Cooper Investors, Marsico Capital Management, VGI Partners, Antipodes Partners, Nikko Asset Management, Ellerston Capital, Manikay Partners, Morphic Asset Management, Neuberger Berman, Paradice Investment Management, Tribeca Investment Partners, Hunter Hall Investment Management, Insync Funds Management, Eastspring Investments, Avenir Capital and Optimal Fund Management.\nThe following charities will benefit: beyondblue, Black Dog Institute, Brain and Mind Research, Butterfly Foundation, headspace, MadCap Social Enterprise, Orygen, ReachOut Australia and SANE Australia.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-10T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:08:10.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
