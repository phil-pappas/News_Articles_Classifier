Alexander Bolton: Senate Democrats held ranks Thursday and blocked a resolution disapproving the Iran nuclear deal, handing President Obama a major political victory. Only a few months earlier, some Senate opponents of the deal predicted they would be able to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto. They fell far short of their goal this week in a 58-42 vote. Sixty votes were necessary to move forward. Republicans refused to concede defeat, however, and said they would force Democrats to vote on Iran again next week. http://bit.ly/1NshPCy \nTHIS IS OVERNIGHT FINANCE, and you've almost made it to Friday.

Mark Schoeff Jr. for Investment News: \"Members of Congress showed their stripes at a hearing in the House of Representatives on Thursday, with Democrats appearing willing to stand with the Obama administration on a controversial Labor Department regulation that would raise investment advice standards for retirement accounts. \n\"For the most part, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee did not call for halting the proposal when two of the panel's subcommittees met to examine the rule. The hearing focused on legislation written by Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., that would force the DOL to hold off on finalizing its rule until the Securities and Exchange Commission acted on a similar measure that would apply to all retail investment advice.\" http://bit.ly/1KHuvF2 \nSHOCK POLL: SANDERS SURGES PAST CLINTON IN IOWA. Mark Hensch: \"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has surged past fellow 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Iowa, according to a new poll.

Speaking at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton promised to be a ‘strong advocate for families.’ While she had previously backed the policies, Clinton laid out those specifics for the first time this week. Americans currently can take up to 12 weeks off of unpaid leave each year to take care of family or new children, but there’s no requirement for paid leave. The U.S. is the only major economy that doesn’t require paid leave for new mothers.\" http://bit.ly/1EQUxDm \n-- SERVER-GATE UPDATE: HUMA HEADED TO HILL TO TESTIFY, via Alexander Bolton: Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin is scheduled to testify before the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, in the coming weeks. http://bit.ly/1L57zy4 \nMeanwhile... \nBIDEN SIGNALS SUPPORT FOR $15 MIN WAGE, via Jesse Byrnes: Vice President Biden on Thursday praised New York Gov. Andrew Cumo’s push for a statewide $15 minimum wage, calling for a “decent, living wage.\" He said Cuomo's call for phasing in a statewide $15 minimum wage for all industries by 2021 was a “smart, reasonable plan.” \n-- WHY IT MATTERS, via Byrnes: The vice president was road-testing his economic message in the backyard of Hillary Clinton, a former New York senator and secretary of State who he is considering challenging in 2016. Clinton, who has backed the idea of a higher minimum wage on the campaign trail, hinted earlier this summer that she supported legislation raising the federal minimum wage to $12. She supported raising the New York minimum wage for fast-food workers to $15 earlier this summer. http://bit.ly/1EZA9Qk \nBUDGET WATCH , via THE Rebecca Shabad: The top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday warned GOP leaders not to attach language regarding the Iran nuclear deal to a bill that would fund the government. “With a mere seven legislative days remaining before another pointless and damaging government shutdown, it is astounding that Republican leadership is still entertaining attaching poison pill riders to a Continuing Resolution [CR],” Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. http://bit.ly/1Q4IrXG", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:01:13.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
