The idea behind these investments is an equity strategy that aims to capture reasonable returns with less risk.\nBut before tucking such funds into a portfolio and heading off to bed, investors need to understand not only the benefits but the limitations of these products.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Beyond 9/11: Alger Comes Back Hulbert on Bear-Market Havens Can You Use a “529” for Airfare? U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month Water: The New Investing Factor For example, low-vol funds can offer great downside protection, says Farris Shuggi, an analyst at mutual-fund company T. Rowe Price Group Inc. TROW 2.46 % But typically, Mr. Shuggi adds, whenever stocks go into rally mode, “these strategies are going to underperform.”\nStrong demand from anxious investors has led investment firms to roll out more than 20 low-vol stock funds and exchange-traded funds since 2011. These funds and ETFs aim to tame volatility by buying stock in only financially strong companies whose share prices tend to move much less than broad market indexes.\nStudies suggest that such stocks can deliver better risk-adjusted returns over time than more speculative stocks—and that has certainly been the case during the recent market correction. In August, the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF USMV 2.09 % (USMV), the largest of its genre, shed about 4.5% while the S&P 500 index was down more than 6%.\nBut China-driven market disruptions notwithstanding, this might not be an ideal time to rush into a low-vol fund, says Morningstar Inc. MORN 1.67 % analyst Michael Rawson. People who think stocks are in for a much bigger decline might be better off going to cash, Mr. Rawson says, while those who expect the rally to resume would fare better with somewhat more aggressive equity strategies.\nHere are some important things to understand about low-volatility funds.\nThe benefit is relative Studies suggest that low-vol stocks deliver better risk-adjusted returns. However, the returns of purely low-volatility portfolios stand out less when compared with returns of moderately volatile stocks, according to research by University of Rochester professor Robert Novy-Marx.\nENLARGE In an analysis last year, Prof. Novy-Marx found that in a 45-year span ended in 2013, moderately volatile stocks performed fairly similarly to stocks with the lowest volatility—and significantly better than the most volatile stocks. A key reason is that the most volatile stocks often are those of unprofitable companies classified as “small growth” stocks. In “large cap value,” the study added, aggressive stocks actually outpaced more-defensive issues.\nJoseph Flaherty, chief investment-risk officer of Boston-based MFS Investment Management, counsels long-term investors to own a mix of low- and moderate-volatility stocks—providing the latter are financially strong companies with positive earnings momentum and attractively priced shares.\n“It’s less about concentrating on low volatility and more about avoiding high volatility,” he says.\nLow-vol funds might face headwinds Although market volatility may continue, funds that specifically aim for lower volatility might deliver weaker performances than in the past, some analysts believe. One concern centers around valuations, which have risen a lot because of strong inflows into low-vol funds. Morningstar estimates that more than $6 billion has flowed into low-vol equity ETFs in about the past year.\nIs low volatility the goal? Or just avoiding high volatility? Photo: iStock/Getty Images Their valuations looked even less compelling after the August market meltdown, says Mr. Rawson. Around the month’s lows, the S&P 500 index had fallen to about 86% of what Morningstar calculates as fair market value. The iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, because it held up relatively better, stood at about 92% of fair market value at that point, thus trading at a smaller discount.\nIn the longer term, low-vol stocks also may eventually face competition from rising bond yields, says Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan. Low-vol funds tend to own companies with stable cash flow. Those are comparatively more rate-sensitive than, say, cyclical stocks, whose cash flows would swell in an expanding economy, offsetting the impact of rising rates.\nStrategic is preferable to tactical It is tempting to jump into low-volatility funds whenever a market downturn seems imminent. But most nonprofessional investors would fare better by taking a buy-and-hold approach, fund managers say.\nMoving tactically in and out of funds is a form of market timing—a practice that frequently trips up individuals. Moreover, there could be benefits to making low-volatility shares a permanent part of a portfolio.\nBecause low-vol strategies moderate downside moves, an investor who uses them as part of a broader portfolio could boost exposure to stocks without taking a lot more risk, says Paul Zemsky, who oversees multiasset strategies at the investment arm of Voya Financial Inc. For example, he says, a person who might otherwise hold 50% in stocks could boost that to 60% using a low-vol strategy and still not lose sleep.\nOther ways to damp volatility In a strengthening economy, if stocks rally, low-vol stocks might provide better risk-adjusted returns than bonds. But people who don’t own at least some bonds are reducing diversification, says John Rafal, founder and vice-chair at the Connecticut-based advisory firm Essex Financial Services.\nMr. Rafal calculates that in the two decades ended last year, a 60%-40% stock-bond mix would have produced average annual gains of about 9%—less than the 11.7% annual return for an all-stock portfolio over the same period. But the stock-bond mix would have had about half as much volatility, he says.\nAnother traditional investment strategy—focusing on stocks with consistently rising dividends—also can reduce volatility, says James Norman, who heads QS Batterymarch Financial Management Inc. The firm uses that approach in Legg Mason’s QS Batterymarch Global Dividend fund (LMQSX), which it subadvises.\nLow-vol ETFs’ rate risk PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), with some $4.7 billion in assets, is a suitable core holding for conservative investors, a Morningstar analysis says. Like its iShares peer, SPLV beat the S&P 500 in August, declining about 5%, or about one percentage point less than the broad index.\nStill, some investors worry about its rate sensitivity. The fund tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which is rebalanced quarterly and holds the 100 stocks in the S&P 500 with the lowest volatility in the prior 12 months. At times, that has included a hefty portion of rate-sensitive utilities, although that allocation recently has fallen significantly.\nRiverFront Investment Group, in Richmond, Va., has switched from SPLV to PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility Portfolio XRLV 1.95 % (XRLV), which is similar, but excludes stocks that fare poorly in rising-rate periods, says Peter Quinn, president and chief operating officer of RiverFront.\nSPLV doesn’t have constraints on allocations, so the rate-sensitive portion of its portfolio could increase again over time, says John Feyerer, head of ETF product strategy at Invesco PowerShares. He says PowerShares launched XRLV to meet demand for an ETF that provided both low equity volatility and less exposure to rates.\nSome active funds worth a look ETFs offer low-vol portfolios with straightforward strategies and low fees.\nBut a low-cost actively managed fund that might be worth considering is Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility (VMVFX), says Morningstar’s Mr. Bryan. With more than 400 individual securities in its global portfolio, the fund offers both lower equity volatility and substantial diversification at a relatively modest cost—an expense ratio of 0.30 percentage point. The fund fell slightly less than 4% during August.\nThe fund aims to reduce volatility from currency fluctuations by hedging its foreign-currency exposure. But it isn’t an index fund, thus its managers have more flexibility to tweak the portfolio, the analyst says. Mr. Bryan adds, “It takes a reasonable approach.”\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.
