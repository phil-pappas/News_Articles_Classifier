Nic Walker by Jacquie Hayes\nGina Rinehart's very public stoush with her children might have been bad for her, but it seems to have contributed to the greater good.\nUltimately, nobody wants to be her or, more accurately, end up in a position like hers. Her protracted and painful court battle with her family has sparked a run on companies that act as objective third parties in managing the unique dynamics that arise in family businesses.\nSuch advisers help families deal with the here and now, but they also hand-hold them in their wealth- and business-transition decisions between generations.\nThis is important at a time in our history when we are about to see the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth this nation has ever seen.\nGina Rinehart's protracted and painful court battle with her family has sparked a run on companies that act as objective third parties in managing the unique dynamics that arise in family businesses. Nic Walker Research by professional services network PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that $3.5 trillion in wealth will be passed from Australia's baby boomers to the next generation over the next 20 years.\nParents avoiding the money talk But there are problems ahead as many parents in wealthy families refuse to talk to their children, particularly about money and wealth, says David Smorgon, a man who knows a thing of two about how a long-standing family business can fall apart.\nThe Smorgon family is considered Australia's richest, with an estimated worth of $2.8 billion, according to BRW . But the family business, which over almost 70 years grew from humble Russian immigrant beginnings into a behemoth diversified across manufacturing and steel, was eventually divested because of family disharmony.\n Smorgon was shattered, but says his biggest regret was that he lost the chance to give his three sons the opportunity to join the family business, as he and his two brothers had done under their father.\n\"I wish I knew back in the 1990s a little of what I know today, because maybe my family story might have been a bit different,\" he says.\nThese days, Smorgon is on the road as the executive chairman of PWC's Family Business and Wealth division, providing advice to the growing number of families who want to avoid a Rinehart-style blowout.\nFrom what he's seen, there are still plenty of patriarchs refusing to let go and continuing to manage things in a dictatorial way.\n\"When I see parents controlling their children with the cheque book, not giving them any respect, not giving them any say or authority, it's no wonder the kids are going down a route of drugs and alcohol and all sorts of other terrible things,\" Smorgon says.\nFour family stumbling blocks From the 300 families he's seen across the country, four big issues have emerged.\nFirst, family businesses are failing for family reasons and not for business reasons.\nSecond, there is clear lack of effective and regular communication between one generation and the next.\nThird, the growing rate of intermarriage in our multicultural society is introducing a sometimes hostile element.\nAnd, fourth, wealth is becoming a burden rather than a benefit to the next generation.\n\"This is just tragic,\" Smorgon says, \"and it's all because there is no communication between the parents and the children about what the wealth is for, about who [they] are, what [they] stand for and what the purpose of the wealth is.\"\nAnyone involved with families knows that successful relations require trust, connection, openness and togetherness.\n\"The minute that starts to fracture you've got issues, particularly when you spend 99 per cent of your time on business issues and 1 per cent of your time on family issues,\" Smorgon says.\nPlan decades ahead Succession is a process, not an event, and it's critical to family continuity, says Smorgon. \"That's why it's essential that planning for it starts 10 to 20 years ahead. It takes that long to work out the attributes required of the next leader of the business.\"\nTo help facilitate the transition, regular family meetings – separate from but alongside board meetings – are essential.\nThis might be easier said than done in families where tensions are high. That's why a key component of their success is to have an independent, objective person chair the meetings.\n\"You cannot chair your own meeting because you always have the kids in their boxes. It won't work,\" Smorgon says.\nEach child should be involved in putting the agenda together, and each should be treated equally, whether or not they work in the business.\n\"It's all about having the right attitude and allowing everyone to have an equal voice,\" he says.\nThe meetings are designed to build family harmony so, very early in the piece, families should aim to build a pyramid of who they are, what they stand for and their values.\n\"And what do they want their legacy to be? In asking these questions, we're trying to project people 10, 20, 30 years down the track.\"\nThe frequency of meetings will vary enormously, Smorgon says, depending on the issues at hand. A family with strained relations or a raft of critical issues might need to meet monthly, whereas an already open, honest family might meet only quarterly or twice a year.\nSuccessful meetings will empower all family members but especially the incoming generations, many of whom lack a sense of purpose, Smorgon says.\n\"In most cases, they don't have anything more important in their lives than themselves,\" he says. \"They're not finding a passion or an interest that creates a sense of purpose. And if you're involved in a family business, the opportunity is there to give them a sense of purpose and their own self-respect within that family business.\"\nHand in hand with this is training and mentoring younger generations about how to manage their inheritances.\n\"Worryingly, not many youngsters are being trained to protect and grow the wealth they're going to inherit,\" Smorgon says. \"There are a lot of sharks out there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:27:05.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
