Tiremakers and insurers led gains.\nThe Topix added 1.5 percent to 1,396.63 as of 9:01 a.m. in Tokyo, after tumbling 4.4 percent Tuesday to the lowest close since January. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.5 percent to 17,191.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, halting a five-day drop.\n“U.S. stocks have regained some calm from a panic situation,” said Chihiro Ohta, general manager of investment information at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “We expect a general rebound today focusing particularly on stocks that have been heavily sold.”\nE-mini futures on the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent. Equities in the world’s biggest stock market swung between gains and losses for much of Tuesday as health-care companies rebounded, while biotechnology shares erased an early rally and Apple Inc. dragged technology companies lower. Glencore Plc rose 17 percent in London, a day after the trader and miner’s record plunge intensified concern about how material companies are weathering the slump in commodity prices.\nThe Topix is on course for a 14 percent three-month retreat, only its second quarterly decline since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power. The measure has slumped 9.2 percent in September as concern about the slowdown in China and the Federal Reserve’s rate-increase plans spurred global financial-market turmoil.\nData Misses Japan’s industrial output fell 0.5 percent in August from a month earlier, according to a preliminary report Wednesday. Economists had expected a 1 percent increase. Data on retail sales also missed estimates.\nThe nation should assemble a stimulus package to shore up its economy before the central bank further cranks up a campaign of unprecedented easing, an adviser to Abe said Tuesday. The premier last week unveiled a three-pronged plan to revive growth. He vowed to expand national output by 20 percent, provide more support for child-rearing and bolster social security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:24:57.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
