AFR by James Eyers Japan's decision to join Australia, Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand on the Asia Region Funds Passport will reverberate at a geopolitical level, and has implications for domestic policy by increasing pressure for part of the tax white paper process to be accelerated.\nJapan's move will have been noted in the European Union, which has built a highly-successful global funds management industry on the back of standardised fund structures known as UCITS, which over 25 years have become popular with investors in Asia. This has allowed European fund managers, often based in Ireland or Luxembourg where tax rates are low, to scoop up investment management fees for managing Asian savings.\nBut with the Asian middle class expected to swell to 1.75 billion by 2020 and drive demand for more sophisticated financial products, the region's financial institutions want the ticket to be clipped in Asia.\nThe birth of the passport is also being watched noted in APEC nations of US and Canada, which have not yet signed up, but whose pension funds may be keen to distribute into the region. The Hong Kong-China Mutual Recognition is liberalising investment fund trade between those two countries. Furthermore, Singapore's last-minute decision to ditch the APEC passport in favour of the ASEAN Collective Investments Scheme shows the APEC passport is part of a regional tussle for fund management supremacy.\nThe passport may also accelerate thinking about Australia's tax competitiveness. It was one of three recommendations by Mark Johnson in a landmark 2009 report. The second - creation of an \"investment manager regime\" - has already passed the parliament, and exempts from Australian tax most gains made by foreign investors in Australian financial instruments.\nThe third piece of the puzzle is the creation of \"collective investment vehicles\", to provide Asian investors with a more appealing corporate structure than the unit trust, which are unique to Australia. Consideration of CIVs is currently part of the government's tax white paper process although Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has expressed an interest in accelerating their adoption faster than that.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:45:09.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
