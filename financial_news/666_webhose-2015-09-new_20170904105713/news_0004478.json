The FTSE 100 is currently trading at a discount to euro zone stocks. \n\"To spend too much time focusing only on China ... we think, misses the point - Europe's a good place to invest, there are still lots of really good companies we can buy cheaper than a month ago, because of the fall in markets,\" said David Moss, manager of the F&C European Equity fund. \nMorrison Supermarkets was up 3.9 percent after a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper signalled South African billionaire Christo Wiese, who recently bought Virgin Active and New Look, is now training his sights on Britain's struggling supermarket industry. \nBattered miners Glencore and Anglo American staged a rebound, rising around 4 percent, even after Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Glencore to 'negative' from 'stable'. \n\"They're bearing the brunt of ratings downgrades from major agencies to add to their woes of falling commodity prices. They are up today, however it could be seen as a dead cat bounce from yesterday's sell-off,\" said Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments. \nIn the midcaps, car dealership Lookers (LSE: LOOK.L - news ) was the top gainer, rising 7.7 percent after its acquisition of Benfield Motor Group for 87.5 million pounds in cash.
