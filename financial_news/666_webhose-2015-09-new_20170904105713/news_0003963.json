Cosco said the order would go to four Chinese yards, which it didn’t name.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the impending Cosco order in April. At the time, some senior company executives had reservations about following bigger competitors—including Maersk Line, a unit of Denmark’s A.P. Møller-Maersk AMKBY -1.07 % A/S, Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. and France’s CMA CGM SA—that already operate dozens of such behemoths.\nContainer shipping, which moves 95% of all manufactured goods, has been in the doldrums over the past decade. An estimated 30% overcapacity in the water has sent freight rates to levels that at times don’t even cover the fuel cost of moving the containers across the oceans. China’s economic slowdown this year and anemic growth in Europe have exacerbated fears that ordering such large and expensive vessels might backfire.\n“Cosco’s concerns were well-founded, but at the end they have to keep up with their bigger rivals if they are to compete in the Asia-to-Europe route,” said Lars Jensen, chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting in Copenhagen. “Over the next couple of years, any ship carrying below 12,000 boxes won’t be able to compete in terms of cost.”\nFully loaded, Triple-E ships cut the cost of moving a container across the oceans by about 25% compared with smaller vessels. The cost benefit comes from modern, fuel-efficient engines and ship alliances that share resources across their networks.\nCosco is the lead member of the CKYHE alliance, which also includes Taiwan’s Evergreen Line and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. 2609 -1.90 % , Japan’s Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. 9107 0.00 % and South Korea’s Hanjin Shipping Co. 117930 -3.28 % In January, Evergreen ordered 11 Triple-E ships.\nCKYHE competes with the 2M alliance of Maersk Line and MSC, the world’s biggest in terms of capacity, and the Ocean Three alliance, the second-biggest grouping, comprising CMA CGM, China Shipping Container Lines Co. and Middle East shipping major United Arab Shipping Co.\nIn its order, Cosco, the listed unit of state shipping company China Ocean Shipping, stands to benefit from substantial subsidies under Beijing’s scrap-and-build policy, which encourages Chinese operators to renew their fleets. People involved in the market said CSCL would soon order 11 of its own Triple E ships under the same program.\nWithin CKYHE, Evergreen has already gone into contract for 11 Triple E’s. The 2M and Ocean Three alliances will operate 51 and 31 such ships, respectively.\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:40:32.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
