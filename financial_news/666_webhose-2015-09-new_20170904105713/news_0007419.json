We take a closer look \nAs Labour's party faithful head to Brighton for their annual conference this weekend, they'll be greeted with a very real problem. As often, up and down the country each weekend, direct trains are not running between London and the Sussex seaside town. \nThousands of conference delegates will instead be forced to disembark at Three Bridges and take 45-minute rail replacement bus services, thanks to ill-timed engineering works. \nFor some, it will be a very stark and real reminder of the state of the national rail network. Two decades after the break-up of British Rail in 1994, re-nationalisation is back on the agenda, for some at least. \nJeremy Corbyn's landslide victory in Labour's leadership race means the question of rail franchises has returned to the news agenda, following his pledge to take Britain's trains back into state ownership were he to win the 2020 general election. \n\"We know there is overwhelming support from the British people for a people's railway, better and more efficient services, proper integration and fairer fares,\" he declared earlier this month. \nA YouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) poll in 2013 showed apparent support for re-nationalisation by a margin of 60pc in favour to 20pc against. Corbyn is in no doubt. In 1988, he told the Commons that the idea that British Rail stations could be sold off was \"merely an attempt by a bunch of Conservative spivs to make a fast buck'' for their friends. \nBut would a \"people's railway\" deliver a better service or provide greater economic benefits to the country and business? According to YouGov, those in favour of re-nationalisation say it will make the system accountable to taxpayers instead of shareholders and profits. \nAlmost half believe it would push rail fares down. However, critics say turning Corbyn's vision of a \"more efficient\" railway into reality requires investment. That means money. Keeping fares down also requires money. All this would have to be bankrolled by the state. \nThere are also fears that railways run by the public sector could also riddle it with the same bureaucrats and wasted money that characterised British Rail, with the unions threatening paralysis every time there is a dispute. \nCompanies and boardroom executives would be replaced by a Fat Controller, or worse, several of them, which could lead to more disruption and less investment not vice versa. \n= Changing Britain, but for the better? = \nJohn Mills, Labour's biggest individual donor and owner of JML, the TV shopping and consumer goods business, describes himself as a tribal Labour supporter, but believes that more state control is not the answer. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's easy to draw parallels between Mills and Corbyn. Both are sceptical about the European Union, but for different reasons. \nMills would vote to leave the bloc even if the Tories get everything on their wish list from Brussels; Corbyn believes the EU is tearing up the social chapter and endorsing tax havens. \nBoth want to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing. Corbyn wants to do it through slapping a financial transactions tax on bankers, while the 77-year-old businessman believes a weaker pound is the solution. \nBut Mills is uneasy with the new administration, and warns that turning back the clock is no solution. He voted for Yvette Cooper in the leadership race, but says none of the four candidates inspired him. \n\"Jeremy Corbyn came across as someone who chimed with a lot of people's feelings about austerity that this was not a big problem for people who were well off, but one for people who were young, disadvantaged and poor. He struck a chord, and it produced this stunning victory which I don't think anyone expected.\" \nHowever, Mills also believes Corbyn faces a reality check. \"The far Left proposals that he's got for reforming the economy just won't work. There's a real danger that in a year or two there will be disillusionment, that the enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn evaporates, that he doesn't get the support he needs to get his policies through.\" \n= When tax becomes taxing = \nWith power comes responsibility, and Corbyn's first policy, which would involve waiting until rail franchises expired before taking them back into public ownership, is a watered-down version of his pledge to seize back the railways. \nAnother, to raise taxes on the rich, comes alongside a claim last month that wealthier people were \"quite happy to pay more\". \nIn this he is backed by John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, who has committed to balancing the books by the end of the decade but believes the rich should pay more. Three years ago he called for a raid on the richest 10pc of households and a 60pc top rate of tax. \nIt's not the first time higher levies have been hailed as the solution, though there have also been some harsh lessons. \nFrance's infamous 75pc millionaire tax rate provoked an exodus of wealthy workers , many of them to the UK. In the end, socialist president François Hollande changed the law so companies, not individuals, would bear the burden. \nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says there is \"huge uncertainty\" surrounding any move to raise income taxes on higher earners. \n\"The truth is we don't know what the impact on the public finances will be. The best estimate we have is that raising the top rate of tax to 50pc or above would raise very little.\" \nJohnson refers to a study conducted by HM Revenue and Customs that showed the Chancellor's move to reverse Labour's 50p top tax rate cost just £100m. \nHis predecessor, Robert Chote, who now leads the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimated that the maximising rate on incomes of above £150,000 was \"about 48pc\". \nThe argument that higher tax rates do not necessarily yield more revenues was made famous by Arthur Laffer, who argued that they reduced incentives to work. In Chote's words, at 50pc, you were already \"wandering round the summit of the Laffer curve\". \nJohnson says: “If I had to guess, if you go from 45pc to 50pc, you’re probably not taking a huge risk. Up at 60pc and you really are beginning to take a pretty big risk. MPs need to bear this uncertainty in mind when forming policy.” \n= Corporate unease with Corbyn = \nCorbyn's victory has also set off alarm bells in the City. \"Concerned\", \"uneasy\", \"wary\": all words repeatedly uttered across the Square Mile. Some of the consternation surrounds the \"tax gap\" or the difference between the amount that the taxman should collect against what is actually comes in to its coffers. \nHMRC believes the gap is around £34bn. However, accountant Richard Murphy, the architect of so-called \"Corbynomics\", estimates it is closer to £120bn. Others believe he is wrong. \n\"If you look at HMRC's numbers, a very small amount comes from corporate tax avoidance,\" says one top tax expert speaking on the basis of anonymity. \n\"Therefore, collecting that isn't about hitting big businesses, it's about cash payments to your window cleaner and stopping fraud. So about £28bn of the £34bn is about £10 here and £10 there. While HMRC is going to get better at stopping it, they're never going to stop it all.\" \nMurphy himself admits that just £20bn of these taxes are collectable if the government pumps an extra £1bn into HMRC. \nExperts also point to the fact that large corporations can easily relocate their headquarters. \nAdvertising giant WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) left the UK in 2008 because of planned tax changes on foreign earnings. It has since re-domiciled in Britain as corporation taxes have come down. \n= Keeping Threadneedle Street Independent = \nCorbynomics also questions the Bank of England's independence. According to a bank survey, 8pc of Britons still believe interest rates are set by the Government. More than half have no idea at all. Regardless of perception, a Times editorial from 1991 highlights why independence is crucial. \"Interest-rate cut keeps option of autumn election open\", the headline read. \nIn other words, a pre-election boom could be coming, engineered by the Government. The editorial described it as a \"political gamble\" that could win votes but also create instability. \nIndependence in 1997 eliminated this risk. So while the tools are authorised by the Treasury, it is the Bank that decides whether to use them. This is crucial to avoid the so-called football managers' mentality where short-term results are so often prized over long-term gains. \nAs Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, highlighted at a recent Treasury Select Committee hearing , being independent allows the Monetary Policy Committee to keep their \"eye on the ball\" while being fully accountable for their actions. \nAnd then there's \"people's QE\" or quantitative easing for infrastructure. Many economists argue that the Government should be borrowing to finance big infrastructure projects. Borrowing costs are low and this is another way to fix the roof while the sun is shining as productive investment drives growth and higher living standards. \nBut people's QE is amounting to the Bank printing money to bankroll the Government . There are two issues with this. Pumping money into the economy in good times could lead to runaway inflation. \nAs Carney highlighted: \"The people who tend to get hurt the most by inflation are the poor and the elderly\" the very people Corbyn wants to help. QE as we know it can be unwound. Bonds are liquid. Houses and trains aren't. \nPhilip Rush, an economist at Nomura, says the combination of more state intervention and the possibility 1970s-style inflation are a recipe for disaster. \"The inefficiency and under-investment that would likely result from such nationalisations would anyway ensure the high inflation was accompanied by lower real growth. \n\"Mr Corbyn's policies have been tried before in the UK and/or elsewhere with consistently negative results.\" \nEven Mills, Labour's big backer, doesn't believe the party has a chance of winning the next election with Corbynomics as a theory. \"I don't think his policies are going to attract Middle England or the business world. And unless you can attract these two, it's very difficult to win elections (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:14:06.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
