Primarily, the EPFO has been investing in the central and state government securities.\nLabour Ministry had notified the new investment pattern for EPFO in April allowing it to invest minimum of 5 per cent and maximum of 15 per cent of its funds in equity or equity related schemes.\nHowever, the EPFO decided to invest only 5 per cent of its incremental deposits in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the current fiscal.\nDuring the April-June period, EPFO’s monthly incremental deposit was around Rs 8,200 crore, which allows it to invest an estimated Rs 410 crore every month in ETFs during the current fiscal.\nA large number of trade union representatives on board of the EPFO had opposed the move in view of the volatile nature of the stock markets.\nEPFO has a subscribers’ base of over four crore and is expected to receive an incremental deposits of Rs one lakh crore during the current fiscal.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 4:40 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:06:49.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
