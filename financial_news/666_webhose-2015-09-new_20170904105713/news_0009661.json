Cole Bennetts by Geoff Winestock A politician at the centre of last year's NSW Liberal party funding scandal has followed the ALPs example and gone to court against the Independent Commission Against Corruption on grounds of \"apprehended bias\".\nJeff McCloy, the property developer and mayor of Newcastle who last year admitted at ICAC that he felt like a \"walking ATM machine\", has asked the Supreme Court to prevent ICAC completing its inquiry into campaign donations, and has used legal grounds similar to the complaint the unions made against Justice Dyson Heydon of the trade union royal commission.\n\"A fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that (ICAC commissioner Megan Latham) might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind\", Mr McCloy said in a summons lodged on Tuesday.\nMuch of Ms Latham's alleged bias occurred during ICAC public hearings unrelated to Mr McCloy. Instead they concern ICAC's inquiries covering former state Liberal ministers such as Chris Hartcher and Mike Gallacher, former assistant Federal Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos and fallen coal baron Nathan Tinkler. Mr McCloy also attacks ICAC's lawyer Geoffrey Watson SC for his style of questioning.\nIf the case proceeds it could further delay the release of ICAC's reports into the campaign funding allegations, which will cover the gift of a $3,000 bottle of wine to NSW premier Barry O'Farrell. The reports have already been held up for almost a year because ICAC's powers were thrown into doubt by a successful High Court challenge by crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen on a separate matter. The NSW government this week put legislation to parliament which should resolve that problem.\nMr Watson said he was disappointed at Mr McCloy's summons and it was inconvenient that it was lodged 12 months after the public inquiry finished and all parties had made their submissions. \"The new ICAC legislation has been expedited to get the Commission back on the job, and this summons is designed to stop that,\" Mr Watson said.\nMeanwhile the High Court is expected to rule soon in a separate case brought by Mr McCloy challenging a NSW ban on campaign donations by property developers. If Mr McCloy wins that, it could prevent the release of the reports into the wads of cash which Mr McCloy – who as a property developer was a prohibited donor – allegedly handed to Liberal candidates.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:53:34.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
