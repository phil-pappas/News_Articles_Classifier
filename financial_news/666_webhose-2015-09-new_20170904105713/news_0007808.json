I think it's a fabulous show, I absolutely love it,\" Julian Fellowes, the creator of PBS British show \"Downton Abbey,\" told Reuters on the eve of the awards.\nHowever with seven drama series nominated this year - none of them from the big five U.S. broadcasters - the competition is fierce, especially from HBO fantasy series \"Game of Thrones\" which had a leading 24 nominations.\nAMC newcomer \"Better Call Saul\" - a spin-off of \"Breaking Bad\" - Showtime's CIA thriller \"Homeland,\" Netflix political drama \"House of Cards,\" \"Downton Abbey,\" and the female prisoners of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black,\" round out the drama series competition. Uzo Aduba, who plays Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren in \"Orange\" is nominated for her second acting Emmy.\nAmazon Studios could be in for a big night with transgender comedy \"Transparent,\" whose star Jeffrey Tambor plays a divorced dad who decides to transition as a woman.\nWith gay and transgender themes enjoying a boom in Hollywood, \"Transparent\" is seen as a threat to ABC's \"Modern Family,\" which has won the comedy series Emmy for each of the past five years.\nHBO's Washington political comedy \"Veep,\" and its tech series \"Silicon Valley,\" FX's \"Louie,\", NBC's \"Parks and Recreation\", and Netflix's \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" are also in the running.\nThe Emmy Awards have been criticized in the past for rewarding the same shows and actors year after year. But this time more than half of the nominees in the lead acting categories are either first-timers or from new series.\nThey include Tatiana Maslany for her multiple clone characters in BBC America's \"Orphan Black,\" Anthony Anderson in ABC's African-American family comedy \"black-ish,\" and comedian Amy Schumer for her Comedy Central sketch show \"Inside Amy Schumer.\"\nA rule change at the Television Academy that has expanded voting from about 1,000 to some 18,000 members also is expected to shake things up.\nOscar-nominated Viola Davis (ABC's \"How to Get Away With Murder\") and Taraji P. Henson (Fox's \"Empire\") are considered front-runners in the drama actress category, which has never been won by an African-American.\n\"If one of those two don't win, there will be much howling,\" said Los Angeles Times TV critic Mary McNamara.\n(Additional reporting by Reuters Television; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T16:35:01.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
