It will also extend the mine life. \nMopani is the second largest employer in Zambia after the Government with about 21 000 direct and contract workers. \nSecretary to the Treasury Fredson Yamba, recently also assured that Government would continue to promote investments by providing a predictable, consistent and stable environment to protect and secure the many jobs created by the sector. \nAdditionally, the operationalisation of the revised mining law to streamline issuance of mining licences, the establishment of a tribunal and promotion of local content will enhance development in the sector. \nAccording to Mr Yamba, the Mining sector is earmarked for growth because the copper output is projected to increase from 741,916 metric tonnes this year to 916,767 metric tonnes in 2018 largely on the account of the improved output at Kansanshi Mine in Solwezi due to the new smelter. \nProduction at Konkola Copper Mines is also projected to increase because of the Konkola Deep Mining Project which is due to start operating soon. \nThe development of Kalumbila and Chambeshi West Ore would also spur growth in the mining sector. \nMr Yamba said the mining and quarrying sector is set to benefit from the mineral diversification by enhancing production of minerals such as nickel, gold, iron, manganese and uranium. \nFrom what has been indicated above, it is clear that Government is determined to promote growth in the mining sector and promote development thereby preventing job cuts in the sector.
