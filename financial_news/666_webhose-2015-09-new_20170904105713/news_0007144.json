It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also paid the company a $1 million \"success fee\" that it recorded as a consulting fee. \nUnder FCPA rules, US regulators can pursue such charges against a foreign company like Hitachi which has a US presence. \n\"Hitachi's lax internal control environment enabled its subsidiary to pay millions of dollars to a politically connected front company for the ANC to win contracts with the South African government,\" said SEC (Shanghai: 603988.SS - news ) enforcement division direction Andrew Ceresney. \n\"Hitachi then unlawfully mischaracterized those payments in its books and records as consulting fees and other legitimate payments.\" \nUnder public pressure, in 2014 Hitachi bought back the 25 percent stake in its subsidiary from the ANC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:39:37.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
