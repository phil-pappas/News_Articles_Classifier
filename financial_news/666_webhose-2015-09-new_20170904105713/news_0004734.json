The main thrust of his annual statement was the country's economy, and social environment; unprecedented economic success amidst abject poverty; upbeat record in maintaining peace and security in and outside of the country. He also called for support to the private sector. \nThe President recognised 12 years of successive double digit growth in the gross domestic product (GDP), which places Ethiopia among countries with the fastest growing economies, coupled with successful achievements in meeting development goals. \"Behind these success stories though, everyone should bear in mind that we still have a surmountable obstacle in eliminating the abject poverty citizens suffer from.\" he underlined. \nHe, however, dubbed the country's performance in the first generation of the GTP as merely encouraging, candidly pointing to the shortfalls in achieving the set 'stretched yet achievable' targets. \nTremendous change that marked the agricultural and rural development sphere needs further structural transformation in the sector. \"Diversification of products particularly in livestock, fishery and efficiency of irrigation needs more focus in the coming years\" he said calling for concerted action in the area. \nPresident Mulatu in his statement shed light on the major challenges the country faced last year. \nThe impact of El Niño is identified as one such challenge being faced by the country, which has developed a capacity to manage the threat and impact witnessed so far, he reassured. \n\"The economy has to break free from subsistence agriculture; this trend has not helped Ethiopia to free itself from the abject poverty still affecting a huge number of people.\" He stressed. \nThe President finds the role of manufacturing industry critical to solve this problem. \"Without serious step to encourage, expand and integrate the manufacturing sector with agriculture, fundamental transformation in the economy is farfetched.\" \nPrivate sector engagement, that suffered lack of concerted incentive and facilitation schemes stands as one major agenda point in the President's statement. Acknowledging its immense contribution in the constricted setting, he recommended wider space for engagement, serious attention and facility to optimise the private sector's role in the economy. \nClosing his comprehensive and audacious statements about the country's economic achievements and shortcomings, the President pointed to the fundamentals of peace and security the country managed to keep in the unstable region. \"The upbeat record in peace and security has made the country serve as a comparative edge in the region. It is now known as the best destination for conference tourism and foreign direct investment.\" He asserted. \nOn the New Year the President extended a pardon for 238 prison inmates.
