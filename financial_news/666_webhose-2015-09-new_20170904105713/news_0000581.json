At the end of his 8 day trip to the U.S., he met with prisoners held at maximum security facilities to give hugs and hope. The poor and marginalized were a focus of the Pope’s attention on his visit.This gentleman from Buenos Aires, and most recently the Vatican, is inspiring people all over the world. It's called the \"Francis Effect\" - and people are inspired to give more of their time and their resources to charity.Were you inspired to either start giving to others in need or to step up your gifts? Whether it was from Pope Francis's visit or something you've been thinking about for a long time, here are four places to give a little bit more than you've given before: At work. They say \"charity begins at home\" but I am starting with the workplace because some employers will match your charitable contributions dollar for dollar. My employer has a matching gift program where they allow eligible employees to make donations to qualified organizations and match the gifts up to $2,000.Having a contribution come right out of your paycheck each month makes it easy to give regularly and having the company match the contribution supercharges your gift. Check with your human resources department about your company’s policy. In your investment account. The advantage of gifting appreciated stock to qualified charities is you don't have to pay taxes on the gain. You simply transfer the shares to your charity's' account and they liquidate the shares. Since they are a not-for-profit organization, they don't pay federal income taxes; and since you gifted shares, you don't either. It’s a win-win!Many people either forget about this option or assume the charity won't take smaller amounts. Don't assume! Ask your charity about their parameters for receiving shares of securities.One of my clients has a portfolio full of appreciated securities. He is very charitable, but likes to spread the love. He gives relatively small amounts to various charities rather than a large donation to one or two.When we met last, we discovered many charities have accounts set up to receive appreciated stock. Don't assume they won't take investments less than $1,000. All you have to do is ask! It might be easier than you think. With your IRA. If you are over 70 1/2 and are receiving your required minimum distribution (RMD) from your traditional IRA, you are paying taxes on those funds. If you don’t rely on the income and you like to give to charity, consider directing your RMD to your favorite charity (up to $100k) instead.This is called a Qualified Charitable Deduction (QCD), and while current legislation let this benefit expire on Dec. 31 of 2014, Capitol Hill is known for bringing this gift back (at the last minute) around the end of the year. So this still may be a viable option for 2015.If Congress does extend this for 2015, instead of paying taxes on your RMD income, you’re actually reducing your adjusted gross income, which in turn reduces the amount of taxes you pay.If they don’t extend the QCD benefit, your IRA distribution will be taxed as usual. You would then simply deduct your charitable contribution on Schedule A. If this strategy interests you, discuss the implications with your financial planner and/or accountant especially since the benefit expired and there is not guarantee it will be extended for 2015. With the whole family. A family that plays together stays together. Well, a family that \"gives together\" can have strong bonds beyond their family life and impact future generations. If the idea of creating a family foundation appeals to you, but you want to do something smaller and simpler as a family, consider a Donor Advised Fund.With a Donor Advised Fund, you get an immediate tax deduction for the assets you contribute. Then you have the right to advise the fund on the charities on the allocation of the gifts. This way, you can separate the \"how much\" decision from the \"which charity\" decision.You can get the family involved and pool your resources -- maybe you donate the bulk of the gift and then encourage your kids and even grandkids to add funds to cause. As a family, you can make recommendations on how the annual gifts are used.For example, if you enjoy the outdoors with your family, consider gifting to charities that help preserve and conserve our natural resources such as the Nature Conservancy . Of course, you could follow Pope Francis’s lead and choose to focus on charities that fight poverty.This way you are coming together as a family for your charitable giving. Sometimes when we think about giving to charity, it feels like we can't make much of a difference. Pope Francis disagrees! He encourages us to make even the smallest of gestures. Compound your small gestures with the increased power of employer matching, some tax savings, and by including your family and friends.Your small gesture of kindness just might have a big impact on your community – you never know.
