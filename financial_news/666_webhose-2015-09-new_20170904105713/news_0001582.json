The 1992 convertible was indeed in a sand box of sorts; the sinkhole in the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Ken., had swallowed it whole. It fared a little better than most cars that had been devoured by the sinkhole, but just about every body panel had been damaged. \nGeneral Motors GM, +0.35% took it upon itself to restore it, and after more than four months and 1,200 hours of work, the restoration of the 1992 convertible is complete. National Corvette Museum Slide 2 of 7 \n“We felt it was important to restore this extremely significant car in Corvette’s long, storied history,” said Mark Reuss, GM executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain. “When we disassembled it, we found that each employee involved in building it had signed a part of the car, which was fantastic and moving to see. It brought the history to life, and reinforced the importance of the project.” Graham Kozak/Autoweek Slide 3 of 7 \nJust how did GM bring this piece of Corvette history back? After the car was fished out of the sinkhole, it was taken to Design Center on GM’s Technical Center campus in Warren, Mich., where 30 craftspeople from GM Design’s Mechanical Assembly group and GM Service Operations proceeded to restore it. The team made the decision to restore as many original components as possible to preserve its originality, even though it wasn’t the easiest way to go. Chevrolet Slide 4 of 7 \n“As the one and only 1 millionth Corvette, its preservation was important to us as the designers of the vehicle — and as Corvette enthusiasts,” said Ed Welburn, vice president of GM Global Design. “The damage was significant in many ways; however we have one of the most highly skilled specialty shops and teams of people in the industry, so they were fully prepared to take on the challenge.” \nAll told, the restoration team was able to save all but two of the original body panels. For those that couldn’t be saved, the signatures were scanned and reproduced as transfers for the replacement parts. Chevrolet Slide 5 of 7 \nThe major outcome from the fall into the sinkhole amounted to damage to the sub-frame, which required straightening, plus damage to two wheels, the two seats and a number of suspension components. The hood and the front fascia couldn't be saved, and the restoration team had to replace the lower panels between the front wheels and the doors. A number of other secondary components in the engine bay had to be replaced as well, with the team using a donor car of the same vintage and color. Chevrolet Slide 6 of 7 \nThe most surprising item that didn’t need replacement was the windshield header. When the car was pulled out of the sinkhole using a crane, the frame popped up very close to its original position, so the team made the decision to save it. “We went to great lengths to preserve every autograph,” said David Bolognino, director of GM Global Design Fabrication Operations. “In the end, we saved every one of them, which was an unexpected and important element to the restoration.” Chevrolet Slide 7 of 7 \nThe most surprising item that didn’t need replacement was the windshield header.
