We want it to be a place where people feel welcome and feel the warmth and sharing the information in their community. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may end up that it’s not technically a dislike, it may be empathy.\" \n\"It’s something that we’re testing right now because we want people to be able to express themselves in the way that they feel most comfortable on Facebook.\" \nFacebook users have long pointed out the thumbs-up 'like'’ button is not suitable for certain status updates, such as bereavements or other bad news. \n\"If you are sharing something that is sad,\" Mr Zuckerberg, 31, acknowleged on Tuesday, \"then it may not feel comfortable to 'like' that post.\" \nHe added: \"It's important to give people more options than just 'like.'\" \nBut he said a 'dislike' tool was \"surprisingly complicated\" to develop. \n\"We don't want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people's posts,\" he said. \nFor years, Facebook has resisted creating a 'dislike' button, fearing that it could fuel bullying or negativity. \nSome 4.5bn likes were generated daily as of May 2013, according to the social network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:23:02.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
