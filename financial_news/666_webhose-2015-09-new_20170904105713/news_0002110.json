The loan program expired last year, but was extended to September 30, 2015 . Unless it's renewed by Congress, students at some 1,500 private and public colleges will lose Perkins funding on October 1. \nMore than 500,000 students received Perkins Loans last year to the tune of more than $1 billion--out of $150 billion in student loans and grants made by the federal government. The loans themselves don't usually amount to more than several thousand dollars per student, but they can spell the difference between whether or not you can attend school.
