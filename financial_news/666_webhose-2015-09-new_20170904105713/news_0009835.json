The ACCC brought the action in 2013 but reached an agreement with Visa admitting liability on the eave of the trial in August.\nThe crux of the case was that Visa banned the use of competitors' dynamic currency conversion services on its card payment network. This meant tourists in Australia engaged in transactions such as booking hotel rooms and hiring rental cars could only use Visa's currency conversion.\nVisa admitted that it implemented rules prohibiting Australian merchants from using any other dynamic currency conversion system other than Visa's, from April to October 2010, which stopped them using other services that could help generate revenue.\nUp to 60 per cent of cross-border transactions were done using Visa cards in 2010.\nACCC Chairman Rod Sims said unlawful conduct which prevented or hindered the competitive process in concentrated industries and restricted consumer choice were priority areas for the ACCC.\n \"The ACCC was concerned that Visa's conduct was likely to stop the growth of currency conversion services which competed with its own and, as a result, limit the choices available to consumers,\" Mr Sims said.\n\"The substantial penalty imposed against Visa Worldwide reflects the serious nature of the conduct, which hindered the competitive process and restricted an emerging technology and service from developing under otherwise competitive market conditions.\"\nA Visa spokeswoman said it was pleased to have reached a settlement, which did not result in changes to Visa's current practices regarding dynamic currency conversion.\nShe said Visa's conduct was conduct was, in part, the result of seeking to protect the experience of Visa cardholders at the point of sale.\n\"Visa continues to believe that the currency conversion process embedded in a Visa transaction provides superior value and experience for the cardholder,\" the spokeswoman said.\nAs part of its settlement with the ACCC, Visa conceded that it engaged in exclusive dealing by facilitating access to its payment network to Australian banks and retailers on the condition they did not use the currency conversion services of its rivals.\nIn exchange the ACCC dropped a more difficult claim to establish, that Visa also engaged in misuse of market power.\nJustice Wigney said Visa operated the world's largest card payment network in the world with an international turnover of more than $US8 billion in 2010.\nIt processed more than seven billion transactions with a value exceeding more than $US5 trillion.\nJustice Wigney said the decision was taken by executives at the highest levels of the global organisation, including the president of Visa.\nHe said the change in Visa's rules was materially motivated by concerns about the growth of the use of dynamic currency conversion services on its network and a potential loss in revenue and fees to dynamic currency conversion providers.\nThe revenue generated from dynamic currency conversion and fees arising from cross border transactions in Australia in 2010 of between $US14.1 million and $US22.34 million.\nThe judge acknowledged Visa's executives also had legitimate concerns about detriment to card holders from using dynamic currency conversion and that it could affect Visa's brand.\nBut he said there were no doubt ways Visa could have responded to these concerns other than by restricting access to its network in a way that was likely to substantially lessen competition.\nThe penalty took into account the size of Visa, the serious nature and extent of the contravening act, the fact it had not engaged in previous contravening conduct and had expressed contrition and cooperated extensively with regulators during investigations, Justice Wigney said.\nHe said it was enough to act as a specific deterrent against any future breaches by Visa and as a general deterrent to other multinational groups that contravening Australia laws was not a mere cost of doing business.\nThe penalty was substantially lessened because of the efficient conduct of the proceedings.\nThe penalty was at the top of the middle range of penalties and was appropriate given the conduct was serious but not of the most serious kind that could attract up to $33.1 million, 10 per cent of Visa's annual group revenue, which was $330 million in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:03:30.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
