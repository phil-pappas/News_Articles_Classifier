Splitting an issue into black-and-white arguments might simplify a difference of opinion, but it's not always constructive in answering the question at hand.\nAnd so it is in the ongoing debate around active and index investment. When we ask 'Do investors get more from active or index investment approach?' the answer might be that investors can benefit most when they use both.\nThis debate is far from new, and since investment luminaries like Burton Malkiel and Jack Bogle began championing efficient, index-based investing in the 1970s, the debate over whether traditional active or passive investing works best has been bubbling away.\nHowever, as with many facets of investing, this isn't an either/or equation. Investors can find a healthy balance between the two, as long as they understand what they are getting themselves into and the benefits and risks of allocating their portfolio across the different management styles.\nRisks v rewards For investors, it's particularly important they appreciate the general risks and potential rewards that can come with active investing. Their grasp of the risks should strongly influence how much of their asset allocation goes to active investments.\nOn face value, yes, well-run actively managed funds can provide above-market benchmark returns for investors. Some active managers can provide consistent performance over a long-term period, but the numbers show that this is a challenge. Vanguard is best known for its index investment products in Australia, but in the US also offers active funds as part of its product line-up. Many of those products are multimanager, so Vanguard understands from experience the challenge in picking good active managers.\nLooking through a raft of research dating back to the 1960s, the evidence highlights how hard it is for all but a few highly talented active managers to consistently outperform market benchmarks. In the case of selecting active funds, investors often look to past performance. But as anyone who has read a product disclosure statement would know, past performance should not be relied on as an indicator of future performance.\n As a case in point, analysis of data from Morningstar shows an investor who picked one of the top 20 per cent of actively managed investment funds in 2009 had a 27 per cent chance of seeing their fund fall into the bottom 20 per cent of performers, or even seen their fund disintegrate altogether, within five years to 2014. That's compared to a 30 per cent chance of their top-performing active fund remaining in that top 20 per cent. So investors have an even chance of their \"top-performing\" active fund manager continuing to outperform or being among the worst-performing of their peers.\nAvoiding fads That's why, when it comes to actively managed funds, investors should look for managers that have a strict investment philosophy that keeps them from following fads and market hype. While we know it is much harder for active managers to consistently outperform index performance over time, they are more likely to hit the mark more often if they follow sound investment principles.\nRisk balanced against potential above-market benchmark returns are the critical aspects of active management that investors need to consider in their portfolio construction. Balancing active management with lower risk and likely lower average, yet more consistent, returns makes sense.\nYou may have heard of the core-satellite approach: this approach uses index funds as the core of your portfolio, with investment satellites that would typically be active investments, but could also be direct investments like property. The outcome is a portfolio that can retain a balanced risk-to-reward ratio over a long-term period, offering potential for some above-market returns without exposing the entire portfolio to significant increases in risk.\nIt is also worth noting that across an entire core-satellite portfolio, investors should be diversified across assets and asset classes to further defuse risk. For instance, a mix of moderate and high-growth equities and listed property alongside more defensive options like bonds and conservative equities is an example of looking to spread asset allocation and benefit from bumper returns in good times while cushioning an investor from downturns.\nThe fee question Although a well-balanced portfolio with active and passive investments working in tandem is a sound approach, there is a significant aspect that impacts on the returns of both active and passive investments: fees.\nInvestors should be mindful that keeping fees as low as possible is fundamentally important, whether they are making a judgment on active or passive funds. Although passive investments typically carry lower costs than active options, investors shouldn't assume that all passive funds have equally low costs. It is also critical that they put active management fees under the microscope, as higher fees could mean the difference in receiving returns when the manager hits a rough patch.\nIf investors can find low-cost options to build a balanced core-satellite portfolio, they will be well on their way to harnessing the best active and passive investments have to offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:08:58.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
