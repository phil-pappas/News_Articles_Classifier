Comments Email Print × \nA day after the Real Estate Board of New York released a report showing that landmarked districts are less effective at stemming the loss of affordable housing, a blogger whose data was used in the study refuted the powerful trade group's findings. \n\"I am disappointed to see REBNY claim the rent-stabilization data I gathered from tax bills proves that landmarking does not protect rent-stabilized apartments,\" John Krauss said in a statement. \nEarlier this year, Mr. Krauss mined data from hundreds of thousands of tax bills kept on file by the city's Department of Finance, and thus was the first person to determine the specific locations of New York's rent-stabilized apartments. Although officials were aware of shifts in the overall affordable-housing stock, his work provided a hitherto unknown breakdown of exactly where rent-stabilized units were being lost and created in the city. Rent increases at these units are limited each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. \nOn Monday, REBNY released a report using Mr. Krauss' data to show that between 2007 and 2014, landmarked areas of the city posted a net loss of nearly 23% of their rent-stabilized stock, while non-landmarked areas shed only about 5%. The report was conducted to disprove an oft-repeated argument by preservationist groups that landmarked districts protect affordable housing by limiting demolition. \nAlthough the numbers in REBNY’s report were accurate, Mr. Krauss contended his data can't be used conclusively to prove a link between landmarking and the loss of rent-stabilized apartments, because by looking at the same information in a different way, he found several examples where the opposite was true. \nFirst, he argued, units created or lost through the 421-a tax-exemption program should not have been counted in the REBNY report, because even though their rents are stabilized, they are often not affordable. In fact, a recent report from the Rent Guidelines Board indicated that the median legal rent for 421-a apartments was $3,599, meaning half the units rent for more than that price, which is already the upper limit of what the city considers an affordable apartment. \nWith that in mind, Mr. Krauss compared landmarked and non-landmarked areas within several community boards. In four lower Manhattan boards, for example, he found that landmarked areas did a better job of creating or preserving rent-stabilized apartments. \n\"Considering the number of counter-examples to REBNY’s report, it's very problematic to claim there's even a strong correlation between the loss of rent-stabilized units and landmarking,” Mr. Krauss said. \nREBNY defended its study, which, it noted, flatly refutes claims by preservationist groups. Two historic districts in Greenwich Village and the Upper West Wide, the report noted, lost the greatest percentage of rent-stabilized apartments during the seven-year period in question. \n\"Advocates have claimed that landmarking helps preserve rent-regulated units,\" said REBNY President John Banks. \"Our analysis shows there is no factual basis for that assertion.\" \nAnd while Mr. Krauss believes a more nuanced analysis is needed to examine other factors that might have contributed to shifts in the stock of rent-stabilized apartments, his data nevertheless shows that in most community boards across the city, more rent-stabilized units were created or preserved in non-landmarked areas whether or not 421-a was taken into account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:39:42.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
