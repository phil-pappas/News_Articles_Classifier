The greater risk-on sentiment pushed Treasuries prices lower, they said.\nThe ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased 190,000 last month. It was a step up from the 177,000 positions created in July and in line with the trend for the first seven months of this year, but was below economists' expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs.\n\"We're down a little bit because stocks have shown some resiliency in the face of weaker data,\" said John Briggs, U.S. rates strategist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.\nWhile Treasuries prices had slipped earlier in the day after China's latest efforts to steady its financial markets soothed concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy and contributed to greater risk appetite, analysts said the strength of U.S. shares and oil prices despite weaker data had more of an impact later in the session.\nAnalysts also said foreign central banks' possible selling of Treasuries in order to raise cash to buy their own currencies could also have sent long-dated Treasuries prices lower.\nU.S. 30-year Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, hit a more than one-month high of 2.97 percent .\nShort-dated Treasuries are less vulnerable to selling pressure than long-dated bonds since they have already weakened notably on expectations of Federal Reserve rate hikes, said Jim Kochan, chief fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.\n\"So if there's talk of (foreign central bank) selling of any kind, it affects the entire curve, but it affects the long end more than the front end,\" he said.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.19 percent from 2.17 percent late Tuesday. U.S. 30-year Treasuries were last off 18/32 to yield 2.96 percent from 2.93 percent late Tuesday.\nTwo-year notes were down slightly to yield 0.71 percent, from a yield of 0.72 percent late Tuesday.
