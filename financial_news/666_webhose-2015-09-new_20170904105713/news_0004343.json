He then secured a commitment from five of her deputy clerks that they would grant the licenses in her absence. The deputies began issuing them on Friday.\nOn Tuesday, a group of plaintiffs who had sued Ms. Davis filed a report confirming that they had succeeded in obtaining licenses, prompting Judge Bunning to order Ms. Davis released.\n“The court is therefore satisfied that the Rowan County Clerk’s Office is fulfilling its obligation to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples, consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding” in June, declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage , Judge Bunning wrote.\nBut he issued a warning to Ms. Davis. She “shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples,” Judge Bunning wrote. If she “should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this Order and appropriate sanctions will be considered.”\nAfter her release, Ms. Davis took the stage at the tail end of a rally in support of her outside the jail. “Thank you all so much,” she said, tearfully. “I just want to give God the glory.” She added, “We serve a living God who knows exactly where each and every one of us is at. Just keep on pressing, don’t let down, because he is here. He is worthy.”\nMore Coverage With Kentucky Clerk Jailed, Same-Sex Marriage Licenses Are Issued (Sept. 4) Q&A: The Case of the Defiant County Clerk (Sept. 3) Defiant Kentucky Clerk Jailed for Refusing to Issue Same-Sex Marriage Licenses (Sept. 3) Rowan County, Ground Zero in Gay Marriage License Fight (Sept. 3) Supreme Court Rules Against Clerk in Gay-Marriage Case (Sept. 2) Appeals Court Upholds Gay Marriage Ruling in Kentucky (Aug. 26) Attorneys at Liberty Counsel, the nonprofit law firm representing Ms. Davis, welcomed the judge’s order. “She can never recover the past six days of her life spent in an isolated jail cell, where she was incarcerated like a common criminal because of her conscience and religious convictions,” said chairman Mathew Staver. “She is now free to return to her family, her co-workers and the office where she has faithfully served for the past 27 years.”\nBut Mr. Staver didn’t address whether Ms. Davis would comply with Judge Bunning’s order. In a hearing before the judge last week, she turned down an offer from the judge to be released from custody if she agreed to allow her deputies to issue licenses.\nAfter one of her deputies began providing licenses to couples on Friday, substituting his name for hers, Ms. Davis’s lawyers maintained that the documents weren’t valid because they weren’t granted under her authority. “They’re not worth the paper that they are written on,” Mr. Staver said.\nRandy Smith, a Rowan County pastor who has been organizing rallies in support of Ms. Davis, said he believed she would remain firm in her stance. “If I know Kim, she’ll be back in jail before long,” he said.\nOn Monday, Ms. Davis’s attorneys sought to secure her release by filing an emergency motion with the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It requested that Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear accommodate her religious convictions by exempting her from his order earlier this year that the state’s county clerks follow the Supreme Court’s ruling and issue marriage licenses to all couples. Mr. Beshear said in July that any clerks whose beliefs prevented them from issuing licenses should consider resigning.\nMs. Davis’s release came on the same day two Republican presidential contenders—former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas —were scheduled to visit her at the Carter County Detention Center in Grayson, Ky.\nMr. Huckabee was planning to hold a rally Tuesday afternoon to protest her jailing. “Having Kim Davis in federal custody removes all doubt of the criminalization of Christianity in our country,” he said in a news release.\nENLARGE Kim Davis, center, and her attorney Matt Staver, right, with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.

A large crowd was gathered outside the jail on Tuesday afternoon.\nA little after 2:30 p.m., Ms. Davis emerged from the detention center with Messrs. Huckabee and Staver, and was greeted by a cheering crowd.\nShe declined to take questions from the media, but Mr. Staver said Ms. Davis planned to return to work later this week. He said she would continue to be loyal to her job and to the people of Kentucky. But, he added, “she’ll also be loyal to God, and she’s not going to violate her conscience.”\nPressed by reporters whether that meant Ms. Davis would try to prevent her deputies from issuing licenses, Mr. Staver would only reiterate, “Kim Davis cannot and will not violate her conscience.”\nWilliam Sharp, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which represented plaintiffs who sued Ms. Davis, said in a news release, “This case was brought to ensure that all residents of Rowan County, gay and straight, could obtain marriage licenses. That goal has been achieved.”\nHe added that the plaintiffs were relying on previous comments by Rowan County attorneys asserting that the licenses issued by Ms. Davis’s clerks are valid.\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE973_KYCLER_P_20150908162450.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE973_KYCLER_M_20150908162450.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-08T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T06:53:02.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
