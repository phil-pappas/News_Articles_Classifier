The game is up for higher-rate tax relief. Higher earners may feel that’s unfair, but the chancellor needs to balance the books, and where else is he going to go but to the people who have the most money? \n- Tom McPhail, Hargreaves Lansdown \n“The game is up for higher-rate tax relief,” said Tom McPhail, head of pensions research with Hargreaves Lansdown. \n“Higher earners may feel that’s unfair, but the chancellor needs to balance the books, and where else is he going to go but to the people who have the most money?” \nKeeping the current system for pensions tax relief is one of the options Mr Osborne flagged in his recent green paper on “Strengthening the Incentives to Save”. But he also said he was “open to further radical change”. \nIn recent weeks, many pension providers have voiced support for a shift to a system of flat-rate tax relief of 33 per cent. \nMeanwhile, the Centre for Policy Studies, the free market think-tank championing the Pension Isa, says it has City support for its proposals. \nThe consultation on pensions tax relief closes at the end of September.
