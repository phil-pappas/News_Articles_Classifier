What Janet Yellen had to say Peter Martin: 'You don't need foot to the floor anymore' It's not every day the Reserve Bank of Australia governor takes a swing at the US Federal Reserve board. Glenn Stevens did on Friday morning over the Fed's decision to delay its much-telegraphed rate rise .\nStevens says there is \"always going to be some argument, some piece of data, saying don't do it, but in the end you're just going to have to do it\".\nStevens told a House of Representatives economics committee hearing there was \"always going to be some argument, some piece of data, saying don't do it, but in the end you're just going to have to do it\".\nAs Stevens explained to the committee, it will be good for the US to get rates off the floor. Photo: Chris Pearce\nHe said the bigger issue than the first rise was the pace of subsequent increases. And he thinks Australia won't be adversely impacted by a rise.\nAdvertisement By implication, Fed boss Janet Yellen achieved nothing by sitting pat. After all its positioning, warning, telegraphing and posturing, the Fed squibbed it, apparently because the world is an uncertain place right now.\nWell, when is it not? Which gives rise to the other obvious question: If not now, when?\nThe market reaction to Yellen's statement summed it up rather well – a knee-jerk rally that went nowhere and was quickly lost plus a little more. The market was left with a degree of confusion, not increased confidence. The decision to not lift rates just sows doubts about the strength of the US recovery and increases concern about China.\nDoes anyone feel more confident about China's economy because the Fed delayed a small rate rise for a month or three? I wouldn't think so.\nAnd, as Stevens explained to the committee, it will be good for the US to get rates off the floor. It needs to be done.\nThere are risks, of course. Baby boomer Stevens made a point about the danger of children playing with sharp objects, not that he put it that way. What he actually did was observe that there are plenty of participants in the financial markets who haven't seen rates rise in their working experience. (Yes, there are some benefits to having grey hair.)\nBy now though, the younger screen jockeys should be used to all the scary scenarios painted about rates rising a touch. Like the infamous taper tantrum , the worst of the worries should be behind us.\nSo, once again, Janet, if not now, then when?\nWhich brings us back to the main excuse for the Fed delaying – China.\nThere is a massive industry devoted to creating scary headlines about China. The RBA view is more relaxed – alert, aware of the challenges, but not panicked.\nStevens on Friday, and assistant governor Guy Debelle during the week , both remained glass-half-full sorts of guys about China's transition.\nFor the 100th time, China's rate of growth is slowing. It has to. That is a healthy thing. But it's volume of growth remains strong.\nStevens said plenty of people were sceptical about Chinese growth and statistics, but they've been sceptical for a long time without being right.\nThe RBA doesn't know if China is going to have a sharper cyclical slowdown, but it doesn't seem to think that is probable.\nPersonally, when it comes to the deftness of China's current economic managers that concerns Yellen, they're still looking good compared with their American and European counterparts.\nJanet, just do it.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/rbas-guy-debelle-nixes-bond-market-calls-for-market-maker-of-last-resort-20150915-gjnlsk.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/us-fed-leaves-interest-rates-on-hold-20150917-gjpe82.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/us-rate-hike-delay-splits-emerging-market-investors-20150618-ghrfxm.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/reserve-bank-governor-glenn-stevens-expects-a-us-rate-rise-by-christmas-20150918-gjpj01.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/what-fed-chair-janet-yellen-had-to-say-20150917-gjpfg2.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:29:56.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
