It's declining growth,\" Lousberg said.\nThe current supply glut would lead to half of Chinese construction equipment producers to close, Lousberg added.\nThey number \"in the thousands\", with some making just a few products, he said.\nHe expects the market to recover around 2017 to 2018 due to massive infrastructure construction by China at home and overseas.\nTerex, which competes with Caterpillar, operates a crane manufacturing venture in Xiamen. The Westport, CT-based firm registered compound annual growth in sales over the past five years in China by focusing on segments that are still growing, said Lousberg.\nThat includes equipment used for rock cutting, he added.\nIn August, Terex and Finnish rival Konecranes agreed to an all-share merger, with a combined $10 billion in annual revenues.
