Jacky Ghossein Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rowan Dean On the other hand: Rowan Dean's satirical weekly take on the world of politics One night in a Point Piper restaurant:\n\"Good evening, sir, may I take your order?\"\n\"Well, of course you may, and may I just say what an absolute delight it is to be here under such, well, obviously these are difficult circumstances for us all, and by that I mean – clearly - not just for me - well - it's not just about me per se, but what I've learnt from my previous meals here, I think I've learnt - I don't think, I know I've learned - to be more respectful of other diners and to - there is so much I recognise on the menu, and that is - that is, you know, other people may want something different…\"\n\"Will you be having a starter?\"\n\"Well, that's not actually something I have considered in isolation, by the way - I am more focused on what the entire table are having tonight, and obviously I intend to consult widely on…\"\n\"Beetroot soup or mushroom tartlet, sir?\"\n\"Well, like I say, I've always been very circumspect about starters, or entrees, or antipasto, or nibbles or whatever you in the galley prefer to call the first course, but - the important thing is to be open-minded, consult, engage intelligently, explain the various dishes to the guests in a manner that respects their intelligence and then make a decision, and having made a decision, then argue, and advocate…\"\n \"Avocado's off tonight, sir.\"\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"… chef says we could do roast tomato instead.\"\n\"Well, look, there are - you probably can't really - you can't really rank them 'cause they are very different. I mean, the - the - clearly the - roast tomato is, and this is not a revelation, by the way - the roast tomato is, if you like, sweeter, whereas, in terms of a more balanced dining experience…\"\n\"So no roast tomato?\"\n\"Well, I'm - I'm not going to rule things in or rule things out at this stage. This is one of those - this is one of those restaurant games you people play. One of the things I'm trying to do is to change the dining paradigm so it's more rational. You know, 'cause you get into this crazy situation where waitresses - or indeed waiters - are encouraged by chefs to say, \"Order this, order that\" or they're asked to say, \"How would you like it, rare or..\"\n\"So just mains?\"\n\"No, no hang on! Hang on! You're not listening to me. I was about to explain that the object of dinner - the sole object - is to reduce your hunger. There are many different ways you can do that. You can do that by having a starter and a main; you can do that by sharing a variety of smaller, tapas style dishes if you prefer; you can do it by selecting at random from the lazy Susan; but in truth, what I am keen on is some kind of fixed price or set menu. It's capped. It will reduce - it has cut our bills in the past two years to less than $14 a head. So, we're not looking for gastronomic theoretical purity here; we're looking for practical innovation, agility, a nimble…\"\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but you have 44 people in your party who are feeling pretty hungry now…\"\n\"Well, there is - look, these leadership tussles always do - you know, there is always some leftover…\"\n\"You may take any leftovers home, sir. It's entirely up to you.\"\n\"Well, you know, I'm not great at analysing myself, to be honest. I'll leave that to others. I don't find myself particularly interesting - even though everybody else does - but I feel I am very - confident and centred in myself. I feel - but not in a sort of ebullient way… I'm far more agile, engaging…\"\n\"I need to get your order in, sir…\"\n\"Of course you do, but I don't believe in rushing these things in a sort of hasty way, but equally I believe you can make decisions very quickly. So I won't put a timeframe on it. Our plans will change, all plans change. But when we do make changes we will do so in a considered yet swift, measured yet innovative way in tandem with the guests, the hostess, myself, and, er, me. And then I'll tell you what we've decided. And if necessary, I will argue, and persuade, and cajole and engage with you and the kitchen…\"\n\"Kitchen's closed now, Mr Turnbull.\"\nIn other news this week, Malcolm Turnbull is backing an unprecedented crackdown on domestic violence against prime ministers. \"Four prime ministers have been slain in the last five years alone,\" said Mr Turnbull, \"It's a national disgrace.\"\nTwitter @rowandean", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/rowandean", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/107339562751475118358/posts"], "published": "2015-09-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:07:32.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
