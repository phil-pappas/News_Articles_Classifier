Photo: Daniel Munoz\nUltra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth are pushing superannuation funds to take money out of traditional stock and bond portfolios and redeploy it into more opaque alternative assets. It is a strategy super chiefs hope will save them from having to tell their members to expect lower returns.\n\"The days when Australians could comfortably expect returns of inflation plus 5 per cent from their super fund are probably gone for the foreseeable future,\" CREATE-Research chief executive Prof. Amin Rajan told the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees investment conference on Wednesday.\nSovereign wealth and pension funds around the world are being pushed into more illiquid assets - such as infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and private equity - as they chase stronger returns and regular yields, UK-based Mr Rajan said.\nEven so, many funds ware tipped to warn their members to expect lower returns in the decade ahead.\nAdvertisement \"I have met with a number of super funds in Australia this trip and I was impressed that they are still targeting CPI + 5 per cent, but it seems like an Everest of a target in the current market environment.\"\nFirst State Super chief investment officer Richard Brandweinerâ€‹ said the fund recently dropped the long-range return target on its most conservative investment option from CPI + 2.5 per cent down to CPI + 1 per cent.\n\"Ultra-low interest rates mean that it is very difficult to deliver any real return above inflation from cash or bonds, and over the past few years we have already increased out exposure to alternative assets to help deal with lower returns.\"\nMedia Super chairman Gerard Noonan said there was a \"lively debate\" underway among his board over whether the fund can meet its long-term target for CPI plus 3.5 per cent, a target it managed to beat through the \"dog days\" of the global financial crisis, even with a healthy allocation to alternatives.\n\"We already have around 10 per cent of the portfolio in infrastructure, a similar amount in property, and a little less in private equity. But shifting significantly more amounts of capital into those three asset sectors to chase better long-term returns can be tough and take quite a long time.\"\nMr Rajan said it was difficult for funds to lower their targets, because it risked alienating members at a time when competition to keep them is fierce.\n\"Targets are part forecast, part aspiration\".\nTwo of Australia's leading actuarial consulting firms, Towers Watson and Rice Warner, warned in July that over the next five to 10 years the annual gain generated by a typical balanced fund is likely to be about 2 percentage points lower than long-term return objectives .\nJP Morgan forecasts the average return from a traditional investment portfolio is likely to drop from 8 per cent to 6 per cent this year.\n\"Institutional investors have a growing demand for assets that can offer some inflation protection, volatility dampening and income. The shift to alternatives is not a fad but a mainstream structural change,\" JP Morgan global market strategist Kerry Craig said.\n\"There is around $US1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in dry powder across the global pension fund industry waiting to be deployed into alternative assets, and that will inevitably push prices up.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/warning-super-funds-likely-to-miss-longterm-return-targets-20150701-gi270a"], "published": "2015-09-03T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T16:00:53.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
