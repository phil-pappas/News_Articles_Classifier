James Brickwood by Julie-anne Sprague Wesfarmers chairman Bob Every wants smaller listed companies to expand their boards in a bid to boost gender diversity.\nMr Every, who is also Boral chairman, said boards benefited when women were involved, particularly when female participation reached 30 per cent.\nBut just 39 of ASX-S&P 200 Index companies have achieved 30 per cent female participation.\nA third of Boral's board positions are filled by women. Wesfarmers, which has three female directors, will return to the 30 per cent mark in November when Mr Every steps down as chairman.\nMr Every said one way to improve the number of female directors was for smaller companies to expand, allowing them to include skills from broader backgrounds such as finance and law.\n\"The point being made to me is that women are not getting traction on smaller companies,\" Mr Every said.\n\"Extending the size of a board that has four or five people on it could be a very attractive avenue to [give] women a start.\"\nBecause smaller companies have smaller boards they typically sought people with strong operational experience, making it more difficult for women, who are under-represented in senior management and chief executive ranks.\n Martin Lawrence, director for corporate governance adviser Ownership Matters, said it would be relatively inexpensive for smaller boards to expand and it could help boost the number of female directors.\n\"It's not a bad idea,\" Mr Lawrence said.\n\"There is the age-old argument that to get appointed to a large company board you need to have experience. How do you get experience? Get appointed to a board.\"\nHe said it was not overly expensive for smaller companies to expand, given they typically paid directors between $120,000 and $150,000.\n\"The fundamental thing is, does the company think they will get the added benefit from more people on the board?\"\nIn Western Australia, 10 of the 15 ASX 200 companies listed with headquarters in Perth have no women at all.\nThey include miners such as Northern Star Resources and mining services group Monadelphous, but also the Kerry Stokes-backed Seven Group.\nMr Every said smaller boards were often more challenging because they often had fewer resources than larger companies.\n\"To some extent the workload on smaller boards is greater because you don't get the support that big companies can provide,\" he said.\n30% Club Mr Every has joined the 30% Club, an organisation expanding around the globe, striving to improve gender diversity by increasing female representation on boards to one-third.\nThe 30 per cent target has been set to reflect a tipping point, when women collectively can influence discussion. The 30% Club does not support quotas.\n\"I think boards behave better when there are more women around the table,\" Mr Every said.\n\"Once you get several women in the room it becomes a microcosm of society â€“ you behave as you would in that group setting.\"\nMr Every will hand over the role of Wesfarmers chairman to Michael Chaney in November.\nHe said he did consider appointing a woman to the role and was confident the six female directors he works with at Wesfarmers and Boral will in time become chairwomen at listed companies.\nWesfarmers director Diane Smith-Gander is already chairwoman at Transfield Services.\nHe said women were typically joining boards at a younger age than men of his generation did, which was also improving age diversity in the boardroom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:10:23.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
