Sam Bennett Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro As Australia's hedge fund industry gathered in Sydney for a week of conferences, private meetings and awards dinners, it was an opportune time to take stock of its direction.\nThere is much for hedge funds to be upbeat about. Australian hedge fund assets have topped $100 billion. The presence of major international names is complimenting domestic funds that are building up strong track records and have gradually won over consultants and investors.\nBut it's clear there are a number of challenges ahead. We can take comfort that these are not local issues, but global ones. But hedge funds everywhere are facing the version of the passive threat that has decimated long-only fund managers.\nEven though hedge funds as an asset class are the antithesis of a passive investment, the same broad forces are at work. In a world of low returns, high fees are becoming harder to justify. The proliferation of low cost alternatives is luring away the capital of sceptical investors while adding pressure on managers who aim to outperform the market to do just that.\nThis was encapsulated by hype around 'liquid alternatives', a topic of discussion at Tuesday's Alternative Investment Management Association conference in Sydney.\nThere's a growing trend to deliver 'hedge fund strategies' at a low cost, identifying and stripping out the 'factor' that delivers most of the out-performance, and packaging that into investment products.\nArbitrage Now, hedge funds don't have to just beat the market or deliver returns with low risk, but beat exchange traded funds and mutual funds that have been created to capture the bulk of traditional hedge fund strategies, whether its 'merger arbitrage', 'momentum' or 'value'.\n That reignites the perennial question about fees. The '2 and 20' fee model that made hedge funds rich – 2 per cent of tota asset value as a management fee plus 20 per cent of profits as a performance fee – has been under threat for many years. But a more competitive environment and a rise of 'factor analysis' is making it easier for investors to identify whether a hedge fund is really delivering 'alpha'.\nHere the debate is a little more interesting. Can hedge funds still deliver 'alpha' that warrants the fees they charge?\nThere's division. The premier funds have shown that they can deliver some degree of out-performance but as they get larger they run into scale limits.\nJohn Hempton runs Bronte Capital, a small but well-known hedge fund. He pointed out at an AIMA panel discussion that this is a problem afflicting even the world's greatest investor – Warren Buffett – who can't replicate the extraordinary returns with tens of billions of dollars that he was able to achieve with millions.\nDumb money The Buffetts of the world are rare. Far more common are the hedge funds and mutual funds that aren't able to conquer their benchmarks.\nAlso speaking at the AIMA conference veteran hedge fund manager Paul Chadwick, of CQS and Nanuk, recalled a line Jeremy Grantham uttered when he worked with him at GMO. \"There is nothing more supremely useless than a mediocre fund manager.\"\nBut Hempton said they're not useless at all: they're there to take the other side of his trades.\nIf hedge funds are indeed the smart money, who is the 'dumb money?'\nHempton explained that when he discovered and sold short a whole lot of fraudulent Chinese reverse mergers, it wasn't retail investors on the other side but some of the world's most successful and sophisticated quant funds.\nAmong the computer operated funds on the side of the trade were Jim Simons of Renaissance Capital; a hedge fund with the best returns in the history of investing.But buying the odd dodgy stock clearly didn't detract from his performance, and was no reason to change a successful formula.\nThat is a reminder that so long as a market is made up of indiscriminate buyers there will be opportunities to generate alpha. And if there's one undeniable trend in the markets, it's the fee-fuelled rise of indiscriminate systematic investing.\nNow read how hedge funds are facing disruptive threats.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-16T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:03:16.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
