The city has surpassed Mumbai in the unsold inventory segment; only the National Capital Region (NCR) is ahead of Bangalore.\n“Given the rising land costs and expected cash flow issues, developers have been launching new projects in the last few quarters. The situation, however, does not reflect a disconnect between developers and buyers. According to the former, enquiries are happening but buyer sentiment has been affected by macro-economic conditions, causing them to put their buying decision on hold,” the report says.\nThe report added Bangalore remains a very end-user driven market – quite unlike Mumbai and NCR, which have traditionally been speculative, investor-driven markets. The key characteristic of being a stable market still exists in Bangalore.\nIn Bangalore, units in the price range of Rs. 35-80 lakh sell off quickly in Bangalore. Units with ticket sizes of Rs. 1 crore and above take longer to sell. Today, ticket sizes for most projects in the city range from Rs. 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Also, sales are slow only in relatively less popular locations like western part of Bangalore, Mysore Road, Tumkur Road.\nOn the other hand, good and stable demand is observed in areas like Sarjapur Road, Bellary Road, Kanakpura Road and Varthur (in Whitefield). The good accessibility from IT parks that these locations enjoy is why they are so popular with buyers.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 5:31 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:34:46.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
