Mpokoto Gold Project remains on track towards its goal of production in H1 2016 Press Release : Armadale Capital Plc – 24 minutes ago Armadale Capital Plc (‘Armadale’ or the ‘Company’) Mpokoto Gold Project remains on track towards its goal of production in H1 2016 \nArmadale, the AIM-quoted investment company focused on natural resource projects in Africa, is pleased to provide an update on the development and funding at its 678,000oz Mpokoto Gold Project (‘Mpokoto’ or the ‘Project’) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (‘DRC’), which remains on track to commence commercial production in H1 2016. \nKey Points: Decision to undertake additional metallurgical testwork in Q4 2015 to further optimise the identified two-phased processing routes for gold recovery (as announced on 3 August 2015) Definitive Feasibility Study (‘DFS’) continuing to progress well: active involvement from Africa Mining Contracting Services group (‘A-MCS’) completion now targeted for Q4 2015 to allow inclusion of results of planned metallurgical work and further input from A-MCS, which should positively enhance results of the DFS Positive engagement and progress with A-MCS to finalise the proposed financing package of up to US$20 million for Mpokoto; including: Provision of finance to fund the plant and power plants; and Mining contract to govern provision of mining services going forward Results from metallurgical work to support the definition of future drill targets to further enhance current resource of 678,000oz Au Mine construction expected to commence in December 2015 subject to receipt of financing Still expecting production H1 2016 on this basis - targeting approximately 25,000oz Au per annum over initial nine year life of mine with projected cash costs of US$647/oz Current Net Present Valuation of US$32.3m based on a forecast gold price of US$1,100/oz Raised £700,000 in August 2015 from institutional and other investors Director Dr Andrew Tunks will be making a trip to site over the coming weeks to ensure the Project remains on track towards its goal of production in H1 2016 \nPeter Marks, Armadale Chairman, commented, “Mpokoto continues to advance at pace towards commercial production. Having recently defined a two phase process route for gold recovery we believe there is potential to further optimise these results through additional metallurgical testwork, which we intend to undertake imminently. We believe the results from this will favourably impact the projected economics of the Project, which are already extremely competitive with estimated cash costs of US$647/oz and an NPV of US$32.3m. As a result of this new planned work, the DFS is now targeted for completion in Q4 2015, although importantly, the overall target of commercial production remains on track for H1 2016. \n“We continue to progress our very constructive engagement with A-MCS who are providing active input to the DFS process as well as the necessary framework to conclude our financing agreements with A-MCS, which will bring with it up to US$20 million of financing. This means we are extremely well placed to commence mine construction, targeted for December 2015. With additional upside available, Mpokoto maintains its status as a low capex, low opex gold mine and I look forward to updating shareholders on these upcoming milestones in the coming months.” **ENDS** \nFor further information please visit www.armadalecapitalplc.com or contact: \nArmadale Capital plc \nPeter Marks, Chairman +44 207 233 1462 \nCharles Zorab, Investor Relations \nNomad and broker: finnCap Ltd \nChristopher Raggett/Simon Hicks +44 (0) 207 220 0500 \nJoint Broker: Beaufort Securities Ltd \nJon Belliss +44 (0) 20 7382 8300 \nJoint Broker: VSA Capital Ltd \nAndrew Raca/Richard Buckle +44 (0) 203 005 5000 \nPress relations: St Brides Partners Ltd. \nHugo de Salis/Charlotte Heap +44 (0) 207 236 1177 \nNotes \nArmadale Capital Plc is focused on investing in and developing a portfolio of investments, targeting the natural resources sector in Africa.
