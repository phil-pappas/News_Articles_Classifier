Craig Abraham by Duncan Hughes A house buyer could save more than $175,000 on a 25-year mortgage and be eligible for cash-back incentives as the competition for businesses intensifies among banks and mortgage brokers.\nThe spread between the highest and lowest interest rates on mortgages is at an 18-month high as lenders offer special deals to attract the best borrowers with proven repayment histories and the ability to repay.\n\"Lenders are offering better rates but are also more choosy about who they want to do business with,\" says Chris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, a mortgage broker.\nThis follows regulatory pressure on lenders to tighten borrowing criteria for investment property buyers by raising rates and increasing loan-to-value ratios, which is the size of a loan compared with the value of a property expressed as a percentage.\nThere's been a sharp increase in the number of investors trying to switch their mortgages from investor to owner-occupied products for the lower rates.\nMany lenders are seeking to offset lost business by redoubling efforts to attract home buyers with regular incomes and unblemished repayment histories.\nThe spread between the highest and lowest standard variable rate has widened by more than 2 per cent, or from 3.97 per cent to 5.99 per cent, according to analysis by Canstar, a company that compares borrowing and savings rates.\nOn a one-year fixed rate the spread has widened to 2.35 per cent and 1.8 per cent for four- and five-year fixed rates, according to Canstar analysis.\n Eighteen months ago, most rates on offer were within a much narrower range.\nToday's best rates mean that a borrower with a $1 million, 25-year variable rate mortgage could switch from 5.12 per cent to 4.09 per cent on offer from Newcastle Permanent Building Society. That's a difference of about $588 a month, or $176,000, over the life of the mortgage.\nOther incentives, such as $1500 cash-back payments, are on offer from borrowers through mortgage brokers.\nFoster-Ramsay says some banks are offering brokers increased discretion to offer better deals. For example, NAB, is offering a variable rate of 4.19 per cent and $1500 cash back of the arrangement fees and cost to the borrower on its Homeplus package.\nThe offer is available for owner-occupied, principal and interest loans between $250,000 and $750,000. The loan-to-value ratio is 80 per cent.\nThe $1500 cash-back applies to customers who have a NAB transaction account and an NAB credit card. All new NAB home loan repayments must be paid from the NAB transaction account.\nMortgage brokers recommend borrowers ask what other deals are on offer.\nMany banks are capping loan-to-value ratios at 80 per cent and raising interest rates for investment lending and/or interest-only loans by up to 25 basis points. Other financiers are pulling out of the investment lending market.\nRecent research shows that property investors are younger and more likely to own several rental properties, with the number of investors with more than five properties rising 35 per cent in the past 12 months.\nLenders, such as St George Bank, which is part of the Westpac Group, claim the current increase in property investors seeking to switch to owner-occupied status is being reviewed to ensure rules are not broken.\nTypically, property owners applying for a better rate will be assessed on their repayment record and ability to continue disciplined and timely repayments.\nAccording to brokers, borrowers' debt with other lenders will be taken into account, regardless of what it is being used for.\nLenders will typically add another notional 20 per cent to the interest rate borrowers are paying on other debt to assess whether they can afford the higher rate in addition to the mortgage.\nLenders are also assuming borrowers spend more each month, which means they have less disposable cash to meet unexpected expenses, such as servicing higher interest rates.\nFor example, ANZ Banking Group will assume every individual has after-tax, monthly outgoings of about $1185. This rises to $2261 for a family â€“ defined as two parents and two stay-at-home children. A monthly amount of $341 is added for every additional dependent child.\nCase study Packaging discount loans with other savings and credit products makes it tough to switch to cheaper products, according to borrower and accountant Nichole McClelland.\nMcClelland says many lenders make lower lending rates, cash-back incentives and special features conditional on taking out a suite of products. For example, some of the latest discount offers are only available to borrowers with the lenders' credit cards.\n\"We have been able to negotiate good packages for most of our loans,\" says McClelland, whose husband, Richard, works in sales. \"But that often means you have to stay with the one provider.\"\nThe McClellands have a home loan with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a margin loan for share buying with BT Group, and loans for five investment properties with other lenders.\nShe says increased competition among lenders makes it more attractive to switch and is beginning to justify the effort involved in decoupling from certain products.\n\"We have started to look again,\" says McClelland, who lives in the Brisbane suburb of Bardon.\n\"We now have more power because lenders are looking for disciplined and low-risk borrowers. But it means a lot of paperwork.\"\nMcClelland adds that existing lenders will renegotiate lower rates to keep their business.\nThe couple, who have two small children, aims for a diversified portfolio of property and shares.\n\"I'm the family risk-taker, my husband is not,\" she says. \"It's a good balance. I used to like the sharemarket before the recent volatility. Property is a good, solid asset.\n\"I'm always for rewards' programs linked to banking products. They are convenient and often a good deal for time-deprived mothers who also have to work.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:09:11.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
