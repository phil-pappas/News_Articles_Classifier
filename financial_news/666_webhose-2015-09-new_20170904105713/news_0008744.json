NXSystems’ Tokenisation solution enables the airline community to process transactions from multiple payment ecosystems (Online Travel Agents, direct bookings, kiosks etc.) in a timely, efficient and safe manner while BankViewTM offers easy tracking through a centralised dashboard. International tourism is at an all-time high with more than one billion people traveling abroad in 2014 alone. Carriers must have easy access to their multiple international bank accounts in order to move funds across the globe easily and securely. NXSystems, an IATA strategic partner, will be unveiling BankViewTM at the trade association's World Financial Symposium, taking place September 14-17 in Barcelona.\nBankViewTM allows airlines to view and manage all their international online banking activities in one easy-to-use platform. This centralised, secure platform presents all linked bank accounts in a single web-based dashboard, consolidating the time-consuming process of accessing bank accounts held across different countries. BankView’s™ dashboard simplifies airlines’ reporting, compliance and reconciliation tasks while increasing ROI across their treasury operations. With BankViewTM, treasury managers are able to retrieve all their transactions in a trusted, secure environment from any location or device.\nNXSystems’ Tokenisation Solution combats the obstacles airlines, travel operators and OTAs face when processing international reservations and payments by eliminating card exposure in the international market that often results in above-average fraud and significantly reducing interchange and foreign exchange fees.\nThe Tokenisation Solution consists of a one-time dedicated use, multi-currency and secure virtual payment card number or token, which is generated for each transaction and delivers the transaction to the receiving financial entity within seconds. The Tokenisation Solution eliminates fraud (prevents the originating credit card number from being exposed) while reducing interchange and foreign transaction fees with NXSystems’ in-house settlement process. The in-house settlement minimises delays and avoids authorisation holds by keeping credit lines open and closing the transaction cycle with an automated reconciliation processes.\n\"The airline industry has one of the most challenging business models when it comes to earning profit; utilising cost controls that provide savings and increase efficiencies is the only way to achieve higher margins\" says NXSystems Managing Director, Tony Ashe. \"BankViewTM and Tokenisation move the industry away from antiquated payment solutions and reconciliation processes by fully automating the reservation, payment processing and tracking cycle.\"\nTony Ashe will be onsite at the World Financial Symposium (WFS) to show airline executives how they can overcome the challenges presented by disparate payment processing systems, and will provide demonstrations of the company’s airline-centric payment solutions at booth number 53.\nTo schedule an interview with Mr. Ashe at WFS please contact Karina Castano at kcastano(at)thinkinkpr.com or +1.305.749.5242 ext. 240.
