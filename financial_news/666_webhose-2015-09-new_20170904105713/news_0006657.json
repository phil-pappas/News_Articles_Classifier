It is expecting to pay a dividend of between 40 and 50 cents, meaning a total payment for fully shared up farmers of $5 to $5.10. \nThe good news for farmers has been delivered three days after Fonterra announced more bad news for its management staff. Job losses from its management team will now total around 750, an increase of over 200 from its previous estimates. \nIt also says it expects that production volumes for this season will be 5 percent down on last season. \nThe co-operative lifted the forecast payment as part of its annual profit result. It has announced a net after tax profit of $506 million for the year to July 31st. That is an increase of 183 percent. \nFonterra also confirmed a final cash payout of $4.65 for the 2015 season for a 100 percent share-backed farmer. That includes a farmgate milk price of $4.40 per kilogram of milk solids and a dividend of 25 cents per share. \nChairman John Wilson says Fonterra's entire business had been affected by \"extremely challenging trading conditions globally\". \n\"Falling global dairy prices due to a supply and demand imbalance impacted the milk price, while the dividend reflected higher funding costs following significant investment in capacity to support milk growth in New Zealand, essential investments in the key strategic market of China, and the costs of maintaining a higher advance rate through the season,\" he says. \n\"The strengthening of performance in the second half resulted in normalised earnings before interest and tax almost doubling, with good growth in our consumer and food service businesses and the results of a major push in our ingredients business to offset low milk prices with improved margins.\" \nChief executive Theo Spierings says prices are \"often cyclical\", but this year's market is one of the most difficult he has known. \n\"The global dairy industry has been hit simultaneously by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and Russia, Ebola in Africa, an economic slowdown in China and the sharp drop in oil and mineral prices,\" he says. \n\"These events suppressed demand at a time when farmers all around the world had ramped up production in response to previous high prices. This resulted in an inevitable impact on pricing. \n\"Looking ahead, this uncertainty means that world markets are likely to be difficult in the medium-term\" \nBut he says the co-operative will be ready, \n\"That's because we have thoroughly reviewed our execution of strategy, our processes and working practices to embed long-term change. We are focusing all our resources to make us faster, more efficient, and achieve sustainable results.\" Volkswagen chief executive resigns \nVolkswagen's share price has rallied 5 percent following the resignation of chief executive Martin Winterkorn. \nBut the rally came after a sell-off that saw the company lose around a third of its value, wiping 23 billion Euro (NZ$41 billion) from its market capitalisation. \nMr Winterkorn said he had no idea about the efforts to cheat emissions standards and was \"shocked by the events of the past few days\". \n\"Above all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group,\" he says. \nHis successor will be appointed later this week. Some have suggested it might be Porsche president and chief executive Matthias Muller. But other possibilities include Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler and VW brand head Herbert Diess. \nIt is likely more people will be forced out of VW by the scandal. The company has itself filed a complaint with the German prosecutors. \nVolkswagen has set aside 6.5 billion Euro (NZ$11.65billion) for potential litigation. To put that figure in perspective VW made a 12.6 billion Euro profit last year (NZ$22 billion). \nBut analysts are already saying VW might need to double that 6.5 billion figure. \nPutting a number on the real cost is tricky. It has been suggested that VW faces potential costs of US$18 billion (NZ$29 billion). \nBut that figure is just an estimate. It was based on the initial figure of 482,000 four-cylinder VW and Audi (owned by VW) cars sold in the US since 2008. VW faces a maximum fine of US$37,500 for each non-compliant vehicle. \nVW will want to settle with the Environmental Protection Agency as quickly as possible. \nThere is also the potential for various US states and individuals to file lawsuits, and for other countries to take action. \nThen there is the question of brand damage. How quickly will customers forgive or forget? Why would anyone in VW think they could cheat the US testing regime? \nOne theory put forward is that the on-board vehicle emission controls degraded the cars' performance when the controls were activated. It made the engines hotter, and shortened their life span. The controls possibly affected torque and acceleration. \nThis meant that the vehicles were not achieving the ideal combination of driving performance, fuel efficiency and environmental standards. \nDiesel vehicles make up around 3 percent of the market in the US and around 17 percent in New Zealand. \nBut they are 50 percent of the market in Europe. \nThere have been concerns in Europe that a number of manufacturers have been gaming the testing system and that on road performance is nothing like the lab results. \nThat's raised the prospect of tougher tests. Add to that the prospects of a slowing Chinese economy and it is no wonder that investors are wary of investing in the auto sector right now. China slowdown \nThe last 24 hours has seen a new wave of concern about the Chinese economy. \nChina's manufacturing sector just had its worst month in over six years. \nThe purchasing managers' index fell to 47 – anything below 50 means factory output is contracting. \nIt is the seventh month in a row it has slowed. \nThe figure has been released as China's President is visiting the United States, hoping to reassure people about the health of the Chinese economy. \nIn a speech he said that the economy was \"still operating within the proper range\". \nHere is my talk with Paul Henry about China's latest manufacturing numbers. The markets \nThe disappointing Chinese factory numbers saw the Asian markets lose ground yesterday. \nChina's Shanghai Composite lost 2.16 percent. \nJapan's Nikkei closed 1.96 percent lower. \nBut European markets clawed back early losses to finish higher. \nGermany's DAX gained 0.44 percent, London's FTSE rallied 1.62 percent and France's CAC 40 made a narrow gain of 0.10 percent. \nUS stocks finished slightly negative. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.31 percent. \nThe S&P500 was down 0.20 percent and the NASDAQ lost 0.08 percent. \nWest Texas crude fell 4 percent to US$44.48. \nThat was after a new report showing that since the end of the US summer driving season there has been a lift in gasoline inventories. \nEuropean Brent was down 2.59 percent to $47.80. \nGold rose $5.40 to US$1130 per ounce. \nBut platinum is at a fresh six and a half year low. It slipped 0.8 percent to US924.50, due to the concern about the VW scandal. Platinum is used in diesel catalysts to clean up emissions. The dollar \nThe New Zealand dollar has lost 0.8 percent against the US dollar, trading at 62.42 cents at 8am. \nBy 9.40 it had edged up to 62.75 cents, following the release of the Fonterra result at 8.30am. \nThe Kiwi gained over half a percent overnight against the Australian, sitting at 89.31 cents by 8am. \nBy 9:40am it was 89.61 cents. \nIt was 40.96 Pence at 8am, moving up to 41.16 cents. \nIt was 55.82 Euro at 8am and 56.10 by 9:40am. \nIt had moved from 75.06 Yen at 8am to 75.44 just over an hour and a half later. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T05:23:29.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
