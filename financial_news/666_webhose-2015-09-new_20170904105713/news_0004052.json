Who is right between the teachers and the government? \nAll of us would agree that teachers do quite some serious work and need to be remunerated in a manner that gives them a sense of dignity. \nSIT AND NEGOTIATE \nOne would, however, see some sense in what the government is saying. Paying them the percentages that the court has ordered would affect the national wage bill in a way that may not be sustainable. \nBut both government and the teachers' unions are headed by human beings who one would expect have the interest of the Kenyan child at heart. \nWhy would they not sit down and negotiate? A lot of time and energy has been wasted over three weeks now and no positive outcome is in sight. \nSchools have in fact been closed as we speak. \nThen there is the Anne Waiguru, Raila Odinga argument about a scandal at the National Youth Service and threats of taking each other to court. \nThe good Cabinet secretary seems to have admitted that some money was lost through the corrupt behaviour of some officers in that department. \nCASE WITHDRAWN \nMr Odinga insists politically that she ought to resign. He even says that she is being shielded by the president. \nWhere is the truth in all this? May be we shall never get to know which is characteristic of Kenyan public discourse on corruption and other social ills. \nThe deputy Inspector General of police was told to leave office and initially resisted that move. After finally leaving office she sued the government. \nNow we hear she has withdrawn the case. Before this matter came to an end we now have the matter of the deputy Chief Justice. \nAfter being told by the Judicial Service Commission that she has to retire at 70 she was not quite in agreement and went to court. It seems everyone is going to court. \nCONSTITUTION VIOLATION \nThere is certainly too much noise to the point that one wonders what energy is left to build Kenya into a country that we can all be proud of. \nWhile Jubilee parliamentarians are rallying around Waiguru, the Cord ones are now focusing on the president. \nThey want to impeach him on account of not honouring a court order. They say he has violated the Constitution which he took an oath to defend. \nI wonder what they would do in his position. Kenya lives on though. \nFr Wamugunda is dean of students, University of Nairobi; Kenya \nStudents, teachers and parents will wake up tomorrow to one of the most dramatic disruptions of the school system in … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation.
