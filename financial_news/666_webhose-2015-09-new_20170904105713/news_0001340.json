Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Environment Minister Greg Hunt has given another signal he is more open to investment in wind technology, in a possible change to the Abbott government's position.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott had wanted to abolish the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, while former Treasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann issued a draft directive to the CEFC to invest away from wind and household solar.\nNow Mr Hunt said the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, recently moved out from the cold and into his own department, could invest in emerging wind technology.\nThe comments come as the government trumpet ARENA's $3.5 million and $7.8 million investment in First Solar's Weipa Solar Plant in Queensland to power Rio Tinto's remote bauxite mine in the area, a further signal they will escape the axe.\nMr Hunt said he did not issue a \"blanket ban\" on the CEFC investing in wind and household solar, but that it should focus on solar and geothermal energy. He said CEFC investments in wind could be appropriate.\n\"If there are emerging components in relation to wind such as new turbines or offshore wind then that might be an appropriate way,\" he said.\nAustralian Wind Alliance National Coordinator, Andrew Bray, said the comments were a crack in the door for the sector.\n\"It was new that he didn't rule out CEFC from investing in wind,\" he said.\n Mr Hunt said the renewables industry should feel \"very supported\" under new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his focus on innovation , after they complained of investment instability fuelled by Tony Abbott's hostility towards the sector.\n\"What has changed is a greater emphasis on confidence and innovation in the renewable sector,\" Mr Hunt said on Tuesday.\nMr Hunt has faced pressure from his own backbench to reverse their position on the investment mandate for the CEFC back to wind.\n\"I've written to the Finance Minister Mathias Cormann seeking his consideration that emerging technologies in wind and small-scale solar be included in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's investment mandate,\" Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the ABC in July.\nA new study by the Energy Supply Association has found Australia is still on a steep learning curve when it comes to large-scale or utility-sized solar systems, with the Abbott government seen as hostile to the sector.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-27/backbench-pressures-government-about-energy-decision/6649648", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-has-escalated-his-war-on-wind-power-20150711-gia3xi.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-29T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:09:34.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
