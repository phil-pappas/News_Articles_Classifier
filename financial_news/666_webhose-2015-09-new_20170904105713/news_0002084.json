Their Universal Content Security protects data through a partnership with Covertix, the leader in next-generation cyber security software. The solution functions inside or outside the organization, across virtually any use case including: securing data based on policy, integration with SharePoint, Dropbox, USBs, email, file shares, and more, and works even in a copy and paste scenario.\nThis new release of Accelerate for Insurance also includes the newly-launched Ephesoft Universe, which is not just a new product, but a new concept. Ephesoft Universe is the first technology to combine an advanced document capture platform with big data to move beyond content contained in key fields or forms, and allow the organization to recognize the wealth of value in unstructured data as well.\nZia Consulting will be attending the fifth annual Insurance Technology Congress in London, United Kingdom, September 22, 2015.
