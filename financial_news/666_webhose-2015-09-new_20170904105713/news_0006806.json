Mining and energy have been hard hit by sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities, and construction revenues have fallen from North America to Asia. \nCaterpillar generates 60 per cent of its pre-tax profit from outside the US, and slowing emerging markets had already forced it to cut 31,000 jobs and close or consolidate more than 20 manufacturing facilities since 2012. In its latest warning, it singled out that \"the most significant decline\" in its revenue forecasts for next year stemmed from its oil and gas business.\nMore from the Financial Times \nCaterpillar reverses on commodity worries Caterpillar cuts forecast on gloomy global outlook US growth helps Caterpillar beat results forecasts Oil price fall cuts Caterpillar outlook On Thursday, the Illinois-based group cut its 2015 sales forecast by another $1bn to $48bn and said it expected revenue to decline an additional 5 per cent in 2016, marking a fourth straight year of decreases - a first in its 90 year history. \nIt announced plans to cut annual costs across the group by $1.5bn, with 4,000-5,000 job losses by the end of 2016, and a possible cut of more than 10,000 jobs by 2018. As of June 30, Caterpillar had 126,800 employees. \nOther savings will come from closing or consolidating plants representing about 10 per cent of its manufacturing footprint. The measures will cost Caterpillar about $2bn. \nThe lowered revenue outlook and need for further cuts suggests that the slowdown in many economies has yet to reach its nadir, analysts said.\n\"Much of the strength in profits across multinationals in recent years was driven by gains abroad. [It's] tough to make the same kind of profits unless we get a major offset from our own back yard or in the developed world,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. \"That is a large hole to fill and will take time.\"\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.\n>Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, said it was \"facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors - namely in mining and energy.\" Caterpillar remained committed to industries such as mining, oil and gas, construction and rail, he said, but \"we have to manage through what can be considerable and sometimes prolonged downturns\". Caterpillar's shares fell 6.5 per cent to $65.63 by midday, bringing their year to date fall to 28 per cent, compared with the S&P 500's 6.9 per cent decline. \nRivals such as Komatsu of Japan are also suffering from the slowdown. Demand in China for the Japanese company's largest hydraulic excavators, for example, has dropped by about 50 per cent or more every month between January and July, the latest month for which it has disclosed figures.\nOther suppliers to the oil and gas industry have cut tens of thousands of jobs amid falling revenues, while United Technologies, which sells Otis lifts to China, has cut its earnings outlook.\nDespite the bleak macroeconomic environment, Caterpillar said that its earlier cost savings programme, which cut more than 8m square feet of manufacturing space, had helped drive gross margins to their best level in two decades. It had increased its market share in some products, it added.\nAdditional reporting by Ed Crooks in New York\nCopyright Â© 2015 The Financial Times Limited.
