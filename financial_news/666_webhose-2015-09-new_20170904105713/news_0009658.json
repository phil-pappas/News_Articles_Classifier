Australia will take 12,000 refugees How the world is reacting Refugee crisis: full coverage Don't care about the growing refugee crisis? You may care that the issue is increasingly intruding on domestic politics not only in Europe but also in Australia and the United States.\nThe increase in refugees, asylum seekers and forcibly displaced people to the highest level since the end of World War II represents a \"significant political risk\" in international politics, according to research from international banking group Citi.\nThe migrant issue will be on the political agenda for some time.

At the same time, the nation will start air strikes in Syria in the battle against Islamic State.\nRising fears for immigration challenge the notion of the free movement of people, money and goods. While immigration is needed in countries with ageing and declining populations, it remains \"deeply unpopular politically\" potentially triggering a move to wind back economic globalisation, Citi said.\n\"Will the politics of reinstating barriers and controls trump the economics of globalisation?\" the report asks. It describes \"public attitudes and policymakers' responses to the refugee and migration crisis\" as another bellwether of a \"wider post-crisis backlash towards globalisation\".\nEurope has already seen the rise of anti-immigrant, anti-EU parties such as UKIP in Britain, France's National Front, nationalist party Jobbik in Hungary. But it's not limited to Europe. \"Opposition to immigration has contributed to the rise in Donald Trump's favourability ratings in his candidacy for US president.\"\nAustralia like European nations must also contend with radicalised citizens who have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight and who pose a threat on their return.\nThis international trend feeds fears surrounding immigration, along with competition for jobs, and the effect on a local communities, that help fuel anti-immigrant movements and parties.\nAustralian National University Strategic and Defence Studies Centre senior fellow John Blaxland said the knock-on consequences of the refugee crisis for domestic politics in the advanced democracies are difficult to predict.\nIn Europe, the \"greatest concern is the challenge to the EU's sense of self-identity and how it perceives its own security and the integrity of its borders,\" he said.\nThis is particularly true, he said, given the \"growing inability to control its borders\".\n\"The implications are hard to fathom but there are numerous ominous indicators that Europe is on the cusp of an existential crisis.\"\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign", "http://www.theage.com.au/world/refugee-migrant-crisis"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:44:54.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
