Steve Cassell Share on twitter by Tim Binsted ASX-listed telehealth minnow ResApp will release clinical trial results on Wednesday demonstrating its technology can diagnose respiratory illnesses simply by having a patient cough into a smartphone.\nThe company, which has a market value of just $15 million, will publish the results of a trial testing ResApp's ability to diagnose pneumonia and asthma in almost 200 patients at the Joondalup Medical Campus and Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth.\n\"There's almost 100 per cent accuracy diagnosing illnesses from coughing into a phone. It's a world first,\" ResApp vice-president Brian Leedman said.\nResApp chief executive Tony Keating said the technology had the potential to radically reduce healthcare costs and revolutionise diagnostic screening.\n\"Our goal is to make that test as accurate as an X-ray and our hope is to replace those tests,\" he said.\nMr Keating is a former commercialisation director at UniQuest, the University of Queensland's venture capital arm.\nHe left UniQuest in July to take on the chief executive role at ResApp.\n\"At UniQuest I was probably focused on four or five projects. I thought this one had a top chance of making a difference,\" he said.\n ResApp's technology was developed by University of Queensland associate professor Udantha Abeyratne. The university retains an 8 per cent stake in the company and owns performance shares that could increase its holding.\nAustralia's slow push into telehealth, the delivery of health-related services through telecommunications technologies, comes as the nation is enveloped in a huge debate about the spiralling cost of healthcare.\nPrivate health insurers Medibank Private, Bupa, and nib defended on Tuesday Health Minister Sussan Ley's review of the Medicare Benefits Schedule in the face of opposition from the doctors' lobby.\nMr Keating said the United States' experience had demonstrated that telehealth delivered \"massive cost savings\".\nHe said estimates suggested a telehealth consultation with a GP in the US was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than a physical visit.\nResApp could also reduce costs from face-to-face GP consultations, he said.\n\"They can do it in primary care and get an instant diagnosis, rather than send for a scan,\" he said.\nUniQuest has successfully commercialised some significant research developed by its professors, including cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil and pain therapy technology company Spinifex.\nThe company hopes to submit its technology to the US Food and Drug Administration in the middle of 2016 and to hit the US market by the end of 2016.\nMr Keating said the approval timeframe was much shorter for ResApp's technology than it would be for a new drug or medical device.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timbinsted"], "published": "2015-09-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:06:17.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
