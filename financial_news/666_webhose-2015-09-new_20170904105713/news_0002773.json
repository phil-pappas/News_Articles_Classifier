Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey New Treasurer Scott Morrison says he will take the same clinical approach to balancing the budget as he did to his previous tasks of stopping the boats and breaking the Senate impasse over pension cuts.\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review after Malcolm Turnbull confirmed he would be replacing Joe Hockey as Treasurer , Mr Morrison also committed to continuing with the White-Paper processes already underway into Tax and Federation and putting together the Mid-Year budget update scheduled for release in December.\n\"My intention is to take the same deliberate, conscientious and methodical approach to these issues as I have applied in previous roles,\" he said.\nMr Morrison has a general appreciation of the state of the budget given, as Social Services Minister, he was a member of the budget razor gang, the Expenditure Review Committee.\nMr Turnbull on Sunday said all policies, including previous commitments by Tony Abbott and Mr Hockey, were up for review. Mr Morrison said he would \"make further statements when we are in a position to do so\".\n\"It is is our duty to taxpayers to soberly manage our public finances. Our taxpayer resources must be put to best use, our deficit must continue to be steadily reduced and the debt burden on future generations must continue to be brought under control,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"A growing, innovative and agile economy is the best defence for jobs and it is the best defence against people and families getting left behind.\n\"In the days and weeks ahead I will be bringing my team together, taking briefings and consulting widely.\"\n As Immigration Minister, Mr Morrison fulfilled Tony Abbott's promise to stop the boats . Late last year he was moved to Social Services where he redesigned the child care system and broke the Senate impasse over pension cuts. The child care package was never introduced because the Senate refused to pass the welfare cuts needed to help fund it.\nMr Morrison, 47, said he regarded becoming Treasurer as a great privilege and that he wanted to build on the 300,000 jobs created under Mr Hockey's watch.\n\"Our ambition is to ignite Australia's economic aspiration to drive the confidence that is necessary to underpin growth. Central to this confidence is jobs,\" he said.\n\"We will back the ability of Australians to work hard to adapt to change and make the most of their opportunities and for our businesses to go out into the world and win.\"\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen described Mr Morrison as a \"political attack dog and chameleon\" who had been rewarded for treachery.\n\"It is a grave reflection on the damage the Liberals have done to the Australian economy that both the Prime Minister and Treasurer were fired after just two years,\" he said.\n\"While the personalities change, all indications are that there will be no significant change to economic and tax policy.\n\"Mr Morrison subscribes to the classic Liberal Party view of tax reform, of punishing low and middle income earners by increasing the GST, while leaving alone our system of unsustainable and unfair super tax concessions and refusing to examine capitals gains tax and negative gearing,\" Mr Bowen said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-20T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:08:08.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
