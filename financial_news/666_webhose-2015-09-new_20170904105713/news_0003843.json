It’s also important because this country stopped building nuclear power stations, which in my view is a tragedy. This country had the first civil nuclear power stations in the world.” \nLord Turnbull said the deal, which guarantees EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour, was “incredibly expensive” and a “huge commitment” for the Government. He also highlighted similar concerns over EDF’s nuclear project in Normandy, which faces a five-year setback and escalating costs. \nThe crossbench peer suggested that the Government should get back to the “drawing board” rather than “plumping for a bottomless pit and big white elephant”. \nHowever, Mr Osborne defended the plans and said nuclear energy remained “substantially cheaper than any other low carbon technology”. \nHe also described nuclear power as part of Britain’s future energy “mix”, and said other forms of energy such as shale gas would be “complimentary” to nuclear and “not an alternative”. \nMr Osborne also used the 90-minute session to suggest that Britain would push for an EU treaty change to prevent the UK and other non-eurozone members from becoming isolated in Europe. \nHe said the eurozone's recent decision to give Greece a bridging loan using the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) during its bail-out talks, of which Britain is the second biggest contributor, suggested that the 19-nation bloc would continue to ride roughshod over EU procedure without a treaty change. \nMr Osborne said \"ad hoc\" solutions, such as the “impregnable ringfence\" Britain secured from the eurozone for the loan, were not sustainable over the longer term. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's a straw in the wind of problems coming our way unless we can deal with this issue,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:41:31.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
