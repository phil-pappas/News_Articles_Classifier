Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -3.28% and earnings by 399.24% compared to the immediate last quarter. Earnings Growth Analysis \nThe company’s gross margins showed no year-on-year improvement. In spite of this, the company’s earnings rose, influenced primarily by the improvement in operating margins (EBITDA margins) from 3.57% to 29.11%. For comparison, gross margins were 58.73% and EBITDA margins were 13.01% in the last period. Gross Margin Trend \nCompanies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet. \nRENT-US ‘s decline in gross margins has not produced any significant offsetting improvement in its working capital . This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the decline in gross margins are likely from operating issues and not trade-offs with the balance sheet. Working capital days are currently 256.63 days, compared to last year’s level of 88.07 days. Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance? \nRENT-US ‘s change in operating cash flow of -402.81% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period. Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group. This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable. Margins \nThe company’s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from -3.84% to 20.69% and (2) one-time items. The company’s pretax margins are now 7.80% compared to -5.99% for the same period last year. \nAccess our Ratings and Scores for Rentrak Corp.
