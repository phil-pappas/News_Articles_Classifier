PUBLISHED: 11:04, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:17, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 PA Wire Homes earned five times more than workersin August \nProperty values increased by a whopping 9 per cent in the year to August to making homes in the UK worth an average £204,674, according to figures released today from Halifax. Prices jumped 2.7 per cent in August alone, adding £5,791 to the typical property value, dwarfing the British worker's average monthly take-home pay of £1,695.House price to earnings ratio is now at a seven-and-a-half year high of 5.34, according to the lender's calculations. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: \"The underlying pace of house price growth is strong. The shortage of secondhand properties for sale on the market is resulting in upward pressure on house prices. \"At the same time, economic recovery, real earnings growth and very low mortgage rates are supporting housing demand. \"Strengthening demand and highly constrained supply are likely to mean that house price growth continues to be robust in the short-term.\" Related articles Property boom will see prices rise by a third \nValues are surging thanks to a chronic lack of supply and continued economic recovery.The amount of homes available for sale fell to another new record low, according to the most recent data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). At the same time, the number of monthly mortgage approvals increased by 3 per cent to reach the highest level since February 2014. Critics are now revising up forecasts for house price growth this year, but think earnings will eventually put the brakes on rises. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"A limited stock of properties for sale is clearly exerting upward pressure on house prices.\"Nevertheless, the upside for housing market activity and prices is expected to be constrained by more stretched house prices to earnings ratios, tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders and the likelihood that interest rates will soon start rising gradually.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:59:54.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
