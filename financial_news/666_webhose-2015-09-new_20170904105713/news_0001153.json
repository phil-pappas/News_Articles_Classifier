Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler has blamed distressed-debt trading, which isnâ€™t part of the group Brennan and Sullivan will run, the person said. On Thursday, the investment bank owned by Leucadia National Corp. said it lost $18.2 million in fixed-income trading in the three months ended Aug. 31, compared with $195 million in revenue a year earlier.\nBrennan left Credit Suisse in March. He worked there since 2000 when the Zurich-based lender acquired investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette, where he was a vice president in the leveraged-finance group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:14:46.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
