Countries find it’s much more difficult for labor and capital to move from resources to other parts of the economy than it was for them to move toward resources in the first place—and that a significant amount of exchange rate depreciation is needed before non-commodity segments of the economy are competitive once again. It’s like trying to build up a muscle that has long been dormant.\nCertainly, these four nations have experienced substantial declines in the value of their respective currencies vs. the U.S. dollar over the past year:\nBloomberg “In an environment of falling export prices and slowing demand for commodities, the severity of an economy’s Dutch Disease likely will determine the extent of currency depreciation needed to balance the economy,” wrote the Barclays team. “In extreme cases, where new investment is required to expand the non-commodity export sector, both international and domestic investors likely will want to see a significantly lower exchange rate to offset the fixed costs of committing new capital.”\nThe Barclays analysts attempt to find out which nations afflicted by Dutch Disease will shake it off and regain strength in non-commodity segments the fastest.\nBut first, Barclays has to prove that these economies actually suffered from “Netherlands Nausea,” as Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter once quipped .\nIt’s not enough for manufacturing to have declined, as this development was commonplace throughout advanced economies. Statistical analyses performed by Barclays indicate that not only did the manufacturing sectors in Australia, Canada, Norway, and New Zealand fare worse than those of their developed peers during this period, but there are also causal links among the rise in commodity prices, exchange rate appreciation, and poor performance of manufacturing from 2000 to 2012.\nAccording to Barclays’s team, Canada’s manufacturing sector is the most adversely affected by the appreciation of the currency out to five years, followed by New Zealand, Australia, and a relatively unscathed Norway:\nBarclays The analysts posit that “Norway’s Government Pension Fund likely insulated the country from Dutch Disease,” mitigating the effect of rises in the price of crude by using revenue generated by oil to purchase foreign assets.\nBut although Canada’s manufacturing sector is the one that appears to take the hardest hit during periods when the loonie is overvalued, it doesn’t require much more exchange rate depreciation to boost the manufacturing sector, thanks to other mitigating factors.\n“Norway’s positive international asset position reduces the need for Norwegian krone depreciation, while a low debt burden and relatively flexible labor markets benefit the Canadian dollar,” the analysts wrote. “Conversely, the New Zealand kiwi and Australian dollar are most vulnerable, suffering from very large net debt servicing burdens that more than offset labor market flexibility.”\nAs such, Barclays recommends shorting the New Zealand kiwi and Aussie dollar relative to the U.S. greenback, or, for the more risk-averse, going long the Canadian dollar vs. its Antipodean peers.", "external_links": ["http://www.bmonesbittburns.com/economics/amcharts/aug2014.pdf\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iyVVV6JZ2q0U/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i7hoLH2hkDrg/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-09-22T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:24:02.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
