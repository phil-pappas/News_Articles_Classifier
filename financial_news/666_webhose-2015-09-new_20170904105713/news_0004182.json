Dr Lowe said there were three elements to the economy's flexibility - the exchange rate, the labour market and monetary policy - and each was helping the economy's transition away from the mining investment boom. \"The missing ingredient continues to be a lift in non-mining business investment, where we are still waiting for convincing signs of a pick-up,\" he said. And, although the economy's flexibility would foster a rise in non-mining business investment, there were limits to what a low exchange rate, slow wages growth and low interest rates could do. So it was important to focus on improving the climate for business investment, he said. \"There is no magic bullet here, but surely the investment climate would be improved through a strong focus by both business and government on innovation, productivity, human capital and entrepreneurship, topics that I have spoken about on previous occasions.\" ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0&title=RBA%27s+Lowe+urges+confidence+in+economy", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0&title=RBA%27s+Lowe+urges+confidence+in+economy", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0&h=RBA%27s+Lowe+urges+confidence+in+economy", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=RBA%27s+Lowe+urges+confidence+in+economy&c=RBA+deputy+governor+Philip+Lowe+urged+Australians+to+be+confident+in+their+economy%27s+ability+to+cope+with+shocks.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/rbas-lowe-urges-confidence-in-economy/story-e6frfkur-1227519480043?sv=82669ca496b8eba9d42b018b813040e0"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:23:15.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
