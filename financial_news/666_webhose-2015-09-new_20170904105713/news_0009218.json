RTI activist Anil Galgali had filed the application seeking information about number of cases in the Lokayukta office. According to the information he received, during 2 July 2014 and 21 August 2015, when there was no Lokayukta appointed, the Office received 7,243 new cases. Maximum number of cases (1,386) was registered against the Revenues and Forest Department, while there is not a single case against the Parliamentary Affairs Department.    According to the information, there are cases registered against two ministers as well.    Condemning the delay in appointing the Lokayukta by the state government, Galgali said, \"The lethargy of the Government in appointment of such sensitive and important position sends wrong message about the seriousness of the government in tackling corruption. In addition, ministers, bureaucrats and staff begin to feel that the position of Lokayukta is ineffective and insignificant.\"   On 24 August 2015, Justice ML Tahaliyani, who conducted the trial of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and sentenced to death Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, executed subsequently, took over as new Lokayukta in Maharashtra.
