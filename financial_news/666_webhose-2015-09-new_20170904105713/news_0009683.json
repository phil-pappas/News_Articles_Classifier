Anna Kucera \"While the rate of capital gains slowed last month, today's results are only one month worth of data,\" he said.\n\"Therefore, we should be cautious about interpreting this as a slowdown in the overall trend of value growth. In fact, the quarterly and annual trend of capital gain remains high in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\"The spring season will provide a timely litmus test for the housing market given it's a time when listing numbers normally increase materially.\n\"It will be important to monitor whether buyer demand keeps pace with the additional number of homes being advertised for sale.\"\n House price index Still strong Quarterly figures still show a very strong housing market. Combined city dwelling values are 5.3 per cent higher over the three months to the end of August.\nDwelling values across Melbourne were 8.0 per cent higher over the rolling quarter, and Sydney values were up 7.4 per cent. The third highest growth rate over the three-month period was in Brisbane, which showed an increase in values of 2.2 per cent.\nThe increase in housing values means yields continue to compress and with rental demand lower, renters emerge winners in this market.\nMelbourne property prices stalled in August but have grown 10.6 per cent over the year. Luis Ascui \"Every investor is bringing in an extra unit and therefore you won't see the 50 people rush to units on Saturday morning inspections,\" Mr Lawless said.\nGood for renters \"It's good news for renters.\"\nA typical dwelling attracts a gross yield of 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne respectively.\nMr Lawless said investors chased future capital gains rather than cash flow.\nSydney dwelling values are still at all time highs at growing 17.6 per cent in the last 12 months.\nMelbourne has grown 10.6 per cent. Corelogic RP Data said the typical Sydney home owner has seen the value of their home increase by approximately $309,000 since 2009.\nSpring will bring a rush of stock with listing numbers 5.5 per cent higher than the same time last year across the capital cities, led by a 16 per cent lift in newly advertised properties in Sydney and a 10 per cent lift in Melbourne.\nAccording to Mr Lawless, this shows the spring listing trend is already accelerating as vendors take advantage of strong selling conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:27:24.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
