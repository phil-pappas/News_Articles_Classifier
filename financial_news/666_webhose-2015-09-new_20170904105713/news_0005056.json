Our product is very good and we have hit a sweet spot on price and quality.”\nMr Gray and brother Paul are the custodians of the third-generation furniture business founded by their great uncle Reginald Muir. It moved around the inner city before relocating to Thomastown in 1965.\n“During the war they were instructed to build coffins,” Mr Gray said.\nAt one time, Remac operated in tandem with a steelworks business called Eagle Tubular Furniture.\nThe now closed steelworks supplied the tubular steel used in the manufacturing of Laminex tables and chairs, which were popular from the 1950s.\n“I think every second beach house in Rye probably still has one of those dining sets,” said Mr Gray of the furniture that is now sought out by retro hunters and hipster cafes.\nMr Gray said their electrician father, George, was talked into joining the company in the early 1950s.\nThe business has always wholesaled its products.\nIn the past, it was to household names such as Patersons and Maples. These days, its main stockists include Snooze, Forty Winks, Domayne and independent retailers.\nThe business was buoyant right up to the 1980s but started to struggle as backyard operators, working in their homes with no overheads, were able to undercut it on office and home furniture.\n“We found the only margin between them and us was the cost of the material. They were working for nearly nothing,” Mr Gray said.\n“We were employing between 50 and 60 people, turning over heaps of stuff, but not making any money.”\nMr Gray said they decided to relaunch back into the domestic furniture market with a designer product.\n“I wasn’t a designer. It just evolved. It was quite a learning curve and it wasn’t always smooth sailing,” he said.\nHe said one bed design was met with horror by a potential retailer.\n“He looked at it and said. ‘My God, what have you been smoking?’,” Mr Gray said.\nIn his defence, Mr Gray said the bed was modern, with clean lines and could stand up well, even today.\n“It was a good seller but was cutting-edge at the time.”\nHe said there was currently an appetite for Australian-made goods.\n“I think there is a very strong turn back to Australian-made by customers and retailers who realise we have something to offer.\n“We have flexibility. We can give choice of colour and finishes.\n“We can react quickly to what people want and we can do short runs.\n“All of a sudden, people have worked out that local manufacturing has benefits.”\nTomorrow is Family Business Day.\nGoing for Growth is a Herald Sun series, presented in partnership with NAB, championing Australian business success stories\nOriginally published as Family’s eagle eye for quality", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/familys-eagle-eye-for-quality/story-fni0dcne-1227530861704"], "published": "2015-09-17T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:36:10.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
