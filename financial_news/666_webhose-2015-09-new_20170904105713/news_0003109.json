The index rose for the third straight day. \nThe index broke out of a recent 60-point range to hit its highest level for three weeks, and is now up 10.5 percent since its lowest level of the year, hit on Aug. 24. \nMarkets were put under pressure in August by concerns over China's growth, and the recent rally has come after Chinese authorities increased support and regulation of stock trading. \nWhile the moves have brought stability to prices, equities and futures are trading so thinly that they are in danger of flat lining. \nDespite this, calm over China helped to support commodity prices, with mining and resource related stocks rallying 3.5 percent, making them the top sectoral gainers. \nOne of only two stocks in negative territory on the FTSEurofirst 300 was GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) \nThe pharmaceutical firm fell 1.2 percent after GSK and its partner Theravance Inc (NasdaqGS: THRX - news ) said their inhaled medicine Breo failed to prolong the lives of patients with chronic respiratory disease in a high-stakes clinical trial of 16,500 people. \nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) left its estimates for GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) unchanged after the test results but said the failure was an \"unexpected disappointment\". \n\"From a purely financial perspective (especially relative to consensus) we see this as only a marginal disappointment ... (however) it raises deeper questions around GSK's overall R&D strategy and spend,\" Goldman analysts said in a note. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Louise Ireland)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T11:39:15.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
