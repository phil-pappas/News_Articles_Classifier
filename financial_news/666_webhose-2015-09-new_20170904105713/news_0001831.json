Woolworths, which also owns liquor business Dan Murphy's and hardware chain Masters, suffered from a fall in supermarket sales, while Big W was still a drag on revenue despite big spending on its transformation. The retailer has also made major changes to its executive team, most recently with the departure of chairman Ralph Waters as a direct consequence of the company's disappointing performance. Mr O'Brien, who in June announced he would leave Woolworths once a replacement could be found, also received $1.4 million in shares in 2014/15, which were awarded as deferred bonuses in previous years. His annual pay was down from $5.3 million in 2013/14, when he enjoyed a cash bonus of just over $2 million. New chairman Gordon Cairns wrote in the company's annual report to shareholders that a range of internal and external CEO candidates have been identified.
