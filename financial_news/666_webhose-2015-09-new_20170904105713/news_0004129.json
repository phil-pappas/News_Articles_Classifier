On Friday alone, the Dow slipped 530 points or 3.1%, its biggest one day loss since 2011. The S&P fell 64 points or 3.2% and taking the index negative for 2015.\"Stocks sold off with conviction,\" said Grace Hallawell, Global Equity markets strategist at Garrett Knight. \"When we see volume of this magnitude, we know that there's typically more to come,\" she added.The global growth story continues to inflict heavy casualties on equity markets around the world as China, hitherto considered the primary engine of global growth, shows more signs that its economy may be suffering the hard landing that some economists have been predicting for several years. \"We've urged our clients to avoid trying to 'catch a falling knife' by picking a bottom in prices because stock market corrections have as much of a tendency to overshoot to the downside as they do going in the opposite direction. There's more selling to come so the stocks they're after could be even cheaper by next week,\" added Hallawell. Garrett Knight, which has spent much of the last 3 months warning clients against buying into what it deemed to be overpriced US equity market, says it cannot rule out a correction that takes the DJIA into bear market territory which is effectively 20% lower than its peak.\"With China's slowdown and trepidation over the timing of a US rate hike, investors have quite a lot to worry about,\" concluded Hallawell.
