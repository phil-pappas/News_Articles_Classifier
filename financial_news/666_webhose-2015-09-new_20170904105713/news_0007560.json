In this part of the series, we will look at the way forward for the company in fiscal 2016 and beyond. \nThe company announced its earnings for fiscal 2015 on August 5, 2015. During its earnings call, the company also announced a $5 billion share buyback that it intends to undertake until next June. As the chart below indicates, the company’s stock price has tumbled by ~16% in the past month and fell by ~6% the day following the announcement of fiscal 2015 results. Fiscal 2016 outlook \n21st Century Fox’s primary sources of revenue are affiliate fees, advertising, and content licensing revenue. As over-the-top, or OTT, services such as Netflix (NFLX) become increasingly popular, the company intends to balance its distribution between pay-TV services and OTT services. It expects to bring in more affiliate fees in the future by strengthening its key brands in the Cable Network Programming segment. \n21st Century Fox has enjoyed great success with its direct-to-consumer offerings in Europe (EFA) and India through Sky (SKYAY) and hotstar, respectively. The company also jointly owns Hulu, an OTT offering, along with The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and NBCUniversal (CMCSA). \nHowever, the company has stated that it has no plans as of now to offer a stand-alone direct-to-consumer service similar to Time Warner’s (TWX) HBO Now. This is because the company currently has flexibility on how it prices its content-licensing deals for other direct-to-consumer or OTT operators. Advertising revenues \nRegarding advertising revenues, 21st Century Fox foresees growth in digital advertising rather than in TV advertising. As more TV audiences move to OTT offerings such as Hulu, advertisers are also going digital to attract viewers. As a result, the company is looking to monetize this digital audience through better measurement of digital impressions and use of the trueX video advertising platform for better user engagement. \n21st Century Fox completed the acquisition of trueX in February 2015 for $200 million. A digital video advertising platform, trueX creates on-demand marketing campaigns and ads that increase consumer engagement through an interactive format. \nInternationally, it views the STAR India (EPI) group of channels as a future growth engine for the company and expects it to contribute around $1 billion to the company’s profitability by 2020. \nYou can get diversified exposure to 21st Century Fox by investing in the iShares S&P 500 Index ETF (IVV), which maintains 0.28% of its holdings in the stock. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:52:03.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
