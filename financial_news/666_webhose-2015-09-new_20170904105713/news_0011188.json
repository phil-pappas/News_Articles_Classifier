Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth After Ramsay Health Care shares rose above $67 in late March, chief executive Chris Rex hit the sell button, crystallising a $100 million long-term pay windfall.\nWhile Mr Rex's share sales in March and April raised $14.8 million, he left another 747,000 shares worth $50 million on the table, with share rights worth another $40 million due to vest in the next two years.\nMr Rex's good fortune is charged by Ramsay's booming share price, but he isn't alone in the winner's circle.\nAustralia's 10 highest-paid CEOs collectively reaped $70 million more than their companies stated in their 2014 annual reports, thanks to long-term incentive schemes based on share prices, according to a survey by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. The survey found big discrepancies between what companies declare they pay their CEOs and what they receive.\nBased on statutory reporting, the top-10 chief executives received $99.6 million in 2014. But the survey found by measuring the value of shares, options and performance rights that vested, the 10 CEOs got $171.4 million in cash and equity.\nMr Rex's pay was the highest on this measure: Ramsay reported his statutory pay was $9.1 million. The value of vested shares and rights pushed the figure to $30.8 million.\nPeter and Steven Lowy at Westfield took second place, receiving $24.4 million on realised pay compared with reported pay of $22.1 million.\nLouis Gries of James Hardie was third, with realised pay of $20.8 million compared with reported pay of $12.6 million.\n Andrew Bassat at SEEKâœ“ showed the greatest discrepancy between the two figures, with reported pay of only $4.2 million, while realised pay was more than four times as much, at $17.9 million. Josh Robenstone Andrew Bassat at SEEK showed the greatest discrepancy between the two figures, with reported pay of only $4.2 million, while realised pay was more than four times as much, at $17.9 million.\nThe Council of Superannuation Investors' chief executive, Louise Davidson, said she had been surprised by the size of the discrepancy between reported and realised pay.\nInstitutions have been pressing boards to make a greater proportion of executive remuneration subject to performance hurdles.\n\"Often an argument put by boards who want to increase fixed salaries for executives is that CEOs don't value long-term incentives,\" Ms Davidson said. \"The survey shows that's a bit of a nonsense. This would have to demonstrate the value of long-term incentives.\"\nVeda Group reported that its CEO, Nerida Caesar, received $8.28 million in 2014, while her realised pay was only $2.83 million. Jessica Hromas Fixed pay for ASX100 chief executives fell 1.1 per cent, with the median pay at $1.81 million. But more cash bonuses were paid, and the median cash bonus was up 12 per cent to $1.07 million.\nMr Rex's road to riches grew out of a 2008 deal, struck when the shares were near a two-year low at $8.84, which granted him 600,000 shares if he remained with Ramsay until 2013.\nMr Rex's predecessor, Pat Grier, sold most of his shares in the next two years, missing most of the rise in the share price, which had reached $34.78 when Mr Rex's retention shares vested on July 1 2013.\nAnother 150,000 shares vested two months later, and 210,000 more last August, before the share price nearly doubled to top $68.50 by last March.\nNine's David Gyngell's reported pay of $19.59 million was higher than his realised pay of $18.03 million. Louie Douvis Under Rex's management RHC's net profit had jumped from $123 million in 2008 to $293 million in 2013 and $419 million in the 2015 year, making it one of the biggest price movers in the ASX100.\nLast Friday 220,000 additional shares vested for Rex, with two further tranches due to vest in the next two years, subject to performance hurdles.\nMr Rex has raised $36.5 million from share sales in the last two years.\nThe survey, conducted by governance group Ownership Matters, focuses on the value of shares at vesting dates and ignores subsequent moves in share price or share sales.\nThe average realised pay for ASX100 companies was $5.63 million, against the average of reported pay of $5.01 million.\nWhile the payouts showed most ASX100 CEOs received more in actual pay than reported pay, not all CEOs were winners.\nVeda Group reported that its CEO, Nerida Caesar, received $8.28 million in 2014, while her realised pay was only $2.83 million.\nThe discrepancy reflects the statutory value of the large equity allocation she received when Veda floated, at $1.25 a share. The share price touched $2.46 last month, before the general market drop took it down to $2.05 this week.\nPay packets for the ASX101-200 companies have been transformed with several resources companies dropping out, replaced by big-earning packages for new floats Nine Entertainment, Veda and OzForex.\nNine's David Gyngell's reported pay of $19.59 million was higher than his realised pay of $18.03 million.\nBut Gyngell's inclusion helped produce a 34 per cent rise in average pay for the ASX100-200 companies, which jumped from $1.75 million to $2.34 million.\nWhile the changes to the make-up of the ASX100-200 had the biggest affect, the media pay was up 8.2 per cent, reflecting greater wage pressures in this sector.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-09-02T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:11:47.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
