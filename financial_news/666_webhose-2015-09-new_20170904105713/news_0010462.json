Add.\n\nFY15 result below forecast \n\nAHZ posted a net loss of A26.8m which was higher than our forecast of a net loss of A19.5m. Product revenue of A9.9m was generated representing A7.3m from medical products and A2.6m from CardioCel®.\n\nThe main reasons for the difference were:\n\n1) A tax expense of A2.9m arising from the reversal of a prior period temporary difference;\n\n2) A loss from non-controlling interest of A1.5m;\n\n3) Lower revenue from medical products of A0.9m resulting from some product life cycle management and move to more consumable based operations;\n\n4) Lower interest receipts of A0.3m;\n\n5) A0.5m in higher share based payments; and\n\n6) 0.3m in higher amortisation charges.\n\nAHZ has A24.0m in cash reserves which we think is sufficient to drive sales in the key regenerative medicines division (CardioCel® is lead product).\n\nChanges to forecasts \n\nWe have made a number of changes to our forecasts moving FY16 to a net loss of A8.2m (from NPAT of A1.5m) and reducing our FY17 NPAT to A11.2m from A21.0m.\n\nThe main changes include:\n\n1) Lower medical products revenue to A7.8m (was A8.8m);\n\n2) Lower CardioCel® revenue to A7m (was A10m) reflecting a more moderate sales ramp than forecast; and\n\n3) An increase in the cost base to A23.3m (was A19.8m) to bring the base in line with FY15 reflecting a higher spend to build the regenerative medicines division and research spend on the vaccines project.\n\nInvestment view remains positive \n\nAs a result of changes to forecasts our DCF valuation has been revised to A0.18 (from A0.20).\n\nThe key catalysts we expect in the next six months include growing quarterly sales of CardioCel® and the interim results from the HSV-2 vaccine trial.\n\nThe downside risk includes failure of the vaccine trial to achieve its clinical outcomes of safety and lowering viral outbreaks.\n \nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:19:21.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
