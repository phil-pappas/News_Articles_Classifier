Photo: Justin McManus\nCFMEU to pay Grocon $3.5 million over blockade Australia's biggest construction union has agreed to pay more than $7 million as part of a massive settlement over its alleged \"black ban\" of concrete giant Boral in central Melbourne.\nWe have fought long and hard to get to the point where we can start to reclaim our position in the Melbourne CBD\nBoral CEO Mike Kane In one of the largest-ever industrial payouts, the powerful Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union will pay Boral between $7 million and $9 million in damages and legal costs, and will enter into a binding agreement that prohibits the union from interfering with Boral's business for a three-year period.\n\"We've improved Boral's cost base, strengthened the balance sheet and we are managing our portfolio of businesses more efficiently,\" says Boral CEO Mike Kane.
