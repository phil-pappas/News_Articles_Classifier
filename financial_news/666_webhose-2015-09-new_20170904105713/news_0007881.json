Lockheed Martin does not take protests lightly, but we are protesting to address our concerns regarding the evaluation of Lockheed Martin's offer.\" \nThe US Government Accountability Office, which acts as a referee in cases like this, now has 100 days -- until December 17 -- to review the protest and determine its validity. \nThe Humvee, praised for its speed and ubiquity, became an enduring symbol of American military power but ran into problems in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it was vulnerable to roadside bombs. \nAM General, which builds the Humvee, said it would not be protesting the JLTV contract decision. \n\"We believe a protest would ultimately result in a distraction from our current growth business areas, including meeting the significant current and future needs of our customers in the United States and around the globe,\" AM General said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:57:43.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
