A build in the inventories reflect softer demand. \nTraders' attention is also focused on a decision Thursday of the US Federal Reserve on the timing for an interest rate increase. \nSome analysts are expecting a rate hike to come this month while others are predicting it to happen in December. \n\"Opinion is really mixed,\" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore. \n\"We're seeing the market split on this. At the end of the day we will only know about the results later this week so there's a lot of speculation at the moment.\" \nInterest is keen in the oil market on a Fed decision because a raise in the benchmark federal funds rate from zero, where it has been pegged since 2008, could boost the greenback, making dollar-priced crude oil more expensive in other currencies and possibly weighing on demand and prices (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T15:21:55.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
