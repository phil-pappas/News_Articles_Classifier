Photo: Louise Kennerley\nEftpos is hoping its first attempt at online payments, due in October, will simultaneously allow it to offer contactless transactions and claw back the rampant growth of Visa and MasterCard via tap and go cards.\nThe 30-year-old local pioneer of electronic payments has been facing a steady decline into irrelevance as its bank and supermarket owners favour issuing and promoting chip-enabled credit cards and leave it with old magstripe cards.\nAs well as the rise of online, it has been hit by the massive take-up of contactless card payments in Australia, which are available in practice only via Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Around 70 per cent of transactions on Visa and MasterCard cards are done this way now.\nAnother factor is the lucrative rewards offered to consumers for using credit cards . Banks and big retailers like Woolies and Coles get paid more by the global card companies for issuing and encouraging the use of credit cards over eftpos – even though they also own eftpos, which has been a separate company since 2009.\nAdvertisement After the Reserve Bank forced the banks to back eftpos in 2007 in return for not cutting the credit card interchange fees that banks receive, eftpos has finally had a major overhaul in the past two years.\nThis includes replacing old bilateral connections between banks with a new real-time \"hub\" network – similar to the New Payments Platform being built by banks to update the existing retail payments network – as well as contactless and online payments.\n\"In October the hub will be upgraded to enable eftpos CHQ and SAV transactions in digital environments like online and mobile, making it possible for the industry to begin rolling out these products in coming months,\" eftpos chief Bruce Mansfield told Fairfax Media.\nOut of a total of 39 million cards in Australia, close to 5 million \"dual network\" Visa/MasterCard debit and eftpos cards have been issued in the past year that can also do tap and go eftpos payments. But these consumers cannot choose eftpos; all payments automatically go via the credit card networks.\nFrom the end of the year, however, the 15 million eftpos-only cards in circulation will begin to be replaced with tap and go chip cards.\nOnce eftpos transactions are done on mobile devices, people will also be able to choose between networks for tap and go payments.\nBut it will be up to retailers to offer the online payment option on their websites. Coles, ANZ Bank, ING Direct and Commonwealth Bank have been running trials of eftpos online and contactless transactions.\nEftpos' magstripe cards still carry most card transactions in Australia, however, despite a rapid decline in recent years.\nAccording to the latest figures available, in the year to June 30, 2014, eftpos carried 2.4 billion transactions worth $139 billion. In the two years to June 30 2014, eftpos' share of debit card payments fell from 80 per cent to 60 per cent, with Visa and MasterCard debit cards seizing the rest. Eftpos' share of all card payments fell by 10 percentage points to 40 per cent in the same period.\nThe eftpos board is discussing transaction totals for the 2014-15 financial year this week. It is understood its share has fallen further, although its decline of total card transactions has slowed.\nEftpos is hoping the Reserve Bank will give consumers an incentive to choose it over credit cards. The central bank is considering a ban on retailers surcharging for debit payments in its ongoing review of payments regulation .\nEftpos in the meantime is beginning to use its new network to get new sources of income. Two major banks are now moving all their ATM transactions to eftpos and it believes all ATM processing could end up on its hub.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/banking/cards-for-the-big-spender-20150810-givil8"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:34:52.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
