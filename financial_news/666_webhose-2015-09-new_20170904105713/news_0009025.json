Bloomberg by Lisa Murray Angus Grigg Chinese purchases of Australian property have dropped significantly in the past month, according to local property agents, as buyers struggle to shift money out of the country following Beijing's move to tighten capital controls.\nOne Chinese property agent, who focuses on the Australian market but asked not to be named, said the latest effort by the central government to avoid large capital outflows was having a \"significant impact\" on his business.\n\"It has affected 70 to 80 per cent of current transactions and some have already been suspended,\" he said.\nThe tighter foreign exchange rules are also expected to affect take-up of the Australian government's relaunched Significant Investor Visa (SIV), which provides fast-tracked residency for those investing at least $5 million into Australia.\n\"I think it will be big, big trouble for the SIV program because the amount of money is just too large,\" said one Shanghai-based adviser, who sells Australian property and advises wealthy clients on their migration plans.\nOnly seven SIV applications have been submitted since new rules were introduced on July 1, which require investors to put their money into riskier assets such as venture capital and emerging companies.\nChinese banks have been told to set up a watch list for unusual transactions, according to one bank manager, who also asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak about the policy.\nHe said the cooperation was aimed at cracking down on a practice whereby family and friends of the would-be overseas property purchaser all transfer US$50,000 into an overseas bank account. That's the limit each individual Chinese person is allowed to move out of the country per year. The purchaser then pays back his friends and family in China and uses the money from the overseas account to put down a deposit on the property.\n However, banks are now tracking the source of funds for overseas bank accounts that have received more than US$200,000 within 90 days, according to the bank manager, who works in Shanghai for one of the major state-owned banks.\n\"We have always had this policy but now it has been restated and is being enforced more strictly,\" he said.\n\"In the past we could find a way around these rules but now all those ways have been blocked.\"\n\"I'm sure this would be having an impact on overseas property purchases,\" he said.\nThe crackdown is not just affecting individual Chinese investors. Trading companies have also been asked to submit more supporting documents to verify their transactions, according to a report in China Business News on Monday.\nChina's move to tighten its capital controls comes amid concern about large capital outflows over the past year. The country's banks reported net capital outflows of US$109 billion in the first quarter of 2015, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\nThe People's Bank of China has also been spending its vast foreign exchange reserves to keep its currency stable after devaluing the yuan on August 11.\nThe devaluation, which came as a surprise, caused havoc on global markets because investors feared it signalled the economy was experiencing a sharper downturn than previously thought.\nOne Shanghai-based agent said the stricter environment around foreign exchange movements would most affect properties in Australia valued at over $1 million.\nHe said authorities were still allowing three to four people to each transfer US$50,000 into the same offshore bank account, but were halting transactions above this level.\nFor most people this is sufficient money to cover the 10 per cent deposit to secure an off-the-plan apartment, as the remainder does not have to be paid until completion.\n\"The government is cracking down on multiple transactions going into the same offshore account,\" he said.\n\"It has made buyers nervous.\"\nHe said buyers looking to buy a property in Australia above the $1 million mark would have trouble getting the funds offshore.\n\"But this being China people are now looking for a way around the problem,\" he said.\nThe agent said the largest impact would be felt by the federal government's SIV program, as this required at least $5 million to be transferred out of the country.\n\"It has always been a grey area and now the government is trying to send a warning.\"\nThe tighter rules in China come as auction clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne are already starting to fall. Sydney's clearance rate of 75.1 per cent was the lowest for the year while Melbourne has now recorded two weekends below the same time last year, according to Corelogic RP Data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:06:32.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
