The report posted Wednesday cited unnamed people.\nTwitter declined to comment. Its shares climbed nearly 3 percent in afternoon trading.\nIf Dorsey is anointed as Twitter's CEO, it would mark his second reign at the San Francisco company that he helped start in 2006. He was Twitter's original CEO until he was ousted in 2008 in a coup engineered by another company co-founder, Evan Williams.\nAlthough Twitter is among the world's best known technology companies, it still hasn't posted a profit and its user growth has been slowing.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:34:44.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
