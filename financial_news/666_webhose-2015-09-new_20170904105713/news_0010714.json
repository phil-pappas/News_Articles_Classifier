This parade is reminding us that China today is a maritime power not just a land power.\"\nIn a further sign of China's more assertive military posture, its warships were seen off the coast of Alaska for the first time on Wednesday, according to the US navy.\nThe sightings coincided with President Barack Obama touring the state and come ahead of Mr Xi paying an official visit to Washington this month.\nThe parade, which featured 12,000 high-stepping troops and 500 tanks, has unsettled China's neighbours even though Beijing insisted it was \"promoting peace\".\n Chinese soldiers stand at attention in Tiananmen Square before a military parade.

Getty Images The existence of the \"carrier killer\" has been the subject of much speculation over the years, as the missile has the potential to reshape the strategic balance in the Western Pacific.\nIt is estimated to have a range of 900 to 1500 kilometres and could neutralise the US's naval advantage, which is built on the strength of its carrier groups that have allowed Washington to project power far from its shores.\nThe parade was attended by 30 world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korea's Park Geun-hye.\nAustralia was represented by the Minister for Veterans Affairs Michael Ronaldson.\nNearly 1000 foreign troops from 17 countries took part in the parade including those from Russia, Pakistan and Cuba.\nThey witnessed Mr Xi drive along Beijing's main avenue in an open-top car reviewing the troops, while shouting \"good morning comrades\" and \"hard working comrades\".\nIn a brief speech before the parade, Mr Xi announced the troop cut of 300,000 for the People's Liberation Army.\nIt is the fourth cut in 35 years and follows reductions of one million troops in 1987 and a cut of half this amount a decade later.\nAccording to Xinhua, the PLA has 2.3 million members. \"The number will be reduced but the strength might be enhanced,\" said Yang Zhaohui, a political scientist at Peking University.\nMr Yang said most of the cuts would be to so called \"ceremonial soldiers\" rather than combat forces.\nMr White believes the Beijing parade is a further sign of China challenging US dominance in the region.\nIn a landmark essay five years ago, Mr White said Australia would one day have to choose between its strategic alliance with the US and its trading relationship with China.\n\"The more overt the rivalry between China and the US, the harder it is for Australian governments to continue walking both sides of the street,\" he said.\n\"There will be more pressure on Australia to side with Washington against China and pressure from China to remain neutral.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:08:45.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
