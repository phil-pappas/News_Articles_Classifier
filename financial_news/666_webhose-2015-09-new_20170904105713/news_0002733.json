This is part of a new approach by the U.S. Army to align the current LOGCAP IV contractors with the six Department of Defense Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC) that are responsible for effective command and control of U.S. military forces in peace and war. \nAs one of three contractors selected to work on the LOGCAP IV indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract, Fluor will support future requirements for LOGCAP services in the AFRICOM and SOUTHCOM areas of responsibility. As a result of today’s announcement, Fluor will assign a LOGCAP planner to the AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, and the SOUTHCOM headquarters in Miami, Fla. These planners will provide information and assist with the integration of LOGCAP services by leveraging the expertise of LOGCAP contractors in multifunctional logistics support. This will ensure the highest quality in the delivery of LOGCAP services for the respective Combatant Commands. \n“From the work we do through our commercial Energy & Chemicals and Mining business lines to our work serving the U.S. Government, Fluor has extensive experience in Africa and the Americas,” said Bruce Stanski, president of Fluor’s Government Group. “Regionally aligning LOGCAP IV will provide an improved rapid response capability for contingency operations and increase mission efficiencies. We look forward to planning alongside AFRICOM and SOUTHCOM to meet their logistics and life support services requirements.” \nEstablished by the U.S. Army to fulfill the Department of Defense's global mission during contingency events, LOGCAP provides the military with additional capabilities to support the logistics requirements of its deployed forces rapidly through use of civilian contractors. \nFluor provides the U.S. Government logistics and life support services in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, Jordan and the Philippines; military construction around the world; disaster relief and recovery services throughout the United States; and nuclear decommissioning and operations at government-owned sites. \nAbout Fluor Corporation \nFluor Corporation ( FLR ) is a global engineering and construction firm that designs and builds some of the world's most complex projects.
