Total group sales were 11 per cent stronger for the same period.\nCiti analyst Craig Woolford said it was positive to see the improved sales momentum in the first few weeks of the new financial year but he said the low Australian dollar would be a challenge in the year ahead.\n\"Oroton Group has dealt with a number of challenges over the past 18 months and is improving the price positioning of its Oroton brand however, the headwinds from the lower currency rates will continue to impact profitability,\" Mr Woolford said.\n Chief executive Mark Newman said the early sales results were encouraging but it was too early to build any forecasts on them, despite this the business is expected to return to profitable growth in 2016.\nHe said the decision to end heavy discounting and increase prices had helped the brand but hurt sales in what was a challenging year.\nThe lower dollar also put pressure on gross margins, which fell by 150 basis points and group net margin declined by 180 basis points as a result of higher purchasing costs.\nOroton claims to be well positioned to ride out the lower dollar for at least the next two years, with hedging in place to cover 85 per cent of US dollar transactions for the next 24 months.\nThe fashion group's break-up with American retailer Brooks Brothers put an end to the losses stemming from this two-year tie-up.\nIn 2014-15 the Brooks Brothers losses reached $1.8 million but this was partially offset by a $1.65 million gain on exiting the agreement.\nThe GAP network doubled in size in fiscal 2015 after Oroton opened three new stores in Sydney, which powered an 81 per cent uplift in sales.\nThe three established stores were marginally positive in the same period, with sales growth of 0.2 per cent.\nA new 'international' fitout concept has been rolled out across about 30 per cent of the Oroton branded store network of to ensure the brand is taking the fight up to international competitors such as Coach and Michael Kors.\nBy the end of fiscal 2016, at least half the stores will be refurbished and Oroton said the new concept was already driving stronger sales.\nMr Newman said Oroton was keen to expand its international network after opening six new stores in Asia in 2014-15 but but he said the group would do this through partnerships and share the burden of the set-up costs.\nOroton shut down its disappointing Hong Kong and Malaysia stores in the same period and closed its Singaporean regional office.\nOroton declared a full franked final dividend of 2¢ a share and a full year fully franked dividend of 6.5¢ a share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:05:13.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
