However, foreign holdings of Mexican peso bonds have held around record highs while inflation has fallen to an all-time low.\nThe central bank's statement was largely similar to July's statement, but specified that policymakers were watching the \"pass through from the exchange rate\" rather than the \"behavior of the exchange rate\" mentioned in July.\n\"It's slightly more dovish,\" said Pedro Tuesta, an economist at 4cast, saying he expects Banco de Mexico to follow the Fed with any rate hike.\nThe peso weakened to a session low after the statement and yields on Mexican interest rate swaps fell. Some market players were betting on a hike Monday, traders said.
