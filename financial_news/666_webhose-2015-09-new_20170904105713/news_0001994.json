Net debt is also continuing to rise. \n\"We now expect the general government deficit to rise to an average of 8pc of GDP in 2015 and 2016 before declining to 5.9pc in 2017, versus 6.1pc in 2014,\" S&P said. \n\"We expect general government debt, net of liquid assets (not including international reserves), to rise to 53pc of GDP this year and to 59pc next year from 47pc in 2014.\" \nThe faster-than-anticipated downgrade, which will likely rock Brazilian financial markets on Thursday, is also a major setback for finance minister Joaquim Levy's measures to shore up public finances. \nLast month Mr Levy, who has tried to steer Brazil to health with austerity measures, presented the country's first ever deficit budget for 2016 and he is now under pressure to raise taxes. \nThe government also announced in August that the economy was officially in recession and that the contraction could extend through 2016, becoming the longest recession since 1931. \nThe outlook on the new rating remains negative, which means additional downgrades are possible in the near term. \n\"The negative outlook reflects what we believe is a greater than one-in-three likelihood of a further downgrade due to a further deterioration of Brazil's fiscal position, potential key policy reversals given the fluid political dynamics, including a further lack of cohesion within the president's cabinet, or due to greater economic turmoil than we currently expect,\" S&P said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:45:44.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
