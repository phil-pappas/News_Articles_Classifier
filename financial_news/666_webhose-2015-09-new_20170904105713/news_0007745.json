Their health and their well-being are most important to me.\" \nThe food voucher system helps to return a sense of normality to the lives of the refugees. Alongside the distribution, WFP and UNHCR organized a 'food fair' with the traders selected for the project. During the fair, refugees went from one booth to another, purchasing the items that they wanted for their families with their vouchers: ranging from cassava, rice, beans, and peanuts, to meat, fish, tomato paste, powdered milk, oil, and sugar. Each individual receives a voucher which is worth 5,000 XAF. A family of four, for example, receives four coupons for a total of 20,000 XAF. \n\"Delivering food to Zemio poses enormous logistical challenges because of the poor road conditions between Bambari and Zemio. This new way of providing food assistance - the vouchers - gives refugees the opportunity to choose the types of food and quantities they want, boosts the local economy and removes the challenges associated with transporting food,\" said Bienvenu Djossa, WFP Country Director in C.A.R. \nThirteen food traders in Zemio were identified to be part of the initiative following a WFP evaluation, which looked at their potential capacities and market positioning. These traders also received trainings on the new initiative. \nDue to the insecurity in the area, products available in the markets are often limited. However, because traders can still source their products from surrounding communities as well as neighbouring countries - Sudan and Uganda - refugees can satisfy their dietary preferences. \n\"Following months of interruption due to insecurity and logistical challenges, food assistance in Zemio resumes in the form of vouchers, along with the food fair. This will enable refugees to gain greater autonomy and create opportunities for exchange and meeting with members of the local community, strengthening local integration and living together\", said Jean-Bosco Ngomoni, head of the UNHCR office in Zemio. \nThe Congolese refugees had fled violence caused by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 2009 and sought refuge in Zemio. In 2010, the government of C.A.R. granted them pieces of land to encourage the development of agricultural activities. However, persistent LRA insecurity in the area hampers agricultural and gardening activities for refugees, and they are still unable to meet their basic food needs. \nLRA activities in the border area between the Democratic Republic of Congo and C.A.R. continue. New attacks in DRC have recently led some 80 Congolese people to flee to Rafai, 150 km from Zemio. \nUNHCR and its partners provide a multi-sectoral assistance to respond to the needs of Congolese refugees in Zemio by facilitating access to drinking water and providing health and education services. Special assistance is also provided to vulnerable people, including the elderly, orphans and separated children.
