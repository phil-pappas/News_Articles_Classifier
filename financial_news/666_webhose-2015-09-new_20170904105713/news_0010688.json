Share on twitter by James Frost A decision by Sydney University to reduce investments in companies it believes contribute to global warming, including big mining companies, has driven it to stocks that may hurt human health: alcohol, softdrink and tobacco producers.\nThe university's $1.4 billion portfolio, the largest of any educational body in Australia, has recently invested in British American Tobacco, one of the world's biggest cigarette companies, beer giant SAB Miller, and FEMSA, a big Mexican Coca-Cola and Powerade bottler.\nClose to $2 million in university funds were invested in the shares of British American Tobacco, SAB Miller and FEMSA during the first half of this year, according to its latest filings. A further $3.5 million remains invested in multinational brewers and spirits companies, including Diageo, the owner of Johnnie Walker.\nIn February the university said it would take a \"leadership position\" on carbon reduction. It plans to to reduce the carbon emissions of its share portfolio by 20 per cent over three years by directing its fund managers to sell companies that have high emissions. Sarah Watts, the university's head of operations, said the shift would \"protect Australia's heritage\".\nRoss Barker, managing director Australian Foundation Investment Company, which manages $6.8 billion on behalf of retail investors, questioned the logic behind the divestment argument. Wayne Taylor Divestment pressure was mounting\nThe strategy was spurred in part by the global fossil fuel \"divestment\" movement pressuring universities and other institutional investors to sell their shares in coal, gas and oil producers such as BHP Billiton and Santos.\nRoss Barker, the managing director Australian Foundation Investment Company, which manages $6.8 billion on behalf of retail investors, questioned the logic behind the divestment argument.\n\"We are watching the science and talking to the companies,\" he said. \"All these arguments have two sides. Some of the positions that people take such as that the economy will be fine without any investment of coal or fossil field, I'm not sure that's right. In fact the expert opinion is that it isn't right.\"\n AFIC does not invest in gaming stocks because of a view that the some people are harmed by the industry.\nSydney University's investment policy prevents it from investing in tobacco directly but permits it in the case of pooled investments. The investments were made by a new emerging-market fund manager appointed this year. Ms Watts said she was working with the manager to help build a \"shared understanding\" of the university's position on tobacco.\nThe university has hired asset management consulting firm Mercer to work with its investment managers on their environmental, social and governance policies.\nMore work to be done\nMs Watts said the university would provide a detailed update on the divestment of Australian companies in early 2016. \"We've looked at the 28 managers we use with Mercer and we are generally pleased by the approach but there is clearly more work to be done,\" she said.\nThe Australian National University triggered a national debate last year , and was criticised by the Abbott Government, for selling $16 million of shares in Australian companies such as Santos, Sandfire Resources and Oil Search because it regarded their activities as harmful.\nANU's decision was based in part on research by consulting firm CAER, which stands for Corporate Analysis, Enhanced Responsibility and which has links to the left-leaning Australia Institute. CAER later admitted that it had not spoken to some of the companies it evaluated for three years. Sandfire Resources sued CAER and settled out of court after it revised its report on the copper mining company.\nAdministered by a small internal team with advice from Mercer, Sydney University's $1.4 billion fund is the largest of its type in Australia. The second-largest is Melbourne University's $800m endowment, which has been run by Victorian Funds Management Corporation since 2002.\nCompanies such as Rio Tinto are among those who have been targeted by parts of the divestment movement. Rio Tinto managing director Phil Edmands said there were significant questions about the recommendations being made by asset consultants.\n\"We think that some of the information is simplistic and misinformed,\" he said. \"You've got to consider the energy mix going forward and any transitioning issues. You need to look at what's happening in global markets. The fact is that 400 million people in India will need coal to switch the lights on.\"\nIn an effort to fight back against the public campaign against it, the coal industry this week began showing ads describing coal as \"amazing\". The Future Fund said last week that it would not join the divestment movement .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jamesafrost"], "published": "2015-09-08T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:26:20.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
