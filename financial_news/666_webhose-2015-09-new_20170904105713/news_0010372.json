Some critics dismissed the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, as an expensive distraction from the airline’s core business. Others, however, thought that Delta CEO Richard Anderson might have found an innovative and creative way of reducing the airline’s $12 billion annual tab on jet fuel by producing its own.\nThe airline invested $420 million to become fully operational and to meet stringent environmental standards and enlisted Monroe Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary, to manage the operation.\nWith fuel prices significantly lower today, the question bubbles to the surface: Did Delta make a good investment or were the critics correct in their initial assessment of the acquisition?\nDelta declined to be interviewed for this article, but provided ample information on the present status of the refinery and its long-term value to the airline.\nIn 2012, the year the refinery was acquired and restarted, Delta paid one cent per gallon more, on average, for jet fuel than other airlines. In 2014, Delta paid “9 cents less per gallon” than the industry, “a cost advantage that totals about $350 million on an annual basis,” Delta’s Trebor Banstetter, GM-corporate communications said, adding that the refinery provides “80% of Delta’s domestic fuel needs” currently.\nThe refinery posted a $95 million profit on a standalone basis in 2014, the first profit in six-years, Delta said. For the first quarter of 2015, the refinery posted a profit of $86 million.\nToday, the refinery provides 80% of Delta’s domestic fuel needs, according to the airline.\nDelta should not be compared to a merchant refiner, which is focused on earning a profit from refining. Delta should be viewed as a large consumer of jet fuel with major interests in the Northeast.\nAt the Argus Americas Crude Summit 2015 in January, Graeme Burnett, chairman of Monroe Energy and SVP-fuel optimization for Delta, emphasized why Trainer is a sustainable business model.\n“If cracks [so-called crack spread] decline, and the refinery’s profitability is reduced, Delta benefits from the lower jet fuel price,” Burnett noted. “If cracks improve, the refinery’s profitability improves, and helps mitigate the increased jet fuel price.”\nCrack spreads are the difference between crude oil prices and wholesale petroleum products.\nViable Hedge\nBurnett and other Delta officials maintain that the Trainer acquisition is a viable hedge against high fuel prices, and ensures an adequate supply of jet fuel, particularly in the US Northeast. Six US Northeast refiners were closed between 2009 and 2012 because of margin pressures, Delta said. The carrier operates hubs at New York’s LaGuardia and JFK airports in the New York region, along with major operations in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Boston.\nThe Trainer refinery helps reduce the pressure on refining margins, the crack spread in this busy region, Banstetter said.\nMixed Reviews\nAs before, analysts’ views today toward the Trainer refinery remain mixed.\n“The refinery does not appear to be a huge distraction for Delta,” Jay Sorensen, president of airline consulting firm IdeaWorks, said. “It is a novel approach to having a steady supply of jet fuel.”\nOthers differ. “While it appears beneficial to Delta now, I doubt the refinery will be an effective investment overall,” George Hamlin, aviation analyst with Hamlin Transportation Consulting, said. The reasons for the acquisition—to counteract high jet fuel costs and vertical integration of services—no longer apply, Hamlin added.\nCarl Larry, director of business development, oil and gas, for consulting firm Frost & Sullivan believes the Trainer refinery has long-term potential, but the first year of ownership was a mess.\n“There were a lot of missteps in managing the refinery during first year,” said Larry. The decision to slow down the refinery because of Hurricane Sandy caused operational problems and the refinery had to be shut down for some time. Published reports said the refinery lost around $80 million during that first year.\nThe acquisition was also controversial within Delta upper management, with some executives reportedly believing that owning a refinery was a bad, revenue draining idea, No other airline owned a refinery. Why should Delta?\nHowever, views have changed over time. “Fast forward to the present and the refinery looks to be a very good investment,” Larry said. “Refining margins are up and demand for refined petroleum products is very high. We haven’t seen jet fuel demand this high since 2006.”\nThe US has the capacity to refine roughly 18 million barrels of oil per day, Larry added. At present, it is refining around 16 million barrels per day. As GDP improves, so will the demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, which bodes well for Delta and its refinery.\nOne economist sees Delta owning a refinery from a different perspective, comparing available opportunity costs with accounting costs. In this instance, the accounting costs don’t capture the opportunity costs—the missed opportunity of selling the fuel to other airlines and airports, for example.\n“I don’t think Delta owning a refinery is a hedge against higher fuel prices,” Richard Langlois, professor of economics at the University of Connecticut, said. “It is a hedge against the lack of available jet fuel.”\nOwning a refinery does not provide Delta with a special benefit “unless there are capacity constraints [on jet fuel availability]. Then it’s a wash,” Langlois said.\nBut as to the Trainer facility’s long-term value, “I wouldn’t be startled to learn someday that Delta was selling its refinery,” Langlois said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:41:55.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
