He denied allegations that the salary deal that teachers struck with the government in 1997 had not been paid in full. \"This amount has been settled,\" he said. \nThe public service -- which has about 680,000 workers -- constitutes 1.5 per cent of the entire population but consumed 52 per of all taxes collected in the last year. \nThe President said public sector wages consumed Sh568 billion of the Sh1.1 trillion collected as taxes. \nIf teachers are paid the 50 to 60 per cent raise as ordered by the Court of Appeal, the wage bill would rise from 52 per cent to 61 per cent of all revenue collected, the President said. \nAccording to him, teachers in public schools earn higher salaries compared with their counterparts in private schools yet, private schools perform better. He also said that teachers were paid the same as other public servants in the same job groups. \nThe salary of a P1 teacher, the lowest-paid, had risen from Sh7,762 in 1997 to Sh23,692 currently. For the highest-paid teacher, the salary rose from Sh35,886 in 1997 to Sh140,089 this year, he said. \nFifty-five per cent of teachers are in jobs J-N and they earn between Sh35,000 to Sh75,000 per month, he added. \nTeachers' salaries are also higher than those of their counterparts in the region. Kenyan teachers earn seven times more than their counterparts in Burundi. In Uganda, the President said, the lowest-earning teacher gets Sh7,600, while in Tanzania, a teacher at the same level earns Sh15,800. \nThis story was first published on Nation.
