The 4th annual GRC Innovation Awards recognize technology innovations and user experience in Governance, Risk Management and Compliance programs and processes.

In achieving maturity, GRC is part of the organization’s strategy and operations and supported by a range of technology, knowledge and services - enabling the organization to achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness, and agility in GRC processes and broader business operations.”\n“ControlPanelGRC is honored to be recognized for this innovation. The Dynamic Security functionality automates routine access control tasks based on changes in HR master data. This means that customers no longer need to manually reconcile HR driven access while ensuring that employees and managers have proper authority based on their role in the organization. This reduces hours of manual processes by automatically provisioning changes to user access based on organizational changes while achieving a continuous state of audit readiness,” states Scott Goolik, Chief Technology Officer. “We are very proud of the new Dynamic Security functionality within ControlPanelGRC, it truly is a unique innovation. Our customers have already reaped the benefits. After month one of implementation, one customer reported that it eliminated 200 hours of manual processing and identified a significant number of user access inconsistencies.”\nThe world of automated controls has been largely focused on the financial side of ERP. Very little attention has been given to HR management systems. This is an issue as HR systems house critical and sensitive data that is governed by privacy laws around the world. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of HR data is critical to organizations. ControlPanelGRC has demonstrated innovation by automating two critical HR processes that before were completed manually. Access Controls Suite’s HR Analyzer with Dynamic Security maps critical HR data to security by automatically tracking and removing sensitive access when job changes occur within the organization as well as provides reconciliation when tied to certain job changes. In a large organizations this process was once executed by several employees that can be completed automated by ControlPanelGRC’s Dynamic Security with HR Analyzer module.\nAbout ControlPanelGRC\nControlPanelGRC® is a Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) and Continuous Controls Monitoring (CCM) platform for SAP environments.
