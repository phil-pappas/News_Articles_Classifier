The jobs that remain in Western Europe and the United States may be fewer in number, but are more demanding and complex. However, there is an increasing evidence of India’s growing stature and presence in the high-end value chain, where cost advantages may not be the only drivers of future growth,” Kumar added.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, when it comes to countries that pay out the best IT salaries, Switzerland again topped the list with an average annual remuneration of $1,71,465. The same job if taken in Belgium, second on the list, would fetch $1,52,430, the survey said.\nDenmark came in at third on the best-paying list, with salary in the IT sector averaging at $1,38,920. The US and the UK were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, with average packages of $1,32,877 and $1,29,324, respectively.\n“India remains one of the most favourite outsourcing destinations due to this low-cost factor, but the future might bring with itself a completely different scenario,” the survey predicted.\nThe survey compared the total annual cash compensation and total remuneration information of the mid-career level for IT staff at 9,413 companies across 40 different countries between August 1 to August 31, 2015.\n 21, 2015 1:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:16:07.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
