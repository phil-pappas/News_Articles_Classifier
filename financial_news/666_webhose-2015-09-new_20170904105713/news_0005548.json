The implementation of the third bailout programme in Greece, the economic impact of the refugee crisis, the completion of the banking union, and the financial turbulence seen in China, as well as in emerging markets, could all slow down its timid recovery.\nIn spite of these challenges, the 19 EU countries sharing the euro feel it is time to prepare some far-reaching changes for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).\nAccording to an EU official, there is “political appetite” among the capitals to start discussing how to deepen the EMU, as was reflected during the last meeting of EU finance ministers on 12 September.\nSome of these could include a treaty change. And the European Commission has seized this opportunity to start preparing long-term reforms.\nValdis Dombrovskis, the Commission Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said that the EU executive is setting up an expert group to draft a white paper on the second stage of EMU reform. These were first outlined in June in a report presented by the Presidents of the five institutions governing the single currency - the European Commission, Parliament and Council as well as the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank.\n>>Read: EU's 'Five Presidents' lay out eurozone vision, with timetable\nThe White Paper, a policy document led by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and will flesh out reforms for deepening the eurozone after 2017, by including a new stabilisation mechanism in the EMU.\nAn EU official told EurActiv that the executive was currently in the process of assessing the format and mandate of this expert group. Although details are still vague, the unnamed source expected that the group would include members not only from the European Commission, but also from other institutions and the member states.\nThe group should have completed its work by 2017, when the Commission expects to put forward a set of far-reaching changes for economic union. One of the priorities is to set up a fiscal cushion to absorb large macroeconomic shocks, in order to make the EMU more resilient.\nIn this context, one of the ideas championed by Juncker was to build a European unemployment insurance scheme. However, the report's final version pointed out that “the exact design of such euro area stabilisers requires more in-depth work”, which will be carried out by the experts.\nOnce the eurozone becomes a genuine monetary union, the report foresees that a treasury could be created to centralise the decision-making process, while increasing risk mutualisation.\nThe outcome of the struggle between the risk-sharing camp and the supporters of more centralised control over national economies will determine how the EMU evolves. In this regard, Dombrovskis stressed the “importance” of achieving the right balance for the “success” of the whole package.\nUpcoming changes\nIn parallel with this process, the executive is finalising its proposal to improve the functioning of the existing economic rulebook. This package, included in stage one of the Five Presidents' Report, will be announced in the second half of October. It will be comprised of a set of actions to strengthen the external representation of the euro, in particular, in the International Monetary Fund (IMF); to revamp the EU semester; and to review the fiscal and macroeconomic rules (the so-called 'two-pack’ and ‘six-pack’) in order to add a more social dimension.\nIt will also include a plan to set up a eurozone system of competitiveness authorities; an advisory European Fiscal Board, to coordinate the existing fiscal councils; and will set out the Commission's general view on its plan for an EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme.\n>>Read: Berlin and London play hardball in shaping vision for the EMU\nThe EU deposit guarantee scheme has become a “controversial” element, Dombrovskis admitted. Germany considers it “unacceptable” to start discussing this issue now, as member states have not completed the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Recovery (BRRD).\nDespite Berlin's opposition, Dombrovskis argued that an EU deposit guarantee scheme is an “important element missing in the banking union”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:46:17.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
