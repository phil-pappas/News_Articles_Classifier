However, the company was not broke and had cash reserves of R1 107bn. \nWhile this was lower than the R1.4bn the broadcaster had at the end of 2014, Matlala said the decline was also because some funds were invested in areas like content, employee benefits and converting contract workers to permanent employees. \nMatlala said despite this, there was \"good news to share\" about the last financial year. \nHe claimed the broadcaster had made remarkable progress although there was \"room for growth\". \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:40:17.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
