CBL disclosed last Thursday a multi-year, multi-property play area partnership with Fisher-Price, a subsidiary of Mattel, Inc. MAT.\n\nHowever, shares of CBL fell 1.15% during Fridayâ€™s regular trading session on the NYSE on broader market concerns.\n\nThis deal with the reputed infant and preschool toy manufacturers would help in designing soft play area attractions at chosen CBL centers on a national scale. These play areas would comprise a Toy Box filled with iconic brands like Thomas & Friends, Little People and many more, and PLAYTIME, LLC would help in creating interactive attractions for the malls.\n\nThe five-year partnership would begin with the opening of attractions for the 2015 holiday season at the West Towne Mall in Madison, WI; Asheville Mall in Asheville, NC; and Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, PA. Another three attractions are expected to be inaugurated in early 2016. Further, the partnership expects to come up with such sites in more than 18 malls over the next three years.\n\nCBL & Associates Properties, Inc. is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) engaged in owning and developing malls and shopping centers in the U.S. The company has stake in or manages 147 properties in 30 states. These properties include 90 regional malls/open-air centers. The company is headquartered in Chattanooga, TN.\n\nCBL currently has a Zacks Rank #3(Hold). Investors interested in REITs may consider stocks like Acadia Realty Trust AKR and Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. CDR. Both stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .
