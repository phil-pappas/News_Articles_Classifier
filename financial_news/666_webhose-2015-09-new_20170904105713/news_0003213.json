Seeing all organization’s employees in both the macro, enterprise context down to the micro, individual level allows managers to uniquely manage their organizational complexity. The integration equips an organization’s leaders with information they need to do evidence-based, data-driven adjustments, which stem from global market pressures on talent management, while maintaining organizational design agility.\nAccording to a Center for American Progress study, the cost to replace a worker, depending on their skill set, can range from 10%-30% of their salary, while the cost to replace executives and other niche roles can be as high as 213% of their salary. In total, voluntary attrition represents a $350 billion global problem that businesses must address strategically. At the same time companies spend more than $400 billion globally on staffing services , in an effort to attract and recruit top talent, with $124 billion of the global spend occurring in the U.S.\nSocial Media has enabled society to identify and apply for new opportunities nearly effortlessly, which presents both challenges and opportunities for talent acquisition and HR teams that are charged with retaining and recruiting top talent; voluntary employee turnover, time to hire, quality of hire, and cost per hire are typical key performance metrics. Joberate and Macromicro have developed an integrated toolset that allows organizations to capitalize on real-time talent analytics to affect a strategic shift towards data-driven talent management, marketing, and communications.\n“Joberate’s platform will perform analysis of job seeking activities of more than 1.8 billion people globally over the next three years, which represents nearly half of the world’s employable population that will have a unique J-Score,” said Michael Beygelman, CEO of Joberate . “Our technology demonstrates the power and the capability of leveraging social “big” data and machine learning, to provide real-time insights about observable job seeking behaviors of the global workforce; helping companies know more about their employee engagement, do a better job retaining their key people, and hire top talent quickly and cost-effectively.”\nThe Macromicro and Joberate API Integration represents an immediate competitive advantage for organizations that are considering moving towards a unified workforce analytics platform, as opposed to trying to self-manage a burgeoning stack of ad-hoc SaaS applications that fall short of expectations.\n“Macromicro is excited to bring unique perspectives of Joberate’s J-Score into OrgInsight,” said Brad Peterson, CEO of Macromicro. “This strategic partnership will allow human resources executives and line of business managers the self-service capability to quickly and easily sort, filter, and combine Joberate’s leading employment indicator [J-Score] with other historical employee attribute data. Our unique capability to show the patterns empower our clients to identify and better understand employee satisfaction and proactively address it.”\nFor additional information about Joberate and Macromicro technology platforms, please visit http://www.joberate.com and http://www.macromicro.com .\nAbout Joberate\nJoberate’s mission is to help society better understand job seeking behaviors of the global workforce, while organizations will leverage Joberate’s global platform to power a whole new generation of real-world business applications.
