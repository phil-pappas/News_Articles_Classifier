Analysts said traders digested the Fed's Sept. 17 policy statement and comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen regarding worries about the global economy, which in turn helped the safe-haven yen gain while riskier emerging market currencies fell.\nThe U.S. dollar was last up 1.17 percent against the Mexican peso at 16.86 pesos, and was up 1.2 percent against the Brazilian real at 4.03 reals.\n\"There's a lot of fear and there's a lot of positioning based on that fear right now,\" Leinwand said.\nECB President Mario Draghi will speak on Wednesday, while Fed Chair Yellen will speak on Thursday. Analysts said expectations that Draghi would hint at more stimulus kept the euro lower against the dollar.\n\"There are some concerns that he will elaborate on the dovish tone that came out of the last ECB meeting,\" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Ltd in New York.\nThe euro was last down 0.43 percent against the dollar at $1.11420. The dollar was last down 0.5 percent against the yen at 119.970 yen. The dollar was last up 0.12 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.97290 franc.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.36 percent at 96.224. That was just under a nearly two-week high of 96.259.\nAnalysts also cited weakness in stock markets as an indication of the low risk appetite that was fueling demand for the yen. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index was last down 1.37 percent.
