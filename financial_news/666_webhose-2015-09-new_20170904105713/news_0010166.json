The panelists will reportedly debate hot-button topics of the day.\nThe new program will be hosted by Nine's Today Show host Karl Stefanovic. Channel Nine Latham has been at the centre of ongoing controversy in recent weeks for remarks made in his Australian Financial Review column - particularly comments he made about transgender military official Catherine McGregor and domestic violence campaigner and Australian of the Year Rosie Batty.\nHe was then linked to a string of abusive tweets sent from the account @RealMarkLatham.\nLast month he resigned as a columnist for the Financial Review as well as his regular radio spots on Sydney's 2UE.\nDuring his public appearance at the Melbourne Writers Festival last month, variously described as shambles, abusive and \"a disappointment\" by organisers, the former politician declared he was \"seeking commercial opportunities\".\n As well as abusing host Jonathan Green, Latham swore at audience members and refused to confirm whether he was behind the Twitter account.\nLatham, who is represented by Sydney-based celebrity manager Max Markson, is bound to bring in viewers hoping for some \"train-wreck\"-style viewing, but it remains to be seen just how effective - and controversial - this will prove to be for Nine in the long run.\n▪ Latham brings bite to writers festival\n▪ AFR and Latham part company amid anti-women controversy", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/financial-review-and-mark-latham-part-company-amid-antiwomen-controversy-20150817-gj0lpi.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/mark-latham-brings-his-bite-to-melbourne-writers-festival-event-20150822-gj5azr.html"], "published": "2015-09-01T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:23:04.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
