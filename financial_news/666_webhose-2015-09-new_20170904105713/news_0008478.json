Overly complicated products confused, trapped and often destroyed people’s financial lives. Poor risk management allowed banks to collapse, bringing taxpayers along with them. Financial institutions became impossibly large and excessively focused on short term earnings. And bankers were able to collect big bonuses, even while their firms had to be rescued with public money. The aftermath of the financial crisis produced even larger companies. Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual became a part of JP Morgan. Wachovia became a part of [entity display=\"Wells Fargo\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"wells-fargo\" ticker=\"WFC\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4683\"]Wells Fargo[/entity]. The big banks became bigger. The paychecks of senior bankers remained intact. And the value offered to consumers remained poor.Silicon Valley venture capitalists like to solve big problems, and the inability of traditional banks to offer good value seemed like a very large problem that needed to be solved. The Silicon Valley response was marketplace lending. Companies like [entity display=\"Lending Club\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"lending-club\" natural_id=\"fred/company/91509\"]Lending Club[/entity], SoFi, Earnest and CommonBond are tackling the problems of expensive credit card debt, student loan debt, medical debt and mortgages. These companies have big ambitions, and every profitable corner of consumer banking will likely be under threat in the years to come.In many ways, the marketplace lenders are simply trying to be the opposite of big banks. The products offered by these new lenders are incredibly simple and transparent. Before the crisis, lenders became overly reliant on credit scores and forgot common sense. Marketplace lenders are leveraging new forms of technology and new variables, while focusing on old-fashioned cash flow and affordability metrics to improve risk management. As lean startups, marketplace lenders can avoid the bureaucracy of large financial institutions.The marketplace revolution began with one of the simplest financial products: a personal loan. Customers of Lending Club can use a simple, low cost personal loan to pay off the surprisingly complicated and expensive credit card. Lending Club borrowers see an average interest rate reduction of 32%. SoFi, Earnest and CommonBond are bringing dramatically lower interest rates to the student loan market. SoFi borrowers save an average of $14,000 when they refinance their debt.How do marketplace lenders do it? First, they have a dramatically lower cost base. Banks are riddled with legacy systems and traditional bricks and mortar infrastructure. The new marketplace lenders are building a low cost, digital and scalable infrastructure. Second, although marketplace lenders are regulated, they have avoided the most expensive regulator. Because marketplace lenders do not offer FDIC insured deposits, they are not regulated as traditional banks. And third, the new lenders do not have to spend a significant portion of their time atoning for the sins of the past. The legacy portfolios of large, traditional banks require a lot of time, energy, resources and money.One lender, CommonBond, is going even further. For every loan that CommonBond approves on its platform, it will fund the education of a needy student in another country. Although CommonBond is still a relatively young startup, it has already donated over $200,000 to Pencils of Promise , a charity that helps provide education for children all over the world. David Klein, the founder of CommonBond, insisted on this model from the beginning of his company. While some people may question the rationale of a startup donating valuable equity capital to charitable causes early in its life, Klein would passionately argue about the importance of social leverage.During my conversation with David, it became clear that the mission of CommonBond is a core part of its identity, and it would impact the experience of borrowers, employees and investors. Potential customers primarily choose a loan based upon its cost. However, when all else is equal, people may prefer conducting business with an organization they respect. If CommonBond offers the same price as a competitor, consumers may choose their product because they feel good about helping to fund a child’s education.Klein asserts that being a values-driven organization also impacts recruitment. As a rapidly expanding business, finding new talent is one of the biggest challenges that a startup can face. Klein believes that he has been able to attract better people because of the social mission and values of the company. The $200,000 contribution should not be looked at in isolation. Being values driven should improve employee retention, reduce customer acquisition costs and enhance customer advocacy. And particularly with the millennials being targeted by CommonBond, values matter.In October, three borrowers and three employees will be flying to Ghana to meet with students who benefitted from CommonBond contributions. Given the hubris of pre-crisis banking, the symbolism of a marketplace lender traveling to Ghana is potent.A number of risks face marketplace lenders. A large part of their funding comes from hedge funds and other investors that can be notoriously fickle. Regulators are increasing scrutiny, which may reduce some of the cost advantages. The new credit risk models look good in a benign credit environment, but have yet to be tested through the credit cycle. Clearly not all of the marketplace lenders will survive.However, the change that has been unleashed will not go into reverse. Borrowers will get better value. Costs will be lower. And maybe, in the future, we won’t be surprised when we hear about a values driven lender with a social mission.", "external_links": ["https://pencilsofpromise.org/"], "published": "2015-09-03T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:28:47.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
