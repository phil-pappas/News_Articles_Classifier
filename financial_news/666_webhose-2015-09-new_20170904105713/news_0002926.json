Spanish inflation slumped to negative 1.2% in September, missing forecasts of a negative 0.5% reading. In Germany, inflation also missed forecasts . Consumer prices there fell 0.2% in September, the steepest decline since January and reviving concerns the eurozone is slipping into deflation. \nEconomists at Barclays said after the two national readings, they now expect eurozone inflation — due on Wednesday — to decline to negative 0.1% in September from 0.1% in August. \nWeak inflation readings, or even downright deflation, are a major concern for the European Central Bank, which in January announced a 1.1 trillion euro ($1.24 trillion) quantitative-easing program to boost growth and consumer prices. \nHowever, with little signs inflation is picking up, economists are now speculating whether the ECB will launch more QE this year. \nIndexes: Germany’s DAX 30 index DAX, -0.35% lost 0.4% to 9,450.40, with shares of Volkswagen AG VOW3, -3.30% VOW, -3.55% VLKAY, -2.71% off 4.1%. \nFrance’s CAC 40 index PX1, -0.31% fell 0.3% to 4,343.73, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index UKX, -0.83% gave up 0.8% to 5,909.24. \nMovers: Glencore PLC GLEN, +16.95% GLCNF, +16.45% surged 17% in London after analysts at Citigroup suggested the mining group should go private if it can’t regain confidence from investors. \n“We believe that in the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly, with a potential float of just the industrial business occurring further down the track,” they said in a note. \nGlencore shares cratered 29% on Monday , as concerns grew that the mining giant’s equity value could evaporate if commodity prices stay low. \nWolseley PLC WOS, -12.51% slumped 13% on Tuesday after the building-material supplier said impairments hit profit in fiscal 2015 . \nShares of Continental AG CON, +2.58% rose 2.5% after Goldman Sachs added the auto-parts maker to its conviction buy list.
