The regional parliament will now have a majority pro-independence presence, led by the president and spearhead, Artur Mas. \nHe has vowed to use his narrow mandate to embark on a roadmap towards full independence over the next 18 months. \nBut despite a record turnout of 77pc of the electorate, the campaign for an independent nation state was run on sentiment rather than the cold hard facts, note political observers. \nOne question that has remained conspicuously absent from the secession debate is the issue of Catalonia's eurozone membership. \nThe debate was brought into sharp relief ahead of the vote when Spain's central bank governor made it clear any independent region would no longer have use of the single currency . This would be the immediate consequence of Catalonia's loss of European Union membership. As a newly sovereign nation, it would no longer be subject to the EU's treaties and would need to re-apply for membership, Brussels has warned. * \"Independent Catalonia will be kicked out of the euro\" * What next for independence campaign? The Bank of Spain's Luis Maria Linde even went as far as to threaten capital controls and deposit freezes being imposed on Catalan banks to stem potential capital flight on day one of independence. \n= Going it alone = \nAs a committed europhile, Mr Mas has promised Catalans will remain a part of economic and monetary union come what may. \nEconomists have suggested that an independent Catalonia could carry on using the euro while the process of re-application to the EU takes place. \nThere is precedent for smaller non-euro countries to adopt the single currency without any formal legal agreement with Brussels. \nExamples include Kosovo and Montenegro , both of whom have no currency of their own and adopted the euro as their de facto method of exchange to replace the German mark in 2000. \nThe issue raises periodic bouts of consternation in Brussels, but is likely to gain the tacit approval of EMU authorities while Catalonia makes its transition to full eurozone member state. \nThe Catalans would also have to hit the feted \"convergence criteria\" set out for all prospective euro countries. This would be a maximum 3pc annual budget deficit and a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60pc. As it stands, the region more than qualifies, with a deficit and debt figures that fall well within the EU's limits. \nSeparatists also argue their finances would be in a much better state post-independence, as they would be free of the burden of the federal government's debt servicing costs. The immediate downside would, however, be a loss of control over monetary policy before a new central bank is established. \nAt best, the process is expected to take years rather than months. Ascension would also require agreement from all of the EU's 28 member states. Madrid has already indicated it would veto any application. \n\"The pro-independence campaign haven't been entirely honest with the electorate,\" says Vincenzo Scarpetta at think-tank Open Europe. \n\"Artur Mas looks convinced that Catalonia could remain in the EU after secession, but the reality is that an independent Catalonia would have to join the queue for EU membership, and would need unanimity from the rest of the union to be allowed back in.\" \n= Uneasy bedfellows = \nBut it is politics rather than economics that could well get in the way of Catalonia as the single currency's newest member state. \nMr Mas's pro-independence coalition, Junts pel Si (Together for Yes), has been forced to team up with the anti-capitalist and anti-euro Popular Unity Candidacy party (CUP), in order to secure a parliamentary majority. \nThe radical Left CUP make awkward bedfellows for the pro-business Mr Mas and are set to undermine his drive to remain in the EU. They have already called for him to step down as president and are vehement opponents of Brussels' neo-liberal austerity diktats. \nCUP's presence as \"kingmakers\" in the new coalition is set to destabilise rather than consolidate the independence movement ahead of national elections at the end of this year, notes Angel Talavera at Oxford Economics. \n\"Mr Mas's biggest job is to tame the CUP,\" he says. \"Otherwise the process is dead on arrival.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:40:08.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
