The purpose is to protect Egypt's borders and to contribute to preserving Egyptian and Palestinian national security. \nIn a speech at the Sustainable Development Summit on Friday, Sisi said the international community must react swiftly to obstacles to sustainable development, especially terrorism. \nLater today, Sisi is slated to meet UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, before holding talks with his Senegali counterpart and the prime ministers of Ethiopia and the Netherlands.
