You bet it is! But, as is the case with everything else the IRS puts forward, things aren't quite that easy. As a tax attorney who deals with the IRS every single day, I would be the first one running down the streets cheering if amnesty was available to anyone who came forward and disclosed their situation to the IRS. But there are caveats; curse the tax gods and their caveats! \nThe prerequisites \nBefore you start thinking about what program might be best for you and your particular situation, it's important to know what you need to do in order to lay a solid foundation for your case to rest on. \nFirst and foremost, and if you've read any of our articles in the past you would know this, compliance is key . There's no better sign of good will than being able to show the IRS that you are no longer doing the thing that got you into trouble in the first place. Not only did you go back and fix the initial problem, but you're once again trying to pay your taxes while showing that you're working your darndest to make things right. \nIf you go into a situation looking for tax amnesty and you're still doing the very thing that landed you in trouble, the IRS isn't going to take you seriously. Even if you resolve the problem at hand, they're going to see your continued and problematic actions as a recipe for the same situation to repeat in the not-so-distant future. And you can trust me when I say that they're not going to look at your too favorably in that situation. \nAt IRSMedic, we've seen it happen time and time again that the IRS actually wants people to get into compliance so that they don't have to prosecute. The truth of the matter is that prosecution puts a lot of pressure on the IRS and their limited resources. Even though millions of Americans are engaged in tax evasion on an annual basis, the IRS only criminally prosecutes 3,000 people a year. If they can save their manpower from being even more overworked, they're going to try and push you to enter into compliance. In this situation, what the IRS is asking you to do is definitely in your best interest. \nMoral of the story? Compliance is the most important prerequisite before requesting amnesty. \nThe two little words that determine your path \nNo, I'm not talking about those two words that you said to your older brother as he dumped his peas on your plate while simultaneously forking your last bit of beef - \"Please stop!\" These two words are a good deal more serious and are key in determining what path you need to take in your pursuit of amnesty - \"criminal intent.\" \nCriminal intent dictates a lot when it comes to disclosing your tax mistakes to the IRS. We're going to be looking at two differing scenarios and how they relate to federal tax amnesty: \n1) Amnesty for those with tax evasion exposure; and \n2) Amnesty for those with little exposure. \nObviously the IRS is going to look more favorably on those who made a mistake (have little exposure) than those who knowingly chose not to properly file their taxes (have tax evasion exposure). But, if you find yourself in the latter category, don't panic! Just because it sounds grim doesn't mean that you don't have options and a bright future ahead. \nThose with tax evasion exposure \nThis group is broken down into two subsets: 1) those with foreign income and 2) those without foreign income. The IRS has made it a point to really go after those who have some sort of foreign income. If you have unfiled FBARs, there's a much higher risk of criminal prosecution. This also applies to those who didn't do anything intentionally. The added presence of foreign income is enough to tip the scales against you. \nSo, if you have unreported foreign income, you have to be particularly aggressive. It's so very important to be proactive in order to get into the tax amnesty program that's going to best serve your situation. Chances are the IRS won't be doing you any favors, so it's up to you -- and your representation -- to fight to get you into a proper program. \nFor those without foreign income, the standard voluntary disclosure process is fairly straight-forward. You'll need to send a letter to an IRS criminal investigator saying that you want to come clean. They'll then let you know whether or not you're under criminal investigation (most people aren't). After that, you'll more-than-likely be told to file amended returns for the past six years. There may be some additional penalties tacked on, but that will be the end of it. \nLittle to \"no\" evasion exposure \nMost people aren't aware, but it's very common for US citizens to have unfiled domestic income; those who are self-employed are even more likely to not file. Many people end up owing taxes but don't file their taxes. In a mad cycle, they keep kicking the taxes out of sight year after year. If you find yourself in a situation like this, you probably don't need to go through a voluntary disclosure. Usually filing the unfiled returns is enough to satiate the IRS. \nIf you have understated your domestic income and don't believe that you are at risk for criminal exposure or the kind of case that warrants a voluntary disclosure, it may be in your best interest to file amended returns that include previously undisclosed income. The typical look-back period is six years, but -- depending on the circumstances -- some cases only call for three years of amended returns. It's best to discuss which might apply to you with professional representation. \nFinally, we arrive at back tax debts. Owing money to the IRS for returns you filed is not a crime (if you tried to avoid your taxes by transferring funds to friends or family members, then it's a different story completely). However, it's important to be aware that there are back tax amnesty programs. One of the newest and most interesting is the IRS Fresh Start Program . If you find yourself owing the IRS back taxes, it's important to look around and figure out what options are available to you. \nAs always, if you find yourself overwhelmed with the differing situations and programs available, don't hesitate to ask for help. Dealing with a tax problem is not an easy matter, and it's not difficult to find your head spinning with all the tiny nuances and details that might be affecting your case. Keep your head up, don't hesitate to discuss a strategy with professional representation, and don't ever lose sight of that bright future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:07:01.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
