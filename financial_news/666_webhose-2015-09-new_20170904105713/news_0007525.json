Investors were shaken as talks between Greece and its negotiators stalled, once again. A special Eurogroup meeting was held on Wednesday, but was unsuccessful, according to CNBC. Greece has a payment due to the International Monetary fund on June 30. Oil ended the trading day lower, settling at $60.27 per barrel. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn sold his stake in Netflix (NFLX) on Wednesday, in an announcement on Twitter. This comes after the company announced on Tuesday it will execute a 7-for-1 stock split come July 14. Plus, homebuilder Lennar (LEN), was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, after reporting second-quarter earnings per share that exceed analysts&#39; estimates by $0.15.\n4\n 0:55 \nNow watching Up next Thousands of Greeks Rally In Athens Against Austerity Before Debt Deadline \nGreek citizens held a massive rally in Athens on Sunday, urging Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to resist pressure from international creditors to accept more austerity in exchange for unlocking billions of euros in bailout funds. Singing, waving Greek flags and banners with slogans such as &quot;No to the euro&quot;, several thousand people filled the street in front of parliament. The demonstration by supporters of Tsipras&#39;s ruling Syriza party and others opposed to the euro, was the second anti-euro rally held this week in central Athens. The latest rally comes a day before a vital summit meeting in Brussels to try and break the deadlock that has left Greece on the brink of financial default.\n5\n 0:55 \nNow watching Up next Greece would Get Hammered If it Left the EU, but would Europe? \nMost economists seem fairly certain a Greek departure from the euro would be a disaster indeed. For Greece. But for the rest of Europe? Some think a Greek exit, or &quot;Grexit,&quot; would not in fact inflict serious damage on Europe&#39;s economy as it struggles to work past a crisis over too much government and bank debt. Comparing a Greek exit to the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which spread panic and deepened a global financial crisis, are misplaced, they say. Others aren&#39;t so sure. They think that while short term market turmoil might pass quickly, letting a eurozone member leave could permanently damage the 16-year old currency that&#39;s now shared by 19 countries. Meanwhile, Greece&#39;s new left-wing government is struggling to convince its international creditors that its reform plans are credible\n6\n 18:03 \nNow watching Up next Apple's ad blocker impacts Walmart and Pope Francis weighs in on U.S. economy \nYahoo Finance&#39;s Midday Movers is live each weekday at 12pm ET, covering all the latest news on the markets, the economy and the biggest stories of the day.\n7\n 2:54 \nNow watching Up next Major corporations pledge to use 100% renewable energy \nWalmart is joining nine other companies, including Starbucks and Nike, in pledging to source 100 percent of their electricity from renewable energy.\n8\n 3:03 \nNow watching Up next Apple iOS ad-blocking apps cause issues on retail sites: report \nApple&#39;s new iPhone ad-blockers are causing issues for some major retailers.\n9\n 3:28 \nNow watching Up next Auto industry weighs on broader market \nThe auto industry is being blamed - at least partially - for dragging stocks lower.\n10\n 4:56 \nNow watching Up next Pope Francis addresses congress \nTurning now to Pope Francis who continued his visit to this country by speaking to a joint session of Congress earlier today.\nLoad More \nU.S. stocks closed lower Thursday as investors awaited a post-close speech from Fed Chair Janet Yellen. ( Tweet This ) \nThe major averages more than halved losses in afternoon trade. Oil turned higher, helping stocks shake off pressure from declines in global markets overnight. Utilities and energy led S&P 500 sector advancers. \n\"Crude was pretty strong on this one. We've broken through some pretty strong resistance on the SPX,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"There was more support near 1,910, which coincides with 1,900 in the futures.\" \n\"We really haven't had a great reason to sell off in the last two days because besides the durable goods numbers we haven't had much news,\" he said. \"I think it's going to be very difficult for stocks to hold their heads up here because of some of the nervousness ahead of the Fed.\" \nAnalysts also attributed the recovery attempt to some short-covering ahead of Yellen's 5 p.m., ET, speech, which could provide clarity on the Fed decision last week. \nRead More Fed blowing its chance to raise rates: Economist \n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed about 79 points lower after falling as much as 263.53 points.

The Nasdaq and S&P briefly joined the Dow in correction mode but closed out of it. The indexes are on track for a weekly loss of more than 1 percent.\n\n\"If we want to go back to fair value we may have more digging to do,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. \"If we can start to see revenue growth that can patch over a lot of problems. Right now the data coming through is not supporting those expectations.\" \n\"I think it's a simple mismatch of reality and expectations, and that's what corrections are made of,\" he said. \"I don't see a bear market. We just need a reset.\" \nThe number of new 52-week lows in the S&P 500 was the most since Aug. 21, the Friday before the \"Flash Crash\" of Aug. 24. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak on inflation and monetary policy at a 5 p.m., ET, speech at the University of Massachusetts, where the audience will not be able to ask questions. \n\"I don't think there's going to be much ahead of that,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. \"We heard from Yellen for an hour last week after (the Fed) statement. I'm sure she's going to be a focus but I'm not sure there's much else she's going to say.\" \n\nRead More Yellen gets a do-over, but will she use it? \n\n\"It's all about Yellen today,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. She could \"be more hawkish. ... Maybe she might indicate that interest rates are going up this year.\" \nHe's watching to see if the S&P 500 can hold 1,900 and indicate a bottom. \n\n\"We're approaching the last week of the month and generally speaking this is a sloppy time,\" Cardillo said. \"With the fear factor at a very high level it can only mean wider gyrations with light volume. From that perspective, it's very difficult to see a market respond to some good news.\"\n\nMajor European stock indices closed about 2 percent lower as investors continued to digest the Volkswagen emissions test scandal. \nJapan's Nikkei plunged 2.76 percent in its first day open after a three-day national holiday. The Markit/Nikkei Japan flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell for the first time in three months. \nThe Hang Seng fell, while the Shanghai Composite closed mildly higher. \n\"It's just more of a continuation of the fact that we keep getting more data points that indicate growth is decelerating,\" said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. \"This morning's durable goods certainly doesn't help.\"\nIn morning U.S. economic news, durable goods showed a decline of 2 percent.
