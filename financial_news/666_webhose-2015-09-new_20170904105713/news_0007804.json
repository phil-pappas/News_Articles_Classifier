The broader All Ordinaries fell 98 points or 1.9 per cent to 5096.3. The sharemarket took its lead from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent, and Europe after the Stoxx 50 fell 3 per cent on Friday.\nKate Howitt, portfolio manager at Fidelity's Australia Opportunities Fund says the broad-based sell-down was notable for the movement in the top 50 stocks, which indicated selling from offshore investors, who had put their money into liquid, safer Australian blue chips amid uncertainty in emerging markets.\n\"A combination of instability in the renminbi and uncertainty about the US Federal Reserve ending its zero interest rate has been putting a lot of pressure on south-east Asian countries,\" Ms Howitt said.\n\"When the Fed says 'reprieve', the cost of money is not going up [for US dollar-debt laden emerging markets], it is a bit of a relief valve for those Asian companies that have been beaten down,\" she said.\nThat caused flows out of the safer Aussie blue chips and into the south-east Asian companies which \"had life left in them\", she said, and that sell-down was amplified by algorithmic trading.\nThe sell-off was broad-based, with the miners, oil and gas and banks the hardest hit sectors.\nLow trading volumes – around 30 per cent lower than usual, according to IG chief market strategist Chris Weston – also amplified the volatility.\n CBA hit hard Commonwealth Bank was the hardest hit bank, down 2.9 per cent to $73.62, following by Westpac Banking Corporation down 2.8 per cent to $30.85. ANZ Banking Group fell 2.4 per cent to $27.72 and National Australia Bank fell 1.9 per cent to $30.47.\nDespite brent crude oil prices falling 2.6 per cent, rare glimpses of green were found in Oil Search, up 0.1 per cent to $7.50, and Santos, up 0.6 per cent to $4.78.\nIron ore rose 0.6 per cent, but BHP Billiton fell 2.5 per cent to $23.86, while Rio Tinto fell 2.9 per cent to $49.78.\nWoolworths meanwhile fell 1.3 per cent to $24.50, and Wesfarmers fell 1.4 per cent to $38.66. Telstra shares fell 1.6 per cent to $5.56.\nNot helping the ASX was the \"overwhelming negativity\" on the global outlook of the Australian economy and dollar, National Australia Bank economist Ivan Colhoun​ said upon his return from a trip to the United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East.\nHe said just one investor was not negative on Australia, while \"another described the Australian economy as 'toast'\" naming China, mining and housing as key areas of concern.\nDespite the turmoil, the Australian dollar was a picture of calm, trading in the high US71¢ handle for the day and shrugging off the market turmoil.\n'Ecosystem of volatility' BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said a stronger Australian dollar had taken away one of the market's few positives: that the Aussie's downward trajectory is helping to boost the economy.\n\"The fact it's trading calming in the face of this negative market, indicates the Fed's delay in raising rates is putting upwards pressure on the Australian dollar,\" he said.\nMore than concerns over China or emerging markets, Mr Bassanese said the Fed had created its own ecosystem of volatility, with pundits now discussing a hike in early 2016 and beyond.\n\"I would actually say the Fed itself is a new source of volatility and uncertainty, in keeping rates on hold it has tried to calm markets and its had the reverse effects,\" he said.\n\"It is a major risk event that we want to put behind us. It is basically hard to make big decisions with that big risk ahead of you,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:05:04.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
