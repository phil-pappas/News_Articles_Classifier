Before that, Hanergy had surged more than sixfold within the space of a year.\nShort sellers are to blame for Hanergy’s troubles and are the only beneficiaries of the company’s troubles, Li said, rejecting any notion that he was involved in short sales of Hanergy’s shares.\nShort Sellers “I’ve never been involved in any form of trade of our stock and my team has never been involved either,” Li said. “As the majority shareholder, the group has never cashed in even one cent from our shares and has never sold even one share of our stock.”\nThe maker of thin film solar products, whose surge briefly made it the solar industry’s most valuable company, last month reported its first semi-annual loss since 2011 after suspending contracts with the parent and affiliates.\nHong Kong’s Securities & Futures Commission suspended trading in Hanergy indefinitely, saying the company failed to keep investors properly informed. Li, in the anniversary speech, said the SFC’s reason for the suspension is “unconvincing,” adding that Hanergy is still cooperating with the probe.\nHanergy had promised that by October it would roll out as many as five prototypes for cars powered only by solar panels. So far, the company has yet to make any further announcements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T07:21:05.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
