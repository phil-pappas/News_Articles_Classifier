The open interest on puts fell to the lowest since mid-July on Sept. 21, signaling bears may be losing their stranglehold on the market. SPDR is the world’s biggest exchange-traded product backed by gold.\nThe drop comes two months after bullion slumped to a five-year low. Prices have rebounded about 7 percent since then as tepid global growth prompted the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising interest rates. Higher rates curb the appeal of the metal, which doesn’t offer yields, unlike other competing assets.\n“Some folks are starting to really worry about whether the Fed rates will raise rates this year,” said Sameer Samana, a St. Louis-based global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which oversees $1.6 trillion. “You probably got a little bit of room for gold to stage a counter-trend move higher,” if the rate increase gets pushed out to December or next year, he said.\nGold is still heading for a third straight annual loss. Investors had been dumping the metal in anticipation of monetary tightening. Fed fund futures show traders now see a 41 percent chance of a rate increase in December, compared with 64 percent on Sept. 16, the day before the Fed announced its decision.\nDecember gold futures on the Comex in New York rose as much as 2.2 percent on Thursday, helping boost shares of mining companies. The benchmark 30-member Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index of the largest producers rose as much as 7.6 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:09:28.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
