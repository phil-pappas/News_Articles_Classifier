It is understood that Zurich management decided during a board meeting on Sunday to end the pursuit of a deal for RSA. \nThe Swiss giant blamed the costs associated with the explosions in the Chinese Port of Tianjin last month , which have so far hit $275m. \nAccording to a statement by RSA, Zurich found nothing wrong with the company’s books but had to cancel the bid because its own finances had deteriorated. \n“Zurich has confirmed to RSA that the due diligence findings were in line with their expectations and, while the process had not been finally concluded, they had not found anything that would have prevented them from proceeding with the transaction on the terms announced on 25 August 2015,” the British firm said. \n“As a result of recent deterioration in the trading performance of Zurich’s General Insurance business, Zurich has terminated discussions with RSA regarding a possible offer.” \nRSA’s shares have shot up 30pc from their early-July low of 391p to 509.5p by the end of last week, on hopes that the 550p offer from Zurich would go ahead. \nFormer RSA boss Richard Gamble had said the deal could have revitalised the British giant , writing to the Telegraph to say he would “welcome a bid to put me out of my agony of watching the company of which I was so proud disintegrate in the way it has over the last 17 years.” \nHe and other investors in the firm will be disappointed by the decision to call off the buyout. \n\"We had thought that the deal would go through which would have been an excellent exit route for long suffering RSA shareholders,\" said Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon. \"RSA will now have to do the tough job of delivering earnings from its reduced size.\" \nUnder Mr Hester, RSA has sold off a series of businesses in a bid to refocus on a smaller number of profitable business lines, following several profit warnings and accounting problems in Ireland in 2013. The Latin American arm was sold earlier this month for £403m after a lengthy sale process. \nIt came as Zurich published a surprise update on its third-quarter trading numbers, warning that in addition to the cost of the Tianjin explosions, its US auto business had been a drag on profits. \nOverall, the general insurance business is likely to report an operating loss of around $200m in the third quarter, the insurer said. \nAs a result, the firm’s general insurance chief executive Kristof Terryn is conducting “an in-depth review of the business,” Zurich said. \nHowever, the firm said its priorities were \"unchanged\" for a $3bn cash pile that it intends to spend on acquisitions that generate returns on capital of more than 10pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:53:14.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
