The Las Vegas Sun reports ( http://bit.ly/1KnEQWv ) that there appears to be enough support on the panel for the measure to pass. \nLaw enforcement officials have tried unsuccessfully for a decade to get such a tax approved. \nThe latest version is a smaller increase than previous proposals. It would allow Las Vegas police to hire another 133 officers, and would provide money for dozens more officers in Henderson, North Las Vegas, Mesquite and Boulder City. \nInformation from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:32:47.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
