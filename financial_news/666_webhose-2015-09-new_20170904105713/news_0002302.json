Many British employees choose to opt out of the time cap. \nAllie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said: “This ruling will surprise and concern many UK businesses, and indeed public sector employers, who had been following the law to the letter.” \nMany companies are likely to find themselves inadvertently in breach of the new rules, and could be forced to put wages up to attract new staff and avoid breaking minimum wage legislation. \n“The notion that the period mobile workers spend travelling between home and their first client in the morning must count as working time goes above and beyond the protections intended by the law,” Ms Renison said. \nRecent ECJ decisions have included rulings on holiday pay, how leave carries over between years, and rest periods from work. \nMs Renison said: “It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a worrying development that the main source of new European labour law now seems to be the EU court. The new European Commission has thankfully decided to reduce the volume of new regulation it creates, but the ECJ has become a red-tape machine, tormenting firms across Europe.” \nDavid Cameron, the Prime Minister, has made clear that retaining the ability of UK workers to opt out from WTD legislation is one of his priorities in negotiating with the EU. \nNeil Carberry, the Confederation of British Industry's director for employment and skills, said: \"Given that this ruling extends working time, it again emphasises that the voluntary individual opt-out from working time rules is a vital part of ensuring the system works in the UK. We want to see the opt out protected.\" \n“Ensuring that employers do not have additional costs and burdens sprung upon them like this must be a core element of the PM’s renegotiation efforts,” Ms Renison added. \nA spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: “We are carefully considering the implications of this judgement.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:52:31.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
