By Matthew Le Cordeur \nA slowdown in August's inflation figures could be exactly what the doctor ordered, as the SA Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announces its repo rates decision on Wednesday. \nStatistics SA will release its August Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures at 11:00 on Wednesday, ahead of the afternoon repo rate announcement, but Fin24 can reveal that the CPI looks set to remain unchanged month-on-month (m/m). \nThe Inflation Factory, which measures CPI in real time, said the m/m inflation at the end of August was 0%, implying a year-on-year (y/y) inflation of 4.6%. \n\"This is the first monthly decrease in y/y inflation following five months of increases and strengthens the argument for the MPC to leave rates unchanged,\" said The Inflation Factory. \n\"Simple projections of CPI show the y/y rate continuing to increase through to January 2016, with a strong chance of breaching the 6% ceiling by the first quarter of 2016.\" \nSA is battling slow economic growth, with a Gross Domestic Production (GDP) contraction of 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015. It has been ascribed to the country's lack of electricity capacity as well as tough conditions in the emerging markets and commodities sector. \nIn July, the MPC hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% per annum.
