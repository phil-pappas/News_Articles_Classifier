Photo used with permission from Rose+Moser+Allyn Public and Online Relations View all 5 photos \nA bit of advice, if you visit Tortilla Fish Taco Shop on Elliot Road in Tempe, Arizona, is “Do not ask for sour cream!” Owner Francisco Peralta is insistent on authenticity. So you may get to experience a genuine Mexican media crema, instead, and be happy you did. Peralta’s approach has been so successful, he is inviting Arizonans to celebrate “Free Taco Day” during the opening of his second location at 44th Street and Thomas Road in Phoenix on November 1, 2015. \nPeralta seemed born to be a successful restauranteur. In Sonora, Mexico, from the age of nine, he would help out his father in their pizza parlor, then, during vacation, go work in his grandfather’s bakery. Peralta came to attend school at Paradise Valley Community College in Arizona in 1998. But, by 2000, he had joined the family in opening Sunset Pizza, which operated in Mesa, Arizona, for six years. \nIn July 2013, Peralta realized his dream of opening his own restaurant—the first Tortilla Fish. Discouraged by many chain Mexican restaurants, which seemed to be drowning in American cheese, rice and beans, and sour cream, he wanted a menu that reflected cuisine prevalent in Sonora, Ensenada and other parts of Mexico. \nPeralta credits three reasons for his success in the competitive restaurant business: \n“Of course, you have to start with good food, and follow that with great customer service. But the key to success is following through with a sound business plan.” \nPeralta’s timing is also fortuitous. In an era, when consumers are nutrition-conscious, Tortilla Fish fare is fresh and natural. He brings key ingredients from Ensenada. Most of the fish and meats are slow-cooked or steamed. The few fried items are cooked in rice bran oil, which is delicate, contains less fat, and does not affect the taste of the food. \nPeralta looks forward to opening restaurants #3 and #4 in 2016. If people would like to work for this growing chain, they are encouraged to contact him now, at the Tempe location. \nPhoenicians also enjoy the fun atmosphere at Tortilla Fish. It is famous for its unique salsa bar. The customer gets bare tacos and meat, and is able to put how much of whatever he/she wants on them. Peralta may even give in to public pressure and provide a little rice…if you ask for it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T00:09:04.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
