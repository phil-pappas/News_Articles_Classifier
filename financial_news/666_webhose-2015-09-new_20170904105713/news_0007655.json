Harrison Saragossi by Tim White Two \"occurrences\" prompted this column. Actually, thinking about it, it was four (although not sequential).\nThe first was a question at a Massolino wine trade masterclass hosted in Sydney by the Serralunga d'Alba winery's oenologist Giovanni Angeli. There was a question from the front, I'm assuming from a \"somm\", about whole-bunch fermentation in nebbiolo.\nBloody whole-bunch: somms, proprietors of \"alternative\" wine bars, and pinot noir producers in the Yarra Valley (especially) are obsessed by it. Although I don't quite understand why anyone would ask about its use in nebbiolo-based Barolo, given that it is already one of the masochistically tannic red wines on the planet.\nNow I love these wines, and those of Barbaresco, and others, but the thought of loading green \"stemmy\" tastes on top of the already formidable nebb tannins, makes me gag.\nStems included Whole-bunch fermentation is the practice of including some portion of grapes which are still attached to their stems into the fermenter, the balance being either crushed or whole grape berries.\nThe percentage of whole bunches varies according to the individual winegrower's philosophy, which may or may not take into account the vagaries of the season or vintage.\nThere are many reasons for using whole-bunch fermentations, but the automaticity and perfume they add to a finished wine is principal among them.\n The technique commands a lot of attention at the moment, as evidenced in the above query, although it has been used in the Old World, especially in Burgundy with pinot noir, for donkey's years. But its use locally has burgeoned as a commonplace oenological styling for much of the past decade, across all manner of black grape varieties, but especially pinot noir and shiraz.\nWhole-bunch cabernet The next incident: Timo Mayer thrusts a glass of wine into my hand with \"Let's see what you think of this shrug\". The red smelled like cabernet sauvignon – but only a really green, grassy green, version of cabernet sauvignon – and I ventured a view to the same effect, containing a mild profanity. It transpired the wine was a 100 per cent whole-bunch cabernet: 100 per cent!\nNow Timo is known for his (partially whole-bunch) pinot noir wines, and some of them are beauties (the Doktor Mayer '14 reviewed is also 100 per cent whole-bunch, the regular Mayer, my preferred pinot in '14, is 25 per cent). But the 100 per cent whole-bunch cabernet? Timo told me the sommeliers loved it and it had sold out. However, I got the impression that he was not entirely convinced by the wine himself, despite its success with the bloody somms.\nOn the positive side, as this wine is primarily going to be sold through bars and restaurants now, it is unlikely that anyone will have to drink it in 10 years' time (when it will bear more than a passing resemblance, I am sure, to all those green cabernets from Coonawarra that were created in the eighties).\nLooking back again, I relate today's stems-in-everything allure to that of the love for all things new-wooded in red a couple of decades ago. Back in the old days many Australian wine gatekeepers couldn't see the fruit for the trees. Now it's stems: just a different type of wood really. Shortly after the encounters with Massolino and Mayer came retrospective tastings with Clive Paton and Phyll Pattie of Ata Rangi and Blair Walter of Felton Road. They both make pinot noir of considerable quality, which ages beautifully for many years (at the Ata Rangi retro the '05 was looking quite delicious, as fresh as a daisy). Both Ata Rangi and Felton use whole bunches in their pinot noir fermentations.\n50 per cent 'a mistake' After 35 years' farming at Ata Rangi they are cautious with stem inclusion in their ferments.\n\"The reason we do it is to centre the palate,\" Clive says. \"But in 1992 tried we 50 per cent; it was big mistake.\"\nIt now sits at around 30 per cent, although this varies a little from vintage to vintage. Blair Walter shares similar views.\n\"Twenty to twenty-five per cent is our average. Fermentation seems to happen a lot better with the whole bunches – sugars are slower so you get a natural extension to fermentation.\"\nBut this figure will go up and down depending on vintage conditions. At Felton Road's vineyards, cool vintages benefit more from stems than warmer ones.\nBut going back to the Massolino question. Angeli said that while some experimentation has been done with stem inclusion in Piemonte, traditional long-skin maceration is seen as the most important way to resolve the tannin structure of their nebbiolo (although the maceration time in Piemonte varies significantly among producers).\nBut hey, you never know. They make Chinato in Piemonte from old Barolo wine flavoured with a mix of quinine, herbs and spices, with a result not dissimilar to many of the bitter alcoholic drinks crafted in the vicinity. So perhaps there's a future for whole-bunch nebbiolo in Australia (made by Timo). The somm at The Hellfire Club would be sure to list it.\nWHAT TO DRINK: LOVELY BUNCH OF PINOTS Ata Rangi Pinot Noir 2013 [Martinborough, North Island, NZ]\nDeep, powerfully inky-smelling: brimming with iron and dark black fruit. Sumac sharp also. Deep and powerfully flavoured with coal dust-soaked blueberry and boysenberry. Dense, but with openness also.

Bitter chocolate plum, and a galangalness. Sweet kidney meats too. More gentle on the tongue than expected with fine, sandy tannins, mouth-sucking plum skin and a bitter orange finish. Excellent length and builds in the glass. 94(95)/100, $76\nMayer Dr. Mayer Pinot Noir 2014 [Yarra Valley, Vic]\nHas quite a strong herbal, Averna stem influence this, but plenty of mossy, forest pips and iron filings power. Excellent mouth-sucking forest pips and long-building tannins. There's a delicious raspberry fool creaminess, and it lasts long. Beautiful. 93(94)/100, $50", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:16:45.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
