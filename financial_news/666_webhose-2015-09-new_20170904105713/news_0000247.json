Getty Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Palaszcuk Labor government has undertaken a purge of the boards of its 12 state-owned corporations, including close friend of former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, Mark Brodie, whose tenure as chairman of Gladstone Ports Corporation has not been renewed.\nMr Brodie, the former chicken takeway shop owner who was controversially appointed to the crucial export hub after the Liberal National Party election victory in 2012, will be replaced by respected former Gladstone Ports Corporation chief executive Leo Zussino.\nMr Zussino, the long-serving chief executive, was shown the door at the Gladstone Ports Corporation in February 2013, following the sacking of chairman and Labor stalwart Ian Brusasco in June a year earlier.\nBut the Labor government will also be accused of cronyism after appointing former Brisbane lord mayor Jim Soorley as chairman of CS Energy. He will replace former director-general of premier and cabinet Ross Rolfe who still had a year to run on his contract.\nMr Brodie, whose term at Gladstone Ports Corporation was set to expire at the end of this month, was never expected to survive. He has since gone into business with Mr Newman with a new start-up company, Castellum Investments.\nBut many are surprised at the scale of the clean-out of state-owned corporations.\nOnly three chair positions of government-owned corporations - Julie Beeby at Powerlink, Don Luke at Queensland Investment Corporation and Michael Klug at Queensland Rail - have kept their jobs.\nOther chairs and directors have been given the flick, some only into their jobs for a short time.\n The new appointments to be announced on Monday include former Powerlink chief executive Gordon Jardine as chairman of Energex, Ralph Craven at Stanwell who is replacing Stan Charles who was only nine months into a three year term.\nOther appointments include former energy director-general Dan Hunt as chairman of Seqwater, Brad Fish to North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation and Clive Skarrot to Ergon Energy.\nTreasurer Curtis Pitt said with the Labor government deciding not to sell the government-owned corporations it was important to inject some new blood into the boards.\n\"Keeping key assets in public ownership, like our ports and our electricity networks, was one of our major election commitments,\" Mr Pitt said.\n\"With these new appointments, we're not well placed to ensure our assets keep delivering dividends for all Queenslanders.\"\nMr Pitt said Mr Zussino's appointment was an acknowledgement of his role in helping establish the $60 billion liquified natural gas industry in Gladstone. There are also three new directors on the Gladstone Ports Corporation board.\nThe Treasurer said the number of female board members of state-owned companies would nearly double under the changes.\n\"This is in line with our election commitment to increase the proportion of female board members on Queensland's government-owned corporations to 50 per cent by 2050,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-27T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:44:54.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
