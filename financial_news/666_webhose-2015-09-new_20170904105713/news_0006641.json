The new solution provides a customized contract model and reports specifically designed to capture granular information about even the most complex financial documents such as derivative and master agreements, as well as information relating to collateral, such as timing and calculation of margin calls. Asset managers, fund managers, banks and hedge funds gain unique insight into critical contract data to better control risk. Exari has developed a unique contract model by working with some of the largest financial services firms in the industry globally. This new contract model provides deep granularity around obligations and risks, including counterparty risk, credit risk, legal and business risk in a way that no other solution can provide. Because the model dynamically parses the data from the document, users can gain immediate insight rather than sorting through hundreds of pages of contract documents. The Exari Contracts Hub for financial services provides insight at all levels across all contract types, including, via structured data, semantic tagging and metadata, and full text search. Only the Exari Contracts Hub for financial services delivers the power of big data across all contract assets.\n“Contracts contain invaluable business information, yet extracting this information is challenging, time-consuming and prone to expensive errors. The ability through technology to deliver deep insight into the data locked in contract assets is especially valuable for financial services firms whose contracts have significant risk exposure,\" said Tim Cummins, Chief Executive Officer at IACCM.\n“Capturing granular information about specialized terms in financial contracts required significant analysis and modelling usually using valuable staff or expensive external legal resources up until now,” said Jamie Wodetzki, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Exari. “With the financial services pack, Exari is delivering a highly complex model at the touch of a button, so financial services firms can get valuable insight into their complex financial agreements in real time.”\nThe Exari Contracts Hub for Financial Services is available immediately.
