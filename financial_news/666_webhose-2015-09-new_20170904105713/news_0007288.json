While companies add new flavors of potato chips, change the wrapping on cookies and seek out seasonal fads—like pumpkin-spice beer—the vast majority of the new items rarely register at store checkout lines. In many cases, sales of a new flavor simply come at the expense of sales for an original product.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

And most of products don’t last very long: “The number of items offered for sale nearly tripled over five years, although 82% of these products have since been discontinued,” the report said.\nDespite the poor return, a “growth through innovation” strategy remains popular, Mr. Byrne said. But, he said, many companies aren’t planning ahead for the complications new products bring to supply chains, including new sourcing and volatile changes in inventory needs based on uncertain demand. Each added item needs new packaging, new artwork, a new process for introducing the product to retailers and a person or team of people in charge of managing the flow of those materials.\nCompanies “should really look at the cost of innovation—the cost of carrying inventory and the impact on service,” Mr. Byrne said.\n“To me, it’s mind-bending to say half the items out there amount to 1% of sales,” he said. “It’s so extreme, it’s hard to believe there couldn’t be some improvement.”\nWrite to Erica E.
