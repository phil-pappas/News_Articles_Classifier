Flightglobal's Ascend Fleets database shows that the remaining two deliveries are scheduled for July and August.\nThe three 787s were initially mandated to African Export-Import Bank in 2012 as part of $1.9 billion funding package comprising nine Boeing 787-8s, one 777-300ER and 10 Embraer 190s. The funding package included pre-delivery payments along with an aircraft delivery finance facility.\nThe Cairo-based institution acted as global co-ordinator in the transaction, which comprised a senior tranche guaranteed by the US Export-Import Bank plus a commercial tranche.\nAfreximbank also acted as the arranger and underwriter of the commercial tranche, while Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan Chase were the arrangers for the senior Ex-Im-guaranteed tranche.\nThe transaction marks AWAS's first 787 acquisitions.\n\"This marks a milestone for AWAS, our first of many planned new-technology aircraft acquisitions with these three Boeing 787-8s,\" says AWAS chief executive Ray Sisson.\nRelated Content Kenya Airways appoints Cabot for 777 sale Afreximbank names new president AWAS chief resigns Kenya Airways to conduct 'fair and honest' codeshare assessment AWAS secures capital-markets funding for 787s Afreximbank closes 787 financing for Kenya Airways Afreximbank closes financing on first Kenya Airways 787 Kenya Airways seeks Ex-Im financing for 777 and 787 aircraft Kenya Airways mandates Afreximbank to arrange financing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:18:03.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
