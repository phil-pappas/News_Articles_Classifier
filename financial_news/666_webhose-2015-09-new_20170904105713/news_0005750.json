James Morgan by Christopher Niesche Any office worker in Sydney lucky enough to have a harbour view will have noticed the growing number of cruise ships docking at Circular Quay, just as anyone walking the streets of Melbourne will have seen more Asian tourists in recent years.\nThese are the most visible manifestations of the growing desire for travel among Asia's growing middle class.\nAsia has been one of the powerhouses of the world outbound travel market in recent years. From 2009 to 2013, the number of Asian outbound trips grew by 53 per cent, twice the rate of overall global travel growth of 22 per cent, according to data from the World Travel Monitor.\nGrowth is especially strong in China. By 2030, it will become the world's largest passenger market, according to forecasts from the International Air Transport Association.\nIn 2034, flights to, from and within China will account for about 1.3 billion passengers, 856 million more than 2014, with an average annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent, IATA says. The stunning rate of growth creates opportunities not only for airlines, hotels and tourism operators, but also for those who invest in these businesses via global equity markets.\nBuy planes Airlines might seem like a logical starting point to tap into this trend but aviation is a highly competitive sector with low barriers to entry and can be buffeted by fuel prices or global travel scares.\n\"We could buy airlines but there are lots of airlines so we'd rather buy airplanes,\" says Nick Griffin, head of international equities at K2 Asset management.\n Airbus and Boeing are both in strong positions, he says. While there have been attempts to build another Airbus or a new 737 over the years, no one has succeeded because they don't have the technological know-how. He also nominates French aircraft parts maker Safran Group.\nAirbus, in particular, is attractively priced, on a multiple of 16 times next year's earnings, Griffin says. The airline manufacturer estimates that more than 31,000 new aircraft will be required in the next 20 years, worth $US4.6 trillion ($6.5 trillion).\nGriffin says another area of interest is the cruising industry, which the Chinese are taking to with gusto.\nCruising capacity to Asia \"The great thing about the Chinese consumer is they're like the American consumer on steroids and the American consumer was pretty big. So they're very, very amenable to brands, to products, to new concepts, to new ideas,\" he says.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Cruises are well placed to benefit.\n\"When we speak to Royal Caribbean, they tell us they're shifting a lot of capacity to Asia. All of their last three new ships have all gone to China,\" Griffin says. \"It's a fairly simple play and there are only two or three players in the world in a good demand environment.\"\nRoyal Caribbean is on a multiple of 14 times next year's earnings, admittedly on its \"reasonably aggressive forecasts\", Griffin says.\nKevin Bertoli, portfolio manager, Asia at PM Capital, says the fund manager has holdings in Asian casinos. The recent economic ructions in Asia have caused a downturn in income from VIP customers but 80 per cent of the casinos' business now comes from the mass market. \"That's a longer-term story and we think a very attractive one, one that's very much linked to that outbound travel story,\" he says.\nThe firm owns shares in Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint venture between James Packer's Crown Resorts and Asian casino owner Melco, and the US-listed Las Vegas Sands, which despite its name, generates 80 to 90 per cent of its earnings from Macau and Singapore.\nAirport well positioned As more Chinese start travelling overseas, Beijing Airport is well positioned to benefit, particularly because the tariff on an international flight is double that of a domestic flight, Bertoli says.\nJames Brown, a portfolio manager at Dixon Advisory, says the firm's Asian Masters Fund also invests in Asian airports, which \"are experiencing enormous growth\", including Shanghai International Airport, Beijing Capital International Airport and Shenzhen Airport.\nThe Asian Masters Fund takes a multi-manager approach and invests primarily with local fund managers who know their markets intimately, he says.\n\"The real challenge for investors is identifying the best way to access that theme. While some investors like to invest in global businesses to gain access to this theme, we prefer to gain more pure exposure to the theme through Asian companies,\" Brown says.\nWhile there is a lot of focus on the rise of the Chinse traveller, travel among India's billion-plus residents is also set to grow rapidly. Brown says India's top travel site, Makemytrip, is the local equivalent of Expedia.\n\"The Indian story is a very compelling, broad, middle-class, growing consumption story,\" he says. \"It's coming from such a low base, a company that's operating there could see very significant annualised growth as people move into that middle class.\"\nSouth Korea has been a major beneficiary of Chinese tourism and Brown says one way to tap into this is via Hotel Shilla, a Korean operator of duty free shops and luxury hotels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:53:49.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
