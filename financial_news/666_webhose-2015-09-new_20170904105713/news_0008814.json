Upmarket home sales pushed Brisbane’s median house price over the $600,000 mark for the first time ever last quarter, including this Park Street home in Spring Hill that sold for $1.675M mid-June. Source: Supplied\nREIQ chief executive Antonia Mercorella said it was a sign of wider recovery in the market.\n“We know that historically the premium end of the market tends to lead the market into a recovery,” she said.\n“But we are also seeing sharp increases in activity across the $500,000 to sub-$1 million bracket, which is great news for the majority of the market.”\nIt’s at that mid section that REIQ expects we will see prices begin to rise now.\n“This bracket is likely to be the first that will see real price increases,” Ms Mercorella said.\nAbout 60 per cent of sales in the June quarter were properties in the $500,000 to million dollar price tag range.\nOriginally published as Brisbane median house price up ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Brisbane+median+house+price+up&c=IT+may+have+tread+water+for+a+while%2C+but+latest+data+shows+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+median+house+price+has+hit+a+new+high%2C+propelled+by+million-dollar+sales.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804&title=Brisbane+median+house+price+up", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804&title=Brisbane+median+house+price+up", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fnihpu6h-1227509387967", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-median-house-price-hits-new-high-off-million-dollar-sales/story-fndbalka-1227509387967?sv=92c6cfb7fc6786563bdb5c3b4cd46804&h=Brisbane+median+house+price+up"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:11:49.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
