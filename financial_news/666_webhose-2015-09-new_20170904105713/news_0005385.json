Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates ​A surprising range of Sydney and Melbourne suburbs, including desirable inner-city postcodes, have been added to a list of areas including Pilbara and Queensland mining towns that National Australia Bank believes may become vulnerable to risks of mortgage default.\nIn a note received by mortgage brokers last week, NAB listed more than 80 \"restricted postcodes\" across the country where it is capping the percentage of a property's purchase price it will lend, known as a loan-to-valuation ratio.\nThe list, obtained by Fairfax Media, shows NAB is most concerned about 40 postcodes that are mainly mining areas, where it says there has been \"significant deterioration in credit risk\".\nMortgage customers must provide a deposit of at least 30 per cent in these areas, three times the 10 per cent deposit that banks traditionally lend against.\nMore surprisingly, NAB also included 34 Sydney postcodes and five Melbourne postcodes on a watchlist of areas it believes \"are exhibiting characteristics which may indicate future deterioration in credit risk\".\nNew borrowers in these suburbs – including Glebe, Chatswood and Chippendale in Sydney and Abbottsford, the CBD and the area around St Kilda Road in Melbourne – will need to stump up a deposit of at least 20 per cent to get a loan from NAB.\nA spokeswoman for NAB said the bank had considered factors such as the rate of house price growth, the amount of borrowing by property investors, and rental yields.\n\"These changes impact less than 1 per cent of our mortgage lending flow. But like all banks, we constantly review our risk settings across all geographic areas, recognising that no two locations are the same,\" the spokeswoman said.\n For banks, the biggest risk of rising mortgage defaults is caused by a rising unemployment rate. Australia's unemployment rate has been steady at around 6.2 per cent and is expected to remain broadly flat over the coming months.\nIt is understood the red-flagging of postcodes by NAB is not the result of rising unemployment in these areas. Instead the bank, Australia's third-largest mortgage provider, is trying to limit its exposure to certain areas where price growth has been especially strong.\n\"Some of the factors that we take into consideration include investor growth levels, property price growth, rental yield and the regulatory environment,\" NAB's spokeswoman said. \"We support our customers in all markets who want to get into the property market. That means getting the balance right and helping manage the risk for customers and our business.\"\nThe postcodes of biggest concern, and requiring a 30 per cent deposit, are mostly mining areas and are included on what NAB calls its \"A\" list.\nPostcodes requiring a 20 per cent deposit and where the bank is eyeing potential future risks are on the bank's \"B\" list. Many have been at the centre of the boom in apartment construction. The central business districts of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth were all on the \"B\" list.\nNAB chief risk officer David Gall last month said the bank would \"look very closely at areas that have had very dramatic increases in property values to consider what is the right ongoing LVR\".\nThe \"B\" group was dominated by Sydney suburbs, which accounted for 34 of the 43 postcodes listed in this category.\nIt included a range of suburbs, from inner-city areas such as Glebe and Chippendale to Campsie, Kingsgrove, Chatswood, Baulkham Hills and Cabramatta.\nNAB said the postcode policy would apply to all new loan applications received after September 18.\nThe managing director of mortgage broker Homeloanexperts.com.au , Otto Dargan, said the policy may affect first home buyers especially, as they typically had smaller deposits.\nWith Sydney dwelling prices up 17.6 per cent in the last year, Mr Dargan also questioned whether the policy was a vote of no confidence in parts of Sydney.\n\"It could be NAB did this for internal reasons, such as being overexposed in those suburbs. Or it could be vote of no confidence in large parts of the Sydney property market,\" he said.\nNAB's move to take a more cautious approach towards parts of Sydney comes after a boom in house prices that Treasury Secretary John Fraser has dubbed a \"bubble\" and Glenn Stevens has called \"crazy\".\nRecently, however, there have been signs of slowing in the market, with Sydney's auction clearance rate falling from near 90 per cent earlier this year to 69.6 per cent at the weekend.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/risky_postcodes_hype/index.html", "https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://homeloanexperts.com.au/"], "published": "2015-09-28T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:09:57.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
