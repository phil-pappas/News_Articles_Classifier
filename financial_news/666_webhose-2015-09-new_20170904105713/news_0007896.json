It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was the biggest single-day gain for Japan's benchmark stocks index in nearly seven years and came after Prime Minister Shinto Abe raised hopes of more fiscal stimulus by his government. \nIn China, the Finance Ministry said it would strengthen fiscal policy, boost infrastructure spending and speed up tax reform, helping lift Chinese shares for a second day. \nProspects for government fiscal stimulus set the stage for a 1.4 percent rally in European stocks, while Wall Street was up most of Wednesday before turning down in late trading, dominated by drops in Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) and energy shares. \n\"That translated into solid gains for the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . dollar against safer and lower-yielding currencies like the yen and euro,\" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union (Sao Paolo: WUNI34.SA - news ) Business Solutions in Washington. \nThe euro was also hurt by widening interest rate differentials between two-year U.S. Treasury yields and comparable German bunds, according to traders and strategists. \n\"The differential is giving the dollar some traction against the euro,\" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York. \nThe dollar was last up 0.60 percent against the yen at 120.54 yen, while the euro was flat at $1.12 after falling as low as $1.1131. \nThe dollar index, which tracks a basket of major currencies, was flat after being ahead most of Wednesday. \nEver since China devalued its currency in early August, sending shockwaves across global markets, the dollar has mostly moved with the ebb and flow in risk appetite. That pattern favors the yen and low-yielding euro when riskier assets such as stocks and commodities are widely sold. \nMany traders said the dollar, which benefits from U.S. interest rates that are higher than those of other major economies, was likely to show limited gains or losses through next week. \nU.S. Federal Reserve policymakers may announce an interest rate hike on Sept. 17. Analysts believe a rate increase would boost the greenback.
