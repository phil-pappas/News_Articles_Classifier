Analysts had expected new claims to rise more.\nThe trend in jobless claims continues to give bullish signs on the health of the U.S. labor market, which is critical for the Federal Reserve's plans to lift interest rates as soon as this year.\n\"These readings suggest no significant change in the continuing low level of layoff activity,\" said John Hoff, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.\nThe four-week moving average of jobless claims fell by 750 to 271,750, which was close to its lowest level since 2000 and suggests the job market remains on the upswing.\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:55:35.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
