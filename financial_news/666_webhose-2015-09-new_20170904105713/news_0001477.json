Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle When Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday unveiled the most radical reshuffle of a government frontbench in years , there was considerable surprise that Immigration Minister Peter Dutton was one of the few ministers left standing in his portfolio.\nAfter all, Dutton had been widely reported to have sent a test message to the new prime minister last week offering his resignation. There had been the embarrassment of the hastily abandoned Operation Fortitude in Melbourne – when his Border Force announced they would doing random visa checks on anyone they ran into on the street.\nFinally, the \"boom mike\" moment – when the Immigration Minister had been caught making a bad joke about rising sea levels in the Pacific – had been one of the incidents in the last few days of the Abbott prime ministership which had seemed to reinforce the idea that when things start to go wrong in politics, everything goes wrong.\nYet on Sunday afternoon, there was Peter Dutton, still standing, still occupying his portfolio – one of only four senior ministers to retain their previous jobs – even if it subsequently emerged that he had lost his permanent spot in the most powerful inner sanctum of the government – the national security committee of federal cabinet.\nWhatever Dutton's personal qualities or capacities, multiple government sources argue there are a number of reasons for stability in the border security area, and therefore for the need for stability in the immigration minister's job.\nThe first is the need for continuity and stability of message on border policy.\nSources have told The Australian Financial Review that there was a lift in \"chatter\" detected by security services among people-smuggling networks when the shift was made from Scott Morrison to Dutton as immigration minister, with plans to \"test\" whether the change in minister also meant a change in policy.\nThere is some anxiety that the policy will be tested again with a change of prime minister.\n At a political level, it's being argued that a change of minister in the sensitive immigration portfolio would actually only refocus attention on policy and whether it was going to change, just as Labor's adoption of boat turnbacks has largely put the issue beyond political contention.\nManus Island and Nauru There is considerable anxiety within the newly re-formed government about doing something about asylum seekers now stuck without hope on Manus Island and Nauru. That will not mean any shift in the hardline policy that none of these people will ever come to Australia. But it will mean an escalation of attempts to resolve their plight by finding another home for them.\nStability in border protection policies also gives the government and the new prime minister room to pivot more in other areas than it might otherwise be able to do away from Tony Abbott's aggressive national security rhetoric.\n\"You can change the whole tenor and tone of the national security debate if you don't change the border protection policy or its minister,\" one source said.\nMr Dutton's future presence on NSC only \"as needed\" is a sign of something of a de-escalation in the whole link between national security and the immigration portfolio.\n\"I'm co-opted into the national security committee when there is a border security issue,\" Mr Dutton told Adelaide radio on Tuesday.\nMr Dutton's shift from being a permanent member of NSC means that there will be only three ongoing members of NSC: Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Attorney-General George Brandis.\nSome suggestions in Canberra that this might ultimately see the militarised Border Force be de-escalated too were quickly scotched by senior sources on Tuesday.\nThe opposition is clearly quite happy for Mr Dutton to stay in the portfolio, given his missteps of recent times. On Tuesday, opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles suggested Mr Dutton's absence from NSC was a worrying sign that Mr Turnbull was \"prepared to engage in political payback at the expense of ... national security\".\n\"Australia's national security should be above party-room vendettas,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-09-22T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:41:08.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
