This is a huge amount and really points to the ubiquity of plastic pollution,” said Wilcox.\nDr Denise Hardesty from CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere said seabirds were excellent indicators of ecosystem health.\n“Finding such widespread estimates of plastic in seabirds is borne out by some of the fieldwork we’ve carried out where I’ve found nearly 200 pieces of plastic in a single seabird,” Hardesty said.\nThe researchers found plastics will have the greatest impact on wildlife where they gather in the Southern Ocean, in a band around the southern edges of Australia, South Africa and South America.\nDr Erik van Sebille, from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said the plastics had the most devastating impact in the areas where there was the greatest diversity of species.\n“We are very concerned about species such as penguins and giant albatrosses, which live in these areas,” van Sebille said.\n“While the infamous garbage patches in the middle of the oceans have strikingly high densities of plastic, very few animals live here,” said van Sebille.\nThe study was published in the journal PNAS.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 4:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:22:03.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
