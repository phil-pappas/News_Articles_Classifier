Rajan said at an event here that keeping inflation down and implementing reforms are needed for maintaining sustainable growth. There are expectations that the RBI would reduce interest rates at its next monetary policy review later this month. This has been reinforced with the US Federal Reserve deciding to hold its interest rates much against the earlier expectation they would be hiked. On the US Federal Reserve's decision, Rajan said this could be due to concerns about the American economy. He said the US may be waiting for more information before deciding on a rate hike. Rajan also said the banks should quickly balance their books, adding there was need for a bankruptcy code to enable the lenders better handle their loan accounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T15:57:17.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
