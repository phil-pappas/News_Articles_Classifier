But he added Tuesday that waters were not contaminated and would not be harmful to humans. \nOn Sept. 13, Barrick said a pipe carrying cyanide at the Veladero mine had a valve failure causing a leak into nearby waters. An investigation determined about 35,300 cubic feet (1,000 cubic meters) of liquid cyanide spilled. \nLocal residents have feared contamination of their water resources. \nBarrick has declined to comment on the judicial decisions.
