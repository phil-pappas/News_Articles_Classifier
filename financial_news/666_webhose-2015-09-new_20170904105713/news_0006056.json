Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose It should be a tax reform priority for the Turnbull government to scrap the annual limit on how much people can save within the generous tax settings of superannuation and replace it with a lifetime cap.\nThat was the consensus of experts at the AFR Tax Reform Summit in Sydney on Wednesday , although debate rages as to what a fair lifetime super contributions cap would be.\n\"A lifetime cap on pre-tax contributions could be set in the order of $650,000 and then indexed to inflation,\" Grattan Institute chief executive John Daley said.\nThat's significantly less than the $2.5 million cap on superannuation balances, rather than lifetime contributions, long advocated by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia .\nFormer Victorian premier John Brumby also told the summit, hosted by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG that he \"backed the idea\" of moving to a lifetime contributions cap.\nLifetime cap fairer for women \"The move from an annual limit on super savings to a more flexible lifetime contributions cap is clearly something that everyone is talking about and there is something relatively similar in the UK, which is a £1.25m lifetime allowance,\" Challenger chairman retirement incomes Jeremy Cooper said.\nDetermining an appropriate cap for Australia is a complex actuarial question that demands detailed modelling, he said.\n \"There should also be thought, not just about the capital amount, but what retirement income it would produce,\" said Mr Cooper – a former regulator who led the government's 2010 review of the superannuation system.\nANZ Global Wealth chief executive Joyce Phillips said that moving to a more flexible lifetime contributions cap was an important measure needed to help address the superannuation gender gap.\nOn average women of all generations have about half as much in superannuation savings as men, she said.\nThat disadvantage is in part a reflection of the pay gap but also a result of women being more likely to take time out of the workforce to raise children.\nNumber crunching needed \"A lifetime cap would be fairer and make the system more sustainable by enabling people to contribute more during the years in which they earned more, to help them catch up from years spent out of the workforce – whether that was to raise children or for any other reason,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\"It would also be an incentive for those who can afford it, to contribute more early in their working life and get more benefit from compound interest.\"\nMs Phillips said she wanted to see detailed modelling before commenting on what the right level to set a lifetime cap might be.\nHer counterpart at Westpac, BT Financial boss Brad Cooper, said in June he saw merit in a cap of \"at least no higher\" than the $2.5 million suggested by ASFA .\nCentre for Independent Studies senior fellow economic programs Robert Carling also backed a move to a lifetime contributions cap and called on the government to produce the modelling required for a robust discussion on what that cap should be.\nSelf-managed superannuation fund groups have previously called to move to a lifetime, or rolling, contributions cap .\nOnce the issue of what the threshold should be, another of the challenges in switching to a lifetime cap would be deciding how to apply it retrospectively.\nMr Daley said it should account for all contributions made since modern record began in 2003.\n\"Anything put in to super before that can just be a free kick,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.brw.com.au/p/investing/the_right_threshold_for_tax_on_super_HoSUbmRB0ASVy5r00I0nYI", "https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-09-23T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:13:05.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
