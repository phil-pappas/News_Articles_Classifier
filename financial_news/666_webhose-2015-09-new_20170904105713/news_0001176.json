The disqualification of the 10 bidders would \"not withstand scrutiny if challenged in a court of law\", the report stated. \n- Approval by the CAV's board, executive committee and management could not be found for the appointment of five service providers to the approximate value of R84.99m. \n- The report found a reasonable suspicion of fraud and corruption in total catering expenditure of around R1.142m. It recommended, in line with legislation, that the DTI report this to police. \n\"According to Minister Davies, a 'turn-around strategy' has subsequently been put in place encompassing a strengthened management and financial framework, the imminent appointment of a suitable CEO, and the strengthening of the board,\" Atkinson said. \n\"It is thus incumbent on Minister Davies to present this turnaround strategy to a special joint committee on trade and industry and economic development in Parliament.\" \nAtkinson said the CAV was often highlighted as a government success story at both the trade and industry, and economic development committees. This was \"entirely disingenuous\" as the project was a complete flop, he said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:39:20.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
