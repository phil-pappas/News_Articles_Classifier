Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking. These statements contain words such as \"possible,\" \"if,\" \"will,\" \"expect\" and \"assuming\" and involve risks and uncertainties including, among others that our business plans may change as circumstances warrant. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Examples of forward-looking statements in this press release include the discussion of the expected accretion associated with the dropdown transaction, average annual escalators and potential acquisitions from our sponsor. For more information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those conveyed in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section contained in the Partnership's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Any forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the Partnership undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or of which the Partnership becomes aware, after the date hereof, unless required by law.\nMergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers the Partnership Landmark Contact: Marcelo Choi\nVice President, Investor Relations\n(310) 598-3173\nir@landmarkmlp.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:23:18.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
