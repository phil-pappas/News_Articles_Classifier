When a developer submits his plan, the local authorities give their approval subject to a lot of no objection certificates, approvals, clearances that the developer is expected to get from various authorities around the project. These include clearances from fire department, water department, sewage department, electrical department among others. “Till the developer does not get commencement certificate, he is not supposed to begin construction. If you do not see this document, do not invest in a project,” says Naushad Panjwani, Senior Executive Director, Knight Frank India. If such a certificate is not in place, the project may not get anywhere and your money may get stuck, he adds.There is a possibility that the developer has got CC for part of the project. Ensure that your floor is clearly mentioned in the CC. Do not confuse title certificate and commencement certificate. Post Your Comments Have an opinion on this news? Post your comment here.
