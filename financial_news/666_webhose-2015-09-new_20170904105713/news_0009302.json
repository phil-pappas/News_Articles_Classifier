It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will have implications, obviously. \n\"You cannot consider the UK independent of its environment. If the UK is part of Europe, it’s a completely different situation than if it is not part of Europe.” \nHis comments were labelled as “inappropriate and extreme”, and saw him accused of scaremongering by eurosceptic MPs. \nHowever, speaking to the BBC as the latest investment was revealed and with Britain committed to a referendum on whether or not to remain in Europe Mr Willcox denied that Nissan “had its bluff called” when asked what its decision to build a new Juke at Sunderland said about its view on the forthcoming referendum. \n“Nissan is a global company and we want to ensure our business has the ability to operate as freely as possible in all markets around the world,\" said Mr Willcox. \"Europe is very important to Nissan, it is a growth region for Nissan. We have a very long-term commitment, we don’t manage our business on short-term cycles. Sunderland is... a beacon for global manufacturing and excellence for Nissan. \n“In terms of the mid-term, [the] announcement shows there is a commitment, it shows that through to 2020 we have made an investment.” \nAsked if it showed that the outcome of the referendum did not matter to Nissan, he replied: “Nissan has been pretty consistent in what it said. We will support all future policy decisions that enable us to continue to build on our on our success. \n\"If you look back at the last three, four years, the investments we have made are significant. I don’t think you can draw a line to what may have been said a few years ago to what we have delivered over the last three or four years. \n“We have made a commitment in terms of bringing a new luxury car to the plant in Sunderland, we are bring the Infiniti, which is a £250m investment, we've just announced £100m for the Juke and a £37m investment in terms of a new heavy press line in Sunderland. \n“The two things (investment decisions and the result of the referendum) are not completely linked, as we manage and judge our business on events that we understand.” \nMr Willcox said Nissan would not reverse the Juke investment, but added that decisions are made on the competitiveness delivered by factories. \n“Our position in terms of competitiveness is driven by not only the situation in Europe in terms of whether we are in or out of the EU but more importantly the commitment of the people we have in the North East, the supply chain we have in the UK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:14:53.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
