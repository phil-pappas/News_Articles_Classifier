By failing to come to grips with the nation's public finances, Mr Abbott cut himself adrift from his government's reason for being. In precipitating Monday night's Liberal party leadership contest, Malcolm Turnbull was regrettably right to say that Mr Abbott \"has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs\".\nAnd now that has led to the remarkable occurrence of Australia's fourth prime minister in just over two years.\nMr Abbott's government had not been as chaotic as Labor under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. He delivered on his core election promises to end the carbon and mining taxes and to stop the boats. He halted the spending madness of the Labor years and struck defining free trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and China.\nBut Mr Abbott's fate stretched back to the eve of his election in 2013 when he failed to back up his professed conviction over the depth of Australia's fiscal challenge: indulging in the new entitlement of an expensive paid parental leave program and ruling out cutting spending to big ticket areas of health and education and even public broadcasting.\nWhen Joe Hockey's first budget tried to get the federal finances back on track towards surplus, he was smashed by claims of broken promises and ran into a wall of Senate opposition.\nBy Australia Day this year, Mr Abbott's strange \"captain's pick\" of a knighthood for Prince Philip lit a fuse that ran through the shock loss of Campbell Newman's conservative government in Queensland and then the February backbench revolt that called for a spill of the party's leadership.\nMr Hockey's second budget, only four months ago, was much more popular. But that was because it marked a retreat on the hard slog of fiscal repair in an economy in the rain shadow of its biggest ever resources boom. And it indulged in the populist fiscal stimulus of a temporary tax break for small business.\nAlong with much of the business community, The Australian Financial Review became alarmed over the policy drift that had settled on the nation when Mr Abbott clumsily suggested that the debt trajectory revealed in the intergenerational report of 50 per cent of GDP by 2054 was \"a pretty good result looking around the world\".\n Under the headline \"Abbott loses the budget plot\" , we wrote that, \"the budget will be the policy area that determines the fate of the Abbott government – and now this fate is likely being sealed\".\nIf Mr Abbott had succeeded, the two national newspapers would not be organising gatherings of non-politicians at last month's National Reform Summit to kick-start change.\nAs Mr Abbott's government continued to trail in the opinion polls, last month our chief political correspondent Phillip Coorey revealed renewed talk of leadership rumbles that climaxed in Mr Turnbull's dramatic Monday night victory.\nChanging prime minister is the biggest call in politics, with unpredictable consequences. The ALP's fortunes never properly recovered from knifing Kevin Rudd. So the reasons for changing the leader must be compelling.\nWould Mr Turnbull do a better job communicating the government's economic strategy? Yes. Could Mr Abbott win a head-to-head contest with Bill Shorten? Probably, yes as well. The shock to voters that made the axing of Mr Rudd so disastrous is not a factor here.\nMr Turnbull's previous Liberal leadership ended in disaster – high-handed, autocratic and with serious errors of judgment.\nBut he was also leader during the height of Ruddmania before being brought down by climate change policy which also helped sink John Howard, Mr Rudd and then Julia Gillard.\nEver constant, however, is the risk of a conservative backlash from Liberal party members and voters who don't trust him. The new Prime Minister must move decisively to unite the government and deliver the stability of clear and effective leadership that Australians are crying out for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:09:20.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
