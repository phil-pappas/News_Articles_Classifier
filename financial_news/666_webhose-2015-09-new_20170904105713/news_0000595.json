ESMA has decided on a bond-by-bond calculation method, rather than looking at the bond sector overall. Some 2,000 bonds will be affected, mostly government debt, ESMA said.\nPosition limits, which curb how much of a commodity individual trading firms can hold in order to avoid unduly influencing its price, are being introduced for the first time. They were called for by policymakers to stop \"speculators\" after food prices hit record highs in recent years.\nESMA said it has scaled back the threshold for deciding when a limit has been breached. Depending on the commodity, the threshold ranges from 5 to 35% of the market, scaled back from 10 to 40%, after criticisms from the sector.\n'Dark pool '\nIn addition MiFID II will cap how much trading in a stock can be done in a \"dark pool\" or anonymously and ESMA said the final rules make no major change to what it previously proposed.\nHigh-frequency trading (HFT), which uses ultra-fast computers to place trades, will also be directly regulated, having been blamed by critics for accentuating volatility.\nESMA's recommended rules will need endorsement from the bloc's executive European Commission to come into force in January 2017.\n\"I would expect limited changes, if at all, to these standards,\" ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told a conference call.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:23:11.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
