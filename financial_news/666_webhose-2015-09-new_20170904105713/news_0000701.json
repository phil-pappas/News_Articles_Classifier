Photo: David Mariuz\nPutting aside yesterday's febrile market, spooked by a single analyst's \"scenario\", there's an underlying concern that one of our bluest blue chips is saying one thing about the sustainability of its dividend and Mr Market saying another.\nIt's familiar territory. The last time it happened with an Australian top weight was October 2008 when Westpac CEO Gail Kelly effectively spat in Mr Market's face by increasing the bank's dividend and denying point blank that it couldn't be maintained. Six months later, Mr Market was proved correct when the dividend was trimmed by 20 per cent.\nThe market didn't believe Westpac at the time and the bank was priced accordingly.\nBHP boss Andrew MacKenzie: \"You shouldn't doubt our commitment to maintain the progressive dividend.\" Photo: Reuters\nToday BHP shares are trading with an amazing yield for a resources company of 7.7 per cent. With 100 per cent franking, it's more like an absolutely astounding 11 per cent. At that rate, compounding semi-annually, the dividend doubles your money in less than seven years and never mind what happens to the share price.\nAdvertisement BHP is sticking by its \"progressive dividend policy\". \"The aim of the policy is to steadily increase or at least maintain the dividend per share in US dollar terms at each financial half year,\" the company says .\nBHP's CEO, Andrew Mackenzie went further in August , saying the company would prefer to cut spending on growth projects rather than cut the progressive dividend policy.\n\"Over my dead body sounds a little strong but it's almost right,\" he said, in reference to the circumstances in which he would be willing to cut the dividend. \"You shouldn't doubt our commitment to maintain the progressive dividend, quite independent of any divestment or any additional sources of cash. Our ability to defend it comes from our exemplary program for productivity and efficiency and the strength of our balance sheet.\"\nThe share price around and below $22 says Mr Market doesn't believe Mr Mackenzie.\nBelieve BHP and it is one of the great all-time buying opportunities. Believe Mr Market and that dividend is going to be reduced, meaning BHP shares might still be a reasonable buy but are not amazing.\nThat's at the heart of the doubt over our biggest miner and, for that matter, Rio, which is yielding 6.3 per cent.\nThe Glencore kerfuffle is a sideshow by comparison, but certainly a bemusing sideshow when the analyst who sparked it was quick to distance himself from his own report.\nIn the process, Investec's Hunter Hillcoat lost the ability to claim hero status should his darkest Glencore musings come true. He told ABC radio that the report was not a \"sell\" call, just a \"scenario\". One fears what might happen then if Mr Hillcoat ever makes a sell recommendation â€“ and pity him for not recommending clients short Glencore ahead of a 30 per cent share price plunge.\nBack at the Australian main game, investors are left wondering about the Mr Market v Mr Mackenzie standoff.\nFor the little that it's worth, by way of disclosure, the Pascoe Family Super Fund, seriously underweight resources stocks, added some BHP to the portfolio yesterday.\nIf that yield can only be maintained for another year before being halved, it's not an unattractive return and if Mr Mackenzie keeps his word, it's a screamer. In the longer term, the outlook for a very low-cost miner unlikely to buy anything stupid at this point should eventually look after the share price.\nAnd buying Westpac in October 2008, even with what Mr Market thought of its dividend policy, has proven to be very rewarding.", "external_links": ["http://www.bhpbilliton.com/investors/shareholderinfo/dividends"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:57:34.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
