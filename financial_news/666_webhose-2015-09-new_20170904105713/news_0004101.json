Beck suggests finding teachable money moments, such as showing your kids a credit card statement, opening a youth bank account, or revealing some financial mistakes you've made as a parent. He said explaining how a mistake caused problems and what you've done to fix them can go a long way in raising financially savvy kids. \n\"Don't lecture your kids about money, but [having] an intelligent discussion about how you manage money and how you avoid pitfalls is a very key thing,\" he said. \nBeck also pointed out that trying to teach kids about money in one sitting isn't effective. He says kids should be exposed to financial topics as they arise. \"If you get a raise, explain to your kids that perhaps the family can take a nicer vacation,\" he said. \"Or if a spouse was laid off -- maybe we can't go out to dinner as often. Just explain the dynamics of it, since children will follow the parent's lead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:18:13.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
