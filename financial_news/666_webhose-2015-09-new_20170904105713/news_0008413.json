BT Group (LSE: BT-A.L - news ) has played a vital role by investing £10.5bn of capital in to Openreach over the past 10 years.” \nMs Fyfield also suggested that BT’s plans for further upgrades using a technology called G.fast were inadequate and a symptom of the financial links between Openreach and the rest of the company. Rather than run fibre-optic lines all the way into homes and businesses, BT plans to avoid expense by squeezing faster internet access from the existing copper wires. \nJoe Garner, the chief executive of Openreach, kicked off the debate in The Telegraph on Monday when he made the case for Openreach to remain part of BT. \nThe latest intervention raises the stakes as Ofcom considers the future of Openreach as part of its once-a-decade review of the communications sector. The regulator has said it is “seriously considering” a split as the most radical of four options (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:36:36.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
