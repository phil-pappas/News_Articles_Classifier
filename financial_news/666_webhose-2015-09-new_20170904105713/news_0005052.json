If clean energy became cheaper than coal, gas or oil, fossil fuel would simply stay in the ground,” the British documentary maker said. \nAFP reports the project, launched in June, is named the Global Apollo Program in honour of the extraordinary achievements of the Apollo space missions of the 1960s that took humans to the Moon. \nThe program’s demands include raising public spending on renewable energy research to an international total of at least US$15 billion annually for the next decade. \n“That compares to the US$100 billion currently invested in defence research and development globally each year,” the petition said, adding that private firms spent “relatively small sums” on renewable energy. \nThe November 30 to December 11 UN COP21 conference in the Paris suburb of Le Bourget is tasked with sealing a universal deal to roll back the threat of climate change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:58:38.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
