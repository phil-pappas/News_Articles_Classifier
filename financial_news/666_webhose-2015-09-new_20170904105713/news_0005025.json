Bloomberg Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Consumer confidence has vaulted to levels not seen since Labor was thrown out of office in 2013, putting pressure on Malcolm Turnbull and his new team to keep it high by getting on with economic reform .\nThe boost, attributed directly to Mr Turnbull rolling Tony Abbott for the prime ministership last week, has been recorded in both public surveys and internal research conducted by the Coalition in the aftermath of the leadership putsch.\nAt the same time, internal rancour caused by the change continued to fester with Mr Abbott taking aim at former friend and ally Scott Morrison over his role in the downfall, essentially accusing him of lying.\nThe Senate crossbench was also threatening to not co-operate with Mr Turnbull after new Special Minister of State Mal Brough said he intended to press ahead with reforms to electoral laws that would stop the micro-parties gaming the Senate preference system and getting elected with a minuscule primary vote.\nMr Brough argued it was only fair that people got whom they voted for.\n\"The strength of our democracy goes to how much the public are engaged. People would be horrified to learn their vote ended up where it did.\"\nThe crossbenchers disagreed. \"We can only hope that Mr Brough's comments were a brain fart because he seems intent on wrecking the relationship with the Turnbull government before it begins,\" said Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm.\nOverall, the mood within government was positive due the the rebound in confidence and the opinion polls.\n The ANZ-Roy Morgan survey showed consumer confidence had surged 8.7 per cent in the week ended September 20, six days after the leadership spill, more than making up for the 7.1 per cent decline of the previous fortnight.\n\"With no other substantive economic news or market movements to explain the outcome, the drive of the bounce was most likely optimism around the elevation of [Mr Turnbull] to the prime ministership,'' it concluded.\nIt was similar to the surge in business confidence upon the election of the Abbott government in September 2013.\nBut ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan warned that to sustain the bounce, Mr Turnbull and his team \"need to deliver a medium-term reform strategy in the context of a clear economic story for the country\".\nHe said Mr Turnbull's first 100 days would be essential in developing a new economic narrative.\n\"Expectations are clearly high, not unlike when the Coalition initially won power, and the community will be sensitive to disappointment on this front.\n\"A clear economic strategy is critical, otherwise consumer caution and gloom in the long-term outlook could easily re-emerge, given weak wages growth and sub-par global economic activity\".\nSenior sources said the government was aware of the need to get down to business after its own research showed a \"massive\" confidence boost. However, they scotched reports of bringing forward from December to October the mid-year budget update to use it as a mini-budget.\nMr Turnbull told the ABC on Monday night the lack of confidence was a key factor as to why business was not investing in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\"So everything I can say to inspire confidence is going to help the economy.\"\nMr Turnbull has put all policies up for review and will dispense with those which have been causing it trouble. New Education Minister Simon Birmingham all but confirmed on Tuesday that the government would either ditch or water down even further plans to deregulate university fees which have twice been rejected by the Senate.\n\"The Turnbull government is more about getting things done than bashing our heads against the wall,\" he said.\nMr Turnbull cited a protracted slump across 30 Newspolls as the reason for challenging. The first Newspoll published since the spill showed the Coalition leading Labor by 51 per cent to 49 per cent, a five-percentage-point swing to the Liberals .\nThe Coalition's primary vote rose 5 points to 44 per cent and Labor's fell 4 points to 35 per cent.\nAn Essential Media poll released Tuesday had the major parties tied at 50 per cent apiece.\nLabor strategists played down the bounce, saying the Coalition's 51-49 lead, or a 50-50 tie, was still smaller than the 53-47 victory at the 2013 election.\nMr Turnbull has taken over Labor's theme of the future and the importance of innovation, science and education.\n\"Turnbull's trying to steal our clothes,\" said one ALP heavyweight.\n\"The more he appears like a Labor prime minister, the more he will offend those who made compromises to support him.\"\nMr Shorten said \"what is important is that we don't just have a change of face and a change of the Liberal line-up\".\n\"What is important is we dump the Abbott government policies.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-22T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:40:31.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
