It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will most likely take a month before the final pact is signed,\" the official said. \nDuring a visit to France in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that New Delhi had ordered 36 of the \"ready to fly\" planes, worth an estimated 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion). \nBut a sticking point has been Delhi's standard requirement that arms makers invest a percentage of the value of any major deal in India, known as the offset clause. \nThe Economic Times, quoting unnamed sources, on Tuesday said the French have agreed in principle to a 50 percent offset clause. \nStephane Reb, the French defence ministry's senior military procurement officer, will head the negotiating team, the daily said. \nThe deal is a long way short of plans in 2012 under the previous Indian government to buy 126 Rafale jets from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation (Paris: FR0000121725 - news ) as part of a $12-billion deal. \nAfter coming to power last May, the Modi government dashed lingering hopes over that deal, saying the country would only buy 36 because they were \"way too expensive\". \nIndia is in the middle of a major upgrade of its ageing military hardware, a modernisation programme worth about $100 billion, partly to keep up with rival neighbours Pakistan and China. \nModi also wants to end India's status as the world's number one defence importer and to have 70 percent of hardware manufactured domestically by the turn of the decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:06:24.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
