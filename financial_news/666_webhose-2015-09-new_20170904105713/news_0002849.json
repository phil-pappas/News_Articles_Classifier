He said the online real-estate company is integrating its Trulia acquisition and is making headway with millennials now searching for starter homes.\nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks\n\"They were smart enough to buy out their most viable competitor there, and even after that acquisition, they only control about 30% of their market,\" Beckerman said. \"It's a highly fragmented industry, but because of their superior brand recognition, they are growing their piece of the pie.\"\nBeckerman said shares of Greenbrier Cos. ( GBX - Get Report ) have fallen over 28% year to date because of \"perceived exposure to the energy industry\". However, he sees the railcar maker turning its fortunes around in coming months because it's highly profitable and trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of less than eight times its trailing 12 months earnings.\n\"They have this beautiful hidden asset, which I love, of a backlog of over 40,000 orders worth in the billions of dollars, so this is a stock that can double and still be reasonably priced,\" Beckerman said.\nFinally, Beckerman is a fan of Spirit Airlines ( SAVE - Get Report ) , which is down 31% year to date, saying that the company is highly profitable, especially because of the drop in oil prices and trades at a dirt-cheap P-E multiple of 10 times next year's earnings estimate.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13294035/1/4-stocks-financial-planner-daniel-beckerman-likes.html", "http://beckermaninstitutional.com/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13294035/1/4-stocks-financial-planner-daniel-beckerman-likes.html&title=4", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13294035/1/4-stocks-financial-planner-daniel-beckerman-likes.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13294035/1/4-stocks-financial-planner-daniel-beckerman-likes.html&text=4", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13294035/1/4-stocks-financial-planner-daniel-beckerman-likes.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:50:59.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
