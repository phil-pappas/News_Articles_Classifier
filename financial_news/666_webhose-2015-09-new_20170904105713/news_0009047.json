The site now has a network of 350 care workers, mainly from New South Wales and more than 1,500 potential carers whose applications are going through the necessary checks, including police records and employer references. He said like many other online marketplaces in other sectors, Better Caring was able to provide more affordable rates. The business has recently scored an extra $2.3 million from investors, including the backing of Tony Wales, co-founder of share registry business Computershare, to expand its service beyond New South Wales and into Victoria and Queensland as it strives to become a national industry player.
