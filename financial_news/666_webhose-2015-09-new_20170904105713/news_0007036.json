Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Linda Champion, manager of the Australian Federal Police's Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre, had been on the trail of Australia's biggest insider trading scandal for months following a tip-off in early 2014.\nForeign exchange broker Owen Kerr reported a series of suspicious trades on the Australian dollar after discovering his client, former National Australia Bank trader Lukas Kamay was friends with Australian Bureau of Statistics employee Christopher Hill on LinkedIn .\nRather than shut the pair down, the Australian Federal Police brought the NAB, the ABS and brokers Pepperstone and Axicorp into a three-month sting operation codenamed Operation Leith .\nDuring that time, Kamay made more than $8 million betting on movements in the Australian dollar, based on economic data leaked by Hill.\nWe knew what it meant for the financial markets and that we needed to stamp it out as quickly as we could, but we still weren't able to prove it to the point where we were confident we had a criminal brief that would hold up in court.\nFinally, the break we were after. On April 26, Hill called Kamay from a friend's mobile phone, in an effort to avoid detection. They made arrangements to meet and soon after Kamay picked up Hill in his car. Over the next two hours, police captured a conversation in the vehicle that was tantamount to a confession.\nLate Friday, May 2, I received a call from one my superintendents saying, 'Ma'am we've got it. Figures for the next trade have been passed. We just need it to happen now and we have them both.'\nThat phone call was just gold. I knew then that we had to see through that final trade to show not only the passing of information but also the illegal trading with it. The teams had been working so hard and waiting for this final breakthrough, knowing we would get the break we needed if we were patient.\n Operation Leith is a good example of how successful we can be when working collaboratively with our partners in both private and public industry. The success we experienced in the arrest of the NAB and ABS employees might not have been as successful if not for the close assistance of ASIC, ABS and the NAB.\nYou manage it, the pressure. That's one of the qualities required of being a manager is you actually have to deal with it. You need to keep your members energised and positive about the outcome, even where there is pressure to retain resources and not knowing when the end of an investigation is going to come.\nBeing able to rise up through the ranks, raising two children [17 and 20 years old] and juggling the demands of being a mother with a career, to be able to reach the level of commander and being given the opportunity to work in London in such a fantastic new role [AFP manager Europe, Middle East and Africa] is a great advertisement for women in policing.\nIt is hard to switch off but that's because I'm passionate about my job, you can't just turn it off at 5pm every day.\nI have a very supportive husband who understands my work and, while I can't talk about jobs with my family, they understand the environment I work in and they understand sometimes the pressure I am under and if I have to take a phone call during dinner, so be it.\nLinda Champion spoke to Patrick Durkin.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
