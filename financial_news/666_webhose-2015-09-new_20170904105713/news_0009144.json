In more recent times, balance has gone out the door, in favour of \"integration\" or \"blending\". Through our attachment to smart devices, we now have an \"always-on\" environment where the barriers between work and personal time have almost disappeared, and natural demarcation points (such as close of business on a Friday) are no longer there. \"Work-life blend\" might sound like a virtuous mixture, but it can turn toxic if you're not careful.\nImbalance in the blend Blending is the new reality, but the experiences of some former staff at tech-giant Amazon show what can happen if the blend gets overly work-skewed. A recent report by Jodi Kantor and David Stretfield based on interviews with more than 100 former employees revealed a punishing culture. Unquestioning devotion was expected, where health and personal lives had to be put entirely to the side. New employees were told to forget \"poor habits\" from previous roles. Emails routinely arrived after midnight, followed by text messages for good measure if the emails were not responded to. Former employee Jason Merkoski indicated \"the joke in the office was that when it came to work-life balance, work came first, life came second, and trying to find the balance came last.\" This harsh culture does lead to high staff attrition, but there is no problem in attracting new workers to the Amazon blender. The company remains a desirable destination for new employees attracted by its path towards being the \"first trillion-dollar retailer\", with capacity being developed to house 50,000 employees across its Seattle headquarters.\nA better blend with help of a cowbell Through our attachment to smart devices, we now have an \"always-on\" environment where the barriers between work and personal time have almost disappeared. Glenn Hunt But other organisations see that there's a danger in extreme blending. Advertising agency Leo Burnett's Australian office has taken some interesting steps to encourage a healthy work-life blend. Its talent management head Sarah Palmer says recent initiatives include a 10am Monday office opening time throughout August to delay the work week just that little bit longer. Before this, their \"Vision 6:30\" initiative featured a daily (loud) cowbell at 6pm, that would signify that all employees had 30 minutes to finish working and leave for the day. This latter measure was in response to a stay-late-and-order-dinner-at-work practice that was emerging and verging on becoming the norm. The company recognised that committed employees did not have to prove their devotion through longer and longer hours that included dinner with colleagues at the office. Rather than this practice becoming the norm, the cowbell served to remind people that it was time to start thinking of their personal lives, and to wind down and leave for the day.\nRemove the guesswork In this flexible, always-on environment, the new rules of engagement can be unclear. There is unfortunately still an aura of mistrust in some organisations for people working from home during standard office hours (as this study shows)… though when it comes to calling on employees to respond after hours it's a different story. Employees can feel this old school pressure to be visible at the office to demonstrate their commitment to the cause, though recognise they could easily be way more productive (and less stressed) if they were given greater control over the where and when of their work responsiveness. This is a frustration particularly expressed by some of my Gen Y coaching clients.\nThe potential organisational benefits of ramping up real flexibility from the employee end of the bargain has been revealed through a 2014 study called \"Changing Work and Work-Family Conflict: Evidence from the Work, Family, and Health Network\" which appeared in the American Sociological Review . The study found that over a six month period employees who were given more control over their work time and work location, in conjunction with more overt supervisor support for their unique family and personal situations, did considerably better on family, work and efficiency evaluative measures than employees working under the old rules. This evidence suggests that when a company dares to \"walk their flexibility talk\", and back up more defined flexibility options with employee-centred supervisor dialogue, the results can be win-win for all.\n There is no end of research and opinion on effective work-life blending. Googling this topic yields millions of results. Yet despite this profusion of discussion, many organisational cultures are still unable to empathise with their employees by genuinely standing in their shoes, and nurturing the potential for two-way and reciprocal flexibility, rather than draining and depleting the tech-enabled goodwill of their always-on employees.\nTips for bosses If you are the one making demands, here are some ideas for turning the blender into a more positive force:\n1. Communicate your expectations. If you are firing off emails at all hours and on weekends, fine. Your ideas might be great, but is there a real need for instantaneous attention from the recipient? If not, clarify the urgency, or lack thereof. Let out-of-work time allow some time for your people to refresh.\n2. Delay 'Send Gratification'. Be more judicious in your email transmission habits, and opt for 'Draft' rather than 'Send' if appropriate. Show maturity and delay your Send Gratification.\n3. Have the hard conversations about potentially new ways of doing things. Do you sense work-life friction is at play for anyone in your team? Your own small-scale flexibility experiments with valued employees can unleash more commitment and productivity. Trust them.\nAnd for those in the blender If you are the one perpetually responsive to external demands from the work-life blender, here are some ideas to consider:\n1. Communicate more, autopilot less. Active communications rather than auto-piloted responsiveness will help address any expectation creep that may be emerging. The little things add up – a coaching client pithily called this \"self sabotage\". Your time is valuable, you are unique, and not a commodity.\n2. Keep sight of 'you'. Although Seinfeld's George Costanza could hardly be regarded as a beacon of workplace balance, he was onto something when talking about his Worlds Collide Theory. \"If Relationship George walks through that door, he will kill Independent George! A George divided against itself, cannot stand!\" Similarly, keep a healthy separation between your work self and independent self. Or the former will consume the latter.\n3. Re-tune to career control. A difficult work-life blend can provide a perfect environment for tunnel-vision where your longer term goals are put aside. Even if you're in a role that you wish to continue in for many years, it is important not to allow blender-induced myopia to blind you to your career future and any exit strategy. You never know when it might need to be invoked. Take advantage of learning and development opportunities within the current role, tweak your CV periodically and purposefully make time to stay in touch with your broader network. Don't neglect it.\nTake charge, or the work-life blender might mash you up.\nTom Loncar is an executive, leadership and career coach who helps his clients develop strategies for thriving in complex environments. www.tomloncar.com.au", "external_links": ["http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=17501#.VfuTs2SeAXA", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=1", "http://www.flexiblework.umn.edu/publications_docs/Kelly_et_al_2014_ASR-online_first.pdf", "http://www.tomloncar.com.au/"], "published": "2015-09-27T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:09:56.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
