Due to the success of Bizfi.com, launched earlier this year, Merchant Cash and Capital is completing its operational and brand metamorphosis in a way that better reflects the Company’s commitment to financial technology. The name change is a consideration of the Company’s rapid growth – in the second quarter of 2015 alone, the Company provided $115 million to more than 3,000 small business owners – as well as its online expansion. Bizfi’s aggregation platform provides small businesses access to products from more than 35 funding partners including OnDeck, Funding Circle, CAN Capital, IMCA, Bluevine, Kabbage, and SBA lender SmartBiz. Bizfi, which is also a direct lender on the platform, can finance a small business owner in as little as 24 hours. It is the only funding platform that allows a business owner to go directly to contract online. \"Since the launch of Bizfi.com, we have received an overwhelming response from both business owners and funding partners,\" said Stephen Sheinbaum, Founder of Bizfi. Bizfi and its family of companies over the past two years has doubled originations to fund more than 25,000 small businesses totaling $1.3 billion. Sheinbaum continued, \"Bizfi stands at the nexus of alternative finance and financial technology. With Merchant Cash and Capital becoming Bizfi, we will provide fast and unparalleled funding options to businesses across all types of sectors in the United States and internationally.”With 80 percent of small business owners today turning online to search for financing, and 66 percent making loan applications after traditional banking hours, Bizfi is positioned to be the leader in the future of small business financing. Bizfi offers a range of funding options including short-term funding, medium term-loans, SBA loans, equipment financing, invoice financing, medical financing, lines of credit, and franchise financing. Mr. Sheinbaum concluded, “The marketplace for business funding has changed dramatically throughout the ten years that we have been in the industry. We are continuing to grow, adapt and combine our deep expertise with cutting-edge technology to meet the needs of small business owners around the country.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:19:11.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
