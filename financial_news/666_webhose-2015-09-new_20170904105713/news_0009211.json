Michelle Mossop by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Private equity exits usually take five to seven years. But that's for the corporate deals not the people, with two of CHAMP's senior dealmakers expected to leave by the end of 2015 after racking up long stints at the private equity house.\nIt's understood Darren Smorgon and Nathaniel Childres, 16-year and 14-year veterans of the firm, will not stick around for CHAMP's fourth capital call.\nSources said the pair were leaving on good terms with Smorgon to join his family's private company, Sandbar Investments, as a managing director.\nSmorgon, who was a director at CHAMP, oversaw investments in oOh!media, Golding Contractors, LCR Group and Study Group International.\nChildres ran CHAMP's Singapore head office and was a managing director at the firm. He is understood to be pursuing investment opportunities in South-East Asia. He was a director of Miclyn Express Offshore and steered CHAMP's involvement with Bluestar Print Group, International Energy Services and Bradken.\nCHAMP, set up by private equity doyens Bill Ferris and Joe Skrzynski, alongside US firm Castle Harlan, last raised in 2009 and 2010, when it took more than 18 months to secure $1.5 billion in commitments for its CHAMP Buyout III fund. Street Talk revealed last year that the firm would look to raise fresh funds in 2015.\nThe movements come after CHAMP appointed managing director John Haddock as chief executive in February 2014 , while fellow MD Ben Sebel stepped back the same year. Graham Brooke joined CHAMP as an MD from CVC Capital Partners earlier this month.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:07:50.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
