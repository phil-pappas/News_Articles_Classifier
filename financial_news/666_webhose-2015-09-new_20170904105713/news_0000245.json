It's hard because these guys, my staff, have to pay rent, they have bills.\"\nMr Yucetepe said there was a lot of anger about the public holiday, not just from small business owners like him, but also office workers.\nThe venue is a favourite haunt for many businessmen and women, especially on Friday night when investment bankers from 101 Collins Street, flock across the road for a drink.\n\"There's a lot of anger from our customers, some have to work still because the stock market is still open,\" he says.\nFurthermore, this year the route of the grand final parade has been changed because of the public holiday. It will bypass Collins Quarter and run from Spring Street to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\"The whole thing doesn't make sense,\" Mr Yucetepe says.\n\"But I don't know what you do. It's going to be like this for years to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:55:52.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
