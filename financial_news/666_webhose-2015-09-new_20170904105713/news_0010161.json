The Reserve Bank of Australia Tuesday kept interest rates at a record-low 2.0 percent to support growth. \nOil extended its sell-off to a second day. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell 98 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $44.43 while Brent slipped 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $48.77. \nOn Tuesday WTI sank 7.7 percent and Brent lost 8.5 percent. Until then the contracts had enjoyed a three-day rally, adding more than 25 percent, on hopes for an easing of a worldwide supply glut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T06:48:48.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
