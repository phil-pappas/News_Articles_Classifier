The next time you see one, you may think you're in a cocktail lounge. \nWith communal seating areas, high-top tables, and wifi access, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are among the leaders in banking companies trying to provide a welcoming environment for clients who go to branches for home mortgages, car loans and customized financial advice, all of which are higher-value transactions than the old-school visits to tellers to deposit or cash a paycheck.

Customers who want the basics can use ATMs that have video-chat capability and dispense cash in a variety of denominations, including $1, $5 and $10 bills as well as the ubiquitous $20. It's a significant advance for consumer banks, since ATMs remain among their most visible and widely used services. \nA study released by the Federal Reserve last year showed Americans made 5.8 billion cash withdrawals from the machines in a single year, with a value of about $587 billion. About 97% of the transactions were from checking and savings accounts. Customers deposited about $2.7 trillion during the same period, the study indicated. \n\"Most bank branches haven't changed in 40 years,\" said Raja Bose, VP of Branch Transformation for Diebold , an Ohio-based company that manufactures ATMs. \"Now it's about going there and having a meaningful conversation.\" \nIt is important that banks strike the right balance in their service offerings. While tech-based solutions such as mobile deposits and advanced ATMs provide attractive benefits, banks have found that customers still want brick-and-mortar sites, though they don't have to operate as many of them. \n\"Customers are choosing to bank with us the way they want,\" said Dan Deegan, head of national sales for JPMorgan Chase. \nSince the financial crisis of 2008-09, clients increasingly are seeking financial advice that traditional branches employing mostly tellers weren't equipped to provide. \nAdding more advanced ATMs meant that those customers could save the time they used to spend going to tellers for change for the $50s and $20s that ATMs usually dispensed, and use the extra minutes to ask more meaningful questions of specialists assigned to the branch in response to changing demands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:18:27.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
