If met, that would be less than the 80.8 million tonnes the Central Asian nation produced in 2014. \nAddressing reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference, Mirzagaliyev said 39 firms had already applied to the energy ministry for a reduction in the MET and in the oil export duty and some other taxes. \nFirms working on mature fields where production had already peaked, like KazMunaiGas Exploration Production , a unit of state oil company KazMunaiGaz, might be eligible, he said. \nThe government, which gets over half its budget revenues from oil sales, was not expected to take a decision before the first quarter of 2016, he added. New Sources \nKazakhstan is betting on new projects and the expansion of existing ones to lift production. \nMost of Kazakhstan's output comes from mature assets, a reality which has prompted it to study if it can tap shale oil and other hard-to-extract resources. \nMirzagaliyev said that Chevron-led TengizChevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's No.1 oil producer, was expected to keep output similar to its 2014 level this year and next. \nTCO, which is developing the Tengiz field in western Kazakhstan, had output of 26.7 million tonnes last year, down from a record 27.1 million in 2013. \n\"We are considering a number of scenarios, depending on the oil price,\" Mirzagaliyev told reporters, referring to TCO's operations. \nTCO has set out an ambitious expansion plan, which aims to boost production to 38 million tonnes by 2021, Kazakh Energy Minister Vladimir Shkolnik said earlier this year. \nTCO shareholders are currently working to cut Tengiz's expansion costs by around $3-4 billion from $38 billion, said Mirzagaliyev. A final decision was expected by year-end. \nSeparately, Kazakh First Deputy Energy Minister Uzakbai Karabalin told reporters oil production at another giant oil field, Kashagan, was expected to restart by end-2016. He said it was hard to predict when output might reach 375,000 bpd. \n(Additional reporting by Raushan Nurshayeva; Writing by Katya Golubkova/Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by David Holmes/Andrew Osborn) Tweet WHAT DO YOU THINK?
