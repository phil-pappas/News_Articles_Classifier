He was subsequently stripped of his knighthood but retained an annual pension of £342,500. \nHe later told a committee of MPs he \"could not be more sorry\" for what had happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:14:13.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
