( bit.ly/1MdJAyl )\nThe company said it was aware of two injuries due to wiring harnesses wear, but no accidents.\nFCA US also said an additional 156,498 heavy-duty trucks were being recalled as they were supplied with steering components that may have welds with insufficient fusion. This may cause separation and lead to diminished steering response.\nThe company said it was aware of a single minor accident in the United States related to the condition of bracket welds, but was unaware of any injuries.\nAs well, about 188,000 vehicles are being recalled to make their side-curtain air-bags compliant with a federal regulation to reduce the risk of rear occupant ejection during a rollover.\nThe company is also recalling 323,183 trucks in Canada, Mexico and outside the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region to fix wiring harnesses and bracket welds.
