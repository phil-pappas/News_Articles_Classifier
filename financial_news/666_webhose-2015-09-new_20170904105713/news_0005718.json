That is why, last week, when I heard that TSC was conducting a register of all teachers in schools as they prepare the September payroll, I, with a heavy heart, went to school. That, however, was not the only reason why I went. \nAs you know, with Bensouda as the headmistress of Mwisho wa Lami Primary School, this school is as good as without an HM. She is rarely in school, she has no solid plans of improving academics here, and has made enemies in almost every teacher in the staffroom. \nAny keen observer will admit that the real HM of this school is yours truly - and that this school would be better had I been given the full powers. In my head, for example, I have a 10-year strategic plan for this school which, if I am given the space to implement, will take this school to echelons only dreamt off. \nSo when I heard that the TSC was conducting a roll call of all school heads, and that those who would be absent and unable to explain why their staff were not in school would face disciplinary action, I knew this was my chance to be promoted as there was no way Bensouda would come. \nSo last Tuesday, I went to school and sat in my office. But it would appear as though Bensouda, a lazy and poor worker, was ahead of me. She sent me an SMS at 8 am. \"I hop you are inside school. I am fur in Nairobi but have told the AEO that you are presenting me.\" \nFrom the look of things, my plan would not work for me, as my presence in school only confirmed her presence. \nBeing alone in school was so boring - not because I missed the company of other teachers anyway. Since she knew we were away, the school cook did not bring the 10 o'clock tea, nor was lunch served! \nBy noon, no one had come to take roll call so I left school and went to Branton's school to pick him up. As you know, as part of the expected improved lifestyle once we get a salary increment, I took Branton to an academy. \nHe now goes to Busy Bees Academy, a private school started by Tito at his parents' home. You all remember Tito. He was an untrained teacher here who was sacked after Sandra, a Class Eight pupil, was suspected to have slept at his place. \n'WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AT HOME?' \nTo make ends meet, he started conducting tuition at his home and come January, he opened the school. His students are the children of who is who in Mwisho wa Lami - teachers, the shopkeeper, Apostle Elkana and the nurses. \nFollowing the teachers strike, there has been an increase in the number of students at his school. \nSandra, the lady who cost him his job, sat her KCPE last year, and is now Tito's wife, as well as the deputy headmistress of Busy Bees Academy. \nI arrived at school just when Branton's class was breaking. \nTito called me to his office, which is actually his simba. He told me that he had started tuition for Classes 7 and 8 students and that he expected a lot of students that afternoon. \"I don't have enough teachers, can you help in teaching this afternoon?\" he asked me. \nI politely declined. \n\"Dre, consider it. So what are you going to do at home?\" he asked me. I ignored him, picked Branton and walked home with the boy in tow. \nFiolina was seated under the mango tree with her friends; picking dirt from beans. I went straight to the house expecting to find a meal. There was nothing. I asked Branton to check in the kitchen if there was anything to bite but he returned to report that there was none, disappointment on his face. \nWe sat in the house as we waited for Fiolina to finish with her friends. It was such a long wait. It was almost 4 pm when they left and she came to the house. \n\"How are you my boys?\" she greeted us, although there was something in her voice that every experienced husband would tell you was a sign that she was spoiling for a fight. \nSensing this, I sent Branton to his grandmother's house. \n\"There is nothing anyone can eat here?\" I asked. \"Remember I took no breakfast.\" \nShe was singing and continued singing as if she hadn't heard what I said. I was sure she had heard. \n\"Fiolina, did you hear me?\" I asked her. \n\"Yes I heard,\" she answered almost rudely. \"And what was I to prepare?\" she asked me. \"Have you bought anything in this house for me to cook? Was I to cook stones?\" \n\"But you have never said there is no food,\" I answered. \n\"Are you blind? Can't you see we have been eating beans that your mother gives me every day?\" she asked. \"Did you want me to announce on Radio Ingo that we have no food?\" \n\"Ok ok Fio, you know we have not been paid,\" I started. \n\"Don't lie to me, I know your salary was not increased but you were paid your salary,\" she answered. \n\"That is not what we should have been paid,\" I said. \n'YOU ARE THE MAN' \n\"You are not the only one and there are many men even here in Mwisho wa Lami who never received any salary but there is food in their houses,\" she said. \n\"Ok Fiolina, write me a list for shopping I see what I can go buy you,\" I said, secretly wishing that she did not. The last time she wrote me a shopping list and I followed it, my whole salary was spent on house shopping. \n\"You are the man, go and buy what you want us to eat,\" she said, then left. \nI was pleasantly surprised to get some Sh1,500 in the pockets of one of my Kaunda suits. I must have left it there. I immediately left with Branton to the market and bought some sugar, bread, salt, rice, wheat flour for chapati and cooking oil. I gave them to Branton to take home and walked to Hitler's. There I found other teachers. \n\"The schools should be opened soon,\" said Kizito as he gulped down the first Pick-Up at a go - we call that kind of drinking One Touch! \n\"I keep quarrelling with my wife every day,\" he added. \"We have just quarrelled over nothing. This would never have happened if I was busy at school,\" he added \nJuma, who had also come to Hitler's after such a long time - he had previously upgraded to Cosmos - also shared similar sentiments. \"You can imagine us who are not used to sitting in the house the whole day. We haven't been speaking since Monday yet I have no school to go to and no money to do anything constructive.\" \nI shared with Kizito Tito's request and we agreed that if by next week the strike will still be on, we will start teaching at Tito's academy. We knew he wouldn't pay much but it would occupy our time and we would be happy even if he gave us just enough for a drink at Hitler's. \nI was still thinking of this when my phone rang. It was an SMS from Fiolina. \"I putted my money in your green court. Did you saw it? Ilikuwa pesa ya chama na wako hapa.\" \nThat was more trouble for me. This strike should end already!
