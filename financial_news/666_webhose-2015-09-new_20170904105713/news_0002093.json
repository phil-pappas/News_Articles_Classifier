From January through June, the relationship broke down, with stocks showing they could rally without a weaker currency as investors focused on corporate governance improvements and company earning outlooks.\n“Japan is back to becoming a macro trade,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd in Tokyo. “For macro investors, this is great news, but for stock pickers, it’s a hard market to invest in. It’s likely to continue as we head toward the Fed meeting.”\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg are about evenly split on whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Last month’s surprise currency devaluation by China sparked a $6.9 trillion flight from global equities and a surge in volatility, leaving the Fed watching markets as much as markets are watching the Fed. The yen has strengthened 3.9 percent amid the stock rout, while the Topix is down 12 percent.\nGlobal Moves “Japan is again driven by global risk-off moves, so if global risk money flows out of Japan, it also leads to a gain in the yen,” said Tomohiro Okawa, an equity strategist at UBS Group AG. When the correlation between the two broke down earlier this year, “capital was flowing into sectors that had nothing to do with the currency and were outperforming.”\nInsurers, retailers, banks and consumer lenders were some of the best performers on the Topix through the first half of this year, while exporters underperformed.\nThe 60-day correlation between the Topix and dollar-yen was at 0.7 on Friday. It touched 0.77 on Sept. 4, the highest in Bloomberg data going back to 1971, with a reading of 1 meaning the two measures move in lockstep. As recently as May, the correlation was zero, showing no relationship.\nNLI Research Institute’s chief equity strategist Shingo Ide says he’s struggling to decipher which asset is moving the other, or if investors are hedging their stock investments with the yen, causing them to move in tandem.\n“I don’t know which is the chicken and which is the egg,” said Ide. “They’re definitely linked. It could be that they’re being bought and sold as a single-set trade.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T02:06:18.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
