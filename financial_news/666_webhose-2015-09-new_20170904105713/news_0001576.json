It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was buying 120.00 yen in Tokyo early trade, compared with 120.90 yen in Asia Thursday. The euro was at $1.1405 against $1.1302 a day earlier. \nStruggling emerging market currencies, which have been rising this week on hopes the bank would hold fire, were also higher. The South Korea won added 0.05 percent, the Malaysian ringgit gained 0.60 percent and the Singapore dollar was 0.15 percent higher. \n- 'Breathing room' - \n\"For emerging-market central bankers, the Fed has given them some much-needed breathing room,\" said Jonathan Lewis, a principal at New York-based Samson Capital Advisors LLC. \n\"Postponing a Fed tightening gives these central bankers room to be more accommodative, without their actions being offset by a tighter Fed,\" he added, according to Bloomberg News. \nEconomists had warned a rise now could severely hurt emerging economies as investors would likely withdraw more cash to the United States for better and safer returns. \nThis, in turn, would have forced other central banks to hike rates -- at the same time as trying to foster growth -- in a bid to support their currencies and prevent a flight of capital. \nIn mid-morning trade most Asian stock markets advanced with Hong Kong up 0.63 percent, Shanghai 0.33 percent higher and Sydney and Seoul 0.30 percent stronger. \nBut Tokyo was 1.28 percent lower as investors were spooked by Yellen's downbeat assessment of the global outlook. However, it pared earlier losses of almost two percent. \nThe comments also weighed on US stocks, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) all ending in negative territory. \nMatt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co LLC in New York, said that with the decision now out of the way, traders \"are going to start focusing more on the problems that caused the correction in August, which is weakness in China and other emerging markets and a rough time on the earnings front\". \nWorld markets (Xetra: 4WM.DE - news ) have witnessed more than a month of wild volatility after China devalued its yuan currency, fuelling worries about the state of the world's number-two economy and main driver of global growth as well as its leaders' crisis control. \nThe concerns have been exacerbated by a series of weak indicators suggesting growth will come in this year lower than 2014, which was the worst performance in a quarter of a century.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:08:51.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
