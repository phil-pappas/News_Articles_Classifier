But there are bigger questions to answer.\nIs Glencore the proverbial canary in the coal mine? Or, more provocatively, is it likely to provide the resource sector's Lehman Bros moment?\nAdvertisement No wonder the Australian market is tanking.\nWhether it is fair or not, market analysts are saying the stock, which is down 75 per cent since March this year, is now priced to reflect the risk of bankruptcy.\nLow commodity prices, tens of billions in debt, and talk of commodities being at the front end of a 20-year \"bear super-cycle\" are driving those concerns.\nSo don't be surprised if the former champion speed walker breaks into a run.\nAnd the chuckles from the back seats would be coming from Rio Tinto boss Sam Walsh .\nIt was barely a year ago that Glencore was shaping up to acquire Rio.\nTo give an idea of how much water has flowed under the bridge since then, Rio is now worth around four Glencores.\nAnd what of Mick Davis , who spectacularly fell out with Glasenberg soon after Glencore acquired the Davis-run Xstrata.\nHe would be the guy sitting up the back with a couple of billion dollars cash sitting in his new corporate play, X2, and waiting very quietly.\nKat decamps With Kathmandu's survival as a listed entity at stake, new chief Xavier Simonet has decided now is not the time for the adventurewear retail to be – you know – adventurous. Its British stores will be closed and the dual-listed stock will now stick to pitching its tent in Australia and New Zealand.\nOverseas expansion has been shoved to the wide open spaces of online. It is what Simonet has referred to as a \"capital light\" model, while placating analysts and the press at Kathmandu's disappointing full-year results announcement.\nMeanwhile, its recently spurned suitor, Rod Duke 's Briscoe Group, is camped out on the share register as Kathmandu's biggest shareholder.\nNo pressure Xavier, eh?\nPremier exit Former NSW premier Nick Greiner probably didn't want to depart from mining service group Bradken in the current circumstances but after 11 years in the chair it was probably time to move on rather than waiting for this mining downturn of biblical proportions to right itself.\nWith Bradken CEO Brian Hodges also eyeing the exit, investors could be forgiven for feeling a bit friendless at the moment.\nRegrets? Yes, Greiner might have a few as the Bradken share price struggles to stay above the $1 mark.\nLike the reputational bruising from the Federal Court case alleging that Bradken had engaged in bid rigging.\nThe $6 a share offer that evaporated just over a year ago.\nThe $2.50 a share bid that was rejected by the Bradken board.\nAnd the latest merger proposal, which fell over weeks ago when its potential partner, Champ Private Equity and Sigdo Koppers, walked.\nAt least it ended an awkward conflict for Greiner, who was forced to step aside from negotiations due to his deputy chairman gig at Champ.\nBradken investors will get to farewell their chairman at the November AGM, with Phil Arnall taking the chair after the meeting.\nMarket mover With impeccable timing, Gina Rinehart 's Roy Hill mine is looming as a whale on the horizon of iron ore excess.\nRoy Hill boss Barry Fitzgerald has confirmed that the mine is expected to make its first iron ore shipment within weeks, and ramp up to full production of 55 million tonnes in 15 months.\nIt sounds like just what the market doctors ordered to calm down their frazzled patient a little.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:50:51.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
