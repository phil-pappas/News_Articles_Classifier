Shane Eecen Share on twitter by Michael Smith Oil Search has left the door open to consider rival offers for the company after flatly rejecting Woodside's $11.6 billion offer , which it says would dilute its shareholders interests in the company's growth prospects.\nThere was little doubt chairman Rick Lee was going to knock the opportunistic offer on the head, which was reflected in the less than 1 per cent fall in the company's share price.\nThere is still a modest takeover premium in the stock, which indicates investors have not given up on the idea of a successful bid. Woodside they are surprised hich they shouldn't be given the offer was only a 13 per cent premium. The target board's failure to engage did disappoint the Perth-based bidder though and the message is now clear. Oil Search will not talk until a more realistic offer is on the table.\nLee cancelled a meeting scheduled with his Woodside counterpart Michael Chaney on Sunday as the Oil Search board met formally for the first time to assess the offer.\nWhat happens next is more interesting.\nAs you would expect, Lee is not giving much away about what he believes a fair price for the company would be but he says the target would go through a similar process if anyone else put something on the table.\nThe Woodside bid has put the spotlight on Oil Search's attraction as a takeover target and the growth potential of the PNG LNG and the Elk Antelope LNG development in Papua New Guinea.\nWhile Oil Search's partners Exxon and Total are considered potential suitors, the other scenario is that Woodside's low-ball offer was the opening salvo in a protracted negotiating process which became public before the target was ready to respond.\n Oil Search chief Peter Botten was travelling on Monday, leaving Lee to handle the analysts' call after the company formally announced it had rejected the \"opportunistic\" bid which \"grossly undervalued\" the company.\nHe talked up Oil Search's deep links with the local communities in PNG and the government, which owns a 10 per cent stake in the company, and was among the shareholders who told the board not to back the offer.\nLee says the offer undervalued the company on whatever basis you looked at the offer, including Oil Search's opinion of Woodside's value and assets. He also said there were little benefits in the potential synergies from a deal, besides the usual head office costs.\nAsked about other bidders, Lee said: \"If other people choose to make a proposal we will apply exactly the same test. Our primary obligation is to Oil Search shareholders. And we will be going through a similar process with anyone who puts something on the table we need to respond to.\"\nLee is playing down where the company sees itself now that it has fallen into the takeover spotlight and says there is nothing that has made it re-assess its priorities.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR", "http://www.twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-14T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:08:49.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
