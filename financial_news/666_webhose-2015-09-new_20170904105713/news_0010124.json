There are lots of factors which are having an impact and that should be taken into consideration very carefully.\" \nMaduro, who often puts a positive spin on the results of Venezuelan lobbying of OPEC, said he and Putin had agreed on \"some initiatives\" to stabilize the oil market. \n\"The initiatives will be known once they are in full swing,\" state news agency AVN quoted Maduro as saying to Russian television network RT, without providing further details. \nVenezuela is an OPEC member but Russia is not. Moscow has so far been unwilling to deliberately cut its crude oil output to support prices, and the meeting of Putin and Maduro was not expected to yield any concrete results, a senior Russian source told Reuters on Wednesday. \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' relatively wealthy members in the Gulf drove the group's strategy shift last year to allow prices to fall to defend market share. \nBut a severe recession and shortages of consumer goods in cash-strapped Venezuela have whetted the government's appetite for higher oil prices. It has been pushing for a new deal between OPEC and non-member producers to stabilize prices. \nRussia has been ramping up output this year, extracting it at a post-Soviet record high of around 10.7 million barrels per day. \nMoscow wants to keep production high to defend its market share, and if it cut output it would, in the short term at least, lose revenue that it relies on heavily for its budget. \n(Writing by Polina Devitt and Vladimir Soldatkin, additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer in Caracas; editing by Andrew Osborn, Susan Thomas and G Crosse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:58:41.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
