Photo: Jim Rice\nA lack of competition in the default super fund market could be letting some funds get away with doing a sloppy job of risk disclosure and member communications.\n\"When, as happens in our current system, employers are responsible for picking a default super fund for their employees, the levels of member engagement are low,\" ASIC senior executive Ged Fitzpatrick said.\n\"There is scope that funds could take advantage of the inertia of disengaged members and we want to deter that. How funds are going about meeting their obligations to disclose fees and communicate important information with members is a high priority for us.\"\nThe corporate watchdog's surveillance of the super sector continues to unearth problems with poor disclosure and misleading marketing.\nAdvertisement \"Rollover forms that may have given members the wrong impression that they had to transfer their existing balance to their new employers' fund are one particular issue of concern ASIC have noted,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said.\nHe also flagged the regulator was eyeing funds that push the envelope too far when marketing increasingly popular direct investment options to members as an alternative to leaving their managed fund to establish a self-managed superannuation fund.\n\"We are concerned by promotional materials that misrepresent the level of choice a member can access via direct investment options as the same level of choice in an SMSF\".\nInadequate risk disclosure was also an enduring problem at some funds, he said.\nThis comes as the prudential regulator also flagged it is worried that many super funds need to develop more-sophisticated techniques to track and model their investment risks.\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority head of investment risk Craig Roodt said many funds need to do a better job of tracking and managing their \"liquidity risk\".\n\"We want to see that someone is responsible for checking assumptions about liquidity risk, that there is rigour around the process, and that the assumptions drawn appear reasonable\".\nWhile liquidity is not a high concern in the current market, APRA is worried about what would happen in another global financial crisis, especially as super funds are increasing their exposure to \"alternative\" assets .\nMr Fitzpatrick and Mr Roodt spoke at the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees annual investment conference on the Gold Coast on Thursday.\nThe government's plans to overhaul the board rules for funds and the default super selection process have been a hot topic of conversation on the sidelines of the gathering.\nLast month, Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg flagged the government wants to strip industrial umpire the Fair Work Commission of its responsibility for overseeing how employers select the default super fund their workers' compulsory contributions are paid into . Currently default super funds are nominated in award wage and enterprise bargaining agreements.\nNon-profit super funds, which the AIST represents, dominate the $9 billion-a-year default super market.\nThe government is trying to shore up support in the Senate for its bill requiring all super funds to appoint a minimum of a third independent directors and an independent chair, a reform targeting the representational model of union-aligned industry and public sector funds.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/fair-work-commission-set-to-lose-control-of-default-super-20150807-gitsen", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/low-growth-pushing-super-funds-into-more-opaque-alternative-assets-20150902-gjdi03", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/abbott-puts-asic-under-the-microscope-in-funding-and-operations-review-20150723-gij1t6"], "published": "2015-09-03T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:11:35.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
