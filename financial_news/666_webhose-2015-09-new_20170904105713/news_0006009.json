The views expressed are their own. \nLONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - So Russian President Vladimir Putin will get the face-to-face talks with Barack Obama he's been after. Moscow says the meeting in New York next week will be about Syria, the White House says the focus is on Ukraine - either way this will be a potentially vital encounter. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) comes amid a Russian surge in Syria and signs of possible shifting in the European camp on a Syrian conflict which is one of the root causes of the migrant crisis. Germany's Angela Merkel has now suggested talks should take place with Bashar al-Assad, while Paris and London insist he has no place in the future of his country. We're looking to probe further into those positions - which are not necessarily incompatible but do raise questions again over his role in any political transition if it were to come. \nLocal election or proxy for an independence referendum? Catalonia's vote for its regional parliament will be closely watched around Europe, not least in Madrid, Brussels and as far away as Edinburgh. Separatist parties running on a joint ticket are expected to win a majority of seats, according to polls. They say they will unilaterally declare independence within 18 months if they win. While possibly insurmountable institutional hurdles make any such secession unlikely, a strong separatist showing will nonetheless set the tone ahead of December's national elections, particularly if they manage to secure over 50 percent of the popular vote as well. \nIn Athens, newly elected Alexis Tsipras will look to draw a line over the awkward fresh start to his government (one minister already forced out over allegedly racist Tweets) with his first cabinet meeting. Hoping to get further clues on policy for the next four years plus signals on bail-out commitments. \nThe demise of Nokia (Milan: 23568.MI - news ) , Western sanctions on neighbouring Russia and more structural issues such as its ageing population have all contributed to a deep-rooted, four-year recession in Finland. Standard (Other OTC: SNDH - news ) and Poor's are set to review its credit ratings - it will be interesting to see if they are downgraded despite recent optimistic noises from the IMF that a recovery was taking root. \nMARKETS (at 0645 GMT) \nChair Yellen saying the Fed is on track for a hike this year (barring surprises, of course) has pushed the dollar and low-risk bond yields higher. The dollar index is up 0.4 percent and the greenback is up 0.7 percent vs the euro and 0.3 pct vs the yen. BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) saying market is not pricing in a Q4 hike so the dollar could rally a lot further. German Bund futures opened nearly half a point down and cash German 10-year yields are up 3 basis points at 0.62 percent. Treasury yields are up about the same amount. \nThe other big overnight development was a slide back into deflation in Japan. It was not unexpected but it has boosted talk of further policy easing in Japan and will keep alive the current theme of monetary policy divergence between the Fed on one hand and the ECB and BOJ on the other. Tokyo stocks rose 1.8 percent on the prospect of looser policy. The rest of Asia was less cheery and MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's main Asia-Pacific index, excluding Japan, gave up gains and is now down 0.2 percent. A small-cap sell-off has pushed Chinese shares down about 1.7 percent in low volume. \nEurope, though, is expected to rise at the open. Equity futures up around 1.5 pct, marking rebound from losses on Thursday, although European stock markets could still run up a loss for the week following the blows dealt to the market from the Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) scandal and new signs of a China slowdown. On VW saga, California preparing major enforcement action, and Indian newspaper reports that India has also ordered a probe into VW. Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) of Porsche due to become new CEO of Volkswagen. Elsewhere, British government cuts stake in Lloyds again. Adidas (Other OTC: ADDDF - news ) ' rival Nike (Sao Paolo: NIKE34.SA - news ) posts profits ahead of forecasts.Global growth fears and Fed uncertainty hit Wall St, which closed before Yellen spoke, but S&P futures are up 0.4 percent. \nOil is up on signs of firm demand in China. Brent 33 cents higher at $48.50. Gold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) took a hit from Yellen's speech and is down about 0.7 percent at $1,146.40. \nEmerging market shares were heading for one of their worst weeks of the year on Friday while Brazil, South Africa and Turkey's currencies were all slumped near record lows. MSCIEF sees small rise on Friday but China down 2 percent again at the time of writing, ringgit and rupiah also down but real steady for now. \nEVENTS \nSLOVAKIA-FinMin/ - Finance Ministry to publish its quarterly macroeconomic fcast \nVIENNA - Austria industrial production \nBRUSSELS - Euro Zone-M3 Money Supply \nLONDON - Bank of England's FPC statement \nLONDON - Royal Economics Society Monetary and Financial Policy Conference (Editing by Dominic Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T10:44:40.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
