Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. \nEffective September 1, 2015, PhotoMedex, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NasdaqGS and TASE: PHMD) and its subsidiary PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. (\"PTECH\") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Supplemental Agreement (together, the \"Asset Purchase Agreement\") with DaLian JiKang Medical Systems Import & Export Co., LTD, (\"JIKANG\"). Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, JIKANG acquired the SLTï¿½ surgical laser business (the \"Transferred Business\") from PTECH, for a total purchase price of $1.5 million (the \"Purchase Price\"). The Company will net approximately $1.2 million after payment of closing and ancillary costs. \nThe Purchase Price is payable to the Company in three installments. An initial deposit of $300,000 was made on September 2, 2015. JIKANG will provide two letters of credit to the Company for the remainder of the Purchase Price. The $1 million Letter of Credit will become payable to the Company on or about November 17, 2015, at which time substantially all the assets will be transferred to JIKANG in consummation of the transaction. The remaining Letter of Credit, for $200,000, will be payable to the Company by February 17, 2016, after certain post-closing steps including the receipt of all assets at JIKANG's facilities and the training of JIKANG's personnel. \nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of the Company, PTECH and JIKANG, as well customary indemnification provisions among the parties. \nAlso, the Company has entered into a First Amendment (the \"First Amendment\") to its Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Stock Purchase Agreement\") of January 31, 2015, under which the Company and its subsidiary LCA-Vision Inc. (\"LCA\") sold LCA and its subsidiaries to Vision Acquisition, LLC (\"Vision\"). The First Amendment amends the Stock Purchase Agreement to permit an Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10) or 336(e) election under which all parties to the transaction, including the Company, are treated for tax purposes as if Vision had purchased the assets of LCA rather than LCA's stock. Vision agreed to pay the Company the sum of $300,000 for entry into the First Amendment.
