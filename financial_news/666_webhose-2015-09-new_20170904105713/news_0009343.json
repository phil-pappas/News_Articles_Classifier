European shares gain, China moves and U.S. data help Reuters - UK Focus â€“ 11 minutes ago \n* Pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 gains 0.8 percent \n* China intervention helping calm market jitters -traders \n* ECB meeting, Chinese holiday also seen soothing \nBy Atul Prakash and Lionel Laurent \nLONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - European equities gained on Wednesday after a volatile start to the week, drawing support from brokerage measures in China to invigorate the country's battered markets and from expectations of policy-easing by major central banks. \nAnalysts said that U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . private jobs data also promoted some investors to believe that the Federal reserve might not start its rate hike cycle from this month. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.8 percent at 1,404.33 points by 1351 GMT after falling to a low of 1,383.54 earlier in the day. Benchmarks in London, Paris and Frankfurt were up 0.8 to 1.2 percent. \n\"We expect some more volatility going forward, but we see the recent sell-off as a correction and not the start of a bear market,\" Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) Fortis Global Markets, said. \n\"Possible actions by some central banks such as China doing more to stimulate its economy, the European Central Bank extending its bond-buying programme and the Fed delaying an interest rate hike are likely to support the market.\" \nThe ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers added 190,000 jobs in August, against expectations of 201,000 jobs, with a more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report due on Friday, the last monthly report before the Fed meets on Sept. 16-17. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is widely expected to make an announcement on rates at the meeting. \n\"The ADP data also improved sentiment. The market seems to be willing to seize any kind of information that supports the theory that the Fed might not raise interest rates in September,\" IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) analyst Chris Beauchamp said. \nEuropean stocks have suffered a bruising end to the summer, falling more than 2 percent in the last two days after dropping about 10 percent since the end of July, but brokers and investors say there is still value in high-yielding blue-chip stocks at a time of central bank bond-buying in the euro zone. \nChina, the epicentre of worries over the global growth outlook, enjoyed a late market recovery after nine Chinese brokerages pledged to buy more than 30 billion yuan of shares, according to the China Securities Journal. \nThat eased investor fears that Beijing may be intensifying a trading crackdown. \n\"The general level of volatility is going to stay for some time. People are still nervous despite several policy responses in China, but in the short term we shouldn't close at another bottom,\" CLAIRINVEST fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu said. \n\"We had a lot of shorts on European indices such as the DAX and the CAC, and used the last week's pullback to cover most of it. We are long at this point and are just waiting for some catalysts to add more.\" \nAmong standout features, shares in Belgium's UCB rose 4.3 percent to be the top gainer in the FTSEurofirst 300, after Amgen (HKSE: 4332.HK - news ) said its experimental bone drug, being developed with UCB, was found to be more effective than an already marketed drug in a late-stage study. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:35:35.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
