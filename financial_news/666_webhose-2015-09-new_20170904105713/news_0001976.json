As she walked out of the Carter County Detention Center in Kentucky after spending five days imprisoned, Ms Davis was met by a large and adulating crowd.\nOne sign held high above the gathering read; “Kim Davis for president”.\nThe Kentucky social services clerk was jailed on contempt charges for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That, and only that, is the reason for her celebrity.\nAs they say, one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter and her defiance has been celebrated with fervour by the country’s religious right and mercilessly mocked and condemned by the left.\nKim Davis joins hands with her lawyer Mat Staver, husband Joe Davis and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.

Source: AFP\nMs Davis walked free after the federal judge who ordered her to be locked up lifted a contempt order against her, saying he was satisfied that her deputies were fulfilling their obligation to grant licenses to same-sex couples in her absence.\n“I just want to give God the glory. His people have rallied, and you are strong,” she told the crowd. “Keep on pressing,” she added.\nA number of conservative politicians have rushed to show their support for Ms Davis, including presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. Mr Huckabee was on stage with Ms Davis at the rally and praised the 49-year-old. “She has shown more courage than any politician I know. She not only said something, she was willing to put her life at risk,” he said. “If somebody has to go to jail, I’m willing to go in her place. I believe that.”\nHer supporters have framed the issue as one about religious freedom which was reiterated by the former Governor of Arkansas who characterised her ordeal as “the criminalisation of Christianity” in America.\nMr Huckabee also compared her actions to that of Abraham Lincoln because he disregarded an 1857 decision that declared black people weren’t fully human. His praise echoed that of other conservatives who have likened Miss Davis to civil rights hero Rosa Parks. A laughable comparison by most people’s standards but none the less, The Washington Post felt the need to highlight how grossly misguided it is.\nKim Davis, lawyer Mat Staver and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee address the throngs of media with a victorious tone.

Source: AFP\nGay couples who were denied by Kim Davis such as Jesse Cruz and his partner Robbie Blankenship have now had the chance get their marriage license approved.\nThe pair were turned away empty-handed last week from the Rowan County Courthouse but returned and had their photo snapped sharing a triumphant kiss with marriage license in hand.\nA photo tweeted by Mr Huckabee with the hashtag #I’mWithKim was quickly co-opted by critics who posted spoof pictures of the likes of Kim Kardashian and Kim Jong Un with the same hashtag.\nMeanwhile countless others have taken to social media to express their opinion on the woman who they view as America’s latest villain.\nIt sickens me that some people see Kim Davis as Rosa Parks and not the bus driver.\n— Matt Fowler (@TheMattFowler) September 8, 2015 Why are they comparing Kim Davis to MLK?\n— Carlos.
