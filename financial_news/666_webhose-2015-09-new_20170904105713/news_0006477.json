In the meantime, the debt-ridden country risks losing 1.4 billion euros.\nDue to political instability and mismanagement, cash-strapped Greece still requires 1.4 billion euro in funds from the 2007-2013 MFF, due to expire on 31 December 2015.\nIn recent months, Greek authorities have discussed the possibility of asking the European Commission for an extension period, in order to implement the projects which were eligible for the MFF between 2007 and 2013.\nAsked by EurActiv if there was such a possibility, a European Commission source had said that it was “too early” to discuss that scenario.\nGreeks say made a request\nOn 20 August, Giorgos Stathakis, the Minister of Economy, Infrastructure, Shipping and Tourism in the Syriza-led government, submitted an official document in the Greek parliament in reply to a written question by Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) lawmaker Vasilis Gkegkeroglou.\nAccording to this document, which was co-signed by Alexandros Charitsis, Secretary General of Public Investments under Tsipras, it was clearly stated that Greece “has already received a negative answer from the EU to the request for a small extension for the MFF period 2007-2013”.\n“The financial crunch, and lack of liquidity have negatively affected the implementation of projects that are integrated into the operational programs for the period 2007-2013, which officially ends on December 31,” reads the document.\nCommission didn’t receive any request\n“The Commission has not received an official request to extend the eligibility period for expenditure under the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy programmes from the Greek authorities,” a European Commission spokesman told EurActiv yesterday (8 September).\nHe added that the EU executive continues to work towards a successful implementation of the 2007-2013 programmes “within the current time frame”, in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 18-19 December 2014.\nThe conclusions state: \"The Commission will work closely with the Member States concerned to find solutions to maximise the use of commitments under the 2007-2013 MFF period and recognises the desirability of delivering long-term projects in the years ahead using the flexibility of the existing rules\".\nOn 15 July, Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis and Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Creţu presented the Jobs and Growth Plan for Greece aimed at addressing the liquidity issue currently hampering the successful implementation of 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy programmes.\nThe proposed measures provide the application of a 100% EU co-financing rate, which would make €500 million immediately available on the ground, and would benefit the Greek budget by around €2 billion in savings.\n“These proposals are now in the hands of the European Parliament, where they were approved on 3 September, without amendments, in the Committee on Regional Development, and of the Council,\" EU spokesman told EurActiv.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:49:52.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
