Louise Kennerley by Ben Potter The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Service and Labor have signalled a willingness to talk about tough tax reform options such as raising the GST and lowering the corporate tax rate in exchange for cuts to tax breaks used by the rich.\nThe careful concession by the nation's leading civil society groups and the opposition at the AFR Tax Reform Summit on Tuesday, marked a promising advance in the stalled tax reform debate.\nIt came a day after new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull declared all tax reform options were back on the table as he committed his government to changes to spur growth and innovation in the wake of the mining boom's collapse.\nBut the civil society groups made it clear the price for their participation in the tax reform debate would be an agreement from business to a winding back of superannuation, capital gains, housing and other income tax breaks enjoyed by the rich.\n\"Let's start by looking for solutions that have stronger equity and efficiency at the moment,\" said Peter Davidson, senior policy adviser at the Australian Council of Social Services.\n\"Then we can turn our attention to issues such as the GST if we can't get far enough down that track.\"\nBusiness challenge On the first day of the summit, hosted by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG, top economist Saul Eslake challenged business to offer cuts to a range of tax breaks such as superannuation, trusts, and capital gains.\n Mr Eslake, a former chief economist at Bank of America Merril Lynch and ANZ Banking Group, said it would be \"hypocritical\" for business to urge the government to broaden the base of the GST without accepting the need to broaden the base of income tax to make space for cuts.\nACTU president Ged Kearney said she was willing to be part of a debate about whether the 30 per cent corporate tax rate was too high.\nBut she told the Tax Summit she did not believe the tax reform discussion should immediately leap to raising the GST to fund company tax cuts.\n\"Having said that perhaps it is too high, I don't know â€“ I'll be in the argument there,\" she said.\n\"But I do agree it has to be neutral. We cannot decrease the tax base. Under any changes it has to be neutral, and I don't think we need to leap immediately to the GST to do that. \"\nBurden on workers Earlier, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said Labor accepted former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson's argument that the burden of company tax fell most heavily on workers and that Labor would look to cut the rate to 25 per cent over time.\nBut, as reported in Tuesday's Financial Review , Mr Bowen said Labor did not accept that raising the GST was the best way to pay for cuts to company tax or income tax.\nMs Kearney disagreed sharply with Mr Parkinson on where the company tax burden fell at last month's National Reform Summit sponsored by the Financial Review and rival newspaper The Australian .\nBut on Tuesday the ACTU president said she was willing to accept that it could be true.\n\"I think there's a danger in saying the only thing that makes a company competitive is a corporate tax rate,\" Ms Kearney said.\nShe said other issues such as the exchange rate, the imputation system, played into decisions such as blood products group CSL's decision to put a new manufacturing plant in Switzerland rather than in Australia.\nMr Bowen said Mr Parkinson's statement was \"a statement of fact which I agree with.\"\n\"I would like to see the corporate tax rate come down over time. I have previously said the nation should be aiming for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate,\" Mr Bowen said, adding that it would not be easy to do.\nRio Tinto Australia managing director Phil Edmands told the summit that CSL had been motivated by tax rates when it made the decision earlier this year to locate the new plant in Switzerland.\nPersonal tax has 'quite a few holes' He said it wasn't feasible to maintain a company tax rate higher than rival nations and regions, regardless of your philosophy.\n\"I guess what the business community is saying is if the UK is moving towards 18 per cent, the OECD is 25 per cent, Asia is moving to 22 per cent, it's just not feasible to maintain a 30 per cent rate,\" Mr Edmands said.\n\"It doesn't matter what your philosophical position is. It's just not practical.\"\nMr Edmands said that although Australia had historically had a big advantage in political stability over other resource-rich nations, some rival nations were getting their political systems in order and as these barriers to investment reduced, \"relative tax rates come into play\".\nFormer top Treasury tax official Greg Smith suggested that the global fall in corporate tax rates meant the 30 per cent company tax rate implemented in 2001 needed to fall to 25 per cent now to have the same level of international competitiveness.\nBut he argued against financing any cut in the company tax rate by increasing the rate of GST, saying that would not be politically sustainable. Instead, he agreed with Mr Eslake about personal income tax concessions.\n\"The personal income tax rate in Australia has quite a few holes in it,\" said Mr Smith, who now chairs the Commonwealth Grants Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:00:10.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
