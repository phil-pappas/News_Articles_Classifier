Photo: Glenn Hunt\nSingtel-Optus has launched a major push to win broadband customers in the bush off Telstra before the national broadband network is completed.\nThe phone and internet provider has focused on selling ADSL broadband to customers in largely city and suburban areas where there were enough users to justify installing dedicated equipment in the local telephone exchanges since 2007.\nBut Fairfax Media can reveal that Optus will ramp up the number of homes and businesses that can use its internet services from 4.5 million to around 8 million across the nation – a move that could threaten Telstra's dominant market position in the country Australia.\nOptus wants to establish a foothold so it can eat away at Telstra's market share once the NBN becomes the monopoly telco provider.\nOptus wants to establish a foothold so it can eat away at Telstra's market share once the NBN becomes the monopoly telco provider and forces all players to compete on a level playing field.\nAdvertisement Most of Telstra's rivals tend to avoid sparsely-populated rural and regional areas because they get better profits by installing equipment in urban telephone exchanges. This has left Telstra to be the main supplier of phone and internet services in the bush.\nIncreased rural profits But the NBN's rollout should make rural customers more profitable than ever before and open up competition. Optus mobile marketing vice-president Ben White also insisted his company would turn a profit in the process.\n\"We've stepped up coverage of our 4G networks into large parts of regional Australia,\" he said. \"Bundling [mobile and fixed-line] presents a lot of opportunities for is.\n\"The products we're offering … are a little more expensive than the rest of our plans [and] that's reflective of the cost of us getting access to those from Telstra.\"\nIronically, this will be done by buying and reselling Telstra's own broadband service rather than installing new equipment.\nThe two new plans cost $115 and $135 per month over a two year period with both offering unlimited downloads. The more expensive service comes with unlimited phone calls to mobile phones.\nOptus mobile marketing vice president Ben White said the company was fighting hard to win more broadband customers. It was Australia's second-biggest fixed-line internet provider until TPG Telecom completed its $1.56 billion takeover of iiNet.\nNBN opportunities \"The NBN is a great opportunity for everyone in the market,\" he said. \"It may not hurt having an existing relationship though I wouldn't see this as the be-all or end-all driver.\"\nOvum research director David Kennedy said Optus' new plans made perfect sense because they would help build a retail presence before the NBN rolled out.\n\"At this point Telstra has got an advantage in that market because it's got the biggest broadband footprint and it has a presence in market where the other competitors don't,\" he said. \"That gives them a marketing advantage as the NBN rolls out.\n\"Telstra will have to form a judgement on how valuable that advantage is and respond accordingly.\"\nOptus is fighting hard to gain more broadband customers after losing its place as Australia's second-biggest provider when TPG Telecom completed its $1.56 billion takeover of iiNet .", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/how-tpgs-david-teoh-snared-his-prey-iinet-20150904-gjf51p"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:55:58.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
