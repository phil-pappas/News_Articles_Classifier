People have tried to draw parallels between what has happened in this case and asking somebody else through the workplace - asking someone out who you work with,\" Ms Proudman said. \n\"What I would say is that they are very different situations. You have LinkedIn, where you are making connections based on your professional skills - and you don't often know those people. \n\"Whereas in the workplace, you will have, I would have thought, developed a rapport and a relationship so that both feel comfortable to take the relationship to the next step.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:39:10.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
