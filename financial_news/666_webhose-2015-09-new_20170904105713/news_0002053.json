This national event promotes awareness of the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals in an effort to raise funds for the children treated at their facilities. Every minute, 62 children enter a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital for treatment. With the aid of national events, like Miracle Jeans Day, contributors are able to help provide comfort, treatment, and hope to millions of sick kids.\nAt Belvoir Federal, the employees came together as the “Belvoir Believers” to make personal donations to this cause and wear jeans throughout the week to show their support.\nThe credit union created a team micro-site through the Miracle Jeans Day Website where employees could donate funds directly online. The monetary goal for the event was achieved with 113% of the objective being met. One hundred percent of the donations will be made to the local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital.\nAbout Children’s Miracle Network Hospital\nSince 1983 Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals have raised more than $5 billion, most of which was a $1 at a time. The money was given to over 160 children’s hospitals across the United States and Canada. The donations support research and training, purchase equipment, and pay for uncompensated care, all of which go to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.
