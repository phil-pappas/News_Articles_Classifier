Since his arrest, the trader has spoken in his defense only once, when he said he had done “nothing wrong” during a court hearing in May.\nU.S. authorities allege that Mr. Sarao earned $40 million in profits by using an illegal trading strategy known as ‘spoofing’ and contributed to the swift drop in stocks on May 6, 2010, known as the ‘flash crash.’\nThe U.S. Justice Department has alleged the trader worked with a customized version of software known as the matrix in a deliberate attempt to ‘spoof” markets, according to an indictment made public by a Chicago court earlier this month.\nWhen ‘spoofing’ markets, a trader places big orders for stocks, bonds or futures to move the price of the security up or down. The trader then cancels the order just before it is executed and trades in the opposite direction, taking advantage of the temporary move in the price.\nWrite to Chiara Albanese at chiara.albanese@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KM494_SARAOj_JV_20150925170422.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T16:49:22.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
