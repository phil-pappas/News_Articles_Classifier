Photo: Louise Kennerley\nNew Zealand's finance minister Bill English says the country's banks – Australia's big four – are expecting a tick-up in bad loans this year as low milk prices pressure the dairy sector , but they don't think this will impact on profits and remain supportive of NZ agriculture.\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates last Thursday for the third time this year , to head off slowing growth amid weak dairy prices and softer construction activity.\nIn an interview with Fairfax Media after the cut, Mr English said the big banks are passing it on to customers with variable mortgages, but pointed to the big swing into fixed rate loans over the past 12 months. About 60 per cent of mortgages in New Zealand are on two-year fixed rates, contrasting with Australia where most mortgages remain on variable rates despite historic low interest rates.\nThe RBNZ cut will relieve pressure on struggling dairy farmers, and while he still expects many farms to make losses this year, Mr English said most have strong balance sheets due to significant increases in equity over the last decade.\nAdvertisement \"There will be a bit of rescheduling of debt going on,\" he said. \"We have been pleased to see the indications from the banks that they have a sound long-term view about the agricultural and dairy sector and they are willing, in general, to supply the working capital needed to maintain production and efficiency.\n'Banks are positive' \"The banks are being positive and their capital has been strengthened in a way that they have plenty of capacity to actually do it.\"\nThe Australian banks made between 10 per cent (CBA) and 22 per cent (ANZ) of their 2014 cash earnings in New Zealand, according to Credit Suisse. ANZ has the highest exposure to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining sector, while Westpac is overweight small to medium enterprises and has also been targeting growth in agriculture. Overall return on assets is higher in New Zealand than in Australia, but growth is softer and bad debt charges, while very low, are higher than in Australia, Credit Suisse says.\nMr English, who is also the Deputy Prime Minster, said discussions with each of the major banks over the past month revealed \"they are expecting some tick-up in their non-performing loans but are not expecting much impact on profitability. They are able to handle it\". The banks \"have done a pretty thorough job, encouraged by the Reserve Bank, of isolating the parts of their books which are likely to be overextended, and there will be some. They will tend to be larger operators or new entrants carrying very large debt loads\".\nThe RBNZ has said that about 30 per cent of dairy farm debt is held by the most indebted 10 per cent of farms. Mr English said that even if some banks do move to foreclose on some farms, there would be little backlash among New Zealanders if those farms had overextended themselves. \"The public is more likely to be supportive of the sound business that is not able to get the seasonal credit that it needs,\" he said.\n\"The shift in commentary [on New Zealand] has gone more negative than the numbers, and reflects the fact that a lot of people have been a bit surprised by the impact on the economy of the low dairy prices,\" Mr English said. \"But all of this is contingent on how long the prices stay down.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/economy/kiwi-dives-as-new-zealand-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-for-third-time-this-year-20150909-gjj2kj", "http://www.afr.com/business/new-zealand-dairy-farmers-slaughter-more-cows-to-combat-global-milk-rout-20150910-gjjn7p"], "published": "2015-09-13T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:48:29.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
