Petco may also attract interest from other private-equity firms, they said. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are working on the planned IPO, people familiar with the process said last month. Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. will also manage the offering, the people said. Petco is looking to raise about $800 million as soon as this year, they said. \nPetco is in the early stages of exploring a sale alongside its IPO preparations and plans to meet potential buyers including Carlyle Group and KKR, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. \nRepresentatives for Carlyle, KKR and San Diego-based Petco declined to comment. \nPetco started in 1965 as a mail-order company for veterinary supplies. In 1994 it went public for the first time, before being acquired by TPG and Leonard Green in 2000 for $600 million. The private-equity firms took Petco public in 2002 and acquired it again in 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:37:33.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
