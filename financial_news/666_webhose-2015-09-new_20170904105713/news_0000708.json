MMTOY 0.00 % factory on the brink of closure here would be a prize for several auto makers but for an unusual distinction: It employs unionized workers.\nThe plant, churning out a sport-utility vehicle called the Outlander Sport, is the only Japanese-owned factory in the U.S. with a unionized work force. Foreign manufacturers short on U.S. production capacity, including Hyundai Motor Co. HYMLY -0.01 % , are usually deterred by union contracts, which generally have higher labor expenses.\nThe upshot is only a handful of white knights able to rescue the plant. Detroit’s three auto makers are among the only ones with unionized workers in U.S. car factories.\nThe failing Mitsubishi plant is another casualty of global forces moving manufacturing jobs overseas and squeezing profits for domestic auto makers. Detroit’s three giants have collectively cut tens of thousands of blue-collar workers and closed dozens of factories over the past decade, culminating in government-brokered financial rescues and bankruptcy restructurings at General Motors Co. and Chrysler.\nTime is short for the roughly 950 plant workers belonging to the United Auto Workers union and another 300 white-collar employees. The union contract expired Tuesday but was extended until midnight Thursday. Mitsubishi plans to soon close the factory and fully retreat from U.S. manufacturing operations. Production, which has fallen to 40,000 vehicles a year from a peak more than four times as high in the early 2000s, will cease the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\n“It’s getting kind of tense at the plant,” said Kyle Young, the vice president of the union’s local branch. “It’s getting down to crunch time and we haven’t heard anything.”\nMitsubishi is attempting to sell the plant, which opened in 1988. The Japanese auto maker is negotiating a new labor contract with the workers that a buyer might need to assume. The union and Mitsubishi are in discussions trying “to ensure the best possible outcome for our members,” said Ron McInroy, the UAW’s Region 4 director.\nBut the work force’s longstanding UAW ties likely limits possible buyers to GM, Ford Motor Co. F 3.19 % and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU 8.19 % NV, said Dan Irvin, a 17-year veteran of the plant who handles public relations.\nFiat Chrysler, seeking a new home to build the Jeep Cherokee, has expressed some interest in the factory, said a company official, but isn’t close to negotiating a purchase.\nUAW leaders are also sounding out GM and Ford, said Kyle Ham, who’s searching for a buyer as the economic development director for Bloomington-Normal, the two adjacent Illinois cities where the plant sits. GM declined to comment. A Ford spokeswoman said the auto maker isn’t interested.\nThe Detroit three are already in tense negotiations with their own 140,000 unionized workers on a new labor deal, let alone weighing another separate contract. “We could not have a worse bit of timing with the complication of the Big Three contract,” Mr. Irvin said.\nThe happenstance of Japan’s Mitsubishi employing union workers traces to an unusual joint-venture agreement in the mid-1980s with Chrysler, which then, owned part of Mitsubishi. The plant once built six models.\nNow, the one Outlander SUV model built here is a footnote in resurgent U.S. auto sales expected to top more than 17 million for the first time since 2001. Sales of the SUV are up but lag far behind popular rivals made by the likes of Honda Motor Co. and Ford.\nAuto makers rarely acquire failing plants. Electric-car maker Tesla Motors Inc. did in 2010, but didn’t restart production for two years, and did so with nonunionized workers.\nENLARGE Production has slowed as the plant will stop making Outlander Sport sport-utility vehicles in November. Photo: Mike Ramsey/The Wall Street Journal Mr. Ham and others noted the Mitsubishi factory’s strengths: It isn’t old or too big; it could come cheap and be operational sooner than a new plant, which could cost billions and take years to build; workers are already trained. Veteran line workers at the plant make $24 an hour, compared with $28.50 at the Detroit Three, making them competitive in the U.S.\nBut a recent visit to this rural Illinois town presented a factory on the verge of closing for good. Robots carried parts across the plant, blaring “Mary Had a Little Lamb” to alert workers of their presence.\nThat was among the few sounds. The parking lot was half full. The production line moved slowly and workers stopped their shifts 30 minutes early.\nWorkers have long known the plant’s troubles, tied to Mitsubishi’s fading U.S. fortunes. In 2012, they accepted a pay cut to help keep the plant open. The yen’s historic strength against the dollar encouraged Mitsubishi to keep the factory running, Mr. Irvin said. Mitsubishi decided to export the SUVs to Russia, in addition to selling them in the U.S.\nThe plan backfired. Russia’s economy collapsed three years later amid economic sanctions and plunging oil prices, killing the plant’s exports. The yen depreciated, making Japanese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive.\nThose events, rather than expensive labor, endangered the factory, said Kristin Dziczek, an analyst with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KN799_NORMAL_M_20150929144428.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KN799_NORMAL_P_20150929144428.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:52:59.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
