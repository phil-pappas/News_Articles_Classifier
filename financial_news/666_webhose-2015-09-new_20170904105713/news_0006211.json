Leaders of both stressed the need for collaboration and stable government.\nGolden Dawn, a far right party whose leaders have been charged with setting up a criminal organisation, could place third. Such a result would also weigh against the two big parties forming a grand coalition, since that would make Golden Dawn the official opposition, which all mainstream parties say should be avoided.\n\"What I expect is a coalition, a unity government so that it can take the country out of the quagmire that it has been the last years independently of which party comes first,\" said 40-year-old voter Constantinos Parousias.\nSunday's turnout was at a pace that appeared lower than in recent elections.\nAn exit poll is due at 1600 GMT when polling ends, followed by an early vote projection expected by 1800 GMT. Just under 10 million Greeks are eligible to vote.\nBAILOUT AND MIGRANTS\nSunday's winner will need to oversee the deep economic reforms required under the 86-billion-euro ($98-billion) bailout Tsipras was forced to broker in August with Athens' euro zone partners.\nA large majority of the new parliament is expected to be committed the bailout, but with differences on the margin about how it is implemented.\nIn an interview with Italian daily La Stampa, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was confident that whatever coalition emerged would still to the reform programme.\n\"From Monday... we are ready to collaborate to implement the programme to reform the Greek economy,\" he was Quote: d as saying.\nTspiras argues that his tough negotiations with Europeans softened the blow of austerity and helped secure a promise of debt restructuring that would ease Greece's plight.\nHis opponents say his erratic leadership and grandstanding only prolonged Greece's agony, deepened the economic crisis and obliterated a nascent recovery.\nVoting in an upper-middle class part of the city, Meimarakis said Sunday was a day of celebration for voters to banish \"greyness, falsehoods and misery... and bring in authentic people for a better tomorrow for all Greeks.\"\nThe new government will also need to handle growing refugee inflows.\nIn a painful reminder of that crisis, 13 migrants died in Turkish waters on Sunday when a boat carrying 46 people en route to Greece collided with a dry cargo vessel and capsized, a Turkish coast guard source said.\nGreece has been the main gateway for hundreds of thousands of migrants making their way to the EU, triggering border shutdowns and bitter recriminations within the bloc over one of the biggest humanitarian crises in decades.
