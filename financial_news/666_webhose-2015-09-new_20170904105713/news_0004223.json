Another photographer Aditya Arya discovered the negatives and preserved them.\nA mix of big size panels and display boards have been used to exhibit the photographs at the station which display historical collection of pictures capturing historic political meetings, iconic portraits and glimpses into the lives of famous freedom fighter and leaders of India.\nThe Exhibition at the station is curated by renowned photographer Aditya Arya and Indivar Kamtekar.\n“If He was alive and in Delhi today, Gandhi would have gone underground. Not politically, of course, but to travel by the trains of our Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. He travelled by the train in the third class to be like the common people. He appreciated efficiency and disliked fuss. He loved punctuality. He loved cleanliness. We like to imagine that our trains and stations would have impressed him”, said the Curators of this Exhibition.\nThe Delhi Metro today represents one of the shining example for its cleanliness, efficiency and timeliness- something which Gandhiji always practiced and preached all throughout his life.\nEvery day the passengers/public visiting the Exhibition will be distributed 1000 free postcard pictures which are on display at the station. A separate stall for this purpose has been set up at the venue itself which will remain open from 8 AM to 8 PM on all days for next two months. DMRC has always endeavored to promote art and culture through display panels and exhibits at its premises. In the past, Delhi Metro has tied up with independent artists, the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), Ministry of Textiles, Shaitya Akademy, National Book Trust etc.\n 29, 2015 4:02 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:52:37.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
