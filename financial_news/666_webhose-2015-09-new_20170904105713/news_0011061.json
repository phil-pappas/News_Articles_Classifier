Share on twitter by James Chessell Australians have been enthusiastic investors in British airports over the years.\nThe Future Fund has owned 17 per cent of Gatwick Airport since 2010 and also has a stake in Edinburgh Airport. The Queensland Government's QSuper is also an Edinburgh Airport investor. Macquarie last year bought into the Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports alongside Spanish construction and infrastructure giant Ferrovial.\nIFM Investors, which is the midst of selling troubled energy group Pacific Hydro, bought a third of Manchester Airports Group , which owns the Manchester, Stansted, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports in 2012. And if that's not enough, AMP Capital owns 49 per cent of Newcastle International Airport.\nSo it should come as surprise to nobody that a number of Australian investors have been linked to the potential sale of London City Airport.\nLondon City Airport's central location has made it something of a trophy asset for investment companies. Andrew Holt Located close to centre of the UK capital next to the River Thames, London City airport is 76 per cent owned by Global Infrastructure Partners, the US investment firm giant which also has stakes in the aforementioned Gatwick and Edinburgh airports.\nGIP appointed investment bank Credit Suisse in August to explore the sale of London City Airport at a valuation of around £2 billion ($4.3 billion), which would represent a solid profit on the £742 million it paid for the asset in 2006. Oaktree Capital, which is known in Australia for its shareholding in media company Nine Entertainment Co, owns the rest.\nThe airport is favourite among business travellers given its proximity to London's two main business districts, Canary Wharf and the city's \"Square Mile\".\nThis, along with the popularity of stable infrastructure assets among investors, is expected to make the sales process competitive.\n At the top of the list when it comes to Australian interest is Macquarie, whose ownership of UK infrastructure assets is not just confined to airports. The Sydney-based investment bank's collection of European infrastructure has stakes in everything from Thames Water to Wightlink Shipping, a ferry company that serves the Isle of Wight.\nMacquarie, of course, formerly owned Sydney Airport before spinning it off, which makes it a likely candidate to run the ruler over London City Airport. Sources close to Macquarie say this is exactly what is happening although they caution it is \"early days\" as far as the sales process is concerned.\nThey also warn the market for infrastructure assets has become very hot, meaning it is possible even competitive bids could be beaten by committed buyer. It is likely any bid from Macquaire would be as part of a consortium.\n\"Macquarie has its mojo back,\" says one infrastructure banker familiar with the process. \"They are looking at possibilities\".\nOther international buyers mentioned in UK media reports include the Kuwait Investment Authority-owned Wren House Infrastructure Management, Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and London-based investment group Hermes.\nWhat price GIP eventually gets will depend on how much growth is left in the asset. London City Airport is forecasting 4.1 million passengers will pass through its gates this year compared with 3.7 million in 2013. The airport is aiming for 6 million passengers a year by 2023.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/16/heathrow-owner-sell-three-airports-aberdeen-glasgow-southampton", "http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/about-us/manchester-airport-and-mag/", "https://qsuper.qld.gov.au/performance/how-qsuper-invests/what-we-invest-in/", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-09-02T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:11:30.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
