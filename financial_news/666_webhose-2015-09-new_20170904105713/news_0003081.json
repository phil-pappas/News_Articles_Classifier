Symbolising the next stage of growth for the city, the design of the Burj2020 is also inspired by the facets of a diamond - elegant, bold and timeless.\" \nThe Burj2020 District will be integrated with the DMCC Free Zone in the JLT, with its 66 towers and is part of DMCC Free Zone's expansion strategy aimed at providing a commercial property offering unique to Dubai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:38:18.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
