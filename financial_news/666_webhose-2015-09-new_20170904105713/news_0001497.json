A bench headed by FMI Kalifulla while rejecting the SBI plea allayed the bank’s apprehensions by ordering that “the HC order will not be treated as a precedent.”\nAttorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for SBI, told the court that if the HC order will create problems if its 5,000 wilful defaulters queued up before the bank with their lawyers. “And what if the lawyers start taking one adjournment after another?” he asked. “If such precedent is set then the entire purpose of RBI Master circular on Willful Defaulter would be defeated as proceedings of the Identification Committee would become protracted affairs,” the AG said.\nAccording to SBI, the HC decision failed to consider the RBI’s circular dated January 7 which had removed the concept of borrower or a defaulter making representation before the grievance redressal committee. The bank had served the grounded airlines a wilful defaulter notice in August 2014.\nThe facts and circumstances of the case did not necessiate an advocate to represent a defaulter as the role of the Committee is only to consider the explanation of Kingfisher and to find out the correct facts. Besides, the hearing before the penal doesnot does not require any legal issue or complexity which would necessitiate appointment of an advocate, Rohtagi argued.\n 19, 2015 12:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T22:42:28.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
