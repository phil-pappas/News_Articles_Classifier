Eamon Gallagher Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Rene Redzepi may be Denmark's most famous chef running one of world's top restaurants, Noma, in Copenhagen. He may have successfully re-defined the range and style and appeal of Nordic food. But he is facing an all too familiar problem in Sydney – affordable housing .\nRedzepi is planning to relocate his entire restaurant and around 100 staff and family to Sydney for three months next January . He's discovering Sydney accommodation comes at a terrifyingly high price if he wants everyone together near the restaurant at the city's new development at Barangaroo. So far the best Quote: is $680,000, he says in that stunned tone non-Australians get when they talk about Sydney housing . He's still looking.\nRedzepi tells me this when he hears my accent as I walk in the door of Noma in Copenhagen. The entire staff are all gathered together smiling to welcome … two of us. Or so I realise as I look bemusedly behind me to see if they are really waiting for Princess Mary. Nope, no one else, socially significant or otherwise, is in sight on the cobbled harbour street. It turns out the arrival of guests is carefully spaced to ensure everyone receives an overwhelmingly warm Noma greeting from all the friendly hosts standing by the front door. That sort of individualised attention is possible because the restaurant has a limit of 44 guests. A special private dining room upstairs seats 16 more but it is hardly dining en masse.\nIn fact it feels as if there are more Noma employees than guests. Not that the service is obtrusive in any way. The waiters glide quietly around the tables, dressed in trade-mark white shirts with grey aprons that fit into the pale wooden floors and tables. Noma is in an old salt warehouse overlooking the water and with elegant understated Scandinavian style. But there's no sense of pretension or excess formality. Nor is there any suggestion of the double-sitting times increasingly common in many top Australian restaurants on weekend nights. The table is ours for the evening, a waiter reassures us as if there could be no other possibility. So no rush – beyond, that is, the necessity of fitting in 20 (thankfully small) courses, along with a brief explanation of each dish.\nThis turns out out to be a gastronomic journey that delights all senses, at least those left after choosing the accompanying wines option as well. This did include the odd reviving non-alcoholic beverage like turnip and green strawberry so I soldiered on feeling almost virtuous. The food is all sourced from local ingredients and flavours so there will be little exact comparison with whatever is on the menu in Sydney. Australians won't be able to eat chocolate-frosted reindeer moss from Finland for dessert, for example. (Delicious, I promise). Redzepi says he will only be bringing an open frame of mind and a passion for learning from his Copenhagen kitchen.\nBut there will be Australian adaptations of Noma's extraordinary flavours. In Copenhagen, they include dishes like sea urchins and hazelnuts or lobster and caramelised milk or pumpkin, rose petals and caviar or indeed milk curd, sweet peas and oregano flowers served with kelp cooked in a tea of mushrooms. I could go on. Each course is a surprise. Every bite explodes with freshness and distinctive flavour. Even the inside of a grilled onion becomes a sweet taste sensation.\nRedzepi's particular genius is the combination of local plants, leaves, petals and berries and, most often, seafood. There is little meat in the wealth of courses. The result is Noma's consistent ranking as top restaurant in the world in recent years although it is officially no 3 in 2015. My vote naturally is for No 1 next year to coincide with Australia.\nRedzepi and a couple of his sous chefs are coming on another \"foraging\" expedition next month to investigate ingredients. On this visit, they will focus on Western Australia and the Northern Territory having already visited most other states. Redzepi says he's never seen anything like Australia's ingredients and landscapes. Australia has never seen a chef like him.\n When bookings open at the end of this month, Noma is likely to be even harder to get into in Sydney than in Copenhagen. That's even at a kroner cost that worked out at around $500 a head for the meal and accompanying wine selection in Denmark. Gulp. I know, I know. Clearly an irrational indulgence. But what's a rapidly depreciating Australian dollar between friends? What price restaurant magic?\nBarangaroo will seat 56 guests for lunch and for dinner. A drawing of the layout is pinned onto the wall upstairs in Copenhagen, just near the design kitchen where Rene and others constantly experiment with dishes. When we visit, the top word on the whiteboard is \"tomato\" I fearlessly predict the result will be like no other tomato I know. The restaurant introduces one or two new dishes a month.\nThe pace is relentless. When we leave (somewhat unsteadily) around 11pm, the kitchens are being cleaned. This is not for the next day – but for \"projects\" due to start at 1am to show Rene the latest test recipes. There are communal tables upstairs where all staff, from many different countries, sit down to eat together between 5pm and 6pm. The passion to be there so many hours every day has to be all-consuming.\nOne of the sous chefs is Beau Clugston, originally of NSW, with previous stints in other famous kitchens like Gordon Ramsay's in London. He laughs that he ate at Noma in 2009 and later knocked on the door to ask for a job. He never left. I can see his point.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-09-03T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:04:59.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
