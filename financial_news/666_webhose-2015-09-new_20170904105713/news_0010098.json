All these were made possible through one-on-one interactions between the two parties. \nThe session attracted 29 participating institutions and investors from the Banking sector, Savings & Loans Companies, Impact Funds, Private Equity firms, Venture Capital Firms, Micro-Finance Institutions and Other Specialised Funding Agencies. \nMany of the financial institutions commended DFID for supporting an initiative that provides cash and “in-kind” awards in the form of Seed Capital and Aftercare Support Services to MSEs. \nThe intervention, according to them will allay the fears of providing credit facilities to MSEs who are mostly start-ups and therefore require some basic collateral which has been catered for through the provision of seed capital under the programme. The programme seeks to replicate similar sessions in Tamale and Kumasi to facilitate access to finance for MSEs. \nSome financial institutions that Economy Times spoke to at the session related that, there are several opportunities for MSEs, but information gap has made it impossible for them to take advantage to build their businesses. \nJoseph orfson-offei of Quality insurance company disputed the complains of MSEs and some Ghanaians that, insurance companies are not truthful and do not pay claims on time and said, claims payment is base on evidence and satisfaction of the evidence as being genuine cause of accident or loss before claims are paid which is the normal practice in the industry worldwide. He counted that, there are several products for MSEs for eventualities loss or accident that could restore them back to their normal operating status to ensure continuity of business and sound mind against future uncertainties.\nHe therefore encouraged the owners of MSEs to purchase insurance products. \nJeoffrey odame yeboah, head personal banking at UMB and Rebecca nyarku, ag head of marketing for global access also counted a number of products that their respective banks have for MSEs development and growth. \nThey admonished the managers of MSEs to adhere to proper book keeping and always seek accounting advisory services when they lacked it to be able to meet the basic requirement of banks wanting to do business with them. \nHowever, some owners of MSEs re-echoed the challenge of high interest rate, cost of doing business, unstable exchange rate and high inflation as major inhibiting factors for their business growth and survival. \nThe multiyear enterprise development project is to support Micro and Small Enterprises to overcome barriers to growth and improve competitiveness. \nThe Programme seek to equip MSEs with the necessary skills and resources to improve their business plans and internal operations, while creating a thriving community of entrepreneurs through increased access to business development services and finance. \nSince the lunch of ENGINE in April 2014, 176 MSEs have received awards in various forms with additional 100 businesses expected to receive grants and technical assistance from the programme by the end of the year. This will bring the total number of businesses to 276. \nWith the 176 entrepreneurs currently benefiting from the cash and “in-kind” awards, 74 of these entrepreneurs have been linked and received various forms of support from financial institutions with 42 completing and submitting applications for financial support. \nThe Programme has so far committed GH¢3.1 million to 176 businesses. Additionally, the programme has initiated the processes of establishing an Alumni association for the past finalists with the aim to network and also promote business to business to enhance access to market benefits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:31:30.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
