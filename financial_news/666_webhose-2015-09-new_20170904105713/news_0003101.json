Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Commonwealth and state officials will meet next week to discuss the resettlement of 12,000 refugees from Syria who, the federal government has confirmed, will be predominantly Christian.\nAt the same time, there was confusion at senior levels about how long Australia would stay involved in the air war above Iraq, which has now been extended to bombing Islamic State targets inside Syria.\nDefence Minister Kevin Andrews said early on Thursday he expected the presence to last for two or three years. Prime Minster Tony Abbott moved quickly to suggest there should be no timeline.\n\"We don't want to put a particular timeline on this, other than to say they'll be there as needed but no longer than necessary,\" said Mr Abbott, who was in Papua New Guinea for the Pacific Island Forum.\nThis was the same language John Howard used when asked how long Australia would stay in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said, \"We should be thinking in terms of years not months,\" and Employment Minister Eric Abetz said the media should focus on the issue of Islamic State, rather than quibble over the timeline.\nWhen Australia first committed to the air war above Iraq a year ago and sent SAS troops, Mr Abbott said the involvement could last \"many many months\".\nStates offer help On Wednesday, Mr Abbott announced Australia would accept 12,000 refugees from the crisis on a one-off basis on top of the nation's annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 refugees.\nThe states have offered to help and on Thursday, South Australia said it would take up to 900 of the Syrians, while the Victorian government has offered to take between 4000 and 5000.\nThe focus would be on bringing to Australia persecuted minorities who Social Services Minister and former immigration minister Scott Morrison said were \"predominantly Middle Eastern Christians\".\n\"Middle Eastern Christians who have been run out of town in the Middle East now for many years,\" he said. \"That is where our focus will be. That is not to say there won't be people of other faiths who are taken under the program as there already [have been] under the program to date.\"\n$1 billion for extra intake The combined cost of the expanded refugee intake and the extended air war will be about $1 billion over the next four years. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the extra spending would be reconciled in the mid-year budget update to be released in December.\nMr Abbott dismissed suggestions that his government should now also release Syrian refugees detained inside Nauru and Manus Island, saying they will never be repatriated because they tried to reach Australia by boat.\n\"There is just a world of difference and we will never ever do anything that encourages the evil trade of people smuggling,\" he said.\nGreens MP Adam Bandt asked in Parliament about a Syrian man who left his wife and child hiding in their house in Syria in the hope of bringing them after him. He has been detained at Nauru for two years.\nOn Friday, Mr Abbott, Mr Morrison, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and parliamentary secretary Concetta Fierravanti-Wells will meet with resettlement agencies, ethnic community leaders and religious groups to discuss the integration of the extra refugees.\nUniting Care National Director Lin Hatfield Dodds thanked Mr Abbott for the humanitarian gesture.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-10T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:55:30.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
