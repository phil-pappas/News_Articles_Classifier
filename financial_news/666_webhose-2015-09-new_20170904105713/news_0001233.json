The French-based planemaker officially announced on Monday that it will build a $600 million plant in Mobile, Alabama. The company has been at work on its new airliner in Mobile since July. The plant is expected to extend job growth and attract aerospace suppliers to the Southeastern, US. \nAirbus has been attempting to lower costs and that includes opening two plants outside of its European based of operations. \nAirbus still lags behind Boeing in the U.S., the worldâ€™s biggest market for airliner sales. Its 960 single-aisle planes in U.S. airline fleets represent only 20 percent of the total. The company has also been backlogged and if it was able to fulfill orders would account for 40% of the market. \nThe company says most plans built in Mobile, Alabama will be delivered to North American customers. The company expected to start deliveries from its 53-acre facilities in early 2016. The company believe it can deliver four aircraft a month by early 2018. Airbus also produces four A320s a month in Tianjin, China, which is poised to eclipse North America as the largest aviation market.
