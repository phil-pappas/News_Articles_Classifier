By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 13 minutes ago 0.0001 0.0000 \nThe Spanish bank has angered customers by increasing its current account fees from £24 to £60. We look at which customers should move their money \nScores of Santander 123 current account holders have reacted angrily to news that the bank is more than doubling the charges on its popular account. \nCustomers who have recently been lured to the Spanish bank by the 123 account’s perks are particularly annoyed. \nMore than 500,000 customers have moved their banking over to Santander using the Current Account Switching Service launched in September 2013. \nThis is equivalent to one in four people who have used the service. \nSince the announcement that Santander will now increase its fee, many have taken to social media to voice their frustrations. \nMany customers are threatening to move their money elsewhere. But is the account which pays a good headline rate of interest and cashback still worth keeping? Or are there better options available? \n= How is the account changing? = \nThe 123 current account costs £2 a month at the moment, or £24 a year. From January, this fee will rise to £5 a month, or £60 annually. \nFor many, the higher charge will negate the current account's benefits. These include 1pc interest on balances up to £2,000, 2pc on balances up to £3,000 and 3pc on sums up to £20,000. \nThe account also pays 1pc cashback on Santander mortgage payments, council tax and water rates; 2pc on electricity and gas bills and 3pc on communications bills including TV and broadband packages. \n= Who should switch? = \nIf you maintain smaller balances and you don’t take advantage of cashback you may be better off moving your money elsewhere. \nWith £3,000 in the account for example you will earn interest of £90 a year before tax, or £72 after 20pc tax. \nOnce you factor in the £60 fee, however, this falls to just £1 a month. \nSusan Hannums, of Savingschampion.co.uk, said savers with less than £4,500 in the account should consider switching. \n“The 123 current account is only really competitive for those saving between £3,000 and £20,000,” she said. \n“If you have less than around £4,500 you could be better off in a standard savings account when compared to the amount of interest you would earn with Santander and the increased fee. You could certainly do better by opening multiple high interest current accounts that don’t come with a hefty fee.” \nAndrew Hagger, of research firm Moneycomms, said that although there is the option to earn cashback on your utility bills on top of the interest, savers at the lower end of the scale will find that the deal now looks significantly less attractive. \n= Which banks are offering the best alternative deals? = \nTSB's \"555 classic plus\" account offers customers 5pc interest on balances up to £2,000, plus 5pc cashback on the first £100 of contactless debit card purchases each month, and a monthly saver account paying 5pc interest. The most that can go into this savings account is £250 per month. \nCustomers can earn up to £238 a year. \nOther interest-paying accounts on the market include Nationwide's FlexDirect account, which pays 5pc on balances up to £2,500. \nFollowing Santander's fee announcement, Tesco Bank said it is scrapping the £5 monthly fee on its current account for all new and existing customers. The fee was previously paid if customers deposited less than £750 per month. \nThe account pays 3pc interest on credit balances up to £3,000 and customers earn Clubcard points whenever they use their debit card. \n= What about Santander’s 123 credit card changes? = \nFees for the credit card, which offers up to 3pc cashback on spending, are also rising in January from £24 a year to £3 a month, or £36 annually. \nThe Santander 123 credit card pays 1pc cashback on spending in supermarkets and 2pc on department store purchases, with no upper limit. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) pays 3pc on up to £300 of petrol, national rail and Transport for London spending a month. \nThis will not change for existing customers, however new customers will see their cashback capped at £3 a month for each of the three categories. \nThe changes come after EU laws reduced the profits banks could make from credit card transactions. From October, the maximum \"interchange\" rate banks can charge retailers will be 0.3pc of the purchase price, down from 0.7pc on average today. \nMr Hagger said the move to reduce interchange fees was designed to benefit consumers, but for many it’s having the opposite effect and “decimating” the cashback and rewards market. \nCapital One (Dusseldorf: 8CA.DU - news ) has already scrapped the perks on its cards and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) is cutting the out-of-store reward points in November. \n= Are there better cards available? = \nThe EU rule changes, which will affect most credit cards including Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) and Mastercard, mean that all providers are likely to cut their benefits over the coming months. \n\"The reduction in interchange income is likely to impact the majority of Visa and Mastercard-based rewards and cashback credit cards, so beware if you jump ship from Santander to one of these cards with another bank as there's every chance that it will also water down its reward offering in the months to come,\" Mr Hagger said. \nHowever American Express cards are not affected by the rule changes for the moment so it could pay to switch to an Amex card, many of which offer cashback deals. \nMr Hagger suggested the American Express Platinum Cashback card, which comes with a £25 annual fee and 5pc cashback for the first three months, up to £125. This falls back to 1.25pc after the introductory period. \nAnother option is the American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday card, which has no annual fee and offers 5pc cashback for the first three months, up to £100. From then on the reward rate is tiered - 0.5pc on first £3,500 of spending, then 1pc up to £7,500 and 1.25pc on monthly purchases above £7,500. Cardholders must spend a minimum of £3,000 on the card a year to qualify for cashback. \nThe disadvantage here is that some retailers don’t accept Amex because of the higher fees charged to retailers. \n• For money-saving tips, tricks and ideas, get our weekly round-up here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:18:22.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
