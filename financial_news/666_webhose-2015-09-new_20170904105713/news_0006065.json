But Democrats are expected to block the move and force Republicans to bring up a so-called \"clean\" funding that does not target the group.\nThe White House said Obama would not sign any bill that included the Senate amendment eliminating the group's funding.\n\"By eliminating federal funding for a major provider of health care, the Senate amendment ... would limit access to health care for women, men, and families across the nation, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals,\" the White House statement said.\nPlanned Parenthood has come under fire in recent weeks over allegations that it improperly sells fetal tissue from abortions following a string of secretly filmed videos posted online by an anti-abortion group.\nThe group says it has done nothing wrong and that the videos are unfair and deceptive.\nSome Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have said they cannot vote for a spending bill that provides money to Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, some first-term House Republicans on Wednesday urged against taking any steps that would lead to a shutdown.\nIf lawmakers fail to pass a spending bill by the end of this month, parts of the federal government would shut down Oct. 1.\n(Reporting by Washington newsroom; Editing by Doina Chiacu )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:06:32.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
