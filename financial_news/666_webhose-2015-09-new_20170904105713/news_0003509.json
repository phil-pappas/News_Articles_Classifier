Photo: Josh Robenstone\nIt is perhaps the strongest sign yet that the commodities downturn is starting to bite.\nMore than 15 chief executives at the helm of resources and mining services companies have stepped out of their roles in the past six months.\nSo too have hundreds of their workers and senior executives, as costs have been cut to salvage company profits amid weaker commodity prices.\nBut the cuts haven't been enough to save the jobs of some of the nation's top brass.\nAdvertisement The services sector has been the worst hit. As miners cut back on exploration, new equipment, mine development and other costs, service company profits have been squeezed and their chief executives have felt the heat.\nWithin four days of equipment rental company Emeco's chief executive Ken Lewsey announcing he would step down on August 20 , the head of US-based drilling company Boart Longyear, Richard O'Brien, followed suit.\nO'Brien, who served previously as Newmont Mining's chief executive for six years, told Fairfax Media at the time he and the board had agreed it was the \"right time\".\nHe believed the board would seek a replacement who would continue the company's focus on cost reduction but \"faster than we have in the past\". Emeco said Lewsey had decided to step down to reduce costs.\nExpose management teams Governance expert at advisory firm Ownership Matters Martin Lawrence says tough market conditions tend to expose management teams and boards.\n\"And they make investors a lot less patient,\" Lawrence says.\n\"You do see this attitude of, 'finish this and then go' but it is really hard to generalise because a lot of cases are company-specific.\n\"Some of the recent changes are clearly impatience from investors and/or boards – probably a combination of both – and market conditions. We have seen this in other industries too, investors demanding that boards and management respond adequately to what are drastic external changes.\"\nBrent crude oil prices have more than halved in 12 months to $US50 a barrel. The dramatic price plunge wiped about $10 billion off the market value of Santos and culminated in the departure of its chief executive David Knox .\nOn August 21, when Santos revealed Mr Knox would leave, it launched a strategic review of its business.\nKnox, who sat at the helm of the company for seven years, led Santos' costly expansion into liquefied natural gas, including its $US18.5 billion ($26.1 billion) GLNG project in Queensland, which is due to begin production at the end of September.\nChange in strategy Drillsearch chief Brad Lingo was also a victim of a change in strategy after six years at the mid-tier energy player. Drillsearch said the board felt the company would benefit from \"the introduction of fresh ideas\" and Mr Lingo would depart immediately to ensure \"clear leadership and to minimise distractions\".\nVirginia Mansell, executive chairman of leadership development firm Stephenson Mansell Group, says executive changes during downturns are common as companies make tough decisions to \"survive the storm\".\n\"Usually the style of a chief executive that has led a company in a fast-growth market won't necessarily have the same level of focus on operational excellence needed for the downturn,\" she says.\n\"A lot of the time a business looks at non-performance, unfortunately, but that's how they do it because of their accountability to shareholders.\"\nMansell says current conditions across a range of industries were \"very similar to the GFC, where there was tough sorting of executives and changes\".\n\"It is not blue sky and companies are looking to find the strategy that is going to get executives to step up to strategic thinking, work more collaboratively, think faster and own their decisions,\" she says. \"There is no room and time not to do that.\"\nLeft companies they founded Highlighting the severity of this downturn, two men who survived previous cyclical lows recently left the mining companies they founded.\nPaladin Energy chief John Borshoff withstood two decades of volatility in the uranium sector but in August Paladin said Mr Borshoff and the board had agreed he would step down .\nCopper miner CuDeco's colourful chairman and chief Wayne McCrae was pushed out by the company's three key Chinese investors , who said they had lost faith in McCrae.\nOther company situation-specific changes of the guard included Orica chief Ian Smith in March, Bradken chief Brian Hodges and Atlas Iron managing director Ken Brinsden in June.\nAs the struggling iron ore miner Atlas worked to secure a stronger future after coming perilously close to the brink in April, Brinsden moved aside for then chairman and founding managing director David Flanagan .\nBrinsden took an executive role focused on day-to-day operations at the company's three Pilbara mines.\nBut the position was short-lived. Brinsden, who continued to be paid his managing director's wage, stepped back into a non-executive director role in September as part of a continued cost-cutting exercise .", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/energy/gas/santos-firsthalf-profit-drops-82pc-as-lower-oil-lng-prices-bite-20150820-gj42yn", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/gas/drllsearch-energy-ceo-brad-lingo-to-depart-immediately-as-broader-growth-sought-20150702-gi472h", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/paladin-md-john-borshoff-to-take-his-leave-20150810-givkw9", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/heads_roll_hype/index.html", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining-and-resources/atlas-iron-slashes-pay-but-managing-director-david-flanagan-comes-out-on-top-20150814-gizj98", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iron-ore/atlas-irons-ken-brinsden-steps-out-of-executive-director-role-to-save-costs-20150831-gjc79d"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:08:04.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
