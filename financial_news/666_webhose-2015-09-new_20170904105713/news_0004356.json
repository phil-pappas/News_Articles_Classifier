Apple has announced two new iPhone models, namely the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus at the September 9 th event. Unlike the previous ‘S’ upgrades, this year’s models will boast of advanced features like the 3D Touch, Live Photos and the powerful third generation 64-bit A9 chip. There are lots of features to play around with, making it worthy of an upgrade. \nThe iPhone 6S is the smaller model and features a 4.7-inch Retina HD LCD LED backlit display with 1334 x 750 pixel resolution. On the other hand, the iPhone 6S Plus come with a Retina HD LCD LED backlit 5.5-inch display with 1920 x 1089 pixel resolution. Both the models are powered by the 64-bit Apple A9 processor with the M9 motion co-processor, which is reportedly much faster and more efficient than the previous generation. They will feature 2GB of RAM on board, which makes it the first time an iPhone is featuring more than 1GB of RAM. Like tradition, users can choose between three different storage variants, 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. \niPhones have always been praised for their cameras and this year too, Apple has paid much attention to their camera units. The rear camera comes with a 12MP sensor that’s capable of recording 4K videos i.e. at a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels. The sensor comes with Apple designed ISP (Image Signal Processor) for better and sharper pictures. Up front, there is a 5MP FaceTime HD camera with Retina Flash, which makes the display three times brighter, ideal for low light selfies. One of the highlights of the new iPhone models is Live Photos. These are 12MP images that can reveal the moments just before and after the image was taken, offering a bit more than a stagnant image. \nLike expected, the iPhone 6S and the 6S Plus comes with the new Force Touch technology. However, Apple is calling the tech as 3D Touch. Like the Huawei Mate S, this tech can sense the pressure applied on the touchscreen to enable new gestures. For example, the new iPhones come with gestures such as Peek and Pop, Quick Actions etc. It’s really a new way to interact with the touch screen on the smartphone. \nWhile the company has not revealed the battery inside the new iPhones, expect it to be similar to the previous generation models. As for the pricing, the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus can be bought for a monthly payment of $27 and $32 respectively for a total of 24 payments. Pre-orders start from September 12, while the actual shipping starts from September 25.
