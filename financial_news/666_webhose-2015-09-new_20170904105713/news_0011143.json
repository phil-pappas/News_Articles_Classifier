Getty by Angus Grigg\nChina's giant manufacturing sector is operating at its weakest level in three years according to official data, which indicates growth continues to slow in the world's second biggest economy.\nThe official Purchasing Managers Index for August declined to 49.7, down from 50 the previous month. The reading was slightly below expectations.\nIt is the first release of official data since Beijing devalued the yuan on August 11, panicking global markets amid fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy.\nA reading below 50 indicates the sector is operating below its long-run average.\nThe official data from Beijing looks somewhat at odds with neighbouring South Korea, which said on Tuesday that its exports had fallen 14.7 per cent in August, the most in six years.\nThe official service sector PMI for China fared better, falling to 53.4 in August from 53.9 the previous month.\nServices now make up a larger portion of the Chinese economy and are the focus of the government's efforts to rebalance the economy away from construction and manufacturing.\n \"We don't think the lower reading [for manufacturing] is cause for alarm,\" says Julian Evans-Prichard from Capital Economics.\n\"For one, China's economy is increasingly driven by service sector activity, which still appears healthy. As such, signs of weakness in manufacturing are less of a concern than they used to be.\"\n\"But in any case, we suspect the latest bout of weakness mostly reflects temporary disruptions to factory output due to restrictions on polluting activities ahead of this week's Victory Day parade in Beijing rather than a deterioration in underlying economic momentum.\"\nThe official PMI reading is more upbeat than a similar private sector measure of manufacturing, also released on Tuesday.\nThe Final Caixin Purchasing Managers Index came in at 47.3 in August, showing activity at it weakest level in over six years.\nThe final reading was up slightly from 47.1 for the so called \"Flash\" reading in mid-August, but weaker than July's final reading of 47.8 which was the worst outcome in 44 months.\nThe Chinese economy is forecast to grow at around 7 per cent this year, but markets now fear this number is unreachable without significant government stimulus.\nOne sign that Beijing is unwilling to let the economy slow significantly has been a recent pick-up in credit growth, often regarded as the single most important factor in China's economic performance.\nIt hit a 31 month high in July and has increased by 20 per cent over the last three months, suggesting activity will rebound later in the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:23:25.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
