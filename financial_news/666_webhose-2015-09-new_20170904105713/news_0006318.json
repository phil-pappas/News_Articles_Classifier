Pat Scala Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Independent Senator Nick Xenophon said the federal government needed to introduce tougher rules for big polluters saying the current safeguard mechanism would not force companies to reduce their carbon emissions.\nAs other critics derided the scheme as \"all gum, no teeth\" , Senator Xenophon warned the Abbott government climate policy would become a major issue at next year's federal election.\nSenator Xenophon, who lobbied Environment Minister Greg Hunt to include the safeguard mechanism as part of the Direct Action climate policies, said he would be arguing for it to be beefed-up during negotiations over the next few weeks.\n\"We need to make it very clear to the government that it needs to do much better with what it's proposing to ensure it's a real stick rather than just a feather-duster,\" he told ABC Radio on Thursday.\n\"The baseline can be set in a more robust manner to drive changes in the emissions output of companies who have traditionally been heavy polluters. The framework is there but the way it's been interpreted by the government is too inadequate.\"\nSenator Xenophon said the rules needed to be tightened otherwise the $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund - which pays companies to reduce their pollution - would be a waste of money. He said the Senate had the power to disallow the regulations if they weren't credible.\nHe denied he had been \"duped\" into voting for the Coalition's Direct Action scheme, but acknowledged there was a divide in the Abbott Cabinet over how strong the enforcement of the policy should be.\n\"I think there is some in the government who would like this to be as weak as possible,\" he said.\n \"I think Greg Hunt and the government need to realise this will play out as a significant election issue. I think if they don't have an effective safeguard mechanism it will be very damaging to the government's credibility on this issue and I worked very hard to get it included.\"\nMr Hunt said the draft rules for the safeguard mechanism - which is supposed to stop rogue companies from increasing emissions to counter reductions elsewhere in the economy - struck the right balance between tackling climate change and not being too much of a burden on business.\nAlthough there will be fines of up to $1.8 million for companies who breach the baseline of 100,000 tonnes of carbon each year, Mr Hunt said he hoped the measure would be budget neutral and no companies would be fined.\nBut there has been criticism of a watering-down of the rules in relation to big mining projects - which allows them to adjust their emissions baseline - after an effective lobbying campaign by the resources sector.\nSince the March consultation paper, expanding coal and liquiefied natural gas facilities will be able to reset their emissions and not face penalties.\nThe new rules, which will affect 330 facilities owned by 140 companies, will be based on a facility's highest carbon emissions over a five-year period between 2009-10 and 2013-14.\nSafeguard 'neither guard nor safe' The agriculture sector is virtually exempt, while the energy sector will have an industry baseline. The door has also been open for companies to buy international permits to offset domestic emissions.\nClimate Institute chief executive John Connor said the safeguard mechanism rules were riddled with loopholes which would allow big polluters to increase pollution without facing any penalties.\n\"This will lead to increasing emissions. We've got something that's supposed to be a safeguard which is neither safe, nor a guard,\" he said.\nOther critics said the current safeguard mechanism would not help Australia reach its emission reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 .\nGrattan Institute's energy program director Tony Wood said it looked like the Coalition had done enough to get their carbon policies through next year's election, but it was inevitable the 100,000 tonnes of carbon baseline would have to be adjusted to have any meaningful change.\nLabor has proposed an emissions trading scheme if it wins next year's election, but provided no details.\n\"To be fair, both sides of politics are buying time until the next election, but this is not actually constraining emissions,\" he said.\n\"If a company can show it is being run more efficiently, they can increase emissions. If a whole lot of companies do that, absolute emissions go up.\"\nThe Investor Group on Climate Change said setting the baseline at the highest level of historical emissions and allowing companies exemptions from compliance penalties risked undermining the intent of the safeguard mechanism.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-03T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:04:23.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
