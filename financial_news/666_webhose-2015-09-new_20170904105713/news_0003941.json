The first quarter was revised slightly lower to 82.6 percent.\nCapacity use in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector fell amid lower demand for support industries. Decreased oil extraction also more than offset an increase in gas extraction.\nOil prices have slumped over the past year, helping to put oil-exporting Canada into a mild recession in the first half of 2015.\nThe capacity utilization rate declined in 13 of the 21 major groups in the manufacturing sector, making up about 75 percent of the sector's gross domestic product. A decline in capacity use in the durable goods industries was the main driver of the overall manufacturing sector's decline.
