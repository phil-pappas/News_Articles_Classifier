Banks fired dozens of staff in the wake of an investigation by U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . and British authorities into alleged market manipulation, when seven banks were fined a combined $10 billion. \nRBS declined to comment. \nThe hearing of former Citigroup FX trader Perry Stimpson began at a London employment tribunal last week and is due to end on Thursday. Stimpson claims he was unfairly dismissed, saying the sharing of client information was widespread and condoned by senior management at the time. \nRBS, which is 73 percent owned by the British government, has paid $1.3 billion to U.S. and British authorities for failing to stop its traders rigging currency markets. \nAt the time of that settlement in May, RBS said it had dismissed three employees and suspended another two in relation to the FX scandal, and was continuing to review the conduct of current and former employees in its FX business. RBS did not name the employees in question.
