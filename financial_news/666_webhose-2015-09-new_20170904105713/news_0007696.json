The same could be said of the tax law -- it's not enough to recognize what the Internal Revenue Code says, it's equally important to know what it doesn't say. Allow me to illustrate by taking you through the 8th Circuit's recent decision in DeBough. It's every tax geek's dream: a case of first impression that highlights the interplay between two provisions; one widely utilized, the other largely unnoticed. DeBough In DeBough, the taxpayer sold his principle residence to a buyer for $1,400,000 in 2007. The buyer agreed to pay $250,000 down, another $250,000 in July 2007, and the balance of $900,000 over a period of years. DeBough's total gain on the transaction was $620,000, but he properly excluded $500,000 of the gain from his income. The reason for the exclusion, of course, is the ever-popular Section 121, which allows a taxpayer who owns and uses a home for at least two of the previous five years as his principal residence to exclude up to $500,000 ($250,000 if single) of gain. After the application of Section 121, DeBough was left with $120,000 of taxable gain, which was reported on the installment method.DeBough collected a total of $505,000 of payments from the buyer before the buyer defaulted on the loan. Using the installment method -- and after factoring in his $500,000 exclusion -- he recognized $56,920 of gain related to the cash received. None of this was problematic.After the default, DeBough repossessed the residence, and continued to hold it for several years. DeBough reported no gain from the repossession, which raised the ire of the IRS. Why?This is where the lesser-known of our two provisions comes into play, and it requires a somewhat lengthy digression. Section 1038, In General As tax advisors, the client problems that plague our daily existence can be divided into two categories. First are those situations when we recognize that a tax issue exists and are merely left with the challenge of chasing down the answer within the Code. The second category is the much more dangerous of the two – it includes those situations when, because we’re unaware of the existence of an obscure section of the Code, we fail to realize that there is an issue within our client’s fact pattern that requires resolution. With the Code as lengthy and ever-changing as it is, the existence of provisions that evade our awareness is inevitable. Consider the following example: In 2011, A sells land to B for $200,000 in cash and B’s note for $800,000. B’s note provides for eight annual payments of $100,000, plus adequate interest, and is secured by a lien on the property. A’s adjusted basis in the property was $400,000. A will report his gain from the sale on the installment method as provided by Section 453. As each payment is collected – including the $200,000 down payment – A will recognize income equal to the payment multiplied by the “gross profit ratio.” In the immediate case, the gross profit ratio is 60% ($1,000,000 sales price minus $400,000 basis divided by the contract price of $1,000,000). In 2011, A’s gain is $120,000 (60% of the $200,000 down payment received). B later defaults before making any further payment and A enforces the lien and regains possession of and title to the land on July 1, 2013. On that day, it has a fair market value of $700,000 and A incurs legal and other costs of $30,000 in connection with the repossession. What are the tax consequences of the transaction? When presented with this set of facts, it would be natural to isolate any tax consequences resulting from the transaction to B. After all, it is B who is transferring property over to A in the repossession, making A the “buyer,” so to speak. Rare is the transaction that yields immediate tax consequences to a buyer. As a result, a tax advisor may neglect to even consider the impact of the transaction on A, other than perhaps to take bad debt deduction for the $800,000 of unpaid purchase price and to determine A’s basis in the repossessed property. And that’s a problem. Because a little known section of the Code – Section 1038 – provides that A, despite being the acquirer of the property, is not permitted to take a bad debt deduction and may be required to recognize gain upon the repossession of the previously sold property. Section 1038 controls the tax consequences when a taxpayer sells real property to a purchaser and takes back a purchase-money note, and the taxpayer later reacquires the property in full or partial satisfaction of the note . Section 1038 only applies, however, if the following three conditions are met: 1. The repossession must be by the original seller (A in our example) and be undertaken to protect the seller’s security rights in the real estate.2. The installment obligation that is fully or partially satisfied by the repossession must have been received by the seller in the original sale .3. The seller cannot pay any additional consideration to the buyer to get the property back, unless (a) the reacquisition and payment of the additional consideration was provided for in the original contract of sale or (b) the buyer has defaulted or default is imminent. Tax Consequences when Section 1038 Does Not Apply If these conditions are not met, the seller cannot calculate the gain on repossession and the new basis in the repossessed property using the Section 1038 rules. Instead, the gain (or loss) on repossession equals: The fair market value of the repossessed property (at the repossession date), less t The sum of the adjusted basis of the note and any repossession costs. (Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.453-5(b)(2)) When Section 1038 does not apply, the basis of the repossessed property equals its FMV at the time of repossession.Applying these rules to our fact pattern, the FMV of the property upon repossession is $700,000. A’s basis in his installment note is $320,000. How do we come up with this number? Because B has made no payments against the note, the balance remains $800,000. If A were to collect all $800,000 of note payments, under the installment method of Section 453, 60% of each payment received would represent income to A, while the other 40% would represent a return of A’s basis in the property. Forty percent of $800,000 is $320,000, making A’s basis in the $800,000 installment note $320,000.Thus, A would recognize gain of $350,000 on the transaction, the excess of the $700,000 fair market value of the property over A’s basis in the note of $320,000 and A‘s repossession costs of $30,000. A’s basis in the repossessed property would be its fair market value of $700,000.Looking at the transaction in its totality, this result makes sense. At the end of the transaction, A holds property worth $700,000 and has received $200,000 of cash. Thus, A has received $900,000 of value in exchange for property with an original basis of $400,000. This equates to total gain of $500,000, which in turn must be reduced by the $30,000 A paid to reacquire the property. After reacquisition expenses, A should recognize $470,000 of gain on the transaction.When A received the $200,000 down payment, he recognized $120,000 of gain (60%) on the installment method. When A recognizes an additional $350,000 of gain as computed above, A will have recognized the total gain of $470,000 necessary to reflect the economics of the repossession. Tax Consequences When Section 1038 Applies One could argue that requiring A to recognize $470,000 of gain when all he has to show for his original sale is $200,000 in cash and property that has actually lost value is rather harsh. Fortunately for A, Section 1038 provides relief from such a result. Gain If Section 1038 applies to a sale and repossession, the original seller does not recognize gain or loss upon the repossession of the previously sold property. There is an exception to this general rule, however. Section 1038(b) provides that a seller will recognize gain upon repossession of real property equal to: The total of the cash and fair market value of other property received before the repossession (this does not include the value of the installment note or the property itself), less t The amount of gain reported prior to the repossession . The amount of gain recognized is subject to an overall limitation. Section 1038(b)(2) provides that the gain cannot exceed: The total gain realized on the original sale (purchase price less basis), less the sum of: The gain previously recognized prior to repossession, plus t Amounts paid by the taxpayer in connection with the repossession For purposes of both gain computations, the “gain recognized prior to the repossession” includes both the applicable portion of installment payments received and any Section 1245 ordinary income recapture that was accelerated into the year of sale by operation of Section 453. Basis Section 1038(c) provides that the basis of the reacquired property in the hands of the taxpayer is the sum of the following amounts determined as of the date of reacquisition: The adjusted basis of the debt. (This is the same concept we described above – it reflects the balance of the note less any amounts that if collected on the note, would be reported as gain), plus t The amount of gain recognized under Section 1038, plus t Any amount paid or transferred by the seller at the time of repossession. Illustrative Example Let’s put it all together by applying these rules to our original fact pattern. As a reminder: In 2011, A sold land to B for $200,000 in cash and B’s note for $800,000, providing for eight annual payments of $100,000. A’s adjusted basis was $400,000, and the gross profit ratio for purposes of the installment sale was 60%. In the year of sale, A’s gain is $120,000 (60% of the $200,000 down payment.) B later defaults before making any further payment and A enforces the lien and regains possession of and title to the land on July 1, 2013. On that day, it has a fair market value of $700,000 and A incurs legal and other costs of $30,000 in connection with the repossession. Because the three requirements of Section 1038 are met, A determines any gain on the repossession under Section 1038. As discussed above, A must recognize gain equal to the following: Gain Recognized: Cash received less prior gain recognized: Cash and FMV of property received prior to repossession: $200,000 Less: Gain reported prior to repossession: ($120,000) Gain before application of limitation: $80,000 (1) This gain is subject to an overall limitation as computed below: Overall Gain Limitation: Total gain realized less prior gain recognized and cash paid Sales price of land: $1,000,000 Less: adjusted basis of land at sale ($400,000) Total gain realized on sale $600,000 Less: gain reported prior to repossession ($120,000) Less: money paid in connection with repossession ($30,000) Limitation on amount of gain: $450,000 (2) Gain resulting from the repossession (lesser of 1 or 2) $80,000 As required by Section 1038, the character of the $80,000 gain would be the same as the character originally recognized by A on the original sale. Next, we compute A’s basis in the repossessed property as follows: Computation of basis in repossessed property: Adjusted basis of buyer’s debt: $320,000* Plus: Gain resulting from repossession: $80,000 Plus: Money paid in connection with repossession $30,000 Basis in repossessed property: $430,000 * $800,000 balance of note less $480,000 (80% gross profit percentage * $800,000 balance While at first blush, the rules of Section 1038 seem to represent a tangle of computational requirements that serve no larger purpose, there is a method to the madness. The goal of Section 1038 is to put the seller in the same position after the repossession that he or she was in prior to the original sale . If we work backwards in the example above, our seller is in exactly the same place he was prior to the original sale – he has a basis in the property of $400,000 with an additional kicker for the cash he paid to reacquire the property of $30,000. Because his basis remains the same, it is as if A never sold the property. Thus, it stands to reason that any cash received on the initial sale should be reported as gain, or else A would enjoy the benefit of both retaining the property with its initial basis and receiving tax-free cash. To avoid this result of tax-free cash, the entire $200,000 of cash A received on the initial sale must be reported as gain. To that end, A reported $120,000 of gain related to the sale on the installment method as he collected payments due on the note. The remaining portion that must be recognized upon repossession, then, is $80,000. This is also the result we get under the computational requirements of Section 1038, proving that the process works. Application of Section 1038 to DeBough In early 2014, DeBough provided a case of first impression for the Tax Court with regard to Section 1038, and it offered fascinating insight into how the smallest big of language in the Code can have wide-ranging implications, and how the absence of language is often more important than its presence.Remember -- DeBough sold his principle residence on the installment basis for $1,400,000. After excluding $500,000 of gain under Section 121, collecting $505,000 in cash and recognizing $56,920 of gain related to the cash received, DeBough repossessed the residence and continued to hold it. He reported no gain related to the repossession.As we discussed, under Section 1038, DeBough's repossession was a taxable event, because DeBough collected $505,000 of cash, but recognized only $56,920 of gain. Under the formulas we learned above, DeBough should be required by Section 1038 to recognize gain equal to the excess of the cash received ($505,000) over the previously recognized gain ($56,920), or $448,080.DeBough countered with a compelling argument -- since the gain on repossession related to his principal residence, shouldn't he be able to use his $500,000 Section 121 exclusion to eliminate the gain? After all, had the buyer actually made all of the payments, DeBough would have been entitled to exclude $500,000 of gain; why should he be robbed of that opportunity just because the buyer failed to live up to his end of the bargain?In ruling against DeBough in 2014, the Tax Court examined the language of Section 1038 and focused on subparagraph (e). This section provides that \"if gain on the sale of property is not recognized under Section 121, and within one year after the date of reacquisition the property is resold by the seller, the seller need not recognize gain under Section 1038, and the resale of the property is treated as part of the transaction constituting the original sale.\"In simpler terms, this means that if DeBough took back the residence and sold it again within one year, he could exclude the repossession gain under Section 121. Both sides agreed that this wasn't applicable, because DeBough did not resell the property after it was repossessed. The fact that Section 1038(e) didn't apply, however, did nothing to quell DeBough's argument that Section 121 should govern the gain on his repossession.For the Tax Court, however, Section 1038(e) was all it needed to see, even if it didn't apply to DeBough. Because in applying the law, the Tax Court stated that because Section 1038(e) exists, whoever drafted Section 1038 was well aware of the presence of Section 121. And had that drafter desired to apply Section 121 to a taxpayer's gain on repossession in a broader context, it could have done so. Because the drafter instead limited the application of Section 121 to situations where the selling taxpayer repossesses the residence and sells it again within one year, the Tax Court could only infer that Section 121 was not intended to apply at any other time. Stated in another manner, like a true jazz aficionado, the Tax Court was giving weight to what wasn't there. As a result, DeBough was forced to recognize gain of $448,080 on the repossession.Late last week, the 8th Circuit heard DeBough's appeal. The taxpayer, again agreeing that Section 1038(e) did not apply to his repossession because he did not subsequently sell the property, argued that the \"Code is silent on the question\" of whether the principal residence exclusion remains available even when the repossessed property is not sold within one year, as is required by Section 1038(e). DeBough maintained that there is nothing in the Code that requires a taxpayer to recognize gain that was previously excluded under Section 121.In siding with the Tax Court, the 8th Circuit, like the lower court before it, focused on the language that wasn't in Section 1038: That Congress added Section 1038(e) to the statute also supports the Tax Court's conclusion in this case. If a taxpayer reacquires a principal residence, but resells it “within 1 year after the date of the reacquisition,” the general rule in Section 1038(b) for calculating gain on a reacquisition does not apply. DeBough asserts that silence on the question means the principal-residence exclusion is available regardless of when the reacquired property is resold. But if DeBough is right, then the Section 1038(e) exception for reacquisition of a principal residence that is sold within one year is completely unnecessary. It is a settled rule of statutory construction that “we must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect.” Section 1038(e) has no “operative effect” if a taxpayer may claim the principal-residence exclusion regardless of whether, upon reacquisition, he resold the property within one year, resold it after more than one year had passed, or never resold the property. We decline to render part of a statute entirely superfluous. This left DeBough with nearly half-a-million in additional income, and if the experts are to be believed, a far better ear for jazz.follow along on twitter @nittigrittytax", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T05:16:36.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
