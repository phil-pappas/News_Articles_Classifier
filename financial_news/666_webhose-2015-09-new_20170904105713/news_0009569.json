The downturn, in fact, is helping ease inflation as consumption falls.\nStill, President Dilma Rousseff's inability to plug a widening fiscal deficit that threatens Brazil's investment-grade rating is raising pressure on the central bank.\nHigh government spending combined with a sharp depreciation of the real due to fears of a weaker Chinese economy could fuel inflation already hovering near 12-year highs. The real has slid about 30 percent since the bank's last meeting to its weakest in nearly 13 years.\nSao-Paulo based Banco Fator calculates that at current levels the weaker real is likely to push up inflation by about 0.2 to 0.5 of a percentage point.\n\"Torn between these conflicting influences, the (bank)committee is likely to leave the base rate unchanged at 14.25 percent,\" economists with Brasil Plural said in a research note. \"Perhaps reinforcing the message that this will contribute to ensure convergence of inflation to the target.\"\nTo keep inflation expectations in check the bank has warned that it will act decisively to prevent consumer price growth from deviating significantly from the government's target.\nDespite the slowdown, annual inflation climbed to 9.57 percent in the month to mid-August, more than double the official target center of 4.5 percent.\nA sharp increase in government-regulated prices such as electricity has continued to fuel inflation, but many economists believe price increases may have peaked last month.
