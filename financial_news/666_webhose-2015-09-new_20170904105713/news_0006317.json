Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket suffered another dramatic turnaround after an early rally quickly turned sour, as disappointing economic data directed investor attention to domestic issues.\nAt close of trade on Thursday, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 ended 74 points or 1.4 per cent lower to 5027.8 , while the broader All Ordinaries closed 71 points down to 5048.6.\n\"Right here, right now, this is an Australian economy issue,\" IG chief markets strategist Chris Weston said.\nAsian equity markets traded higher, after strong gains on Wall Street on Wednesday night, while US futures, which have been a leading indicator for Asian markets, also pointed towards gains. That implied Thursday's Australian sharemarket losses were related to domestic issues, Mr Weston said.\n\"What we're seeing is a feedback loop between the perception of the Australian economy and where it is going, and that is feeding back into the sharemarket.\"\nThe early rally, which had the ASX rise as much as 1.5 per cent, quickly fizzled and worsened upon the release of disappointing Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, which revealed retail sales in July shrank 0.1 per cent, well below market consensus expectations for a 0.4 per cent rise.\nThe numbers came a day after Australia's GDP recorded a weaker-than-expected 0.2 per cent rise for the June quarter , the slowest growth in more than two years.\nNews that Australia's trade deficit had shrunk to $2.5 billion on the back of increased exports failed to inspire investors.\n \"The word recession has come up, people are talking about it now ... we're seeing a few calls that the Reserve Bank of Australia has to act,\" Mr Weston said.\nIn a skittish market with volatility indices elevated, there was too much uncertainty for investors to maintain confidence in the sharemarket, Patersons economist Tony Farnham said.\n\"People are certainly looking over their shoulder to see what could happen next,\" he said.\nThursday's broad-based sell-off was led by selling in the big banks. Commonwealth Bank of Australia finished 2.3 per cent lower to $71.97, National Australia Bank fell 2.5 per cent to $29.93, ANZ Banking Group ended 1.7 per cent lower to $26.96 and Westpac Banking Corporation fared modestly better, down 0.8 per cent to $30.19.\nThe poor retail sales figures weighed on consumer discretionary stocks, which was the hardest hit sector, down 3.2 per cent. It was helped on the way down by the day's most heavily sold stock, Myer, which plunged 20.5 per cent to a record low 90Â¢ upon release from its trading halt from a $221 million equity raising .\n\"It's not a good day to be a Myer shareholder,\" Mr Weston said. \"It is trading under its rights price, so the whole carrot of the underwriting has gone.\"\nHe said investors were sceptical that the company could deliver on its $600 million turnaround strategy.\nConsumer staples were mixed, with Woolworths shares closing up marginally 0.1 per cent to $25.26, while Wesfarmers fell 0.8 per cent to $39.43.\nThe miners fared slightly better than the banks, with BHP Billiton closing down 1.26 per cent to $24.32, Rio Tinto ended the day down 0.6 per cent to $49.27.\nTelstra shares meanwhile fell 1.6 per cent to $5.56.\nThe best-performing stocks for the day were Mineral Resources and Cimic Group, with both adding 4.4 per cent.\nOil Search was among the best-performing stocks, up 3.6 per cent following news of its plans to shut down its Brisbane office as it copes with lower oil prices . Talks also resurfaced that it was a potential takeover target for Woodside Petroleum.\nIn the absence of news from China, which closed its markets on Thursday and Friday for World War II commemorations, investors globally will be taking their leads from the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday night and the unemployment figures from the US on Friday night.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/myer-shares-tumble-after-returning-from-trading-halt-20150903-gje20r.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-cautious-rebound-20150902-gjdyth.html"], "published": "2015-09-03T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:03:13.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
