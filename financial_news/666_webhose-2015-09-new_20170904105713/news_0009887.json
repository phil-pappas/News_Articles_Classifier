REUTERS/Yuya Shino \nBy Saikat Chatterjee \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares fell for a third straight day on Wednesday as weak manufacturing reports from China, the United States and Europe fueled worries about slowing global growth, while the dollar took back some ground lost in the previous session to the safe-haven Japanese yen. \nBut European markets were seen opening higher and U.S. stock futures rose, suggesting some respite for jittery markets later in the global day after Wall Street shares fell close to 3 percent overnight. \nFinancial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open up by around 0.5 percent, Germany's DAX to open around 0.5 percent higher and France's CAC 40 to open up 0.7 percent. \nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.4 percent, though off session lows, taking its losses to 3 percent so far this week as investors dumped emerging market assets. \nJapan's Nikkei was down 0.5 percent. \nBut U.S. S&P e-mini equity futures were up 0.9 percent, which put a floor under sentiment. \nWhile signs of an emerging market slowdown have been evident for a while in the form of falling commodity prices and weak trade growth, investors had been broadly sanguine on hopes that robust demand from the U.S. and China would keep the global growth engine chugging along. \nBut this week's weak PMI data has dispelled such notions. \nData showed U.S. factory activity hit a more than two-year low in August while a survey showed China's manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest pace in at least three years last month. In a worrying sign, new order to inventory growth indicated further declines. \n\"This is the emerging market crisis of 2015,\" said Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer of equities at Fidelity Worldwide Management, which manages $290 billion in assets globally. \n\"While emerging markets are in a far better shape than what they were a few years ago, there may be more pain in store for them,\" he said. \nInvestors and money managers are taking no chances. EPFR data for the latest week showed the largest weekly emerging market bond outflows since the \"taper tantrum\" in 2013 while equity outflows also surged, according to BNP Paribas. \nChina's major stock indexes extended losses on Wednesday, despite pledges by a number of brokerages to increase their stock investments to support the market. \nThe CSI300 index fell 1.1 percent in afternoon trade while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.8 percent, though both were down around 4 percent earlier. \nTO HIKE OR NOT TO HIKE? \nFacing growing uncertainty over policy in the U.S. and China, all three major U.S. equity indexes are now solidly in negative territory for the year so far. \nThe downbeat U.S. factory figures made it appear less likely that the U.S. Federal Reserve would opt to hike interest rates at its next meeting later this month, but markets are awaiting Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for August to provide more timing clues. \nEconomists expect the report to show U.S. employers added 220,000 jobs in August, up from 215,000 in July, a Reuters poll found. \nExpectations of an eventual increase to U.S. interest rates had underpinned the battered dollar in recent days, even as investors bought the perceived safe-haven yen and unwound speculative positions funded in euro. \nThe dollar firmed 0.5 percent to 120.01 yen, after skidding more than 1 percent overnight and moving away from last week's high of 121.76 yen, while the euro slipped about 0.3 percent to $1.1284. \n\"Currencies will continue to closely watch equities, with the yen and euro boosted by unwinding of carry trades in such times of risk aversion,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. \nCrude oil futures continued to drop after plummeting 8 percent overnight after the weak Chinese manufacturing data raised fears of slowing demand. \nU.S. crude was down 2.4 percent at $44.32 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.1 percent to $48.51. \nSpot gold edged down about 0.1 percent to $1,138.40 an ounce, pressured by the stronger dollar, after rising 1 percent in the previous session. \n(Additional reporting by Lisa Twaronite and Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; Editing by Kim Coghill) Asia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T11:53:59.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
