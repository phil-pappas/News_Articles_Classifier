Gazprom abandoned its South Stream pipeline project, designed to deliver gas from Russia to Europe via the Black Sea and Bulgaria, last year under EU pressure. \nThe EU has instead encouraged the development of alternative supplies from the Caspian Sea and the United States. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) an agreement with a group of Western energy companies on the Nord Stream link via the Baltic Sea to Europe will allow it to come online in 2019, giving it a head start on the competition. \n\"The fact that the global energy majors participate in the project bespeaks its significance for securing reliable gas supply to European consumers,\" said Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller in a statement. \nMany Western companies are reducing their exposure to Russia because of sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. \nGerman officials remain concerned about the situation in Ukraine, but have praised Russia's approach during talks to seal an accord over Iran's nuclear programme. \nThey say Moscow has also shown signs that it is prepared to play a more constructive role in discussions over how to resolve the civil war in Syria - the source of many of the hundreds of thousands of migrants heading for Europe. \nTRUSTFUL PARTNERSHIP \nAustrian energy group OMV (Amsterdam: OM6.AS - news ) , a long-standing partner of Gazprom, separately reported progress on its own asset-swap talks with Gazprom. \nOMV chief executive Rainer Seele, a German who recently joined the Austrian firm after many years at BASF, spoke of extending a \"trustful partnership\". \nShell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) 's Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, partner to the pipeline deal, stressed Europe's dependence on Russia. \n\"New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) projects like Nord Stream 2 are needed to ensure that Europe's demand for energy is met, especially as gas production in Europe itself is falling,\" he said. \nNord Stream 2 will come on line just as a rival pipeline is supposed to bring Caspian gas to Europe, boosting competition for market share in the bloc and loosening the ties between politics and energy security. \nNew liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States should also be in full swing by then and likely landing on Europe's shores in significant volumes, an development set to challenge Russia's current energy dominance. \n(Additional reporting by Noah Barkin, Katya Golubkova, Thomas Atkins, Ludwig Burger, Shadia Nasralla and Karolin Schaps; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T13:52:33.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
