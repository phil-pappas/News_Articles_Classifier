AP Raising rates for the first time in almost a decade was always going to be a tough ask, but given the blanket coverage of the whole issue there wasn't an investor on the planet who didn't know it was on the cards and therefore should have been prepared.\nStill, when the FOMC decided to keep rates steady, it didn't take long for the conspiracy theory to do the rounds.\nTo quash those theories, Yellen can make it clear in her speech that the Fed remains on course to hike interest rates in 2015, or confirm that's it likely to be delayed until next year.\nBut there is a catch here. The savage reaction to the Fed's latest decision has led many to think it has a communications nightmare on its hands. Trying to put the latest ructions to bed in a speech could make matters worse.\n The art of communicating clear messages to investors is much harder when interest rates are close to zero, but the latest round of volatility also shows how dependent investors are on central banks.\nIt shows again that it's not money that makes the world go round – it's the price of money.\nTo add to all the second-guessing that's going on, two voting members of the FOMC , John Williams of San Francisco and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta, have both come out after the meeting and said they expect a move this year.\nIt has also thrown the focus on China, the US and the rest of the world as investors fret that global economic growth is in a much worse position than everyone thought before last week's FOMC meeting.\nMaybe it's more to do with current players forgetting what a period of rate hikes does to sharemarkets, rather than anything specific the Fed knows.\nIn the past, the Fed tightening has coincided with other global events such as the Mexican peso crisis in 1994, when the bond market collapsed, the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and the Argentine debt crisis in the early 2000s – all made worse by the Fed jacking up rates.\nIf history is any guide, it's also the first move that has the most impact. Since World War II there have been 16 periods when the Fed went through a period of higher interest rates. The risks have always been higher when the Fed first raises rates, but in time the strength of the US economy has pulled through and shares have recovered.\nRight now any brief run of optimism is very short-lived and it doesn't take long to revert to what's been called the \"snakes and ladders market\" where one small misplaced step sends everyone back where they started.\nInvestors are worrying about a long, long list of the bad things, but there is only a very short list of likely good things – and long-term investment in shares requires enough confidence to invest without any specific certainty about future events.\nThe FOMC will meet twice before the end of this year. Investors think it's just a 20 per cent chance of a move in October; a hike by December less than 50-50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:06:22.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
