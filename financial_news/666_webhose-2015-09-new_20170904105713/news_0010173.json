It was last off 1 percent at $1.1109. It was as high as $1.1332 earlier this week as investors spooked by the market turmoil in China moved heavily into the euro and yen.\n\"Draghi at his press conference raised the risk of additional monetary support by the central bank,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. \"We were expecting some dovish comments, and he delivered.\"\nFriday brings the monthly U.S. jobs report, a key element in the Federal Reserve's decision on when to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.\nThe Fed, which meets on September 16-17, has said it will raise rates when it sees sustained economic recovery. While the labor market has strengthened, inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.\nMSCI's all-country stock index rose 0.8 percent, while the FTSEuroFirst leading index of 300 shares closed up 2.4 percent. Germany's DAX shot up 2.7 percent .\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 103.66 points, or 0.63 percent, at 16,455.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 12.62 points, or 0.65 percent, at 1,961.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 15.72 points, or 0.33 percent, at 4,765.69.\nHelping the stronger tone, data released on Thursday showed new applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a strengthening labor market.\nChina's stock markets, the root of much of the global volatility in recent weeks, were closed on Thursday for the start of a two-day holiday. [\nU.S. BONDS RISE\nU.S. Treasuries prices rose after the dovish outlook from the ECB made U.S. government debt more attractive than European counterparts. But caution ahead of Friday's monthly U.S. employment report limited gains.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 2.166 percent.\nIn the energy market, Brent was up 74 cents at $51.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose $1.01 cents to $47.26 a barrel.
