The trains stayed in place as the trespassers were removed from the tunnel and away from the tracks, it said. \nLocal media reported that the trespassers were migrants attempting to cross into the United Kingdom through the Eurotunnel (Paris: FR0010533075 - news ) , also known as the Chunnel. So far this year, thousands of refugees have attempted to make the dangerous crossing. \nPassengers on one of the London-bound trains, which stopped less than a mile (1.6 km) from the tunnel, were told at one point to be very quiet and listen for the sound of people climbing on the roof. A helicopter with a searchlight then circled the train as guards walked the tracks looking for migrants, but seemingly none were spotted. \nWith the power out, passengers on that train sat in the dark for nearly four hours. The heat and mugginess in the cars rose as conductors walked the aisles with wind-up torches. A woman in business class wept and many passengers said they could not breathe in the stifling air. \nEurostar then pulled the train back to Calais, where passengers disembarked for fresh air and bottled water. But when some attempted to leave the station to cross the English Channel by ferry, French gendarmes stopped them, saying that customs and immigration laws required that the passengers return to Paris. However, Eurostar tweeted that the train, ES9055, \"is unable to be used to take passengers in Calais back to Paris and alternative options are being sought.\" \n\"We've been abandoned on a platform somewhere in the cold with NO INFORMATION,\" tweeted one of the passengers, Danny Bell. \"And enlighten me - at 4am in the middle of nowhere what are those options? For hundreds and hundreds of people?\" \nEurostar has offered to exchange tickets.
