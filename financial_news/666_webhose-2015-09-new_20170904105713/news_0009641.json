Peter Braig Share on twitter by Joyce Moullakis Severe cost cutting by mining and resources companies and a flight by some executives to other industries, has led to an erosion of corporate memory, heightening the risk firms will repeat past mistakes in mergers and acquisitions.\nThat's the view of McGrathNicol transactions partner Anne-Maree Keane, who cautions firms in the sector to look at the history of assets that are being sold cheaply in the commodity price downturn.\n\"We are still seeing the cost cutting,\" she told Fairfax Media. \"My main concern is really around the loss of corporate knowledge ... I worry greatly that, particularly in a lot of the listed companies, is the corporate memory still there?\n\"You can still overpay when something is cheap. Just because something is a bargain … doesn't necessarily mean it is still worth buying.\"\nMcGrathNicol's Anne-Maree Keane: be wary of cheap assets. The external environment, including concerns about economic growth in China and spiralling debt piles at many companies in the industry, has prompted more talk of deal activity and a string of divestments of non-core assets.\nBarrick Gold this year sold its Cowal gold mine to Evolution Mining , while Rio Tinto, Peabody Energy, Vale and Anglo American are looking to sell or exit their coal portfolios in Australia.\nHands-on approach But Ms Keane noted it was heartening boards were taking a more hands-on approach to mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n \"We are seeing more board interaction in M&A, as well as boards and executives getting closer together,\" she said.\nMuch has also been said about deals that were struck at the top of the market. In a note in June, Citigroup analysts cited data showing that the world's largest mining companies had written off about 90 per cent of the value of deals executed since 2007, led by charges in aluminium, iron ore and nickel. The research suggested coal assets would add to writedowns as prices fell.\nPeabody's Australian assets – including its purchase of Macarthur Coal – have dropped markedly in value.\nThe mining industry ranks as the second busiest for announced Australian M&As so far in 2015, behind the transport sector, says Dealogic. The announced transactions in mining amount to $US14 billion ($20 billion) in 2015, up from a sombre 2014, and the highest year to date total since 2011.\nBut those figures are dominated by this year's spin-off of South32 by BHP Billiton. Tilts for nickel producer Sirius Resources and miner PanAust round out the biggest three announced deals this year.\nIn its 2015 half-year update, The Real Deal , which is being sent to clients, law firm Clayton Utz said it expects activity in the energy and resources sectors to pick up in the latter months of the year.\nIt noted the \"need for consolidation\" among smaller players to access capital and achieve greater economies of scale, outlining survival as a priority for many against the backdrop of sharp declines in commodity prices in the past 18 months.\nThe report also highlighted opportunism as a factor, as larger players or investors diversified or entered new markets to take advantage of depressed prices.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/joycemoullakis"], "published": "2015-09-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:11:07.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
