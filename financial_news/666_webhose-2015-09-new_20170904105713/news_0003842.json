Hiring intentions in the US continue to improve, and the current outlook is the strongest since Quarter 4, 2007.\nHowever, employer optimism dwindled in Brazil and labour market activity also slowed in China where employers forecast weakest hiring environment in more than six years.\nMeanwhile, the forecast remains negative in Italy, Greece, France and Finland, the survey indicated.\nFirst Published on September 08, 2015 1:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:17:31.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
