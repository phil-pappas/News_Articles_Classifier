Simon Schluter by Simon Evans If the Apple iPhone is the product of our times, then the fact that the latest 6s version comes with a camera especially built for making selfie shots more flattering, epitomises our era.\nNarcissism is in and where there's a demand, there's money to be made. In Australia, a fitness boom has propelled the nation to have the highest per capita consumption of sports nutrition bars in the world and personal trainers are more sought after than mining engineers.\nFitness meets fashion has enabled entrepreneurs like Lorna Jane Clarkson and her husband Bill to build the $500 million activewear and sportswear company Lorna Jane. Next Wednesday, Vitaco will list on the stock exchange in a $232 million public float of a business that makes protein products and health supplements, capitalising on the rising ranks of gym junkies and the wellness wave .\nBeauty is more than skin deep, it's a thriving services industry that requires skills. Melbourne entrepreneur, Ryan Trainor​with business partners including model and television presenter Rebecca Judd, are doing some serious upskilling with the help of the reinvigorated upmarket department store chain, David Jones.\nNew type of school Beauty EDU, teaching therapy and make-up, is a new type of beauty school, marking a shift from the traditional campus setting onto the shop floor. The move will come with the opening of a new David Jones store, in late October, in a $650 million revamp of the Eastland shopping centre in outer Melbourne.\nThe words \"beauty school\" might conjure up Frankie Avalon urging dropouts to return to high school in the musical Grease . But Trainor, a serial entrepreneur, has grasped how our selfie-obsessed culture is giving the industry a very handsome outlook, while the traditional beauty school is ripe for a makeover.\nDozens of beauty-therapy schools throughout suburban Australia offer diplomas of various shapes and sizes. For instance, the Australian Institute of Applied Sciences, owned by British-based global education giant Study Group, offers a 12-month diploma of beauty therapy at a cost of $15,990 at its campus sites in Brisbane or in Melbourne, or by study online. The online-course fees are identical.\n Trainor and Judd's new business blurs the lines between retail and education. The students, who will pay about $24,000 for a 12-month course, will walk through the doors of David Jones at Eastlandto a 250-square-metre campus at the rear of the store. There is also a 30 square metre nail-and-brow bar on David Jones' shop floor which that will be branded Beauty EDU and host \"master classes\" to give students the chance to ply their skills.\nDonna Player, who is David Jones' group executive of merchandise, oversees what's on the shelves and the floor space at the retailer's stores across Australia. She emphasises that she is no expert on social media trends, but her gut-feeling is that the enormous number of selfies being taken daily and shared through social media is helping to accelerate a desire by people to look their best all the time.\n​\"It's about people wanting to look good and also feel good,\" Ms Player says. The retailer has no qualms about devoting the 30 square metres of space to Beauty EDU in what is traditionally known as a \"concession\" – a mini-store store within a store.\n\"We're not of the opinion that every square inch has to be covered with product,\" she says. \"We also like the fact that it keeps people in our stores for longer. It's going to create retail theatre for us,\" she says.\nPlayer says beauty products are the fastest growing of any segment inside David Jones. She won't be specific, but says the sales growth in that category is running at more than 15 per cent.\n\"It's high teens and we're very happy with that,\" Player says.\nThe beauty category consists of skin care, fragrances, lipsticks, foundations and make-up. Across the industry, cosmetics and toiletries' sales are running at almost $4 billion annually in Australia.\nSpecialist education forte Beauty EDU's Trainor has bought and sold companies, starting with a security firm formed when he was 23. His big hit was the sale of a vocational educational training business to Kaplan group for more than $20 million in 2011.\nHe now runs the Republica education group which includes other specialist education firms, such as a digital design school and the BSchool entrepreneurship program, which uses sports stars, ranging from former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting to surfing champion Layne Beachley,​ to teach leadership. In a competitive market for training where students are customers, Republica aims to offer a more enticing product with serious sizzle.\n\"We're providing both the inspiration and the practical 'now' skills. It needs to be embedded within industry,\" Trainor says.\n\"It gives the right skills and the toolbelt. It closes the loop of supply and demand\".\nTrainor says for too long education has been about creating supply, with little thought for where the demand is, with learning areas in \"beige\" classrooms that are uninspiring.\nThere is a place for TAFE and university, Trainor says, but industry and education need to get closer. \"We want to look at what problem education is trying to solve\". Beauty EDU already runs three campuses in Melbourne, Sydney and East Gippsland in country Victoria.\nRebecca Judd, a co-founder of Beauty EDU along with David Trewern​ and Trainor, says the connection with David Jones will deliver more oomph to the business and give the students real-world experience, which is invaluable.\n\"David Jones is such an aspirational brand. For our students to have the opportunity to work with such world-renowned brands is fantastic,\" she says.\nJudd, whose husband is retired Australian Football League star Chris Judd, , says the Beauty EDU branding will be on the shop floor's nail-and-brow bar.\nJudd is a trained speech pathologist, and is highly sought after as a model and brand ambassador. She holds an equity stake in the business but the partners don't want to be specific about how much they each hold. Ironically, she spent five years working for Myer as racing ambassador, reflecting the rival department store chain's presence at Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival.\nPart of renaissance The tie-up with David Jones is part of a new approach by the chain as it reinvigorates its business under new ownership. A year ago South African retailer Woolworths Holdings paid $2.1 billion to buy David Jones and it has injected fresh zip and brought more foot traffic, lifting sales to their highest in eight years, at $1.89 billion in the 12 months ended June 30.\nResearch firm IBISWorld's senior analyst Arna Richardson says there are structural shifts from online competition, and as supermarkets and category killers like Chemist Warehouse try to muscle in, the trends are running the right way in cosmetics and toiletries.\nShe concluded in a comprehensive report in July this year, that \"underlying economic, demographic and social trends bode well for the industry\".\nShe says changing consumer attitudes to \"holistic\" wellness will help drive industry growth along with product development in new items and an expansion of \"eco-friendly products\".\nBur pricing is under pressure because of the globalisation of the industry and the arrival in Australia of international beauty retailers like Sephora – hence the desire for businesses like DJs to do more than simply sell product.\nTrainor is convinced that Beauty EDU inside a David Jones is right for the times, and he's already planning further expansion. It will make an ideal case study for those studying entrepreneurship in one of his other schools. He's adamant that being an entrepreneur can be taught, provided there is a spark there in the first place.\n\"What we do is give people a process to follow\". \"The people who come up to me afterwards always say I've got an idea\". But the trick is to know what to do next to put that into action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:03:00.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
