However, the send-out of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply is still above 40 mcm/day. \n\"Prices are slightly lower this morning on the bearish factor of lower UKCS flows but it's not a big fall because the market is quite balanced,\" a UK gas trader said. \nBritain's gas flows were forecast at 174.1 million cubic metres (mcm) a day and demand at 175.7 mcm, National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) data showed. \nFurther along the curve, prices for winter delivery were slightly up, trading 0.20 pence higher at 44 pence/therm. \nThis coming winter demand will be higher year-on-year on the assumption of colder weather, UK-based consultancy Energy Aspects said. \n\"Over the two winter quarters, we expect gas demand from power will be up by 0.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) and then 0.6 bcm, while overall demand will be up by 1.4 bcm and 1.5 bcm,\" analysts said in a note. \nSupply from domestic production and Norway will be higher as a result, particularly in the fourth quarter. LNG supply will be at last year's levels in Q4 but higher by the first quarter next year. \n\"The UK market will see a fairly heavy call on storage to get through the winter. We put that at some 3.9 bcm, which will take UK gas in storage down to fairly low levels,\" Energy Aspects added. \nIn the Dutch TTF gas market, day-ahead prices were 0.10 euros higher at 19.48 euros per megawatt hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, benchmark EU Allowances (EUA) edged down by 0.04 euros to 8.21 euros a tonne.
