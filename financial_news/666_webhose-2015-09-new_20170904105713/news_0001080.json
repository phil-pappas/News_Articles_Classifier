The downward move follows a run-up that has seen the index jump from 1,040 back in September 2011 to 4,110 at the end of June this year -- an astonishing 295 percent increase.\nBespoke Investment group points out yesterday&apos;s fall marked the seventh straight day of losses for the index and put it down more than 20 percent from its recent high. The industry has a history of volatility, but this recent decline is quite steep even by its own standards. Here&apos;s a longer term chart for example:\nThis isn&apos;t the first time that the biotech sector has faced a bear market, so Bespoke took a look back from 1992 until now to see how long and how steep prior reversals have been for the S&P 500 Biotech group.\nHere&apos;s what it found:\nOf the 18 prior bear markets, the average length was about three months (92 days) over which time the index dropped an average of 29.3% (median: -26.7%). Based on these prior declines, if the current bear market follows the average path, it would imply further downside of about 10% over the course of the next three weeks.\nGiven the strength of biotech&apos;s recent bull market, you might be tempted to think that the current bear could be much deeper and longer. The good news is that there&apos;s little evidence to support that assertion, according to Bespoke. Of the four biotech bear markets that followed triple-digit bull markets, declines ranged from 20 percent to 34 percent.\nOf course, this time could be different.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ig382XRd79XU/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iNOsXu2PlV6Q/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-09-29T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T14:18:19.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
