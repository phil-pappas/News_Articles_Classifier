A recent report from market intel provider RentRange and Salt Lake City-based Real Property Management shows a year-to-date 6.1% uptick to $1,320 per month for rental rates for three-bedroom single-family homes. \nThat certainly raises the bar of affordability for recent graduates, but it also raises the threshold of comfortable living for cash-strapped retirees with a fixed monthly income, as well as pre-retirees—some of whom carry education loan debt on behalf of their children and many of whom are still recovering from the 2008 recession. \nReal Property Management’s Bob Pifke says that just as Millennials take on housemates or roommates to cover the rent, Boomers may want to consider something similar.

Besides the income, they might find having a roommate rewarding.” \nAlso rewarding is shacking up with relatives. While 85% of seniors are heads-of-household, the U.S. Census’s most recent American Community Survey puts the number of seniors living in a house headed by their children, children-in-law-, or non-spousal relatives at 9% in 2012. The benefits of intergenerational living are well documented, as seniors find it easier to combat isolation and loneliness and the youngest members of the household find a sense of continuity and richer concept of family. \nFor Pifke, though, Boomers should think about other types of communal living situations with non-relatives—less \"Frasier,\" more \"Golden Girls,\" as 2% of seniors, according to the Census Bureau, already do. He also points to what he calls senior dormitories—a more institutional version of cohabitation. \n“It seems improbable, but senior dormitories, or something similar to dormitories, might also be a solution,” he says, which could take a lesson from retirement homes (or, “senior living complexes”) that offer residents costly private amenities such as bathrooms and kitchens when, in fact, those amenities could be shared, communal spaces—thereby reducing costs. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:02:58.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
