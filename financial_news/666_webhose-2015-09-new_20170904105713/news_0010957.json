The S&P 500 declined 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8%.\nShares in Europe and Asia posted losses. The price of oil, which had rallied in recent days, slumped.\nAfter calmer sessions on Friday and Monday, traders and investors said they were hoping last week’s volatility had passed. However, signs of turbulence returned Tuesday.\nStock markets around the world fell sharply Tuesday, after weak Chinese manufacturing data fueled investors’ worries about the health of the world’s second-largest economy.

He added that the weak manufacturing data in China triggered the steep declines.\n“Under normal circumstances maybe our market wouldn’t be so volatile and take this information so severely, but this shows our market is still fragile,” he said, noting that the mood on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was “here we go again.”\nIn the past couple of weeks, stocks, currencies and commodities have swung dramatically on signs of a slowdown in Chinese growth. Disappointing economic data out of the world’s second-largest economy, as well as the country’s devaluation of its currency, have exacerbated concerns.\nStill, newly released economic data in the U.S. has remained rather buoyant. Last Friday, the Commerce Department said U.S. consumer spending rose in July, and last Thursday a reading of gross domestic product showed a stronger second-quarter expansion than initially estimated.\nAs a result, the extent of the spillover of China’s stock-market declines to the U.S. has some investors scratching their heads.\n“For us, it’s a question of ‘are we missing something?’” said Stephen Freedman, senior investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. “Is this downward volatility telling us something about the fundamental picture in the U.S. that we’re not seeing?”\nSo far, Mr. Freedman said he sees no change in U.S. fundamentals and remains relatively upbeat about the long-term performance of U.S. stocks. He added that he was encouraging clients to use this as an opportunity to invest in sectors such as technology and energy rather than have alarm bells go off.\nCommodities and stocks around the world have swung sharply in the weeks since China devalued the yuan, interpreted by some as a sign of Beijing’s concern about slowing growth.\nENLARGE An employee on an assembly line producing Mercedes-Benz cars at a Beijing Benz Automotive Co. factory in Beijing. Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace in three years in August, an official survey showed on Tuesday. Photo: Reuters The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 3% late in the session. The Shanghai Composite fell nearly 5% before ending the day down 1.2% . Hong Kong’s Hang Seng HSNGY -0.46 % Index fell 2.2% and Japan’s Nikkei lost 3.8%.\nOn Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group Inc. invoked “Rule 48” for the stock-market open, which relaxes some trading rules in an attempt to ensure a smooth opening. The rule is instituted when trading ahead of the open is especially volatile.\nStock indexes around the world suffered their biggest monthly losses in years in August. The Stoxx Europe 600 had its largest one-month percentage decline since August 2011. The Dow fell 6.6%, representing its biggest monthly percentage decline since May 2010. The Shanghai Composite fell 12.5%, notching its third straight month of declines.\nOn Tuesday, China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index for August fell to 49.7, from 50.0 in July, marking its lowest level since August 2012. A number below 50.0 implies a contraction.\nSeparately, the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of nationwide manufacturing activity, fell to more than a six-year low in August, according to Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit.\n“We believe that the clock is ticking toward further negative surprises,” Rabobank strategist Michael Every said about the data in a note to clients.\nHe said that policy responses from China aimed at encouraging stability had so far failed.\nChinese authorities have been trying to stabilize the domestic stock market since late June, cutting interest rates for the fifth time since November and pledging to support the market by buying stocks. More recently, Beijing has stepped up a crackdown on what they are labeling as securities violations .\nChristine Lagarde , managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Tuesday that the organization expects global economic growth to weaken and that Asia risks slowing further because of the recent volatility in financial markets.\n“Asia as a region is still expected to lead global growth,” Ms. Lagarde said in a speech at the University of Indonesia. But even in Asia, the pace “is turning out a little bit slower expected—with the risk that it may even slow further given the recent spike in global risk aversion and in financial market volatility.”\nThe euro, which in recent months has tended to do well during times of market stress, was recently 0.4% higher against the U.S. dollar at $1.1253. The dollar was 1% lower against Japan’s yen at ¥119.954.\nThe U.S. oil benchmark was down 5.1% at $46.71 a barrel after oil prices had surged over the previous three trading sessions. Gold rose around 0.7% to $1,140.60 a troy ounce.\nLater this week, the European Central Bank is scheduled to hold its regular monetary policy meeting. Analysts expect President Mario Draghi to get questions about what recent market volatility could mean for Europe and the ECB’s bond-buying program.\nOn Friday, monthly U.S. nonfarm payroll figures could provide further hints on the timing of a U.S. interest rate rise.\nMarket turmoil has led some investors and analysts to push back their expectations for when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start to raise rates from rock-bottom levels.\nStephanie Lindeck, an economist at Julius Baer , JBAXY -2.37 % wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, however, that she thinks a move in 2015 is on the cards, partly thanks to “better-than-expected economic data from the U.S.” in recent weeks.\n—Saumya Vaishampayan in New York and Chao Deng in Hong Kong contributed to this article.\nCorrections & Amplifications:\nLast month, the Stoxx Europe 600 suffered its largest one-month percentage decline since August 2011. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was the largest one-month percentage decline since August 2010.\nWrite to Josie Cox at josie.cox@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC223_panmkt_TOP_20150901035432.jpg", "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.14/require.min.js", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC223_panmkt_M_20150901035432.jpg", "http://fonts.wsj.net/HCo_Whitney/font_HCo_Whitney.css"], "published": "2015-09-01T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:33:10.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
