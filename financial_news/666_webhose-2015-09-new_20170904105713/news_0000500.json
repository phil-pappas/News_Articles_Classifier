A vaccine is yet to be developed for the virus, which was discovered in humans in 1957, as it has a complex molecular structure.\nNovavax said last month that a separate mid-stage study showed its vaccine protected the elderly against the virus.\nRSV primarily affects those with compromised immune systems, including young infants and the elderly. For most older healthy children and adults, it causes little more than a common cold, but in high-risk groups it could lead to more serious lung infections, and sometimes, even death.\nNovavax also said on Tuesday that it had received a grant of up to $89 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support a late-stage trial of the vaccine in pregnant women, which is planned for the first quarter of 2016.\nA late-stage trial in the elderly is expected to begin later this year.\nA RSV vaccine represents a $1 billion opportunity in the United States and double that number worldwide, Wedbush Securities analyst Heather Behanna said.\nNovavax said the trial tested the vaccine against a placebo in 50 healthy pregnant women in their third trimester. Women who received the placebo showed no significant change in their antibody levels.\nThe data is consistent with immune responses observed in previous trials in women of child-bearing age, the company said.\nInfants of the pregnant women who were given the vaccine were found to have received a significant bolus of all anti-RSV antibodies, Novavax said.\n\"Half of all hospitalizations due to RSV occur within first three months of birth and the vaccine demonstrates the potential to protect infants when they are most at risk,\" Gregory Glenn, Novavax's senior vice president of research and development, said in a statement.\nThe Maryland-based company's shares were down 2 percent at $7.99 in noon trading, reversing course.
