Rob Homer Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Tourism-related stocks could be among the big winners if the Australian dollar continues its cascade , with few signs travellers will stall their holiday plans.\nWhile the jet setters may reconsider the US, indicators suggest we won't see a sector-wide shun, or return to the domestic travel hey day, according to Morningstar equities analyst Farina Parsons.\nInstead destinations like Europe may become more attractive, given the smaller currency gap between the Euro and the Aussie, she said.\n\"The market share shift to outbound that has happened over the last eight or nine years will continue over the medium term,\" she added.\n\"Flight Centre is still well placed to take advantage of that. They've had some issues over the last 6-9 months over fees, but since then they've seen a return to strong outbound growth,\" Ms Parsons said.\nBut that doesn't mean domestic tourism will miss out, said UBS Wealth head of investment strategy David Sokulsky, who suggested looking to companies leveraged to increasing traffic to Australia.\n\"[When the dollar drops], Australia becomes a much cheaper holiday destination for offshore travellers and secondly, when you look at Australian travellers they are going to be more inclined to take holidays here rather than go overseas,\" he said.\nHowever, Michael Gable, managing director of Fairmont Equities, is a little more cautious when it comes to stocks like Flight Centre. He said while its report card currently looks sound and the stock is undervalued, he does have some reservations about the currency headwinds.\n \"The currency should hurt Flight Centre (FLT) in theory but they seem to be going well on the corporate business side,\" he told the Australian Financial Review. \"We hold FLT and I am looking to sell in the low $40s.\"\nHe advised investors wanting to cash in on the falling Aussie dollar to target stocks that benefit from a low interest rates and low energy prices, as well as the low dollar itself.\nExamples include Aristocrat, Sonic Healthcare, Macquarie Group, CSL, Ramsay Health Care, ResMed.\n\"All these stocks have outperformed since the market peaked. They are generally back to good support levels and are worth buying again during the next few weeks in the volatility,\" Mr Gable said.\nThere could be more upside for the above stocks if downgraded currency predictions start to be factored in, he added.\nEarlier this week the dollar fell to a six year low of US69¢.\nMr Sokulsky believes it has further to fall, but in the short-term will settle between US65¢ and US67¢, but much lower if there's a shock from China.\nCurrently, he is looking at opportunities in the US technology space and Europe financials.\n\"What we've been saying is to focus on offshore assets and Aus corporates that have US dollar earnings,\" he said.\nCompanies that could be in for a shaky ride include those in the consumer space that are priced in US dollars, said Ms Parsons. She named Pacific Brands and Asaleo Care as examples of stocks that could suffer.\n\"The majority of them are hedged for the first half for FY16, but for the second half, that's where the currency pain will be felt,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-09-08T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:15:36.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
