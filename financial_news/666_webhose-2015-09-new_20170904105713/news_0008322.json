Alex Ellinghausen by Misa Han Primrose Riordan Attorney General George Brandis has rejected former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's claim that nothing has changed under Malcolm Turnbull, saying \"this is a very different government\".\nIn interviews with News Corp on Saturday , former prime minister Tony Abbott said the leadership change was not about change of policy and his two-year leadership built a \"strong foundation\" for electoral victory.\nMr Brandis said instead that while the \"broad approach\" of the Coalition government was the same, the sweeping reshuffle and policy revisions should not be underestimated.\n\"Never underestimate the importance of a change of leadership itself. Never underestimate the importance of the fact that there are no fewer than eight new faces around the cabinet table. So this is a very different government,\" Mr Brandis said.\nNothing has changed Mr Abbott said on Saturday that his legacy was safe.\n\"Whatever else the changes of last week were about, they plainly weren't about policy,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\"Interestingly, just as nothing has changed on economic policy in the last fortnight, nothing's changed on climate change policy in the last fortnight, nothing's changed in respect of same-sex marriage in the last fortnight and nothing's changed in respect of border protection in the last fortnight, and I don't imagine anything will change in national security policy more broadly.\"\n Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese seized on the comments, saying they proved that the Turnbull government is a change of style rather than substance and the leadership change will not deliver policy changes.\n\"Abbott is putting a step down saying there are no policy changes here. He wants to say this is different in substance, not just in style,\" Mr Albanese told Sky News on Sunday.\nSharks will be circling Mr Albanese warned that sharks would be circling around Mr Turnbull, saying no leadership change can occur \"without repercussions\", and Tony Abbott as a backbencher would be a \"powerful symbol of discontent\".\n\"In spite of the calm on the surface, the sharks will be circling.\"\nHe also said he would be opposing Mr Turnbull's decision to rename Parliamentary Secretaries as Assistant Ministers in last Sunday's reshuffle.\nMr Albanese claimed the Turnbull government policy was led by Bill Shorten's budget reply and his own ten point plan for cities.\n\"When I looked at Malcolm Turnbull's policy my response was 'where have I heard that before'?\"\nHe also slammed the government's decision to appoint Jamie Briggs in the newly created portfolio of Minister for Cities, saying it is unworkable without the backing from infrastructure and transport.\n\"To Quote: Tom Cruise in that movie, follow the money. You can't have a junior minister responsible for cities when the infrastructure is controlled by the National party in the form of Warren Truss.\n'Smallest bounce' Mr Albanese also dismissed the bounce in the poll results in favour of the Liberal party since the leadership change. A Newspoll result indicated the Coalition is leading Labor by 51 per cent, a 5 percentage point swing to the Liberals .\n\"That is the smallest bounce I have seen. Look at where Gillard was, or Rudd was, or even Latham was.\"\nHe said the Canning by-election in which Andrew Hastie claimed victory was also indicative of Labor's success.\n\"A 6 per cent swing in what has been a traditional conservative seat, if this is the best it gets, the transition hasn't been a great success.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbott-my-legacy-the-key-to-victory-at-next-election/story-fn59niix-1227544498180?sv=71d1f7333062f3981d98a4c7f3188a45"], "published": "2015-09-27T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T06:07:59.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
