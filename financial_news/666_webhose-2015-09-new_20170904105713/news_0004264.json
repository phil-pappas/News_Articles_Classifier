Did we know defeat devices were being used in the EU? No.\" \nAnother source added the reinforced testing that has been in preparation since then has been developed to thwart such cheat technology. \nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said on Friday that \"currently emissions are measured on a laboratory test cycle (NED) which does not reflect the emissions of vehicles in normal driving conditions.\" \n\"To address this shortcoming, the Commission has been working to develop Real Driving Emission (RED) test procedures,\" it said. \nThe new testing procedure will come into force in January, the Commission added. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T05:39:25.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
