the world's biggest economy - decline, and signs of deflation appear around the globe. \nChina remains a watching brief, with authorities there having enough room to trigger further stimulus measures. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Share market's worst quarter in four years AAP \nThe Australian share market has taken its worst beating in four years over the September quarter, mainly because â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:11:02.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
