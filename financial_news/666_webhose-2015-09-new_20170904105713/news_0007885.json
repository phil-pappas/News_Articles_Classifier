Although his return won generally favorable reviews, some critics were disappointed.\nJames Poniewozik at the New York Times called the first show \"overstuffed and messy.\"\nBut he added; \"This show may not completely know what it is yet, but it knows exactly who its host is: a smart, curious, playful entertainer who's delighted to be there.\"\nRobert Bianco said in USA Today Colbert \"seemed a bit over-caffeinated. But calm will almost certainly come with time.\"\nVariety's Brian Lowry said \"if the goal was to establish the CBS show as fun-loving (a silly bit with George Clooney) yet potentially topical (an interview with Jeb Bush), as another Bush family member might say, 'Mission accomplished.'\"\nThe Chicago Tribune was unimpressed, calling Colbert's debut \"inauspicious.\"\n\"Tuesday night's debut, so highly anticipated, so long in the making, came off as yet another frantic yet fundamentally formulaic iteration of your grandparents' late-night talk show. There was very little that was sly and almost nothing that was subversive about the effort,\" the Tribune's Eric Zorn wrote.\nAt the Washington Post however, Amber Phillips said two things were clear from Colbert's debut:\n\"1) Colbert plans to be a major player at the nexus of pop culture and the 2016 presidential election, and 2) he's going to take politics and its players seriously.\" (Reporting by Jill Serjeant ; Editing by Eric Walsh and Mohammad Zargham)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:27:35.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
