In a memo signed “Lloyd,” Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein revealed he’s been diagnosed with lymphoma but added that it had been determined to be a “highly curable” type of the cancerous disease. He said he would undergo chemotherapy and scale back activities but would not take leave from the company.\nBelow is the full text of the memo, as published on the Goldman GS, +1.33% website:\nTo my colleagues, our clients and our shareholders,\nLate this summer after several weeks of not feeling well, I underwent a series of tests, which culminated in a biopsy last week. After the biopsy, I was told by my doctors that I have lymphoma. Fortunately, my form of lymphoma is highly curable and my doctors’ and my own expectation is that I will be cured.\nMy treatment plan will include chemotherapy over the next several months in New York. My doctors have advised me that during the treatment, I will be able to work substantially as normal, leading the firm. I will, however, reduce some of my previously planned travel during the treatment period. I have discussed this approach with our Board of Directors and they are supportive.\nThere are many people who are dealing with cancer every day. I draw on their experiences as I begin my own. I have a lot of energy and I’m anxious to begin the treatment. I appreciate your support and good wishes.\nLloyd\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:11:46.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
