In the same period in 2013, there were just 17 fallen angels, said Diane Vazza, head of S&P's global fixed income research. The rise is partly due to an unusually large number of Russian issuers that were cut to junk on concerns about geopolitical risk, she said. \"Still the number of global potential fallen angels increased by one to 52 since our last report, with five additions and four removals,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:06:28.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
