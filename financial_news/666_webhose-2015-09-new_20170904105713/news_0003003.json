The ability to strike a ball and send it flying hundreds of yards so that it lands within feet, or even inches, of a tiny hole requires incredible control—a theme at the heart of many of the stories in this month’s issue.\nOur cover star, Robert Redford, has led an acting career defined by self-control. “Bob understands the power of restraint,” said Barbra Streisand. “That’s what makes you want to keep looking.” Many of his film roles, ranging from the mountain man epic Jeremiah Johnson to 2013’s survival-at-sea drama All Is Lost —and now this month’s A Walk in the Woods —have been studies of solitary characters who find themselves at odds with the natural world. As he turns 79, Redford shows no signs of slowing down; he also plays a lead role in Truth, opening next month.\nFew things combine beauty and function like sailing vessels, and few sailboats are as beautiful or functional as those made by cult Finnish yacht firm Nautor’s Swan. As our story details, the company is unique for designing every detail of the boat, from the bilge pump to the deck hardware, a commitment to integrity that has earned it customers like photographer Patrick Demarchelier and tech billionaire Thomas Siebel. Heini Gustafsson, a senior designer at Nautor’s Swan, remarks: “You are creating self-contained worlds with each boat.”\nThis October will see the first gallery show in four years from Canadian photographer Jeff Wall, often considered a visionary who redefined his medium. Yet his meticulous process has earned him the label “control freak” from some critics—an assessment that makes him bristle. “Was Mozart a control freak because he wrote every note of his music?” he asks. In a chaotic world, it’s often a firm hand—whether wielding a putter or a shutter—that allows us to achieve moments of beauty and grace.\nk.oneill@wsj.com | Instagram: kristina_oneill", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/kristina_oneill/"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:41:10.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
