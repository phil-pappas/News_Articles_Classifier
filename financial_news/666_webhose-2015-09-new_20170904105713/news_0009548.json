Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Those on the brink of despair about Australia's lack of political leadership should take a closer look at the latest company to graduate from the Tank Stream Labs in Sydney's central business district.\nPolitical machinations in Canberra have not been an obstacle for James Fitzgerald and Rax Huq, who have built a technology platform designed to cash in on the fast-growing entertainment segment called daily fantasy sports. These former digital experts at Fairfax Media have used their network of contacts in the media, banking, gaming and software sectors to build a business that is well placed to go global.\nIn the time it would have taken a major Australian company to conduct a feasibility study on a new project, Fitzgerald and Huq have created a new company, written the software for a secure and scaleable global platform, obtained a gaming licence and completed a series A capital raising.\nThey are now poised to start spending that $1.8 million in new funds on promoting their business, which is called Moneyball.\nMention the word Moneyball and most people will think of Michael Lewis's book about a baseball team that beat the richest teams in the American league by using a bunch of skilled but undervalued players.\nBut if Fitzgerald and Huq are successful, the Moneyball name will become the favoured platform for wagering on sport by the 1.65 million Australians already involved in fantasy sports and the 1.8 million people involved in sports betting.\nThe Moneyball platform allows users to join real games and pick the ultimate fantasy team for a day or weekend and compete against friends and other members for a prize pool. The site uses a virtual salary cap and allows users to monitor their fantasy picks in real time based on real-life on-field performances.\nFitzgerald says that in most cases the Moneyball site will be used by a group of friends wanting to get involved in peer-to-peer betting on their favourite sport.\n Large potential revenue pool The daily fantasy sports concept started in the United States about three years ago in response to a ban on internet betting. It has taken off like a rocket, with the two largest US providers, DraftKings and FanDuel, expected to pay out $US2 billion in prizes this year. They are expected to each record $US100 million in revenue as a growing number of Americans back their favourite players.\nIn Australia, the potential revenue pool is quite large. Fitzgerald says the annual $900 million spent on sports betting is an indication of the tip of the iceberg, because that is the revenue earned, not the amount actually wagered.\nMoneyball has first-mover advantage in Australia and that will give it a headstart compared to the American market.\nFanDuel has partnerships with the NBA, the Brooklyn Nets, the Chicago Bulls, the Dallas Mavericks, the NY Knicks and Orlando Magic.\nIt offers contest across six sports: NFL (National Football League), MLB (Major League Baseball), NBA (National Basketball Association), NHL (National Hockey League), CBB (College Basketball) and CFB (College Football). Like Moneyball, it offers peer-to-peer wagering across these sports, taking a rake as its revenue stream.\nDraftKings offers a wider range of sports than FanDuel. It offers NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, CBB, CFB, PGA (Professional Golf Association), MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), NAS (Nascar Racing) and SOC (Soccer â€“ EPL and MLS).\nFitzgerald was responsible for Fairfax Media's real estate division, which explains why one of his mentors and members of the Moneyball advisory board is Nic Cola. Cola is a former Fairfax executive who is now managing director of Open Colleges.\n'Morally preferable' option The Fairfax connections run deep at Moneyball. Another advisory board member is the former editor of T he Australian Financial Review , Glenn Burge.\nBurge provided the introduction to the company, which helped Fitzgerald and Huq complete their first A series funding of $1.8 million. He introduced them to a capital markets advisory firm called Lane 9 Capital which is headed by two former Macquarie Bank executives, Peter Curry and John Vatovec. It is no surprise that when Lane 9 Capital hit the sophisticated investor market for funding for Moneyball, it ended up getting much of the money from other former Macquarie bankers.\nBurge, who is a sporting fanatic and racehorse owner, says the beauty of the Moneyball business model is the way it taps into the Australian culture of groups of mates betting with each other on a sporting event.\nHe argues that peer-to-peer betting is better than the traditional model, where the punter is up against the bookmaker. \"Moneyball offers peer-to-peer wagering, with prize pools based on number of participants multiplied by an entry fee, which is called the rake,\" he says.\nFor example, if 30 people enter a $100 contest, $2700 is the prize pool and Moneyball takes $300 as its guaranteed rake. Players are paying a fee to play, rather than Moneyball relying on them to lose in order to make money.\nFitzgerald has told investors that this business model is seen by the company's affiliate partners as being \"a more ethically and morally preferred means of partnership with a bookmaker\".\nThe test of any new start-up is the willingness of people to buy the business. Moneyball has passed that test. At least two major online bookmakers have offered to buy the business. But Huq and Fitzgerald knocked them back. \"We think this business will go into the stratosphere,\" Fitzgerald says.\nThe timing for the ramping up of promotional advertising for Moneyball could not be better. The company will be offering NFL from next week at the same time as the Hayne Plane, also known as Jarryd Hayne, is making his mark at the San Francisco 49ers.\nIf Moneyball is successful, it will soon find other competitors. But for the time being, it is the only fantasy sports platform offering a wagering aspect.\nThe barriers to entry are both technical and regulatory because you must obtain a wagering licence and handle the compliance issues that go with that.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-04T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:04:53.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
