(Staff photo: Bill Klotz) \nRoughly 21 months after the first scoops of dirt were moved for the new home of the Minnesota Vikings, ironworkers on Thursday planned to put the final steel beam in place for the stadium as part of a traditional “topping out” ceremony. \nTurns out, the actual “topping out” part didn’t happen as planned, because lightning forced the construction team to postpone the placement of the steel beam into the roof, about 230 feet above the rain-soaked ground. \nAs of Thursday afternoon, the beam still had not been installed, but project leaders said they expected to get it in place as soon as the weather cleared. \nStill, Thursday’s gathering was a mostly festive event to celebrate a key milestone in building the $1.08 billion U.S. Bank Stadium, which is on schedule to open in 10 months, just in time for the 2016 football season. \nMortenson senior vice president John Wood said the placement will happen about nine days earlier than it was expected to, based on a schedule that Mortenson general superintendent Dave Mansell put together three years ago. \n“The designs we had at that point – they were just cartoons,” Wood said. “But Dave Mansell is a genius when it comes to planning and executing a plan for a complex structure like this.” \nFor many, Thursday’s event was their first chance to see inside the 1.7 million-square-foot stadium that has been under construction since December 2013. \nWalking around on the muddy ground, with dark skies above and sporadic rain falling through the roof’s open spaces, visitors in construction hardhats and yellow vests got a first-hand look at the project. \nVisitors ran the gamut from team owners Mark and Zygi Wilf to elected officials and Vikings legends Alan Page, Carl Eller and Chuck Foreman. \n“It’s an exciting day,” Zygi Wilf said in an interview after the formal remarks. “We are happy to be able to have this be part of the Vikings legacy.” \nWood paid tribute to the subcontractors and workers on the job, arguably the most complex stadium yet built in the nation, in his view. \n“Just look around and marvel at the skill, knowledge, ingenuity, and the muscle and sweat of every man and woman that has been part of this project,” Wood said. \nOne of those workers is Brad Smith, a 29-year-old employee of Shakopee-based Danny’s Construction, which is doing steel erection work. Smith spends much of his work day connecting steel beams 200 feet or more above the ground. \nHe has to look down to “see what’s coming and keep an eye on the guys on the ground,” he says. But the heights don’t faze him. \n“You get used to it,” said Smith, who was still wearing his fall protection gear while answering questions about his work. \nThe trickiest part? “With this job it’s the slope,” he said. “Most of the buildings are flat. And you throw weather at it, whether it’s rain or snow or ice or wind. That affects it.” \nOne of the next project milestones is to get the building fully enclosed, which should happen in November. The large operable doors on the west side will be completed in early spring. \nSeat installation started about three weeks ago on the stadium’s east end. \n“Purple seats – do you see that?” Zygi Wilf said. “They look pretty good.” \nThursday’s event was bittersweet, as it comes a little more than three weeks after a Berwald Roofing & Sheet Metal employee fell 50 feet into a snow gutter and suffered a fatal injury while working on the stadium’s roof. \nWood called for a moment of silence to remember the fallen worker , 35-year-old Jeramie Gruber, who died Aug. 26. \n“Aug. 26 stands as a shocking reminder of the dangers involved in construction – dangers that we all have a responsibility to recognize, manage and avoid every day,” Wood said. \n“We’ve got a lot of work to do – about 1.6 million more work hours – to reach the finish line. But … we’ve got enough time to finish this project safely.” Pause Play Play Prev | Next Vikings owner Zygi Wilf, wearing a Vikings hardhat, poses for a photo with a group of construction workers during Thursday’s “topping out” event at the stadium project in downtown Minneapolis.
