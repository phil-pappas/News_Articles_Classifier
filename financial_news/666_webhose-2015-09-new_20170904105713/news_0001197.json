The RBNZ cut its 90-bank bill forecast to reflect an additional rate cut in the coming months, and reduced its economic growth and inflation forecasts.\nWestpac chief economist Dominick Stephens said the RBNZ had foreshadowed the possibility of new lows for interest rates. \"It's certainly not what the RBNZ is currently thinking, but alternative scenarios have an unfortunate habit of coming true.\"\nThe RBNZ cut its outlook for global growth in its quarterly policy statement, and outlined a scenario where a sluggish Chinese economy might push New Zealand's OCR towards 2.0 percent in the next year - which would be a record low.\n\"Conditions that probably would be needed to create a recession in New Zealand would be something like China slowing dramatically or perhaps moving into a recession,\" Wheeler told reporters. \"That would certainly create huge problems in Australia and ourselves.\"\nThough most economists believe a gradual and prolonged slowdown in China's economy is more likely, a stock market crash and unexpected yuan devaluation last month have rattled confidence, inside and outside China.\n\"The big worry would be if China really started to significantly devalue the RMB (yuan),\" Wheeler said, estimating China's current growth rate at around 5-6.5 percent, versus the official 7 percent forecast.\n\"We've seen authorities basically say they want to stabilise the RMB but if there were to be a very substantial depreciation in the RMB it would certainly export deflation around the rest of the world, so everybody is looking closely at China.\"\nThe New Zealand dollar tumbled more than 2 percent to a low around $0.6263 on the rate cut news, heading towards the six-and-a-half-year low around $0.62 it hit last week.\nThe RBNZ said falls in the New Zealand dollar helped support some growth, but it needed to fall further to offset to lower commodity prices, particularly for dairy exports.\n(Reportiung by Charlotte Greenfield and Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:47:33.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
