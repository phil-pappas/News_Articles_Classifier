GE manufactures such products as jet engines, oil field equipment, and gas turbines.\nGE is expecting to earn $6 billion in revenue from software and analytics this year. The company's total revenue last year amounted to nearly $150 billion.\nEarlier, the company said it would sell its health care lending unit and related loans, as well as most of GE Capital's assets. It is selling $26.5 billion in real estate assets.\nAs part of the reshuffle, the company has appointed Russell Stokes as president and CEO of GE Energy Management. He succeeds Mark Begor, who's retiring at age 57 after serving the company for 35 years.\nStokes has served as GE's transportation chief, launching a locomotive designed to meet new emission standards. Begor used to ran GE Capital's real estate business.\nReplacing Stokes as head of GE Transportation is Jamie Miller, who has served as chief information officer of the company.\nThe new appointments take effect October 1.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.springboardplatform.com/storage/js/ingage/apingage.min.js", "http://mgid.com/", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/14/us-general-electric-management-idUSKCN0RE1WE20150914", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-14/ge-forms-digital-unit-to-expand-6-billion-software-business", "http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/General-Electric-forms-GE-digital-unit-6503697.php"], "published": "2015-09-16T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:15:24.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
