Instead, the Canadian and New Zealand dollars, which are likely to move more ahead of their central bank policy decisions, will gather much of the attention,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, senior strategist at Monex in Tokyo.\nThe Bank of Canada is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent in light of recently upbeat data after already cutting twice this year, although market participants are readying for possibly dovish undertones from the central bank. The decision is due at 1400 GMT.\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), on the other hand, is expected to cut interest rates to 2.75 percent on Thursday. The focus is now on the language accompanying the policy decision.\n\"The forecasts and language will probably imply one further OCR (official cash rate) cut. Westpac remains on the dovish side of consensus in terms of how low the OCR is eventually cut,\" wrote Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney.\nThe Canadian dollar was steady at C$1.3197 against the greenback after gaining 0.8 percent overnight as crude oil, a major export for Canada, surged on the back of a global equities rally. A tumble in crude oil prices had sent the loonie to an 11-year low of $1.3353 last month.\nThe New Zealand dollar was up 0.6 percent at $0.6380 , after gaining more than 1 percent overnight. The kiwi had slid to 6-year low of $0.6200 late in August.\nThe euro was little changed at $1.1193, stuck in a narrow $1.1230-$1.1122 range this week.
