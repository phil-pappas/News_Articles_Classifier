The Federation of Small Businesses recently reported that credit availability for small businesses had increased. \nThe biggest declines in lending to small firms came at Nationwide Building Society (LSE: CCDS.L - news ) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . Nationwide's lending to small firms contracted by 279 million pounds, and RBS's lending fell by 266 million. \n($1 = 0.6532 pounds) (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Steve Slater and David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:21:08.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
