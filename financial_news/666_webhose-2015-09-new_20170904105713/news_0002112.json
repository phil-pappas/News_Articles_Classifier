Turnover for the full year is now expected to exceed current analyst forecasts, though adjusted operating profits will remain in-line with expectations due to increased spending for growth in the second half. \nOn revenue up 25% to $4.4m in the six months to 30 June, pre-tax profits swelled 49% to $0.91m thanks mainly to the growth in corporate-owned stores. \nManagement looked to balance its profit objective with its investment plans, with the period including the re-acquisition of major former franchise stores in New York and Miami and a significant growth opportunity in Detroit. \nDuring the first half, costs increased 20% to $2.9m due to hirings that are part of the corporate store growth plan. \nExecutive chairman Patrick DeSouza said: \"We are pleased that the strategic choices we have made to grow our brand - national sales channels and reinvigorated corporate presence via selective franchise re-acquisition - are bearing fruit. Our entire franchise system is unified behind our direction and reinvesting for future growth.\" House broker WH Ireland (LSE: WHI.L - news ) said the significant underlying growth opportunity was the size of the circa-$70m in systemwide sales - ten times the size of the company's current reported external revenues. \n\"The size of the YoY increases suggests that strong growth drivers are at work; however, at this stage, we leave our forecasts unchanged.\" Shares in Water Intelligence were up 18% to 55p by midday on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:32:38.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
