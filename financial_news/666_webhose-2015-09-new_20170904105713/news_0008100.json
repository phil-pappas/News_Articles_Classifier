Getty Images Share on twitter by John Stensholt The North Queensland Cowboys NRL team might be winning on the field, but off it the club is battling funding cuts to successful indigenous and underprivileged community programs.\nLed by star player Johnathan Thurston, the Cowboys will play in Sunday evening's NRL grand final against the Brisbane Broncos and enjoy huge support across the north Queensland region, with half the team's average 17,000 home crowds driving between 1 to 10 hours to watch matches in Townsville.\nCowboys chief executive Greg Tonner said the club has tried to use its popularity to establish community programs and try to help a region that has been hit by the mining downturn.\n\"We have to be more than an NRL club. Sport is something that gives people hope and this is an area that has some of the highest youth unemployment in the country. But you take someone like a Johnathan Thurston. When he tells kids to do their homework, they go and do their homework. That's the difference we can make.\"\nScale backs after cuts Tonner told The Australian Financial Review the programs, which provide mentoring advice and support to high school students and young children, have been scaled back this year after federal government cuts.\nHe said while the club would like to regain the funding, ideally a corporate sponsor would step in and fill the breach. \"Look, we love having the sponsors on the shirt and on our sleeve and that sort of thing. But something like this I think is ideal for those sponsors that want to get involved in the community.\"\nTonner claimed one program, called Learn Earn Legend, which supports Year 11 and 12 indigenous students with support to finish their education and move into further study, training or employment, has been cut back significantly.\n \"We had it in 15 to 20 schools and had to cut back to five. We've had a 95 per cent success rate with getting kids finishing school and then 80 per cent within a year going on to get jobs or do further. What we would really like to do is expand it outside Townsville.\nParochial support Tonner, a former Optus executive, was appointed CEO of the Cowboys in March, taking over a team that is one of only a few NRL clubs to break even thanks to its parochial support around its region.\nThe Townsville-based club has enjoyed a 20 per cent increase in membership in 2015 to about 14,330 people, and about 15 per cent in corporate sponsorship, taking annual revenue over the $20 million mark.\nTonner said the next phase of growth can only come from the team moving to a planned near stadium closer to the Townsville CBD and away from 1300 Smiles stadium, which was converted from a trotting track 20 years ago.\nThe new stadium is another point of contention, with the Queensland government promising $100 million funding for a project that will cost $200-215 million. Tonner is hopeful the federal government will help if the stadium is built with a planned convention centre.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:06:31.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
