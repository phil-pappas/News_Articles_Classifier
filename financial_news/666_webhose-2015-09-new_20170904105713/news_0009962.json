Reuters could not immediately confirm that report.\nThe raid comes some three months after the state's Fair Political Practices Commission opened an investigation into links between Pougnet and a real estate developer.\nThat investigation followed reports in the Desert Sun about the mayor's business relationships with that developer and an editorial saying he owed voters an explanation.\nPougnet responded in a post on his website in May that with the editorial the newspaper \"threw their hat in with the handful of politically motivated detractors who have made accusations about my job as a consultant and my integrity as your mayor.\"\nPougnet, a 52-year-old Democrat who was first elected mayor of Palm Springs in 2007, announced in that same post that he would not seek reelection in 2015.\nEimiller declined to say if the FBI raid was connected in any way to the mayor.\nThe mayor did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment by Reuters on Tuesday morning.\nEimiller declined to say if the FBI raid was connected in any way to the mayor.
