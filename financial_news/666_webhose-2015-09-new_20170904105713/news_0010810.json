Advertising Print This Post \nThe takeover battle between rivals 888 Holdings Plc and GVC Holdings PLC is still far from conclusion as the target company bwin.party announced this morning a revised offer from the former. \nGibraltar based gaming company 888 Holdings Plc which is owned by brothers Avi and Aaron Shaked has sent a revised proposal to the board of bwin.party. The takeover target company has been created after the merger between PartyGaming and Austrian betting firm Bwin back in 2011. \nInterTrader was established in 2010 as a spread-betting company, which later expanded with a typical forex and CFDs offering. With the form’s main focus on Europe, the company has been competing with a number of brokers in the main markets of bwin.party like the UK, Germany, France and Spain. \nSince InterTrader was established to capitalize on the existing affiliate structures that bwin.party had already been in possession of the company has not managed to compete with any of the big spread betting brands. Financial metrics of bwin.party \nBwin.party digital’s revenues for 2014 totaled to about £478.1 million, with InterTrader being included in the “others” segment of the company’s annual report. The revenues in this segment increased by 14 percent in 2014 to €48.9 million. According to the company, InterTrader and B2B both delivered strong growth but it was the payments part of the business of Bwin.party that amounted to the greatest year-on-year increase helped by the acquisition of PXP in May 2014. \nBack in July a takeover offer from 888 Holdings Plc valued bwin.party at £870 million , the race was joined by GVC Holdings which put on the table £1 billion. Both offers have been approved by the board and recommended to shareholders and the company was on the verge with signing with GVC, before this morning a new offer has hit home from 888 Holdings Plc. Could InterTrader be on the market? \nAccording to sources close to Finance Magnates the push of bwin.party into financial spread betting has not been as successful as hoped and the massive competition unleashed after the MiFiD passporting from smaller EU jurisdictions like Cyprus has caught InterTrader unprepared. \nWhile a source inside GVC Holdings has shared that the firm is not expecting to make any changes to the company’s portfolio after the takeover, if shareholders are to decide that any of the subsidiaries of the company are not feasible in the long run, InterTrader could go to the market. \nWith the recent expansion of another big gaming company Playtech into financial trading, InterTrader could be a potential target for a takeover after the conclusion of the bidding war for bwin.party. \nBwin.party has not disclosed any financial details about the new offer it got from 888 Holdings PLC. A regulatory filing stated this morning, “a further announcement will be made in due course”.
