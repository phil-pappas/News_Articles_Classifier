Dismaland, an art show “experiment” featuring new works by Banksy and others, was a sellout, drawing 150,000 visitors and bringing roughly $30 million to the small English town of Weston-super-Mare, according to the Associated Press .\nSee also: Banksy’s dystopian theme park is a dark twist on Disneyland\nBanksy’s work is often loaded with social and political commentary on topics such as greed and poverty, absurdity and alienation. With Dismaland, Banksy explored inequality. One exhibit featured tiny remote-controlled boats crowded with refugees in a polluted pond. The boats were designed to be almost impossible to navigate, Banksy said in an interview posted on the Dismaland website. The boats would randomly switch to ensure that visitors steering them had “no control over whether [their] destiny is to be an asylum seeker or a Western superpower.”\nThe migrant crisis in Calais has grown over the summer, with thousands of immigrants, mainly from Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Afghanistan, living in makeshift camps and shelters in an area near the port referred to as “the jungle.” The number of migrants camping there hit a new high recently with many hoping to cross the English Channel to reach the United Kingdom.\nRead more about Europe’s migrant crisis: Mohamed El-Erian: Europe needs refugees as much as they need Europe\nShipping industry braces for costs from migrant crisis\nVIDEO: Why Europe’s migration crisis is happening now\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eDbngwOpX9z/embed/simple", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/653ee87873a4436ebc13bdbd6eaa3c72/banksy-send-timbers-his-uk-theme-park-refugees", "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29074736", "http://dismaland.co.uk/interview/"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:10:11.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
