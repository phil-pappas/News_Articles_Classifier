Things did get done.\nFast forward to today and what a sad state of affairs. Last week the state had to embarrassingly announce that it doesn't even have the money in the bank to pay lottery winners. Now the jackpot winners are suing the state to get their rightful money.\nPerhaps the state will need a second lottery to raise money to pay off the winners from the first lottery.‎\nChicago is so broke that its bonds are junk status and Mayor Rahm Emmanuel had to go hat in hand last week to Springfield for bailout money to pay the bills.\nAccording to Forrest Claypool, who is the new chief executive for the Chicago school sytem: \"We are really now at a point where further cuts would reach deep into the classroom.\"\nTeachers have been laid off and extracurricular activities have been cut. Yes, the financial crisis is wreaking havoc, but to ask the state to kick in money is a laughable proposition - like Puerto Rico asking Greece for a loan. Springfield is plum out of money, too.\nTo protest additional service cuts, the Wall Street Journal reports that parents are going on hunger strikes. But it will take more than divine intervention for the cash inflow to meet expenditures.\nWhy should residents of other states care about this financial meltdown in Chicago and Springfield Illinois? The answer is that Chicago is the canary in the coal mine when it comes to the government pension crisis.\nPensions to retired teachers and state employees are bleeding the state dry. Since 2006, annual pension payments have grown tenfold, from $60 million to over $650 million. A state budget office spokesman tells me that \"nearly one of three state tax dollars now goes to paying pensions for retired municipal and state employees.\"\nMeanwhile tax increases on the rich under the previous governor failed to raise much money, but did accelerate an exodus of money and talent out of the state.\nA new Illinois Policy Institute study based on latest IRS data finds a record number of people have been fleeing Cook County.\n\"The income of the people who left Cook County in 2012 was $2 billion more than the income of the people who moved into Cook County... The 2011 and 2012 out-migration will cost the county nearly $30 billion in taxable income over the next decade,\" the study said.\nIt couldn't get much worse, right? Wrong. The state has been operating without a budget now for more than two months. Vendors are routinely going two or three months without getting paid because the vault is empty.\nThe Democrats who rule the state legislature and serve their masters, the Illinois teachers unions, passed a budget this summer that is $5 billion in the red out of a $34 billion budget, flouting the state's balanced budget requirement.\nRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who inherited this calamity, is the state's last best hope. He has vetoed the state budget and rejected the unions' demands for more taxes. Property and sales taxes (which can reach 10 percent at the cash register in Chicago's Cook County) are already nearly the highest in the nation.\nThe rich that the unions want to tax have been leaving for Florida and Arizona and Texas. Rauner argues that Illinois already has one of the five worst business environments in the nation.\nWorst of all, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that pensions can't be touched because they are contractual obligations. So funding for schools, roads, and public safety get shortchanged so that public employees can keep cashing in on benefits far more generous than what private sector workers/taxpayers receive.\nThis is justice? No wonder residents are going on hunger strikes.\nIt's a Battle Royale that pits the union bosses against the taxpayers. And it's a fight that Mr. Rauner can't lose. If he does, the exodus from the state will look like the floods of Hungarian refugees trying to get to western Europe.\nThe shame of all this is that Chicago is a world-class city. It is the capital of the Midwest and by far the most desirable city in the region to live in. It should be and could be America's Hong Kong if it weren't for the ‎labor agreements that are shredding basic government services and making the city unaffordable.\nWhat is scary is that the fiscal virus that has incapacitated this once great city and state may soon spread to a city or town near you.\nAmazingly national Democrats are saying with a straight face that to help American workers and make the country great again we need more powerful unions.\n*Stephen Moore is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:54:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
