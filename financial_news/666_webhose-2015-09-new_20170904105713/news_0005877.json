You want people to reach their potential. That still won't work for some people in a highly developed market system. \nI mean if this were a sports-based system, you could give me a PhD in football, and I could practice eight hours a day, and I might be able to carry the water from, not onto the field, but from the locker room to the bench. There's just some people don't fit well into a highly skilled market-based economy. \nThey're perfectly decent citizens. We'll send them off to Afghanistan, but they are not going to command a big price.\" - Interview with Warren Buffett on Sept. 8 on Bloomberg TV \nEconomics as a whole has changed very little over time, but the financial structures which function within the confines of economics have. And while people like Warren Buffett, and the many financiers and intellectuals who run our monetary system want us to believe that today's market based economy is too erudite a topic for the common man to understand, the fact remains that just as many brokers and investors on Wall Street fail despite their Ivy League educations than investors who only have modest credentials and knowledge in the fields of finance and money. \nIt is sad to think that Warren Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger are held in such high esteem for their commentary outside of direct trading and investments since on occasion their opinions seem to belittle those who do not have the same advantages they do. And while it is correct in some instances that military soldiers do not always have the same high IQ's as those who graduate from Harvard or Yale, to discount an American's choosing to join the military versus a career on Wall Street as their being illiterate in the ways of today's finance is nothing less than seeing those not within their sphere of influence as simply rungs to be ignored on the ladder for success.
