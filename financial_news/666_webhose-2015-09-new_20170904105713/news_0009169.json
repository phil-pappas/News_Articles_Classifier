PUBLISHED: 18:06, Tue, Sep 29, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:05, Tue, Sep 29, 2015 GETTY The value of mining companies has slipped amid China's slowing economy \nIn the City, the name is synonymous with wealth and riches beyond the dreams of even the bankers earning millions every year. When Glencore floated in one of the largest ever listing on the London stock market four years ago, its chief executive and a handful of other top executive shareholders were propelled to billionaire status overnight. But now the firm is one of the largest companies being brought to its knees by China's slowing economy - and this affects anyone invested in the FTSE 100 which, for most people, is through their pension savings. Why Glencore matters Mining companies make up a large part of the FTSE 100 and so their share prices are significant to pension funds - and therefore savers - across Britain.Glencore's stock is down more than 76 per cent in year-to-date – marking it the worst performer in the bluechip index this year, according to FE Trustnet data. Related articles The biggest investment mistakes and how to avoid them \nThe huge size of the company has a disproportionately large affect on the FTSE's value. And it's fall is not alone: mining stocks made up 7.1 per cent of the FTSE 100 at the end of April, compared to 4.6 per cent today, according to Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. It goes some way to explain why the blue chip index has lost a large amount of its value since the summer - closing at 5926 today, after topping more than 7,000 in April. \nWhy are Glencore and mining stocks being hit? Falling demand from China for raw materials has helped to send the price of commodities spiralling down.Iron ore, for example, is trading at around the half the value it was a year ago, while zinc, nickel and copper prices have fallen by around 25 per cent. This is having a huge affect on the profitability of mining and commodity companies. But Glencore is particularly vulnerable because it racked up around £20bn worth of US dollar denominated debt in the years when credit was cheap. GETTY China's slowing economy is hitting stock markets around the world GETTY Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg has seen his wealth plummet \nIn recent months the US dollar has strengthened - making it more expensive to service debts - and the US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates this year or early next year, which will further increase the cost of credit. In the face of lowered earnings, this is a toxic combination for the firm. Competitor Anglo American is in a similar position. Michael Hewson, chief analyst at CMC capital markets, said: \"It was always believed that commodity prices would remain high given the expectation that we would continue to see significant growth out of emerging markets as well as China.\"When commodity prices are high this debt is not so much of a problem. If weaker commodity prices continue for any length of time, highly indebted mining or oil companies will find it difficult to roll that debt over, due to lower revenues, coupled with an expectation that the Federal Reserve might start to raise interest rates.\"Investors lost confidence in Glencore is evident in its plummeting value; the firm floated on the FTSE 100 in 2011 with a share price of 530p, yesterday it closed at 69p. Chief executive Ivan Galsenberg, who holds an estimated 15 per cent share in the company, has gone from being the 301st richest person in the world to 1,335th in March - and that was before the recent dire performance of the firm's share price. \nThe shock slowdown in China has been weighing ever heavier on mining companies since the summer. But fears hit new levels yesterday when an analyst note questioned Glencore's value for shareholders. Investec warned that there is a possibility that earnings could completely collapse, as Glencore worked to purely pay off its significant debt – which would eliminate all shareholder value. \nWho is worst affected? Pension savers are affected by the decline in the FTSE 100, but those who do not have to access cash or a number of years have been advised to sit tight, as losses should be recouped over the longer term.Overall pensions funds have little exposure to Glencore, according to Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown. He said: \"Not many UK institutions feature on the share register, and often where they do, it is on behalf of index funds, or sector specialist funds. The latter are unlikely to be held by pension funds in any quantity.\"However, funds that track the FTSE 100 have had to invest in Glencore and mining stocks because they make up such a large part of the index. And those likely to hold these so-called tracker funds are typically first-time investors - many of which are savers who have been struggling to get a return on cash in recent years. FE Trustnet’s Tahmina Mannan said: \"People most likely to hold FTSE 100 trackers are those who want a low-cost way to start investing in the markets. \"Often it is people who are new to investing and want to ease into it, DIYers of any age and those who are unsure of individual active managers’ strategies and therefore unsure of with whom to park their money.\" Related articles State Pension payouts will be reduced for millions under new 'flat... \nMr McPhail added: \"There are important lessons here. Glencore’s sheer size meant that index funds were effectively forced buyers. But the company was built on leverage and markets did not go its way. Perhaps if commodities had continued to rise, things would be very different. But blind tracking of an index is a risky game when there are large, but leveraged companies in the index.\"For now, the future of Glencore remains to be seen, especially as the fallout from China's economy remains a largely unanswered question. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \"It is hard whether to tell if the worst is over or not. On one hand, at its current value Glencore really can’t afford to fall much lower, with a debt pile that dwarfs its market cap; on the other hand, the stock has consistently dropped below what people have thought was the bottom throughout the year, continually shocking even the most bearish of Glencore investors – there is no reason it couldn’t do so again.\" GETTY China's economy is slowing and this is pushing commodity prices down Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:22:53.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
