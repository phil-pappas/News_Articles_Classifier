Low prices were also putting high-cost projects in OPEC countries at risk, it added. \nAnd the gambit has not been without wider risks for OPEC countries, whose public finances have been pummelled as the price of their main revenue source plunged. \nOPEC countries have had to tighten their belts, with even Saudi Arabia announcing at the weekend it will cut spending and issue more bonds as it faces a record budget shortfall due to falling oil prices. \nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts the Saudi deficit will swell to $130 billion this year, up from $17.5 billion last year, which was only the kingdom's second since 2002. \nBut the IEA sees the drop in oil prices, along with a gradually improving global economic outlook, to accelerate growth in demand for oil, in particular demand for OPEC output. \nIf forecasts oil demand growth to hit a five-year high of 1.7 million barrels per day (mbpd), and stay at an above trend at 1.4 mbpd next year. \nThe IEA increased its forecasts for overall demand this year and next by 0.2 mbpd to 94.4 mbpd this year and 95.8 mbpd in 2016. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) cut its forecast for non-OPEC supply by 0.3 mbpd next year to 57.7 mbpd. \nThe IEA does not make supply forecasts for OPEC, but said it expects market demand on OPEC suppliers to rise to 31.3 mbpd in 2016, an increase of 1.6 mbpd as low prices dent high-cost production support higher demand. \nOPEC output dipped 0.2 mbpd to 31.57 mbpd last month, the IEA said, but that was still up 1.2 mbpd from last year. \nOil prices were down on Friday, after having climbed the previous day on falling US output. \nBrent North Sea crude for delivery in October, the European benchmark, fell 90 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $47.99 a barrel in London. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October fell 92 cents, or 2.0 percent, to $45.00 per barrel, while", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:34:20.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
