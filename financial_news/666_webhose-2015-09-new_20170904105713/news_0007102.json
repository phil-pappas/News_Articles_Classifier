Facebook just moved to a new office in Singapore, its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and it's the work-space of which dreams are made. \nLocated on the 22nd floor of Singapore's South Beach Tower, lofty corridors with unfinished ceilings, open working stations featuring flexible desks and intimate seating spaces make up the huge four-story office. \nWhile Facebook doesn't disclose its employee numbers per country, the new Singapore digs have plenty of empty desks and the company is looking to fill over 40 positions, according to the website. \nA quick tour of the office reveals just how seriously the company takes employees' work-life balance, with spaces designed to provide visual and physical stimulation. Work anniversaries, or Face-versaries, are celebrated with a giant balloon depicting the number of years worked being attached to the employee's desk. \nClick on for a peek into one of the world's most creative offices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:04:18.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
