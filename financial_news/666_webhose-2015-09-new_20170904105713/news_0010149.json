The web has loads of sample plans, but how do you, really, write your own business plan, your own way? How do you write the plan that accomplishes the goals that you want to accomplish in your business? First things first, you have to start thinking about what you’re not thinking about. Ask yourself the right questions, about your business and put it into your plan notes. The best way to write a business plan is to write it in small segments or pieces. Forget trying to consume, writing the entire plan as a large, mammoth, assignment. It is, too, overwhelming, give yourself a break, and write small bursts, of information. It is easier, to write your top three to five business objectives, clearly and concisely when you are not looking down the barrel of a twenty-thirty page business plan. \nWhen you write your business plan, start with the basics, and write the things that you have already thought about. Here are a few business plan starter questions. \n1. What is your mission statement? Your mission statement is what you want to do now, and your vision statement is what you want to do in the future. 2. What are your top keys to success? Don’t write a laundry list of keys, keep it simple, and focused.3. What is your value proposition? Why should someone do business with you?4. What are your core competencies or skills?5. What is your start up budget? Write it like a grocery list, at first, and add up the numbers.6. The executive summary is written last; after the entire business plan is, absolutely, finished. Think of the executive summary as your movie trailer, build to attract interest in your business. \nSo far, not so bad, if you write your business plan in smart small steps, you can eat the mammoth one bite at a time, and before you know it, you have a business plan. Go and get started, and next week read part two, on how to write a business plan. \nSan Jose Womens Business Examiner invite you to subscribe by clicking subscribe at the top of the page.
