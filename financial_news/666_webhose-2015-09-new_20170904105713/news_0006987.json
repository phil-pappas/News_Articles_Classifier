The sun had burnt off the fog after a seriously chilly night; the paddocks were green and glossy in the sunlight afterrecent rains. Towards midday, it was getting pleasantly warm and I was warming to the task at hand.\nAbout three wines into my tasting with Tim Stevensof Huntington Estate the music began to boom from a car that had pulled up outside the cellar door. The sound smashed the Sunday silence asunder: '70s and '80s soft-rock anthems – Mix FM fodder. Stevens frowned and began closing windows of the relocated, timber Queensland bungalow next to the winery that serves as a private tasting room and office.\n\"That's not the type of music you associate with Huntington Estate,\" he grimaced. That's because Huntington is known in Australian arts circles for its ongoing support of chamber music through its annual festival which is now in its 26th year. Tim and Nicky Stevenshave maintained and built on this musical traditional since buying the property a decade ago from the founders of Huntington Estate, Bob and Wendy Roberts.\nOutside the track changes and it takes but a few bars to pick the tune, a '70s \"classic\" from Bob Seger, We've Got Tonite (sic). Stevens and I exchange a chuckle at the incongruity of it all and get back to what's in the glass.\nWine standards at Huntington have been more than upheld also and the smells and tastes in front of me strike familiar Mudgee chords. These are varietally expressive whites with tangy, exuberant fruit; reds rich in dark berries, dried spice, and formidable tannins. Mudgee tannins are a force of nature and across the other side of town at Logan Wines, Peter Logan describes them as 'gritty', and I know exactly what he means: ironstone gravel being ever so slowly and finely ground down.\nJust the type of wines to tackle the homegrown Berkshire and Wessex Saddleback pork on the menu just up the road from Huntington at Robert Stein's Pipeclay Pumphouse. Stein's '11 cabernet sauvignon is right up there with those of Huntington, although if the roasted pork loin with parsnip puree and red cabbage was on the menu I'd be going for the juicier, easier on the tongue non-reserve wine. Although this dish would most likely have changed by the time you read this as Andy Cresanti's​ menu is genuinely seasonal.\nThis will also mean that you'll miss out on the truffled sopressa, made with locally-sourced winter black truffles. No matter, you will still find the house-made pork rillette which is something of supreme beauty, especially with one of Stein's toothsome rieslings. It's exciting to see more Mudgee producers getting serious about riesling as the region does it well (so too semillon, of course).\nYou can buy Pipeclay Pumphouse pork rillette to take away at The Botobolar Shop in town, along with a number of other delicious local comestibles. Which must include a slab or two of Spencer Cocoa's milk and dark Vanuatu chocolate.\n The food-wine experience at Stein's is second-to-none in Australian wine country, as it is at Lowe Wines 15 minutes drive away. The Lowe winery is paired with Zin House where Kim Currie also crafts excellent food. The rustic-sophisticated Lowe cellar door experience was the best that I encountered in the district and the number of visitors coming and going during my short visit was remarkable.\nSmall groups are seated with flights of wine presided over by knowledgeable cellar door staff (all with responsible service of alcohol badges on display) and guided though the chosen line-up of wines. All remarkably slick but personable I thought.\nThe key to success of any wine region is variety and diversity, not just in the wines placed before you but in the nature of the interaction with the wine, and other producers. The Mudgee I visited in September – wine region and town – I couldn't believe was the same place I last visited more than 15 years ago. The heritage heart of the town remains but it is now pulsing with many (good) cafes and places to eat and drink. Mining, not wine, has played the most profound part in re-energising Mudgee, but tourism is also an increasingly central component of the district's daily life.\nIn the centre of town, Roth's, one of the oldest wine bar licences in NSW, remains superficially unchanged, but the wine in the glass and food on the plate is everything a modern establishment of its kind should be. I'd be living there if I lived in Mudgee (and some people seemingly do).\nThe cellar-door selection ranges from the super-polished at Lowe's (as mentioned) and that offered at the elegantly styled Logan facility, which is pretty much the first cellar door you'll encounter if driving from Sydney. But for complete contrast you can visit the considerably more homespun, but no less fun, shack that is Skimstone across the road (both enjoy beautiful outlooks).\nWhile back over at Buckaroo, where Huntington Estate is located, you might hang out at Short Sheep micro-winery which truly lives up to its name. Owners Sue Ridler and Tony Shadbolt take care of the place and make two contrasting expressions of shiraz (among other things) and will happily show you around while their ovine charges keep the vineyard in good order (at ground level anyway).\nThis year Huntington Estate's Music Festival runs from November 21-22, so you might make a visit and take in some tunes. And then, with a region with so much to offer and to Quote: Bob Seger, \"Why don't you stay?\"\nWHAT TO DRINK\nSERIOUS MUDGEE MOUTHFULS\nLowe Nullo Mountain Riesling 2012 (Mudgee, NSW}\nDeep and serious: pulpy and peachy.
