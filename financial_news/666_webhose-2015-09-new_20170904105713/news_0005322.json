The agreement aims to restore debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability in the country to foster a return to high growth and job creation, while protecting social spending. \nThe country received the first tranche of 100 million dollars in April. The IMF board approved the disbursement of the second tranche of about 116 million dollars to Ghana Monday August 31, 2015. This is expected to hit the account of the Bank of Ghana in the second week of September 2015. \nBut the Minority in Parliament is raising legal issues with the disbursement. \nMinority Spokesperson on Finance, Dr. Anthony Akoto Osei is demanding the recall of Parliament to ratify the loan agreement. \nThe Minority, he told Joy News, are prepared to go to court to ensure the right thing is done. \nThey are therefore appealing to the IMF to stop any further disbursement until Parliament approves the agreement. \nMore soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:46:42.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
