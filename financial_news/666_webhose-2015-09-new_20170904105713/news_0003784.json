Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Catie Low Retail groups representing traders from the major supermarkets right down to the little, independent grocers have joined forces to push for reduced penalty rates.\nAnd it's understood this unlikely coalition has amassed a warchest of as much as $1 million to fund its representations to Fair Work Australia's review of penalty rates.\nThe Australian Retailers Association,the National Retail Association, the Retail Council and Master Grocers Australia are leading a push to reduce the Sunday penalty rates to time-and-a-half instead of double-time.\nThe group has already commissioned a report from Deloitte on weekend work in Australia as well as a piece on the retail award in Australia.\nThe Australian Retailers Association's Russell Zimmerman says the penalty rate the group was pushing for was above the rate recommended by the productivity commission, which was time-and-a-quarter.\nMr Zimmerman says this was the first time the retail associations had come together and worked co-operatively to push for change.\n\"What this comes down to is a retailer paying 105 per cent of his turnover on a Sunday to run his business,\" Mr Zimmerman said.\nHe says a reduction in penalty rates would ultimately create more employment opportunities in the retail sector, particularly for young people.\n Jos de Bruin represents independent grocery and liquor traders through Master Grocers Australia and he says the only way the retailers could fight the the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association was by banding together.\nBut he says this fight wasn't just about the retail sector or workers, it was about safeguarding the future of the Australian economy.\n\"I wish I could say the union was sympathetic or collaborative... about this but they are not,they are at risk of doing serious damage to the Australian economy,\" Mr de Bruin said.\n\"This is one of the greatest imposts on independent liquor and grocery stores, we just can't afford to pay $50 an hour for a casual on a Sunday.\"\nThe ACTU says a proposal to cut hospitality workers' penalty rates is \"reprehensible\" in a terse exchange with the Productivity Commission into workplace relations on Friday.\nThe Productivity Commission, tasked with reviewing Australia's workplace relations framework, released its draft report last month with a wide range of potential changes to laws settled under the previous Labor government.\nThe unions have vehemently opposed its recommendation that cafe, entertainment and retail workers' Sunday penalty rates – usually double the rate of their base pay – be cut to Saturday levels, arguing it would create \"two tiers\" of Australian workers and hurt the most vulnerable Australians.\nScott Connolly, assistant secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, confronted Commission chairman Peter Harris about this on Friday at a public hearing in Canberra, calling the recommendation \"reprehensible in this space\".\nWhile the gap between poor and rich was widening in Australia, the report's recommendations favoured the employer over the employee rather than focusing on the need to balance both their needs. It did not deal with many inequalities in the work force and \"fails to promote the labour force participation of women, migrants and the unemployed.\"\n\"The draft report is a failure and we reject it,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@catielow"], "published": "2015-09-11T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:44:52.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
