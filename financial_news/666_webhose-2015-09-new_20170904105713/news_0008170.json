It gave no details of their identities.\nThe announcement, dated Tuesday, said they were the \"first batch\" of penalties under the July 8 rule, suggesting more might be announced.\nThe ban on sales by shareholders who own more than 5 percent of a company was one of a flurry of measures imposed after China's main market index fell 30 percent beginning in early June.\nThe violators' sales \"seriously undermined the market order and damaged investor confidence,\" the securities commission said in a statement.\nOther emergency measures included multibillion-dollar stock purchases by a state-owned brokerages and a finance company.\nAuthorities have reduced the scale of those purchases but have set no date for easing the ban on sales by big shareholders.\nThe stock market slump fueled political tensions and set back Communist Party plans to use financial markets to make China's state-dominated economy more productive. The party wants to encourage stock ownership but small investors whose holdings plunged in value have said they will no longer buy shares.\nIn a separate case, the police ministry announced Sept. 15 the general manager and other executives of China's biggest stock brokerage, state-owned Citic Securities Ltd., were under investigation on suspicion of insider trading and leaking sensitive information.\nOn Sept. 16, the ruling party's discipline agency said the deputy chairman of the securities commission was suspected of \"serious violations of discipline,\" the official term for corruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:27:47.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
