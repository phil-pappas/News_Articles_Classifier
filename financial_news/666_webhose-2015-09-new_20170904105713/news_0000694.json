Our research supports the use of varenicline as an effective and safe tool to help people quit,” said Daniel Kotz, from the Medical Faculty of the Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Germany.\n“On the basis of our extensive analysis, we believe it is highly unlikely that varenicline has any significant adverse effects on cardiac or mental health,” said Aziz Sheikh, Co-Director of the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Medical Informatics.\n“Regulators such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should review its safety warning in relation to varenicline as this may be unnecessarily limiting access to this effective smoking cessation aid,” Sheikh said.\nResearchers at Maastricht University in Netherlands, University College London in UK, and Harvard Medical School in US, also contributed to the study.\nThe study was published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\nFirst Published on September 07, 2015 9:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:10:05.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
