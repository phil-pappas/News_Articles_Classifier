Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama did not give further details on exports or output. \nFreeport negotiated a six-month export permit with the Indonesian government on July 27. It is still in talks on new government rules making it compulsory for its exports to be transacted through letters of credit issued by domestic banks. \n(Reporting by Bernadette Christina; Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and Wilda Asmarini in Jakarta; Writing by Michael Taylor; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:34:40.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
