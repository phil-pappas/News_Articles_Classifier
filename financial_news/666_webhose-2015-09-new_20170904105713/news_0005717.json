PeerLogix's patent pending platform collects Torrent data, including IP addresses of the uploading and downloading parties (e.g., location), the name, file type, media type (whether movie, television, documentary, music, e-books, software, etc.), and genre of media downloaded, and utilizes licensed and publicly available demographic and other databases to further filter the collected data to provide insights into consumer preferences to digital advertising firms, product and media companies, entertainment studios and others.\nTorrent is a geography agnostic platform used by approximately 130 million people worldwide to share TV shows, movies, music, pictures, video games, e-books and software with one another. All major entertainment and media content is available to consumers using Torrent to access media. Of this population of Torrent users, approximately 40 million reside in the United States and 90 million are distributed throughout all major and developing countries of the world.\nTorrent activity represents one of the most significant categories of global Internet usage, comprising approximately 22% of all Internet traffic. Although Torrent data available at any one point in time is ephemeral and is then lost, PeerLogix has been storing and continues to store all such data in a fully scalable database which has been aggregating the results since approximately January 1, 2014, providing the distinctive ability to provide trend data on the basis of media consumption. The Company's proprietary platform operates on an automatic basis with little human interaction and continually acquires and catalogues Torrent data in real time, obtaining millions of data points daily.\nForward Looking Statement \nCertain of the statements contained in this herein include future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other \"forward-looking\" information.
