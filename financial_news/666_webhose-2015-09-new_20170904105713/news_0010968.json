My apologies to the Parisians, but the farmers are coming.\" \nDuring the summer, protesting farmers around the country dumped manure in cities, blocked access to roads and motorways and prevented tourists from reaching the popular Mont St-Michel in northern France. \nIn the latest protest, tractors from all over France have for a week been converging on Paris at an average speed of 35 kilometres per hour (22 miles per hour). \nPolice have asked \"drivers to postpone their trips\" into the capital on Thursday and to take public transport, as traffic is expected to be severely disrupted. \nFarmers' unions have been negotiating with the government, which unveiled an emergency package worth 600 million euros ($680 million) in tax relief and loan guarantees in July. \nBut they say this is woefully inadequate, as tales of farms going under -- and in the most extreme cases of suicides -- hit the news. \nThe agriculture minister has estimated that around 10 percent of farms in France -- approximately 22,000 sites -- are on the brink of bankruptcy with a combined debt of one billion euros. \nA delegation of some 100 farmers will go to France's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, Thursday to hand over to lawmakers \"the demands and grievances of an agricultural and rural world that is on the brink of exploding and that expects a lot from its national representatives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T23:08:48.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
