The Tennessee-based distillery prides itself on crafting spirits that few would ever think to make — say, a quinoa whiskey or a buckwheat whiskey (the latter is called “Buck Yeah”). It’s a formula that appears to be working: The company’s annual sales have increased from about 1,000 cases in 2010 to 10,000 in 2014. And its spirits are winning serious industry awards and recognition: Whisky Advocate magazine named Corsair’s Triple Smoke its Artisan Whiskey of the Year in 2013, for example.\nNow, Corsair is marking the fifth anniversary of Triple Smoke, its best-selling spirit, and even recently launched a barrel-strength version of the sip that clocks in at 110 proof (the regular Triple Smoke is 80 proof). Either way, the whiskey is unique because of its mix of three kinds of “smoke.” The traditional “smoky” Scotch, which typically comes from the Islay region (think the Laphroaig brand), relies on one kind of smoky component — that is, malted barley that’s been dried with peat smoke (and thus flavored by it). With Triple Smoke, the barley has also been treated with beechwood smoke and cherry wood smoke. Corsair owner Darek Bell makes the point that the blend of smokes adds complexity and depth to the whiskey, so why stop at one? “Let’s forget our preconceived notions,” he says.\nWhat we think about it: Triple Smoke (in the 80 proof version) is as close to a modern “classic” as you can find in American whiskey. It’s a devil of a drink in that you can’t quite call it a smoky Scotch (for starters, it’s not made in Scotland), but it has those sitting-by-the-campfire elements of a good Islay whisky. Yet there’s a sweetness there, too — you can definitely taste hints of cherry. And given that great Scotches can easily run in the triple figures these days, Triple Smoke is something of a bargain as well.\nHow to enjoy it: Yes, you can enjoy your Triple Smoke in some very unique cocktails. The Corsair folks suggest a “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” drink with lime and pineapple juices, among other ingredients. But we wouldn’t get too adventurous here. Enjoy Triple Smoke neat and appreciate it for all its unadorned smoky genius.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://zesterdaily.com/drinking/cocktail-hour-triple-smoke-whiskey/", "http://www.corsairartisan.com/index.html", "http://whiskyadvocate.com/2013/01/21/whisky-advocates-19th-annual-award-artisan-whiskey-of-the-year/"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:03:35.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
