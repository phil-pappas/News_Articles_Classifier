One person said fire melted a couple of windows,\" Steinberg wrote. \"They opened the back door and slide went down and smoke started coming in plane, followed by mad dash to front. A lot of panic.\" \nA spokeswoman for British Airways, which is owned by IAG , said safety is always the airline's priority and the airline is looking after customers.
