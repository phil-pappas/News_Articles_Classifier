Federal Reserve meeting next week to make a decision on interest rates. \n\"The fact that we haven't been able to hold on to the gains that we've seen in the first part of the week suggests that I think investors remain very unsure,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. He said it would be difficult to get a clear idea of the direction stocks would take ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting. \nMiners led the gainers, with Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) rising 2.5 percent on a broker upgrade from UBS to \"buy\". \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) was up 1.9 percent and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) 2.9 percent as spot iron ore prices posted a weekly gain of nearly 5 percent to their highest level since July. \nAnglo American is also likely to be the next mining firm to follow Glencore's example in cutting its dividend to help contain debt levels and preserve cash amid a global commodity market slump, analysts and bankers said. \nGlencore, weighed down by net debt of $30 billion and hurt by declines in the prices of its main copper and coal products to six-year lows, this week suspended dividends and said it would sell assets and raise $2.5 billion in a share sale. \nIn all, the FTSE 350 mining sector index was set to close 7.2 percent higher for the week.
