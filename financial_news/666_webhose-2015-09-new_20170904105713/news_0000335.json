That illustrates the effect of the recent public presentation of Dr. Jimanze Ego-Alowes' book, Economists as Assasins: The Nigerian Connection on readers. The author wrote the book with strong philosophical framework, looking at past leaders' mistakes and building his economic debate from there. That was gathered at the event which was held in GRA, Ikeja recently with literary minds such as the poet and polemicist, Odia Ofeimun, Otunba Tola Adeniyi and Henry Boyo. Also present was the former Commissioner for Information in Anambra State, Mr. Toyin Onyima. Boyo eulogised the author's effort at writing profoundly on the subject with a view to reorienting the reader. \n\"His thoughts are grounded in history and are universally applicable across the globe. The underlying precept to the work is found in its first chapter,\" he revealed. He added that the book is no mere literary consumption but is targeted at changing attitude to economics. Otunba Adeniyi, the author of The Lunatic, urged the author to commercialise the book to get the reward for his painstaking effort at bringing to the fore, powerful arguments that can change the collective thought process of the Nigerian people for good. \nOfeimun who was introduced by Otunba Adeniyi was glad that the book had opened a door for intellectual discourse on the subject matter of economics. He recalled his days at Guardian Newspaper and how the newsroom was a hub of intellectual engagements. \"Boyo may be soft spoken but he has many violent ideas. He generally would turn the Nigerian system upside down. To make it work if he was given a chance and frankly we need someone who can attempt it with some good sense of rationality. That is what we don't have in the Nigerian system,\" he said as he recounted the many instances of debates shared with like minds. Ofeimun said that although he had not read the book, he knew that what some economists had done, if clearly understood, could prompt citizens to 'cork guns'. \n\"Some ideas when mixed destroy lives more fundamentally than guns do. It is so formalised that when you enter any Nigerian university, the brightest students are the ones disliked by their lecturers. In public life, the same thing happens. There are rational ways of getting involved in debates and there are irrational ways too. If you can manage to follow a debate, and be able to point out to the individuals involved, where they are not following their own rules, then you know you have a strong basis at arriving at reasonable conclusions,\" he remarked. \nOfeimun recalled his personal experience of how a bad economic decision can affect the quality of lives of a people. His father was a rich man who crashed out of business during the bank crisis in the early 50s. He didn't need to read economics. All he did was to read his father's life to see how a thriving business was knocked out by those he called the \"mismanagers\" of the economy. \"My father was investing in banks. Since then, I never let economics rough handle my way of thinking. When I find a good economist, I love to read his book just like my brother here,' he said, referring to the author. \nFor him, Nigeria is yet to have proper economic thinkers as managers of the society. He argued that even when the economic thinkers come to the political scene, they always end up in a group that has no interest in economic organisation. \"We have two political parties apparently pretending to be very different. The way they define their differences is such that if you go into it, you will never be able to know the meaning of the word progress. They are not discussing the Nigerian society. When people turn curses into analysis, they are no longer in a position to save the country. I want us to be frank with ourselves. In Nigeria, no political party has provided us with a clue to solve the nation's problem. \n\"You have a situation where the European Union says come and sign this agreement. The agreement simply says we are manufacturers. We will lend money to you to buy from us. That is the simple meaning of the economic partnership agreement that many African countries have signed but Nigeria has refused to sign. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria told us that 2.1bn will be lost if the current government signs it. The same problem that Jonathan had is the same that Buhari has. If a foreign government says that I am going to build a refinery, but I will build it in my country first, dismantle it then bring it to your country and plant it, it means we are going to pay three times for one refinery. It is not about who is in government. We need a country with a strong spine in order that strong leaders can make sense. The general institutions in the country need to be strengthened,\" he argued. \nHe encouraged other writers to tell the truths about their country and desist from partisanship which promotes lies. He said with good economic structure in place, it is possible to wipe out illiteracy from Nigeria from age 60 downwards. The poet who was secretary to late nationalist, Chief Obafemi Awolowo said that free education in the Western region was an economic decision. \"Whether you are in politics or not, whatever happens there affect all of us. Jimanze has a way of taking the broad strokes while waiting for you to fill in the gaps,\" he added.
