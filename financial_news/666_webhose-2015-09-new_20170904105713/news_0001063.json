Photo: Aaron Bunch\nThe ITUC's general secretary, Sharan Burrow, said: \"If Chevron avoids so much tax in Australia, imagine what they might do elsewhere.\"\nAdvertisement The battles with tax authorities appear to be confirmed in the company's annual report, which states that \"examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2014\".\nIn fact, the annual report states, Chevron has not had a filing approved in Nigeria since 2000, Angola since 2001, Saudi Arabia since 2012 and Kazakhstan since 2007.\n\"The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain,\" the company's annual report, released in February , states.\n\"It is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company's total unrecognised tax benefits within the next 12 months\" but that \"the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognised tax benefits\".\nChevron, which is set to be a major supplier of energy to the Asia-Pacific with its $US54 billion Gorgon project in Western Australia, has long been accused of using subsidiaries in Bermuda, Singapore and Delaware that allows it to avoid paying billions of dollars of tax locally .\nThe company, which has been in a court dispute with the Australian Taxation Office over the amount of taxes it pays locally, has denied claims it dodges tax.\nIn a submission to the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance, Chevron Australia managing director Roy Krzywosinski said the company was forecast to contribute over $1 trillion to Australia's economy over the next 25 years, create more than 165,000 jobs and deliver more than $380 billion in federal revenue through its projects.\nA spokesman for Chevron told Fairfax Media the company's total worldwide income tax expense was $66.8 billion between 2011 and 2014. \"Chevron abides by a stringent code of business ethics, under which we comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.\"\nBut the ITF report, launched late on Thursday and endorsed by the Tax Justice Network, said the energy giant had $US35 billion in untaxed profit stashed in offshore accounts.\nThe report, Chevron's Tax Schemes: Piping profits out of Australia? , is being released at the Global Labour Tax Summit held at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva.\nIt details how the company is under scrutiny by several tax authorities, including the Australian Taxation Office, for tax avoidance.\nThe report's author, Jason Ward, a senior global strategist at the International Transport Workers' Federation, said stronger anti-avoidance powers introduced by Treasurer Joe Hockey into Parliament on Wednesday were welcome, but would be unlikely to help the ATO win the case.\n \"The government's Multinational Tax Avoidance Bill is a step in the right direction, but an initial read suggests that it won't have any impact on Chevron's latest tax scheme,\" Mr Ward said.\n\"This scheme, like the previous one, relies on high-interest related party loans from Delaware. Australia must legislate additional changes to thin capitalisation rules to shut down this rort.\"\nChevron in its 2014 annual report itself noted that \"the tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world\".\nIt also revealed that it had set aside $352 million to settle the lawsuit with the ATO.\nThe Tax Office claims Chevron avoided paying $258 million in taxes by shuffling loans and other payments through various subsidiary companies and other related bodies.\nBetween 2004 and 2008, Chevron shifted $2.5 billion from the US tax haven of Delaware. The money was borrowed in Delaware at 1.2 per cent and lent in Australia at interest rates above 9 per cent, thereby allowing it to reduce its Australian taxable income.\nJustice Richard Edmonds' pending judgment in the case will determine how aggressively the ATO can pursue other Gorgon partners.\nAs detailed in a recent Australian Financial Review investigation , Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are headed for another showdown with the Tax Office over tax-free profits of up to $3 billion a year.\nThe Tax Office is investigating funding payments for the Gorgon project that will deliver estimated tax-free profits of more than $60 billion to the partners over the life of the development.\nChevron is one of a number of multinationals including miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and technology companies Apple, Google and Microsoft, that have come under fire for using subsidiaries and related companies to minimise their tax bills.\nThese companies have all recently been called before the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance to explain their tax minimisation practices.", "external_links": ["http://www.chevron.com/annualreport/2014/", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/joe-hockeys-multinational-crackdown-is-bad-tax-law-that-will-spark-global-revenue-wars-say-experts-20150916-gjnsds.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/chevron-a-hornswoggler-of-the-highest-order-20150507-ggwvm3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/ato-chief-chris-jordan-fires-back-at-multinationals-on-their-evidence-to-corporate-tax-inquiry-20150421-1mqd4q.html", "http://www.world-psi.org/en/tax-publication", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/chevron-exxonmobil--shell-and-the-3-billion-gorgon-tax-twostep-20150814-gizijk"], "published": "2015-09-18T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:23:34.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
