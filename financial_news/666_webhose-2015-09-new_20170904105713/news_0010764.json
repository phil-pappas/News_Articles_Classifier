The report also revised up the June increase in construction spending to 0.7 percent from 0.1 percent previously. \nGround breakings for houses, apartment complexes and commercial centers have helped to improve overall economic growth. The government said last week that the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the April-June quarter, after having edged up just 0.6 percent in the first quarter. \nTotal construction spending has risen 13.7 percent over the past 12 months. \nIn July, construction of single-family houses advanced 2.1 percent. Factories rose 4.7 percent, and power facilities increased 2.1 percent. \nSpending on government building projects slipped 1 percent, although they have risen over the past year largely because of the construction and maintenance of highways and streets. \nThe gains from residential construction have laid a foundation for broader economic growth since the beginning of 2014, after the sector suffered severe setbacks during the Great Recession due to the bursting of the housing bubble. The economy entered its seventh year of recovery this summer. \nOther reports point to the strength in residential construction. \nHousing starts rose 0.2 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million homes, the government said last week. All of July’s gains came from construction of single-family houses, which climbed 12.8 percent to the highest level since December 2007 Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:20:42.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
