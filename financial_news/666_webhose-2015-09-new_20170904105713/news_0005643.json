Bloomberg Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Liberals still seething over last week's leadership spill are vowing to target Treasurer Scott Morrison, who has found himself the ongoing focus of Tony Abbott's ire.\nMr Abbott accused Mr Morrison of \"badly misleading\" the Australian people after Mr Morrison said last week that he had tried to warn Mr Abbott 's office three days before he was ousted by Malcolm Turnbull that the brewing coup was a real threat.\n\"Not true, not true; Scott never warned anyone,\" Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph.\n\"He certainly never warned me. I spoke to him on Friday [before the coup]: not a hint of a warning.\n\"So I'm afraid Scott badly misled people. I was doing what I could do to save the government, that's what I was doing.\"\nMr Morrison voted for Mr Abbott in the spill but was elevated to Treasurer, replacing Joe Hockey . His former friends accuse him of running dead by knowing all along he would benefit from a change to Mr Turnbull, and not using his numbers to protect Mr Abbott.\nOne Liberal still angry at events said Mr Abbott's outburst was \"not the end of it\" and the new Treasurer would be the target of ongoing ire from the right.\n\"We're not going to let him become the [leadership] successor,\" he said.\n Mr Abbott took a shot at Mr Turnbull and his new team by claiming he and Mr Hockey had been doing nothing wrong.\n\"Joe will be judged much more kindly in the months and years ahead than he was when he was actually doing the job,\" he said.\n\"The fact that no policy settings have been changed testifies to the soundness of Joe's stewardship.\"\nMr Morrison declined to engage with Mr Abbott, but last week he said that once Mr Turnbull had issued the challenge, Mr Abbott had offered him the deputy leadership, and by extension, the Treasury, to save his prime ministership.\nHe said he had offered to throw Mr Hockey under a bus.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:42:04.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
