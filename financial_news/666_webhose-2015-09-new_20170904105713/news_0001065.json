We believe that we have come in at the right time to provide these equipment,\" said Mr Malunga. \nWhile a loader imported from Germany costs over Sh20 million, those that will be assembled here will cost about Sh13 million, resulting in savings of Sh7 million, said Managing Director Shadrack Mwangolo. \nAccording to Mr Malunga, the company will set up stations in each county and employ machinery operators to enable the devolved units to hire the equipment. This will create at least 5,000 jobs across the country. \n\"Liebherr products have been proved to be reliable and durable and will serve as a key driver to development in the counties,\" he said, adding that there were plans of establishing branches in other countries in the region.
