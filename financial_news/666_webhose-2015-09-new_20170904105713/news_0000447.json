He was 21.\nKyle Jean-Baptiste died Friday night following the show’s evening performance at the Imperial Theatre, said representative Marc Thibodeau, who called it a ”tragic accident.”\n”The entire ‘ Les Miserables ‘ family is shocked and devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of Kyle, a remarkable young talent and tremendous person who made magic – and history – in his Broadway debut. We send our deepest condolences to his family and ask that you respect their privacy in this unimaginably difficult time,” a statement from the production reads.\nThe actor was an ensemble member of the company and an understudy for Valjean, going onstage as the ex-convict in a history-making appearance July 23. His last performance in the role was Thursday.\nThe Broadway community took to Twitter on Saturday to mourn the loss of a young talent.\n”Shocked and saddened to have lost one of Broadway’s youngest treasures,” tweeted Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry. Former ”Glee” star Matthew Morrison, starring in ”Finding Neverland,” called him ”such a pure voice. Heartbreaking.” Patina Miller, a Tony winner for ”Pippin,” said: ”My heart goes out to all who knew and loved this incredibly talented young man.”\nA spokeswoman for the New York Police Department said investigators believe Jean-Baptiste’s death was accidental.\nAccording to police, Jean-Baptiste was sitting on a fourth-floor fire escape of an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn with a 23-year-old woman Friday night when he stood up, slipped and then fell backward to the ground.\nThe city’s medical examiner will determine his official cause of death, police said. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment late Saturday.\nJean-Baptiste was born in New York and graduated from Baldwin Wallace University. The 6-foot-2-inch tenor had recently landed two musical roles at Playhouse Square in Cleveland – in ”Murder Ballad” and ”Love Story.” He also had played Enjolras last year in a production of ” Les Miserables ‘ at the Idaho Shakespeare Festival.\nAfter making stage history as the first black Valjean, he told Playbill: ”I did not immediately think of it as making history. This was my dream since I was a little boy. This incredible team of creatives presented an opportunity to play a part I have dreamed of playing since I was introduced to theatre, and I am forever grateful. I felt a huge amount of responsibility to do right by them and to honor this iconic material.”\nIn one of his last tweets, sent Tuesday, Jean-Baptiste showed gratitude for his friends and fans: ”I thank everyone who supported me and still does. I will never forget this experience. Onwards and upwards,” he wrote. ”Nothing but love.”\nThe current ‘ Les Miserables ‘ on Broadway is the second revival of the hit show. It debuted in 1987 with Colm Wilkinson in the role of Valjean and lasted until 2003. A revival in 2006 lasted just a few years and the latest reimagined version landed on Broadway last year. In a few days, British opera star Alfie Boe is due to take over Valjean.\nFirst Published on August 30, 2015 5:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:28:22.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
