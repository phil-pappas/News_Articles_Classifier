But only a few of his titles were available in English and several of those had gone out of print. Mr. Modiano’s French publisher, Gallimard, said the Nobel spurred sales in France, where about 5 million copies of his novels have been sold since he was first published in 1968 at age 23.\nIn August, Yale University Press issued an English translation of Mr. Modiano’s memoir “Pedigree.” On Sept. 15, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt HMHC -1.97 % will publish a translation of his latest novel “So You Don’t Get Lost In The Neighborhood.” All told, 10 of his books have been published in the U.S. since the Nobel announcement last October. English translations of six more novels are due later this year and in 2016. Mr. Modiano, now 70 years old, spoke with The Wall Street Journal at his home in Paris’s 6th arrondissement. Below, an edited interview.\nYour novels depict a reality familiar to French readers, such as Paris street names and eras like the German occupation during World War II. Does that make your books difficult for a foreign audience?\nThese realities fuel an imaginary world. I happened to be born in Paris, but it would have been the same elsewhere. You’re always the prisoner of reality. It may be preferable for the reader not to know Paris, to read the book as pure fiction. The street names don’t matter.\nYour novels seem to be a quest for something. What is it?\nSolving an enigma, that’s what you get in detective stories. But they give you the solution, whereas in my books…\nDid you start writing to understand or imagine your father’s life during the war? As a Jew, he was hiding his identity but he also engaged in black-market activities with the German occupation forces.\nYes, it’s always a problem when you’re born right after the war, like me, in 1945. During my childhood, I heard intriguing snatches of conversation about the life my parents had led. That was a real enigma to me because it didn’t fit the black and white version of the war I was told at school. I grew up in a weird period, in a dark atmosphere, full of the last echoes of the war. The war haunted people. It’s even more true when your parents are a little weird like mine.\nENLARGE You’ve been hailed as the Marcel Proust of our time. Is there something like time regained in your novels?\nForgetting actually fascinates me more than remembering. Scraps of memory always surface from an ocean of oblivion. With Proust, the entire past emerges in a brutal way, like a tiered cake. “In Search of Lost Time” doesn’t grant any free space to the reader. Proust’s cobwebs are fascinating but they surround you; it’s a bit suffocating. More than in the continuity and length of time, I’m interested in the abyss of time elapsed, the smell of time.\nWhen you won the Nobel, you praised the short and “reassuring” sentences the Swedish Academy used to sum up your work. You also use simple sentences.\nWriting helps you reach some kind of serenity or simplicity. It helps you escape a stormy past, whose echoes persist in a muffled form in the book. I try to cover the chaos of life with a cloth of sober sentences, to smooth the past. But the surface of words eventually cracks and anguish re-emerges through the balm.\nWrite to Thomas Varela at thomas.varela@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK825_MODIAN_JV_20150911160311.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-14T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:17:51.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
