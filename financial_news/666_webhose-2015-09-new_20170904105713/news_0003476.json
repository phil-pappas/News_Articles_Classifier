Andrey Rudakov by James Chessell When commodities analysts at Goldman Sachs took a chainsaw to their outlook for the copper market in late July, alarm bells did not ring in the offices of Glencore.\nThe Swiss miner and trading house famous for making almost 500 of its senior employees instant paper multimillionaires – and its redoubtable chief executive Ivan Glasenberg a paper multibillionaire – when it floated in May 2011 has long prided itself on being able to read movements in commodity markets better than the competition. Vast quantities of coal, zinc, wheat, oil, copper and many other raw materials make its way around the world because of Glencore's traders.\nConsidered a barometer of global economic health, the price of copper was at the time threatening to trade at less than $US5000 a tonne for the first time since the depths of the global financial crisis because of concerns about weakening Chinese demand. However, Glencore's seasoned executives believed the red metal was unlikely to experience a prolonged slump at about $US4500 a tonne, which the bearish Goldman report was forecasting. Even if it did sink that low for a brief period, they reasoned, many copper miners would be forced to cut unprofitable production, which would constrict supply and push the price back up.\nYet the Goldman report turned out be a warning sign. Not so much of weakness in the copper market – it is too early to say whose predictions will be proved right – but of crumbling investor confidence.\nInvestor roadshow Soon after Glencore released a disappointing set of interim results in mid-August that included a 29 per cent drop in earnings and lower profit guidance for its trading arm, Glasenberg and chief financial officer Steve Kalmin embarked on an investor roadshow in Britain and the United States.\nWith Glencore's share price seemingly in freefall, the executives explained why they believed prices for Glencore's key commodities would hold up. However, many shareholders had taken Goldman's forecasts to heart.\n\"Investors were saying, 'We hear you Glencore but we've got to prepare for a doomsday scenario and we would prefer your company to be in a position where it could withstand anything',\" Glasenberg told AFR Weekend in a phone conversation.\n Glencore's response was to take what analysts at Investec described as \"drastic action\". On Monday morning in London, Glasenberg announced plans to slash the company's $US30 billion ($42.3 billion) debt pile by shelving dividends, selling assets and raising up to $US2.5 billion in fresh equity. Investors cheered the news, sending Glencore shares, which had lost more than half of their value since the start of 2015 – up 7 per cent on the day.\nBut the short-term sharemarket relief was not nearly enough to overcome the nagging sense that the party is over for Glasenberg. Having transformed Glencore from a poorly understood commodities trader based in Baar into one of the world's largest resources companies through the spectacular $US60 billion float four years ago and the takeover of mining group Xstrata in 2013, the hard-nosed South African was lauded as a savvy deal maker. While the big miners such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton dumped chief executives, sold non-core operations and hacked away at costs as the commodities boom turned to bust, Glencore showed no signs of slowing down. Glasenberg even suggested an audacious merger of equals to Rio chairman Jan Petrus du Plessis in July 2014.\nDeal went nowhere However, the Rio deal went nowhere and Glencore has suffered a dramatic fall in fortunes. Investors became increasingly concerned about the company's relatively high levels of debt as prices for its key commodities including copper, coal and oil continued to decline. Blaming some of the share price damage on \"short-term hedge funds\", Glasenberg argued as recently as the interim result that \"we can control our debt levels\" and indicated sufficient steps had already been taken \"in order to preserve our current credit rating and sustain our track record on equity distributions\". Yet the \"doomsday\" feedback from investors during the roadshow left him with no choice but to surrender.\nThe reaction by London's financial press, which has tended to be more far more positive about Glencore than its Australian equivalent, has been unusually harsh in some instances. Glasenberg has been accused of succumbing \"to his own publicity\" and suffering from \"denial\" for implying his shareholders were being overly cautious about commodity prices. Questions about the Glencore model, which includes trading and mining and is meant to insulate the company during downturns, have also been asked.\nThese arguments ignore the fact that no big resources company predicted the full extent of the China-led slowdown and that rivals Rio and BHP are equally guilty of making mistakes. Nevertheless, Glencore now faces a period of what Deutsche Bank analyst Rob Clifford describes as \"rebuilding the contract with equity investors\".\nClifford argues the reasons for buying the Glencore story at the time of its IPO was its capital discipline, the stable nature of the trading division, Glasenberg's talent for opportunistic acquisitions and management's ability to operate tough assets well. \"We now find Glencore is the first of the major miners to raise equity in the current tough pricing environment, the marketing division failing to deliver as indicated in [the first half of 2015], poor acquisition outcomes in [African oil group] Caracal and Xstrata and difficult operating outcomes in key assets,\" Clifford says.\nDecidedly upbeat Given all this, Glasenberg could be excused for feeling a little disheartened. Yet by all accounts he has been decidedly upbeat this week. Asked if he would do anything differently, he sticks with the explanation that he was simply listening to the wishes of concerned investors.\n\"It is clear that shareholders in the current market would prefer you have a more strict and tighter balance sheet than we are used to,\" he says. \"Shareholders have their view on doomsday scenarios and they want you to run their balance sheet according to those scenarios. That is the lesson we learnt.\"\nHe remains similarly consistent on the subject of Glencore's structure. \"The model works well. We do believe [the trading business] insulates us against pure falling commodity prices. I do think you want to be part of the full value along the chain, from extraction all the way to delivering it to the end customer. It works.\" The trading arm has hit its annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation target of $US2.7 billion-$US3.7 billion in the past three years and management are confident it will bounce back in the second half of 2015.\nGlasenberg remains confident the Glencore view of commodity markets will be vindicated.\nWhile BHP and Rio have stepped up their low-cost Pilbara iron ore operations during the downturn to increase market share at the expense of more-costly producers, Glasenberg has advocated curbing production to put a floor under prices. \"We should not be increasing production in anticipation of China demand,\" he said at the time of the company's first-half results, adding: \"Keep it in the ground. You can dig it out any time.\"\nIn November and again in February, Glencore announced cutbacks at its Newcastle coal operations because of subdued demand. Company executives say the decision has helped stabilise prices. On Monday it said it would suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper production at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia . The copper price responded by jumping more than 5 per cent, although it seems Glencore was partly lucky its announcement coincided with an increase in confidence.\nGlasenberg will no doubt take confidence – and credit – for having a positive impact on these key markets for Glencore. But after the events of recent months, it will be some time before investors are convinced.", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9c564824-5564-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3l4GVrSD3"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:06:58.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
