This was probably the result of stronger earnings by families and expectations the economy would continue to improve.\nThe labor market was probably already at full strength, he said, and there were already signs that wages could rise at a faster clip.\n\"Over the last year or so, reports of difficulty finding and hiring qualified workers have become notably more widespread and persistent,\" he said, referring to reports in his region.\nLacker said no discussion of the economy's state would be complete without considering recent volatility in financial markets.\nWorries over the strength of China's economy appear to have prompted the volatility, he said, but he noted that developments in China were unlikely to have a direct impact on U.S. economy.
