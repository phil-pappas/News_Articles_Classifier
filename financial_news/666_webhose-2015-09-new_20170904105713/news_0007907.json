Kate Geraghty Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason Nine Network's Perth managing director David Mott is leaving the free-to-air broadcaster to become head of the Australian arm of British television business ITV Studios.\nNine chief executive David Gyngell addressed staff late on Wednesday afternoon with the news.\nRay Wardrop, formerly Seven Network's Perth boss, will take over from Mr Mott, and will begin in the new role on November 2.\nMr Mott joined Nine in 2013 and was previously Ten Network's head of programming before leaving in 2012.\nMr Mott is one of the most highly regarded television programmers in Australia and was given the blessing of Mr Gyngell to enter into talks with ITV, as reported by Fairfax Media last month.\n\"On behalf of everyone across Nine I extend a warm welcome to Ray. He brings a wealth of television experience â€“ 14 years in the industry and four of those as the successful general manager of Seven Perth,\" Mr Gyngell said.\n\"Ray's a well-known and highly regarded figure in our industry with strong contacts across the Perth business and media community. He knows the turf, and we're thrilled to have him at Nine.''\nMr Gyngell also congratulated Mr Mott on his new role at ITV Australia.\n \"He has played a crucial role driving the successful rebuilding of Nine in Perth these past two years following its acquisition by Nine Entertainment from WIN in September 2013. We are very grateful for his expert stewardship and wish him the very best.\"\nITV Studios Australia had been searching for a replacement for the well-respected Anita Jacoby, who left the company in early August.\nThe role will likely see Mr Mott return to Sydney from Perth.\nHe was also among the favourites to takeover the Australian operations of the merged Endemol Shine Group, before Shine founders Mark and Carl Fennessy reversed their decision to leave following the merger.\nITV is the production house behind I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! , Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell , and The Chase Australia .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nines-mott-on-shortlist-for-itv-studios-role-20150821-gj4ins.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:11:37.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
