NHB to launch over 80 new housing finance companies, says top official NHB will work with RBI to address issues like loan retention and capital requirement, National Housing Bank MD and CEO Sriram Kalyanraman says NHB will work with RBI to address issues like loan retention and capital requirement, National Housing Bank MD and CEO Sriram Kalyanraman says \nDelhi-based National Housing Bank (NHB) is working to set up more than 80 new housing finance companies (HFCs), with a special emphasis on those that will focus on financing affordable houses. Sriram Kalyanaraman, the new managing director and chief executive of NHB, who was earlier with Mumbai-based credit information bureau Equifax Credit Information Services, is working to transform the NHB which is tasked with regulating, developing and refinancing HFCs. The NHB is a fully-owned entity of Reserve Bank of India. At present, there are 66 HFCS that are active; according to rating agency ICRA, HFCs loan portfolio grew by 22% to Rs 5,238 billion in March 2015, from Rs 4,298 billion in March 2014.\"If the goal of Housing for All by 2022 is to be reached, the number of HFCs (must go up to) in the region of 150, up from present number of 66,” Kalyanraman told Business Standard . “Look at the vast country. If they have to reach everywhere, their number of should be more.\" HFCs service a category of home-buyers that typically belong to low income groups, and therefore find it hard to compete with commercial banks for loan sizes in the range of Rs 30 lakh-Rs 40 lakh. As a result, their underwriting practices also often differ from those of larger banks since the emphasis is on understanding the socio-economic condition of customers, who others are not able to or willing to underwrite. The average cost of acquisition of a customer for an HFC is typically Rs 2,000. NHB will work with RBI to address its issues and capital requirements, Kalyanraman said, adding that he will push for some relaxation for HFCs on retaining loans for a certain period.“They need some sort of protection at least for initial period from balance transfers (read takeover loans),” he told Business Standard .“While respecting right of customer to move his loan, can we look at locking loan with HFC for 12-18 months,” Kalyanraman wonders aloud. The purpose, he says, is to give finance for housing and not just look at growing an outstanding loan book. At the other end (customer’s side), he pointed out, RBI has gone a long way in removing the unfair practice of holding on customers using the threat of prepayment charges. And given that affordable housing finance is a rapidly growing segment – ICRA estimates market size of about Rs 67,800 crore – NHB is looking at fresh ways of taking equity stakes in HFCs, as well as creating new instruments to help them. The portfolio of new players in the segment stood at Rs 6,500 crore as on March 31, 2015, and could expand rapidly with a compounded annual growth rate of over 50% over the next three-five years. However, regulatory challenges in monitoring the promotion of new HFCs will remain, and the NHB will have to keep an eye on their governance and ensure they stick to the rules for servicing lower-end customers. The meat of the work, though, remains in the area of development, refinance and capacity building. NHB’s goal, Kalyanraman says, is to become knowledgeable regulator for housing finance sector and provide more refinance for those serving lower segment. However, this will also likely mean that NHB changes its current management style, despite a small team and limited management bandwidh?\"Neither current structure nor bandwidth will be a constraint,” Kalyanraman insists. “The moment people see that you are implementing things so fast, enough support will come your way for increasing the people strength or make changes in the structure.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:49:07.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
