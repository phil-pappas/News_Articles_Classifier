However Majority of Indian marketers expect budgets to rise by 25% this year and by 51-99% in 2020.

The state of the industry reveals that around 47% audience believe that mobile as a marketing channel is effective and that it will benefit the brands (58% in India vs 65% in APAC). So education becomes extremely crucial at this stage. Indian advertisers are far more likely to have a formal mobile strategy for their brand. [60% in India vs 34% in APAC].

Consumer behaviour in India with regards to mobile usage is dramatic with 68% of consumers opting for multi screening. With regards to Mobile Marketing, content has become the king with most marketers focussing on content, search and app development.“It’s clear from the study that there is still a long way to go before brands and agencies in India understand the full potential of mobile for reaching consumers. It is encouraging to see however that those brands that have taken the leap are now learning to use mobile in innovative ways that integrate with other marketing activities, demonstrating mobile’s gradual move from the periphery to the centrepiece of marketing strategies,” said, Edward Pank , Managing Director at Warc Asia Pacific. Other findings from the survey revealed that Hindustan Unilever is regarded as the most innovative mobile brand in India, recognised as a “risk taker” and for having “inspiring creative”.

Within the umbrella-term of ‘education’, respondents noted concerns ranging from a lack of technological understanding to a lack of proven methods for delivering effective campaigns. While there is immense scope of growth, the industry needs education to thrive the challenge and sustain as the most important marketing tool. Social media is the most used channel and over half use mobile as a supporting channel. Other concerns for the industry, included Indian barriers to growth differ from wider region like metrics, content and data pricing. While the Industry has the potential to grow, it needs education.“For brands to really see the impact of mobile on their operations, they need to focus on three I’s – Investment, Innovation, and Integration.
