That's why we're introducing digital tax accounts for tens of millions of taxpayers and investing in HMRC's digital transformation,\" he said. \nThe Telford centre will focus on creating and improving online services for HMRC as part of a wider strategy to reduce the department's use of paper by offering more digital services that provide access to online tax forms. \nThe spokesman noted that HMRC uses digital â€˜iforms' for different tax services that allow people to access and complete tax documents, such as self-assessment and inheritance tax forms, though a web browser, but then requires them to fill out and post a paper equivalent. \nA major part of HMRC's digital strategy is the opening up and release of APIs for its services, so that third-party providers of tax software can connect their products to HMRC's digital systems. \nThe goal is to allow businesses to use tax software of their choice rather than HMRC and government-owned platforms, yet still connect to the services provided by the department. \nMark Dearnley , HMRC's chief digital and information officer, explained that the API strategy aims to encourage more innovation in the tax software market. \n\"Our vision is to provide software developers with better and richer APIs that will enable them to innovate and bring more sophisticated software products to the market,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:27:06.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
