The sector has seen a decline in respect of its contribution to the country’s GDP. \nMinister for Petroleum Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah is sure of a turnaround as government makes inroad in fixing the country’s energy challenge. \nSpeaking with Joy Business at a Gas Forum to deliberate on current developments in the sector, the minister indicated that government has set in motion a range of projects which would by the end of the year add over 300 to 400 million cubic feet of gas to the national stream of natural gas: a development he believes has the potential to propel the country industrially. \nMr. Kofi-Buah indicated that “the quantum leap in industrialization that has eluded this country for so long is going to come back if you look at the line-up of projects that are going to bring gas”. \nKey among these, according to him, is the arrival of the FPSO Mills by December. It would not only produce crude oil but also bring at least about 60 million cubic feet of gas, he said. \nMr. Armah-Kofi Buah stressed that the Jubilee gas that is currently producing over 100 million cubic feet of gas from Atuabo to the Aboadze enclave, would be boosted with additional gas from the Sankofa gas. \n“The ENI project which is obviously the largest project in the sub-region promises to give us a maximum of about 180 million cubic feet of gas. \n“The full-field development of Jubilee is also looking at a project that will possibly lead to the expansion of the Atuabo gas processing plant that will increase production” he added. \nGhana, in view of these projects coming on board, is hoping to generate over 300 to 400 million cubic feet of gas in the medium-term. This is expected to have a clear impact on Ghana’s electricity supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:28:13.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
