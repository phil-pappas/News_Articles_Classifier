Experts say the text message has overtaken email as the power medium inside workplaces because so many emails going unanswered.\nA succinct text to the chief executive ensures a much greater chance of a reply, and recognition, but make sure you use it sparingly.\nExperts say the sheer volume of emails bouncing around the world, estimated at 100 billion emails sent per day and with only 14 per cent of them considered critical to the running of a business, has made it truly overwhelming and increasingly ineffective.\nThe text message is getting real cut-through inside the corridors of power. Even in the endless round of meetings in modern workplaces it has a potency because it is immediately visible, and there's an unwritten code that it is higher up in the queue when it comes to importance.\nPeter Wilson, the national chairman of the Australian Human Resources Institute, the overarching body of HR professionals, says the text message definitely has more clout.\n\"It's immediate and it demands your attention,\" Mr Wilson says. He's held executive positions at ANZ, Amcor and worked in Federal Treasury, and has seen the workplace changes first hand.\n\"If it's really urgent then people do accept that it is okay to excuse yourself from a meeting\".\nHe also cautions that constant checking of emails in the workplace is increasingly distracting to people working on longer-term strategic projects, and finding the right balance is crucial.\n He believes checking emails around every two hours is sufficient in most circumstances for senior executives working in modern offices.\nBut for the increasing number of people working from home or in remote locations who are hooking into the communications system of their firm, it is natural to want to reply to emails as quickly as possible because of perceptions that home workers are somehow more distracted.\nThey go overboard to reply fast, and hence are checking emails much more regularly so they can bang back a reply.\nJuliet Bourke, a partner with Deloitte who is an expert in workplaces and \"human capital\", says the text message is powerful but there needs to be protocols around its usage inside the workplace when it comes to senior executives.\nFor those who work closely with them it is accepted practice and brings a level of immediacy that may be lost if the same information is sent as an email along with thousands of others that also arrive in an \"in\" box.\n\"At the moment the text message is a way of cutting through this but over time the text may also start losing some of its power,\" she says.\nEach workplace will have a different culture and it is important to establish a working relationship first before firing off text messages, because there are still traditional hierarchies where a personal assistant may be the gatekeeper for more junior employees trying to get an audience with the boss.\nEstablishing the ground rules is also important when it comes to those late-night emails that come through on people's smartphones. The familiar \"ping\" in the dead of the night when communications come through from a colleague who might be in an overseas office working on the same project needs to be treated with caution.\nMs Bourke says a junior employee may feel compelled to send back an immediately reply even if it is 11pm, without an understanding that colleagues have just sent it through as the next step in a project and the answer can wait until the next working day.\nA study completed for Deloitte in the United Kingdom earlier this month found that 12 per cent of smartphone users looked at their phones as soon as they wake up, while 55 per cent checked their phones within 15 minutes of opening their eyes after a night's sleep.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-09-10T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:04:02.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
