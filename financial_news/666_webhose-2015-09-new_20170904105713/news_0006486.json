But you know what? I don’t care. I’m going to keep breastfeeding, maybe even until she’s six.”\nThis isn’t the first time Milano, who is married to David Bugliari, has spoken out about breastfeeding.\nMORE: Mums on sustained breastfeeding\nHost Miley Cyrus walks the red carpet at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards last month.

Support from not only breastfeeding mums, but mums everywhere, has been really powerful and really overwhelming,” she said.\n ‘I’ll breastfeed my daughter until she’s six’", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/alyssa-milano-says-she-will-breastfeed-her-daughter-until-she-is-six/story-fnet08xa-1227519109798", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227519/111017-9461aa3e-5689-11e5-ade8-2efb76e8d469.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227519/109718-bab9ae0a-5686-11e5-ade8-2efb76e8d469.jpg", "http://mums.bodyandsoul.com.au/pregnancy+parenting/parenting+tips/mums+on+sustained+breastfeeding,17969", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227519/111043-ccd1f9d0-5686-11e5-ade8-2efb76e8d469.jpg", "http://celebritybabies.people.com/2015/05/02/alyssa-milano-breastfeeding-photos-daughter-elizabella-explained/", "http://mums.bodyandsoul.com.au/pregnancy+parenting/parenting+tips/galleries/5+things+you+need+to+know+when+youre+breastfeeding,26386", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrxBTENtSlI"], "published": "2015-09-09T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:33:40.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
