Obama and Salman will discuss the world economy and energy issues, Obama told reporters on Friday.\nSaudi Arabia has also joined the United States and other Arab states in air strikes against the Islamic State jihadist movement in Syria, also called ISIS.\n\"We continue to cooperate extremely closely in countering terrorist activities in the region and around the world, including the battle against ISIS,\" Obama said on Friday.\nObama and Salman discussed the potential fast-tracking of the release of American military technology and weapons systems to Saudi Arabia, al-Jubeir said, and discussed a \"new strategic partnership\" between the two countries, although he gave few details.\nThe Gulf state is in advanced discussions with the U.S. government about buying two frigates based on a coastal warship that Lockheed Martin Corp is building for the U.S. Navy, a deal valued at well over $1 billion.\nThe sale would be the cornerstone of a long-delayed multibillion-dollar modernization of the Royal Saudi Navy's Gulf-patrolling eastern fleet of aging U.S. warships and would include smaller patrol boats.\n(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Julia Edwards; Editing by Ken Wills, Tom Brown , Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:03:25.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
