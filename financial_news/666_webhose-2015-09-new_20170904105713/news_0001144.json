Clinton could face more hurdles if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.\nSanders already has introduced legislation in the Senate to crack down on what he called \"skyrocketing\" increases in prescription drug prices.\nOn Monday, shares in biotech companies such as Immunogen and Gilead Sciences dropped after Clinton tweeted that steep prices for specialty drugs were \"outrageous.\"\n\"Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on,\" she said. She pointed to a New York Times story about a 62-year-old drug to treat a deadly parasitic infection that soared in price to $750 a tablet from $13.50 after the drug was bought in August by a start-up pharmaceutical company.\n\"Big Pharma\" companies have long been criticized for steadily raising prices of prescription medicines in the United States, unrestrained by price controls that are common in other countries.\nAlso controversial has been a strategy of raising prices for older drugs after being acquired by other companies. Examples include the heart medications Nitropress and Isuprel, which were bought by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc this year.\nClinton's comments on Monday were her first about how to tackle high drug prices, but she has talked about the problems facing consumers before.\nIn June, Clinton said drug companies that benefit from a Pacific trade pact should offer bulk discounts on products to U.S. government programs such as Medicare.\nThe iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, which tracks an index of biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks, was down about 4.3 percent at 341.48 on Monday afternoon. The Nasdaq biotech index skidded 4.3 percent.\nFor more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, \"Tales from the Trail\" ( here ).
