But there were reasons to suspect this would make the Reserve Bank of Australia reluctant to cut interest rates further, even though they think the struggling economy will eventually force the central bank's hand. One of the stumbling blocks is the lower Australian dollar, which will give the economy a shot in the arm. AMP's Shane Oliver said the exchange rate's 37 per cent fall against the US dollar from its peak in 2011 may be bad news for anyone planning an overseas holiday, but that was the point. \"It's forcing Australians to think about holidaying more in Australia, it's helping drive a return in foreign tourists and foreign students to our universities and it's turning Australians off their love affair with shopping overseas which is good for our retailers,\" Dr Oliver said. UBS economists Scott Haslem and George Tharenou were among a number of economists who had anticipated a weak GDP figure. The national accounts on Wednesday revealed a paltry rise of 0.2 per cent in the June quarter, with annual growth at 2.0 per cent. That was well below the long-run average of over three per cent, they noted in a report. \"Moreover, looking ahead, at least to the middle of 2016, it seems unlikely Australia can shake-off this two per cent growth rate.\" ANZ's economics team - Felicity Emmett, Justin Fabo, Katie Hill, Daniel Gradwell and Kirk Zammit - said the small quarterly rise in GDP most likely understated the economy's strength, just as the 0.9 per cent rise in the March quarter overstated it. Even so, the economy's momentum remains \"quite weak\", they said. \"We expect growth to continue to trudge along at a below-average rate through the second half of this year.\" The July retail trade figures on Thursday, with the first monthly fall in 14 months, did nothing to dispel the gloom. St George Bank's Janu Chan said the results were disappointing and added to the uncertainty about the outlook for consumer spending and the non-mining parts of the economy. Even so, like the RBC team, Ms Chan was not convinced that the case for further interest rate cuts had been made by the latest round of bleak data. \"This will keep the rate cut debate alive, but low interest rates, rising house prices and an improving labour market should underpin moderate growth in household spending,\" she said.
