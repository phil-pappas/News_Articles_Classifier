The neo-liberal economic policies are only aggravating the problems of the workers and common masses,\" C H Venkatachalam, general secretary, AIBEA, said. \n\nBanking activities including clearing operations will be affected and normal banking activities will be hampered.  \n\n\"The strike has been forced on the unions by the governmentâ€™s anti-labour policies,\" Venkatachalam added.  \nHe alleged that there are continuous attempts to push through the reforms agenda aimed at privatisation of banks, consolidation and merger of banks. More and more private capital and FDI is being encouraged, he said, adding that private sector companies are being given licences to start banks.  \nVenkatachalam said the government is trying to privatise regional rural banks (RRBs) and primary agricultural co-operative societies (PACs) are under threat of winding up. Urban Co-operative Banks are under threat of delicensing while private sector executives are being imposed on public sector banks, he added.   \nBesides, he said government schemes are being imposed on banks without proper infrastructure and manpower, resulting in harassment of bank staff.  \nThe employees will hold protest rallies and demostrations throughout the country on September 1 and September 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:20:29.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
