The country also staged a shock devaluation of the yuan and intervened in the stock market. China is now shutting down its exchanges and banks until Monday to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japan’s World War II defeat, giving investors and bankers four days of respite.\nAt the world’s top investment banks, excluding Goldman Sachs Group Inc., revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading will fall 18 percent in the third quarter from the second instead of a previously projected 14 percent, with “currencies expected to be the best-performing asset class followed by rates and credit,” the analysts wrote. Revenue from equities trading may drop 20 percent in that period instead of 16 percent, according to the note.\nAt UBS Group AG, analysts’ top pick of the global trading and advisory firms, earnings per share will be 3 percent lower on average through 2016, driven by lower equity and corporate advisory revenues, according to the report. At Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, estimates for earnings per share were also cut by 3 percent for 2015, with with Deutsche Bank AG’s and Barclays Plc’s forecasts down 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.\n“We prefer cash equity and macro geared investment banks,” the analysts wrote in the report, when citing UBS and Deutsche Bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:49:26.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
