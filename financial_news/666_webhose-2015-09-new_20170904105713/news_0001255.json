Campaigns are rolling out this fall across the networks and will also be integrated into Corus' kids apps.\n\"We're excited about the opportunity to partner with Kimberly-Clark and Sunwing Vacations to develop creative, customized campaigns across our networks and digital platforms,\" says Marilyn Orecchio , Vice President, TV Sales, Client Strategy. \"Corus has become the destination for family viewing and reaches more than 90 per cent of moms, making this a great fit for these premium brands.\"\nEarlier this year, Corus conducted an online study with New York -based Feldman Research Lab. The survey polled 1,000 respondents in English Canada with children between the ages of 2-12 and revealed that TV is one of the top three most important activities for families to do together, along with meals and reading. Seventy-seven per cent of those parents associated family viewing with family time, while 84 per cent of parents reported watching TV as an easy and relaxing way to spend time together. \n\"In a time-starved world, watching television together has increasingly become an important family activity and our advertisers recognize this,\" added Orecchio. \nCampaigns have been customized for each charter sponsor. The integration of Kimberly-Clark's Pull-Ups Training Pants will be supported through an extensive linear and digital campaign across Treehouse, TELETOON, YTV and Disney Channel along with Corus' apps.\nThe sponsorship includes on-air brand spots, branded billboards and advertorials on Treehousetv.com and WDish.com . Additionally, custom content, including mom-focused television and radio spots, have been created to align Kimberly-Clark with the September launch of Disney Channel and the Disney Junior series featured on it. \nSunwing Vacations charter sponsorship will be featured throughout targeted family viewing programming blocks within ABC Spark, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, TELETOON, and YTV. Sunwing Vacations branded spots will be integrated into sponsorship billboards, closed captioning and lower thirds. \nAbout Corus Entertainment Inc. \nCorus Entertainment Inc. is a Canadian-based media and entertainment company that creates, broadcasts and licenses content across a variety of platforms for audiences around the world.
