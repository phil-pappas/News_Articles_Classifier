That allows them to attract more eyeballs and attention, which is what they live to do.\nBut it makes no sense for average retail investors, who include me, to pay attention to the endless maunderings and predictions. It also makes no sense to assume that the Fed is all-knowing and all-powerful, and that its smallest decisions have major long-term influence over the economy and the stock market. That's just not the case. Pretty much everyone involved in the Fed game knows this, but few people will say it out loud.\nSure, it was fun watching the Fed announcement and listening to the Brooklyn cadences of Janet Yellen. But seriously, there's no point immersing yourself in the navel-gazing minutiae. Photo: John Taggart\nIf you're a short-term trader, you have to play the game of figuring out what the Fed might do. That's because you have to try to anticipate what other traders will do in response to what you think the Fed will do.\nBut that's not a game we regular retail investors have to play. Or should play.\nYou gotta problem wit dat? Sure, I had fun watching the Fed announcement. And as someone who speaks with a pronounced Brooklyn accent - you gotta problem wit dat? - it was fun listening to the cadences of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\nHowever, the endless buildup to the Fed's announcement that it would do nothing to short-term or long-term interest rates, much of Yellen's news conference and the post-announcement hyperventilating barely engaged me.\nWould it have made a major economic difference if the Fed had raised short-term rates to a whopping 0.25 per cent from the current zero? It would have had virtually no impact on the economy, as best I can see, and it sure wouldn't have gotten me or other savers anything resembling a reasonable interest rate on our cash. Whatever impact a Fed rate rise might or might not have had on the stock market will be fleeting.\nWhat matters to a retail investor with a time horizon of longer than a week isn't what the Fed does or doesn't do on a given day. It's how well the world's largest economy and companies do over the intermediate and long term.\nYou can't figure this out by immersing yourself in Fed navel-gazing minutiae. And you certainly can't figure it out by paying attention to the people screaming at each other about what the Fed did.\nTune out the noise, folks. Spend time with your family and friends or read something interesting (in addition to this column) or do something else that will enhance your mental or physical well-being.\nThat's a far better use of your time than obsessing over the Fed. It will serve your long-term interests better. And it's a lot more fun.\nThe Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:03:31.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
