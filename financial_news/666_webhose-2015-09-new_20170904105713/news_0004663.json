The adult video website is offering a $25,000 scholarship to a legal age college student who likes making others happy. \nThe rules are simple. Applicants need a 3.2 GPA, an essay answering the question \"How do you strive to make others happy?\" and an up to five-minute video that \"elaborates on the good work you do and anything else you might want to say.\" \nBut, get your mind out the gutter: While the website features porn, those who are seeking a future career with the company need not apply. That's right: Pornhub is simply judging applicants for their hearts and minds. \n\"We will not seriously consider anyone if they include explicit material in the video,\" Pornhub Vice President Corey Price said via email. \"We are not looking for that whatsoever. I want to make that abundantly clear.\" \nPrice said that it decided to offer the scholarship in honor of its newly launched charity, Pornhub Cares, after discovering most of its viewers were between the ages of 18 to 25. It saw this as a way to give directly back to the millennial community. \n\"Pornhub Cares is a compilation of Pornhub's past, present and future philanthropic initiatives,\" he said. \"The Pornhub Cares Scholarship aligns with our trajectory here at Pornhub, which is firmly set on providing happiness and opportunity through the worldwide community we have established. It's about giving back and providing our fans with life changing experiences/opportunities.\" \nCharity has proven to be a way to reach disillusioned millennials. A survey by online publication Elite Daily and consulting firm Millennial Branding showed three-fourths of the age group said it was \"either fairly or very important that a company gives back to society instead of just making a profit.\" Companies ranging from Unilever to Patagonia are dedicating their resources towards non-profit initiatives. â€¹", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:34:20.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
