Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The Australian dollar surged back above US70¢ on the back of a stabilisation in Chinese, European and US stock exchanges as well as a minor pick up in commodity prices.\nAfter getting a boost from improved business confidence numbers on Tuesday afternoon, the dollar continued to rise overnight, hitting a high of 70.37 US cents. The local currency has established a new trading range in the past week, staying between US69¢ and US70¢.\nCapital Economics said stabilised equity markets, falling petrol prices and ongoing resilience in the labour market was likely to maintain business confidence into the next few months, keeping the dollar supported in its current range.\nThe dollar is however expected to continue to head south in late 2015 and into 2016.\nOn Wednesday morning the Commonwealth Bank followed suits started by major investment banks and Westpac of downward revisions to the dollar.\nThe Commonwealth Bank had been forecasting the dollar to reach US70¢ by the first quarter of 2016, and has now dropped that forecast to US65¢ by the same period.\nCurrency strategist Richard Grace said the revision was due to a strengthening US dollar and a push back in their forecast of China's economic recovery, which would hit its neighbouring economies as well as Australia by keeping commodity prices subdued.\nOn Tuesday, it rose slowly throughout the day after the monthly business confidence survey revealed better business conditions but seemed to reach a sticking point at US70¢.\n National Australia Bank senior currency strategist Emma Lawson said she expected the dollar to stay range-bound, US68¢ to US70¢, until mid-next week when the US Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting will take place.\n\"For the short term we're heading into a period with news from the FOMC and some key numbers out of China but if they're OK, we'll be somewhat stable and markets will continue to trade within existing ranges,\" Ms Lawson said.\nThe FOMC meeting will be a key indicator for the thousands of analysts and investors positioning for the impending US Federal Reserve rate increase, after almost a decade of historically low rates.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/116041942547218769712/posts"], "published": "2015-09-09T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:08:14.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
