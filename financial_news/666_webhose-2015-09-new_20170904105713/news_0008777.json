His father and grandfather both laboured in the same mine. \nPotash, trapped in layers of salt, is the key ingredient in many fertilisers. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a market believed to have enormous potential as the world tries to feed a growing population. But the industry has been forced to adapt to a sharp fall in prices, sparked three years ago by the collapse of a de facto oligopoly, in which a few firms exerted control over the market. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in K+S, the only commodity producer on Frankfurt's DAX index, are widely held and some employees are concerned that a high enough takeover offer could tempt investors. PotashCorp's last takeover offer was 41 euros a share -- higher than Friday's close of 35.25 euros. \n\"It is all the same to funds who want to maximise their profits quickly... we are all scared they will sell,\" said Metz. \n\"We fear PotashCorp will close sites,\" added Vanessa Konkel, an 18-year-old apprentice who is one of only seven women who go underground. Wearing a protective yellow helmet, she uses a machine to fix metal anchors to support the tunnel ceiling. \nPotash production in Germany is costly, in part because of the environmental rules. PotashCorp, on the other hand, has excess capacity. That is feeding speculation here that PotashCorp may simply want to control prices. \n\"The purchase does not make any sense for PotashCorp apart from creating a new consolidation in the potash industry, which is already concentrated,\" Societe Generale (Swiss: 519928.SW - news ) analyst Rajesh Singla said in June. \n- Appeal to Merkel - \nAccording to the German press, PotashCorp has promised not to touch the German sites for five years. But K+S argues that the legal conditions mean the promise has little weight. \nFive years \"is definitely not enough\", said 40-year-old mechanic Rene Korngiebel. \nRegional politicians have asked Berlin to help out, for example by taking a large enough stake in the group to block a takeover. But Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is not a fan of interfering in business. \n\"Having a majority shareholder would obviously help us but we don't have any influence over that,\" sighed Harald Doell, who represents employees on the board. \nAs they wait, workers cling to their traditions. On the last day at work of a company receptionist, it is time to get out the trumpets for the traditional miners' song, \"Steigerlied\". He, too, has worked here for his entire career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T10:38:54.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
