Targeting a certain designer gives both the consumer and designer a simpatico that their work looks good on them, for lack of a better word. \nJust as with shopping for many other items, the convenience of online shopping as opened the door to more brand awareness, more selection and lower prices, enabling consumers who were leery of spending top dollar for a prestigious label at a bricks and mortar store. The internet has also leveled the playing field, by facilitating new up and coming designers to promote their collections via the web .
