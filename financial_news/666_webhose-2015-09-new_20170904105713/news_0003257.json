Written by: Robert McGarvey 09/10/15 - 12:04 PM EDT More Headlines How To Buy NFL Tickets Without Bankrupting Yourself \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Congratulations, you just took a new job, but then there is this reality: you hate it. You want to quit . Should you? This is job hunter’s buyer’s remorse. Keith Rollag, a management professor at Babson College who has specialized in what he calls the newcomer experience, said he has heard his share of buyer’s remorse stories. It’s not uncommon. Al Smith, managing partner at job search company Transition Sherpa pointed to research that says that perhaps half of all new employees expressed unhappiness in their decision to take their job. Surprised? Don’t be. “Job interviews are like dates,\" said Lynda Spiegel, an HR expert. \"Everyone is on his or her best behavior. What do you do when you begin to see the unpleasant aspects of your new manager's personality? Or when you're asked to take on responsibilities that differ from what you expected?” So true. Just as job applicants may gild their personal lily, hiring authorities often gild theirs - leaving out details such as everybody works 12-hour days and, by the way, bosses publicly humiliate underlings who goof up in a kind of tough love practice. Hiring authorities sell the prospects they want to hire every bit as much as job hunters sell themselves. Hiring authorities often also downplay unpleasant - but essential - parts of the job that if made known might turn off a job seeker. Add it up and of course many new employees may quickly come to regret their decision to say “yes.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:33:00.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
