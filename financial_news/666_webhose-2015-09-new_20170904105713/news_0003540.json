Toshiyuki Aizawa by Jeremy Chunn If a third of Australians own property outright, and another third have a mortgage over direct property, why would anyone consider squeezing a bit more property into a portfolio by way of listed real estate investment trusts? Because they look more like listed industrial companies, says Julia Forrest, portfolio manager of the BT Wholesale Property Securities Fund.\n\"It is still property, but if you look at the returns over the past three or four years [a typical REIT] looks more like an industrial company,\" Forrest says.\nTraditionally the asset class has had a beta of 0.7, she says, where a score below 1 would indicate defensive attributes. \"But it didn't behave defensively during the GFC,\" she says.\nThe global financial crisis was an ugly period for REITs. The debt markets were frozen and trusts with short-term bank debt were forced to raise capital in the equities market (sometimes twice) to repay lenders. \"That's where [listed property] failed the defensive test.\"\nIf Australian investors are still wary of past capital losses from owning ASX-listed REITs international pension funds are attracted by the fact they have diversified their debt and have longer repayment deadlines.\nInvestors who hopped aboard after the global financial crisis have done pretty well. \"If you look at the performance for the past three or four years they've outperformed the market,\" she says.\nStress conditions Having performed extreme capital management in stress conditions, REITs have salvaged their positions and the sector is now trading at a 23 per cent premium to book value. The premium for 2016 is expected to drop to 15 per cent.\n \"There's been a lot of volatility and some of the stocks are getting closer to [net tangible assets],\" she says. Yield is about 5.5 per cent and growth is around 3.5 to 4 per cent, Forrest says, and on a total return perspective the sector \"stacks up well\" against the broader market.\nRegional shopping malls comprise about half the value of REITs and zoning constraints mean very few malls will be added to the Australian landscape. \"There are no more regional mall sites, so there's a protected nature about it,\" she says.\nContraction in consumer numbers and spending is another matter, but shopping malls are flexible, she says: \"There are opportunities for them to refine what they have without them going broke.\" Shops can be replaced with medical services or Centrelink; apartments or retirement villages can be built on site.\nThe same rule applies to REITs that applies to every other asset: you can have yield or growth, but seldom both. Westfield and Goodman look better for growth than income, she says, whereas trusts which specialise in office buildings may pay income above 7 per cent but growth around 2 per cent can be expected.\n\"It depends on what your investment horizon is and what your risk profile is.\"\nA more obvious time to buy might be when values approach net tangible assets, but if interest rates go lower values of REITs can be expected to track higher. If rates rise, the structure of leases dictates REITs will likely be the last to see rental growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:46:58.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
