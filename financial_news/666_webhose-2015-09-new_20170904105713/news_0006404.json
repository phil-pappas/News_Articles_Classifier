The overflow audience peacefully petitioned their government to save a vital part of the community. Photo by Professor Metze View all 14 photos \nY Worry Farm Pumpkin Patch will open on Saturday October 3, 2015. Over 500 loyal customers and supporters of the 60 year old family small business traveled to the Davidsonville Family Recreation Center to respectfully ask their political leaders to reconsider the possible destruction of the Y Worry Farm Pumpkin Patch to build a salt dome. Photo by Professor Metze \nThe lines of supporters circled the community center because there so many citizens who came out to support the Y Worry Farm that there wasn't room for all of the people to enter the community center. \nCrowds of people stood outside and listened to speakers through the windows and door ways. There was no yelling, or shouting, or violence. The supporters of the Y Worry Farm conducted themselves with dignity and discipline as they politely petitioned their government to please leave the Y Worry Farm Pumpkin Patch alone. \nIt was fitting that the meeting was held in the Boy Scouts meeting hall. As each citizen stood to speak the writing on the walls projected words of kindness, honor, respect, dignity, loyalty, friendship, and love of country. There was no profanity or vulgar language. People used their constitutional right to plead with their elected officials to build the facility in a place that would not destroy a pumpkin garden where area residents have brought their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren for decades. \nThe center of the great meeting was a gentleman who is nearly 90 years old. He started a small business over 60 years before many in the audience were born. His faith in God and in America had not waned in nearly 90 years. Jack Scible would have been honored to see that so many people cared about his small business; however, he is a quiet man. \n\"Fools like to see their faces in public places,\" is one of his favorite sayings. He would rather survey his land in his Y Worry Farm Ford truck than to sit in front of the cameras and lights that flashed so brightly on Thursday September 3, 2015. \nNot one speaker cursed the government for its right to take private land when it is desperately needed for the common good. Some acknowledge that the all-powerful state had the power to do whatever it wanted do. Evidence was provided that raised questions about the location and the necessity of placing the salt dome where the pumpkin place has been located for decades. \nA tiny, frail, citizen pointed out that salt poisoned the land and many governments have moved away from using salt because of the damage it does to the drinking water supply. Although her voice was so quiet and frail that the present writer had to strain to hear her, the message was clear, \"Please don't bring this facility to our neighborhood.\" \nHaving come to the Washington area as a journalist in 1980, the sight of people using their First Amendment right is not new; in fact, the rights go back to December 15, 1791. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" \nIn meeting with employees of the Maryland State Highway Administration on Friday September 4, 2015, no final decision was available. Examiner.com will remain on the story with the fight to permanently save the Y Worry Farm Pumpkin Patch until the end. \"We will be open on October 3, 2015. Our pumpkin patch will be open,\" said Mark Scible, Sr. Suggested Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T21:41:04.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
