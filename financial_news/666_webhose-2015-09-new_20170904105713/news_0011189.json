Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the group leapt by more than 6 percent on the trading update. \nChief Executive Geoff Drabble told Reuters he expected the strong demand to continue for its equipment, which ranges from small tools to large diggers and water pumps. The company said it was on track to achieve its full-year expectations. \nIts optimistic outlook contrasts with U.S. peer United Rentals and British rivals Speedy Hire (LSE: SDY.L - news ) and HSS Hire, which all downgraded their full-year forecasts due to fears about a slowdown in U.S. growth and subdued activity in the oil and gas industry. \n\"People are trying to make an awful lot more out of the contagion of oil and gas and pressure of energy prices, I think its massively overdone as witnessed by these results,\" said Drabble. \"(In construction) we're seeing lots of projects continuing to start.\" \nAshtead's pretax profit rose 23 percent to 161 million pounds ($246.5 million) for its first quarter ended July 31, at constant exchange rates. Rental revenue rose 20 percent to 539.6 million pounds, with oil and gas equipment accounting for just 3 percent. \nThe company did not give specific full-year forecasts, but analysts expect pretax profit to rise about 25 percent to 610 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data. \n\"Despite concerns over comments from its main peer (United Rentals) and wider concerns on the U.S. macro outlook, this was another strong quarter of growth,\" said Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) analyst Andrew Gibb in a note. \n\"The group continues to take market share, its end markets are still in recovery mode and importantly, structural growth is still prevalent.\" \nAshtead, which makes 85 percent of its revenue from U.S. division Sunbelt, said the region grew by 23 percent in the first quarter. Revenue at its British division A-Plant rose 11 percent. \nShares in the company were up 6.1 percent at 1015 GMT. \n($1 = 0.6532 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:15:53.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
