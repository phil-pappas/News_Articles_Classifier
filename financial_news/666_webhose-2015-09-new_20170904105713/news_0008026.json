Photo: Bloomberg\nQantas Airways could return an additional $2.4 billion of cash to shareholders this financial year due to an expected record-breaking financial performance driven by its cost cutting program and the lower oil price, according to Deutsche Bank.\nQantas has already announced plans to reward shareholders with a $505 million capital return of 23c a share and a share consolidation in November, but Deutsche analyst Cameron McDonald said he expected there was more to come.\nHe said it was possible the airline could return 50c a share alongside its half-year results in February and up to another 70c a share alongside its full-year results next August.\n\"Ratings agencies have previously indicated that Qantas would need $2 billion of liquidity to underpin an investment grade credit rating,\" Mr McDonald said. \"Our analysis indicates that even after a $2.4 billion capital management program the company would maintain $2 billion in cash, $1 billion in undrawn facilities and $4.3 billion in unencumbered aircraft.\"\nAdvertisement The airline has $855 million of tax losses as a result of the tough times it went through and as a result, it isn't expected to pay tax until FY17. That would mean any dividends are likely to remain unfranked through that period and share buybacks could be pursued as an alternative. The $505 million capital return is structured so that investors won't have to pay tax until they sale their shares as it is effectively reimbursing shareholders for a capital raising conducted during the global financial crisis.\nOther analysts also believe there is room for Qantas to announce more capital returns as it heads toward an expected record $1.6 billion profit before tax in the current financial year.\nUBS analyst Simon Mitchell this month said could return another $1.5 billion to investors through share buybacks over the next two financial years before resuming dividend payments as a result of its improved financial position. Mr Mitchell expects it could take until FY18 before the carrier resumes dividend payments due to the lack of franking credits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:55:55.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
