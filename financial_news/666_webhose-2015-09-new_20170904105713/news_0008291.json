Photo: Richard Drew\nRalph Lauren, the quintessential American designer who built a fashion empire based on sweeping fantasies of country-club prep and the Wild West, is stepping down from his post as chief executive of the company.\nTaking the helm at Ralph Lauren will be Stefan Larsson, a former H&M executive and president of Old Navy, Gap's down-market brand, which Larsson is credited with reviving. Old Navy has consistently been one of the few bright spots in Gap's brand portfolio since Larsson, who is Swedish, took over in 2012, making him one of the most visible executives in retail.\nThe change is a move by Ralph Lauren to get its financial house in order. Earnings at the upscale apparel company, known for its Polo brand, has been pressured by a strong dollar and intense competition in the luxury space. Its latest quarterly earnings of $US1.09 earnings a share topped analyst estimates, but revenue dipped 5.3 per cent on a year-over-year basis. The company's share price has slumped by almost half this year.\nThe fashion house is best known for its signature Polo shirts. Photo: Jennifer Soo\nIn an interview, Lauren said that he intended to remain active at the company he founded in new roles as executive chairman and chief creative officer. Larsson will report to Lauren, though the 75-year-old American designer characterised their relationship as a \"partnership.\"\nAdvertisement \"When they start designing things I can't understand, I'll quit,\" Lauren said, sitting with Larsson at his side at his offices on Madison Avenue, adorned with the rustic paraphernalia - a tin toy robot, cowboy boots - that Ralph Lauren's stores have come to be known for.\n\"But I don't feel like I'm stepping back now,\" Lauren said.\nLarsson will take over as chief executive of the Ralph Lauren Corp. in November, and will also join the company's board.\n\"One of the biggest reasons for me to join is the opportunity to work side by side with someone like Ralph,\" Larsson said.\nLauren's most recent show at New York Fashion week was an ode to Americans in Biarritz, with his signature perfect leather tailoring, blue and white evening gowns, and stars such as Jessica Chastain and Julianne Moore in the front row. But his brand is a typical luxury pyramid structure, with luxury at the pinnacle casting an aspirational halo over the more accessible Polo Ralph Lauren line (also now shown at New York Fashion Week), and factory stores below that form the bulk of the profits.\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:53:42.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
