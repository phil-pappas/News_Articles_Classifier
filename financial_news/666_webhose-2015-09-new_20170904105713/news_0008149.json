Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jessica Sier Jessica Wilson, founder Stashd\nAmong the T-shirts and sneakers of the tech world Jessica Wilson stands out. Since she made the move from fashion show producer and publicist to technology entrepreneur she has resisted the urge to tone down her look.\nNow you're running your own business, have you found your style has taken on a different flavour?\nI have a lot more high-profile meetings now, so it's slightly more professional. But I'll rock up wearing a bright pink blazer if that's what I feel like. That's what's wonderful about this entrepreneurial environment, I can be what I feel – and I feel part of the creative process.\nMoving into tech I initially stuck out like a sore thumb! I did wonder if I should tone it down or pare it back, but no way. A lot of our coding guys wear hoodies, jeans and sneakers. Style is a reflection of yourself and fashion-tech is such a crossover. There are so many personalities and I wouldn't want people in our tech department to change their style!\nWhen did you develop your style sense and interest in fashion?\nI was that five-year-old girl twirling in the princess dress at the supermarket! I was always drawn to the dresses people would usually wear to costume parties. My mum would make us little dresses as well, and if it had pink tulle in it, I was utterly sold.\nThese days, I'm all about blazers. Block colours, patterns, short, long – I wear them with everything. But I'm not much of a pants person, so I wear blazers with dresses and my favourite A-line skirts.\n Who are your favourite designers?\nI chop and change all the time! Right now I'm loving the hidden gems of online shopping that may not immediately pop up on Google or are held in the major retailers. Sometimes you've got to hunt these down!\nDesigners such as Poppy Lissiman​, Mon Purse, Polite and Gorman … I'm actually dressed head to toe in Gorman for this piece! I love Lisa Gorman's tongue-in-cheek prints, her playful clothes. She's a statement designer and can make basics as well as patterns and colour tones that don't come up on Google. She tailors for the individual.\nOnline shopping can either be a most enjoyable pastime or a frustrating, nerve-racking hell. Are you a stickler for knowing your measurements or do you cross your fingers and hope?\nFor me, I know what silhouettes works for my frame and I stick to that: an A-line skirt, just below the knee and just above; blazers. You've got to get a feel for which stores and brands have which size ranges so you can buy them on the go.\nWe all know that what's size X in one store, won't be the same in another. Figure out what brands work for your body so you can trust their sizing.\nI had an absolute frustration with online shopping. I was an avid bookmarker of online stores and would juggle multiple shopping carts. I thought, there has to be a better way to integrate multiple stores in one location but keep online browsing second nature. Just like how we would move about in a bricks-and-mortar store rather than a heavy categorisation of items. And so, Stashd was born!", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/118426044981129025592", "https://twitter.com/jessicasier"], "published": "2015-09-26T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:07:15.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
