Yet Western sanctions on Russia and a raft of its state-run companies have meant bond issuance from these once-prolific borrowers has dried up.\nAnother major source of corporate debt is Brazil, which has been the throes of a political crisis and recently had its credit rating slashed to junk by Standard and Poor's.\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned that the record $18 trillion of debt amassed by emerging market corporates needed careful monitoring as the era of record low global interest rates comes to an end. High leverage in China and Latin America were risks, it added.\nJP Morgan said in a recent note said that corporate issuance would likely fall short of a full-year supply target of $330 billion. The bank also lowered its 2015 sovereign bond supply forecast to $82.1 billion from $91.8 billion, citing the slow issuance pace so far.\nThe number of governments coming to the market too has fallen, standing at 20 compared with 23 in the previous quarter, the data showed.\nVolumes here too are at four-year lows though some borrowers are continuing to probe the market - Ghana is meeting investors for a bond while Pakistan raised $500 million last week, less than it had been expected to issue.\nGiven the backdrop, those sovereigns in a position to defer issuance would probably wait until 2016 to tap international investors said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets research at TD Securities, though that too could prove risky.\n\"(This) implicitly assumes that tomorrow's market conditions will be better than today's, and if tomorrow's are worse it is a different story,\" Maggio said.\nThe picture is more benign for some emerging sovereigns however, especially those in central Europe that have benefited from lower oil prices and the European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme. They are also less exposed to fallout from China.\nAlbania for instance, about to embark on a roadshow for a euro issue, may receive a warm welcome from investors, said Michael Ganske, head of emerging debt at Rogge Global Partners.\n\"It's one of the stories which is compelling because of the accession process with the European Union,\" he said. \"The whole of Central Europe is benefiting from the (money printing) programme from the European Central Bank so there is a lot of technical support for new issues (from central and eastern Europe),\" Ganske added.
