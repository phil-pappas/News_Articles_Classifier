( SCOR ). Rentrak shareholders seeking more information about this acquisition can contact Carl L. Stine at (212) 759-4600 or cstine@wolfpopper.com .\nThe investigation concerns whether Rentrak's directors are breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately maximize shareholder value. Under the terms of the proposed acquisition, each share of Rentrak will be converted into the right to receive 1.15 shares of comScore. The all-stock offer is valued at $47.69 per share. However, the offer price is below Rentrak's 52-week high of $85.69 per share and the 52-week average of $63.75 per share, and also below the median analyst price target of $74.80 per share.\nWolf Popper LLP has extensive experience representing investors in mergers and acquisition lawsuits and has successfully ensured that investors receive the maximum compensation. Twelve Wolf Popper attorneys were named Rising Stars or Super Lawyers in the 2015 Super Lawyers New York City Metro Edition, including Wolf Popper partner Carl Stine, who was included in the Super Lawyers Top 100 List for the New York City Metro area.
