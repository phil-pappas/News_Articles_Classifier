Pressure from civil society makes it difficult for court members to go back on a preliminary June decision that said Rousseff’s 2014 accounting practices were illegal, they said.\nThe TCU’s decision is expected in October and could shift the balance on starting impeachment proceedings. Leaders from ruling coalition parties on Tuesday came out in support of Rousseff, saying attempts to remove her from office only exacerbate the country’s economic malaise by heightening uncertainty. Also on Tuesday, opposition parties formally questioned the lower house president on procedural issues involving impeachment.\nIn the two months that the court gave the government to present its defense, Brazil’s economic crisis has deepened with a credit rating downgrade. Rousseff’s response -- more austerity-- has alienated her traditional base among the poor and working class.\nThe government’s almost 2,000 pages of defense won’t be enough to explain why the Treasury delayed payments to state banks for social programs, among other alleged irregularities, one of the people said. The TCU will issue a recommendation and Congress will have the final say whether to reject the government’s 2014 accounting.\nThe president’s and Attorney General’s press offices didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Rousseff’s legal team has said all accounting practices in question were used by previous governments and didn’t violate the fiscal responsibility law.\nPolitical Winds Even if Rousseff’s accounting is deemed illegal, legislators will gauge the broader political and economic climate at the time to decide on possible impeachment hearings, according to Christopher Garman, head of emerging markets at political consulting firm Eurasia Group.\n“How the political environment evolves will then dictate whether the TCU becomes the potential mechanism for a petition of impeachment,” Garman said by phone from Washington.\nThe next big political battle will be over a government proposal to cut 26 billion reais ($6.7 billion) in spending and raise a net 28 billion reais in taxes after Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil to junk. Civil servants will discuss a possible general strike in response to the government’s proposal to delay salary increases and hiring, the head of the confederation of public workers, Joao Domingo, said in an interview.\nHundreds of thousands of Brazilians last month demonstrated in favor of impeaching the unpopular president. Eurasia Group this week increased to 40 percent the odds that Rousseff won’t finish her term, citing “the government’s increasingly limited capacity to respond effectively to economic and political challenges.”\nStill, Rousseff has resisted calls for her to step down and vows to fight attempts to remove her from office.\n“The government is paying close attention to attempts to produce a certain kind of deep instability in the country,” she told reporters Tuesday. “We will do everything we can to prevent non-democratic processes from growing and strengthening.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:34:27.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
