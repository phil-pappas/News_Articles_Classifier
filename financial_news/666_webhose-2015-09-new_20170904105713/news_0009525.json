Scott Eells Share on twitter by Karen Maley Are bond traders getting ready for a US rate increase on Thursday? That's one explanation for last night's steep rise in US bond yields that pushed two-year bond yields to 0.8 per cent – the highest level in 4 ½ years. Even 10-year bond yields climbed to 2.3 per cent, the highest level in almost two months. Bond yields rise as prices fall.\nSome economists believe this steep rise in US bond yields is a clear indication that investors are preparing for the first rise in US interest rates since 2006. Yields on short-term bonds are more sensitive to changes in the US Federal Reserve's key interest rate.\nThey argue there's no longer any reason for the Fed to tarry, particularly after the report of US August retail sales rising 0.2 per cent helped dispel fears that last month's vicious share market sell-off would crimp US consumer spending. While August sales were less than the expected 0.3 per cent gain, July's sales were revised higher to 0.7 per cent from 0.6 per cent.\nAlthough investors may fret about the impact of slowing Chinese growth, US consumers appear to be shrugging off these fears, and instead are taking advantage of lower petrol prices to boost spending.\nUS consumers also appear more confident about their job prospects, after the US jobless rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest level in more than seven years. At the same time, the strong US dollar is helping to encourage spending by pushing down the price of imported goods.\nThe US central bank will pay close attention to these signs of consumer resilience, since consumer spending accounts for about 70 per cent of the country's GDP.\nDeutsche Bank's economists have joined the ranks of those arguing the Fed should raise rates this week. They believe the US labour market is strong, that problems in emerging market woes are not severe enough to damage US growth, and that US inflation is only temporarily clamped down.\nWhat's more, they warn that if the Fed were to delay its move, it may be forced to raise rates higher and faster in future.\n \"Having to tighten more aggressively down the road to keep inflation at bay could be far more disruptive to the US and global economies than beginning the process sooner (now) and reducing the chances of having to shift to a more aggressive stance later\", Deutsche says.\nBut while some important Fed policymakers are clearly keen to raise rates, others worry that subdued US inflation, combined with slowing growth in China and the emerging world, mean it is more prudent to wait before raising rates.\nThere are also fears that higher US interest rates could encourage even more capital flight from emerging markets, further dimming their growth prospects and leading to even more turmoil in global financial markets.\nIndeed, some analysts argue that the sharp rise in US bond yields overnight reflects moves by big US fund managers to adjust their portfolios to reflect the expectation that the Fed will not raise rates this week.\nThey say that big institutional investors have been selling bonds and buying shares because they believe a decision by the Fed to keep rates close to zero will likely fan inflationary pressures, which is a positive for equity markets, but a definite negative for longer-dated bonds.\nAt the same time, rumours that some foreign sellers were selling short-term US bonds in order to raise much-needed US dollars pushed up short-term bond yields.", "external_links": ["https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-16T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:10:01.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
