Coupled with other data, it shows that the Chinese authorities have been intervening to support the yuan as capital outflow continues,\" said Shin Kadota, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nOn Monday, Malaysia's ringgit plumbed fresh 17-year lows while the South African rand slipped to a record low, both under pressure because of relatively limited foreign currency reserves.\nWith U.S. financial markets shut for holiday on Monday, the dollar moved little against major currencies.\nThe dollar index stood at 96.206, little changed from late last week.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar ticked up slightly to 119.45 yen , still half-way in recovering its losses on Friday. The euro stood little changed at $1.1159.\nOil prices fell more than 3 percent on Monday, as the fall in Chinese share prices and record North Sea crude production added to global supply concerns.\nBrent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to $48.02 after a 3.7 percent fall on Monday. They still traded below the 50 percent retracement of their rally late August to $54.32 from 1/2-year low of $42.23.
