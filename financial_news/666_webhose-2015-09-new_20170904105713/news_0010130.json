But nostalgia can have a wonderful reflective component and some apps are leveraging nostalgia (and our unrelenting need to share our images online) to their advantage.\nSurprisingly thought-provoking Timehop has over 15 million users and is surprisingly thought-provoking. Free for Android and iOS, Timehop shows you a daily time capsule of your photos, updates and tweets from the same date in years gone past. It's plugged into all your social media accounts and allows you to share your memories.\nWhen I first downloaded the app it was incredibly boring. One year ago I had been making pointless observations of counsel becoming hangry (hungry + angry) during an ICAC interrogation. It took a few days, but as I received a little reminder every morning, more meaningful data began to surface.\n Timehop shows you a daily time capsule of your photos, updates and tweets from the same date in years gone past. Supplied Drinks underneath the Eiffel Tower while on a Uni trip, holding sandy hands in Central America and a recurring embarrassing peccadillo for #duckface crica 2009. I really enjoyed finding articles on the internet I had tweeted years ago. I re-read them and re-loved them. A few times I almost exclaimed out loud; \"my god, I have good taste in literature\".\nI only looked at the photos for a minute in the morning when I woke up, but they tended to stay with me all day. It was extraordinary how much time had passed, it's been six years since I fell out of a trolley and broke my wrist. Timehop really made me think about choices I'd made and where I've been #nostalgiawank. Who my friends used to be. As a 25-year-old person, I've been using social media for the entirety of my adult life. Timehop prompted me to call an old school friend I honestly hadn't thought about in years.(Because of Facebook, I knew she'd had a baby, but it was nice to hear her voice anyway. And who am I kidding, I texted her rather than called).\nThe alignment of all the social media platforms allows Timehop to show a more complete picture of the user. For example, my Twitter page has always been more work focused, whereas Facebook is all about the lols and Instagram keeps things pretty.\nLike Facebook's \"On This Day\", there are risks of images surfacing you have no interest in reliving and there's nothing you can really do about it. Timehop, for as long as you can be bothered to look at your past self, is interesting, but if an app could catalogue, say, all the political gaffes of the last 25 years, I would spend all day scrolling through that.", "external_links": ["http://timehop.com/"], "published": "2015-09-04T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:05:38.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
