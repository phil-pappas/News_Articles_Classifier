Aldi will sell all of its in-store wines on the internet and some wines will only be available online.\nIn the second quarter of the year, Aldi will start selling non-food items, known as Specialbuys, online. These items, currently available in stores, range from cycling gear to power tools and Halloween outfits . It will offer customers a choice of home delivery or collection from pick-up points.\nRelated: More UK shoppers come to value the discounters\nAldi unveiled the long-rumoured web operation as it announced UK record sales of £6.9bn for the 12 months to December 2014, a rise of more than 30% as it opened new stores. Operating profit fell by £11m to £260m as the company reduced prices and hired more staff.\nMatthew Barnes, the chief executive of Aldi in the UK and Ireland, said: “Our launch online is another exciting chapter in our story. This will enable us to introduce the Aldi brand and some of our bestselling, best-quality and best-value products to thousands more customers across the UK.”\nGrowth in online orders has helped the UK’s “big four” supermarkets – Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – to offset falling sales at large supermarkets caused partly by the growth of Aldi and its German discount rival Lidl.\nAldi said it had no plans to offer other groceries online but that it would monitor the site’s progress. Supermarkets have struggled to turn sales from selling a full range of food into profit because of the high costs involved.\nAldi said it was on course to open 65 of its no-frills stores this year, up from 54 openings in 2014. Its sales increased by 17% in the past three months as sales at rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Asda fell, recent industry figures showed .\nOnline grocery sales are expected to be the fastest-growing part of the UK market, more than doubling in value between 2014 and 2019 to £17bn, to make up 8% of overall sales.\nUntil recently Aldi and Lidl were thought unlikely to start trading online because their low prices are based on keeping things simple and cheap.\nBoth chains have used wine as a way to broaden their appeal to middle-class British shoppers looking for low prices. Aldi launched an upmarket wine selection, called the Lot Series, and rationed them to four per customer. Lidl is also considering launching a wine website as a first move into internet retailing in Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:31:15.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
