As the chart below shows, Amazon’s operating margins from its North America region have improved from 3% in 2Q14 to 5.1% in 2Q15. The margins have improved on a sequential basis as well, increasing from 3.9% in 1Q15. Better margins in 4Q14 have been the only exception, mainly because of the leverage that the company received from higher revenues in the holiday season.\nThe company cited that this improvement of margins is coming not only from higher revenue growth, but also from the efficiency of fulfillment and marketing cost segments. Fulfillment and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were stable on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAmazon benefited from Prime Day’s success According to Amazon, the revenue growth in the North America region came from higher adoption of the Prime program. In this regard, the company launched its first-ever Prime Day on July 15, 2015, offering exclusive lightning deals to its Prime members for a day. According to the company, Prime Day was a huge success, and new Prime members signed up in higher numbers than ever.\nFollowing this initiative from Amazon, Walmart (WMT) launched its own counter-sale on the same day. Walmart criticized Amazon’s initiative, mentioning that it is only available to Prime members who pay $99 per year for a membership. Other online retailers eBay (EBAY) and zulily (ZU) have also launched similar flash deals in the past. Incidentally, QVC parent company Liberty Interactive (QVCA) recently acquired zulily for $2.4 billion.\nTo gain diversified exposure to Amazon, you could invest in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY). XLY invests 8.7% of its holdings in Amazon.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Amazon Expects Unfavorable 3Q Impact from Currency Headwinds Part 2 - Amazon’s International Segment Saw Improvement in 2Q15 Part 4 - Why Amazon’s International Segment Margins Have Not Improved Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies Amazon North America", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:21:20.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
