Lindsey Potter Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Music speakers in golf carts, players in board shorts and 12-hole courses.\nThe Great White Shark has never played it safe and now Greg Norman is leading the charge to tear up the game's rule book.\nYou don't expect the 60-year-old golf legend, who has amassed a $235 million fortune from a sport steeped in tradition, to be so radical. But Norman has always been ahead of the game when it comes to marketing, branding and promotion with tentacles spread across golf course design, wine, property development, eyewear, clothing, premium beef and most recently the launch of a $100 million investment fund, the Great White Shark Opportunity Fund .\nThe aggressive style of the two-time Open champion meant he often came spectacularly unstuck and his name is synonymous with hard-luck losses in majors.\nSo when the AFR Weekend asks Norman about the terminal decline in golf's popularity – 50 per cent of Australia's golf clubs are in \"financial distress\" and 51 per cent have 100 members or less – the conversation turns lively.\nYoung parents with families don't have time to play 18 holes, Norman says, 12-hole golf courses are the future.\nAnd drop the dress codes, speed it up, turn on the music and use gadgets and social media to engage the next generation, or else the sport faces an existential crisis.\n\"Bring the kids in by letting them put speakers in golf carts, putting headsets on or playing in their board shorts or getting on an electric skateboard or something like that to take their clubs around, have fun with the game, speed it up, do what the kids like to do,\" the straight-shooting Norman says.\n \"I'm a big proponent of increasing the speed of the game. Building 12-hole golf courses, reducing the time. Why do we have to build these 7000 metre long golf courses for maybe one week a year or not even one week when the cost of constructing and maintaining these ridiculous clubhouses gets out of hand. We've really got to get our crap together.\"\n\"[Progress] is like Chinese water torture, drip, drip, drip, but you only need to do a couple of successful [12-hole courses] and people will sit up and take notice,\" Norman tells AFR Weekend from his Florida home, before travelling to Sydney to speak at the Advance Global Australian Awards for Aussies achieving on the global stage.\nNorman knows that the golfing establishment is all-powerful and achieving a shake-up of the game won't be easy – but he delivers a typically blunt message.\n\"If that is what they choose to do in life that's fine, but don't throw a big wet blanket over the rest of the game of golf just because that's what the younger generation want to do.\"\nNorman's ideas may seem radical but golf is running out of options .\nGolden era gone The Shark's 331 weeks as the world's number one in the 1980s and 90s marked the game's golden era. Club membership across the country peaked at 500,000 in 1998 and has been falling ever since.\nThe extent of the problem is masked by over-65 Baby Boomers who continue to play the game in high numbers. But participation rates in the crucial 15-to-24 age bracket have collapsed to less than 2 per cent. This missing generation will eventually become a missing middle-aged generation.\n\"Quite honestly, you can't rely on the Baby Boomers to carry the game of golf any more, they have done that for a long period of time but you've got to reach down to the millennials,\" Norman says.\nGolf courses are being forced to close and councils are under pressure to accept lucrative offers from property developers.\nIn Melbourne's outer suburbs, Chirnside Park and Eastern Golf Club have been sold and Capital Golf Club was sold to Crown for $67 million last year. Burswood Golf Course in Perth has closed its doors . In Sydney, Eastlake is being converted into 65 hectares of parkland and there are similar plans by the Ku-ring-gai Council for north shore's Gordon Golf Course.\nNorman likens the crisis to the disruption ski resorts faced when they failed to embrace snowboarding.\n\"When snowboarding became popular, ski resorts resisted and resisted and resisted, and what happened was families wouldn't come because their kids couldn't snowboard, so the resorts were cutting off their nose to spite their face because they weren't reaching down to the millennials – you have got to listen to what these kids do,\" Norman says.\nAdvance billing The Advance awards at which Norman is speaking are being held at the Sydney Opera House on Monday night. Advance is the New York-based network which connects the 1 million Australians living and working overseas with offices in Hong Kong, London and San Francisco.\nThe organisation was founded by former Australian consul-general in New York, Ken Allen, to connect US-based expats following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Allen says 9/11 brought famous Australians like Greg Norman, Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman and Rupert Murdoch closer.\n\"We figured out there were probably 120 Australians working in those buildings … we kicked all of the furniture out of our house and served vegemite sandwiches and cups of tea, it brought a lot of people together,\" Allen says.\nThis year's award recipients range from the plain-speaking Morgan Stanley CEO, James Gorman, to basketball star Lauren Jackson and restaurateur Michelle Garnaut​, who has cracked the Chinese market with her upscale restaurants like M on the Bund.\nBorn in Mount Isa, Queensland, Norman remains based in Florida with his third wife, Sydney interior designer Kirsten Kutner (following a brief marriage to tennis champion Chris Evert in 2008) but recently told the BBC he would like to return home. \"I would love to go back [to Australia] to die for sure, I was born there, I would like to die there\".\nNorman – a mentor to our current crop of golf stars including Jason Day and Adam Scott – says he likes to pick the brains of business people as well as sports stars and names his good mate Dow Chemicals Australian CEO Andrew Liveris.\n\"My connections with Bob Hawke and John Howard and people like that, even to this day I'll be walking through an airport in Asia and there will be John Howard come up and tap me on the shoulder,\" Norman tells the A FR Weekend about his deep connections within Australia's powerful global networks.\n\"Australia has produced some of the most incredible CEOs out there. When you look at what we have done in the business world that's what I get impressed with and when you sit down with these men and women you go 'wow'.\nSlimming down Norman's latest aggressive business strategy is to restructure his companies ensuring he is not invested too deeply in golf-related sectors. This drove last month's decision to sell his Greg Norman Production Company, which hosts several US golf tournaments, to Wasserman Media Group, and to launch a $100 million small-business equity fund in March.\n\"I can tell you exactly when it was, I went out to my [Colorado] Ranch in 2013 and I spent 10 weeks out there studying all my businesses,\" he says of the decision.\n\"I sat down and analysed them and I wanted to look out 200 years and say 'OK, which ones can survive the longevity test?' As I studied my 19 divisions I came down to the fact that I could skinny my whole company down to 5 or 6 divisions.\"\n\"I came back to my office and I made this major decision to move away from the sports-marketing company and move to a fully-fledged business.\"\nThe Shark remains Australia's highest-earning athlete despite last playing a tournament in December 2013, making $US12 million in 2014, according to US Golf Digest magazine, and amassing a fortune estimated at $235 million back in 2012.\nNorman credits much of his success to his nickname and Shark logo which was the brainchild of US billionaire Paul Fireman who bought the fledging Reebok company in 1979, before it rode the sneaker craze of the 1980s and made Norman an ambassador.\n\"One day, Paul sat me down and said 'Greg, I am going to give you your logo, this is yours in perpetuity for the rest of your life'.\n\"So Paul taught me about branding, marketing, fashion, distribution and being a living brand. I was like a kid in a candy store,\" Norman says.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.watoday.com.au/comment/burswood-was-no-augusta-but-well-miss-it-20130415-2hwav.html", "http://www.insidegolf.com.au/news/golf-industry-news/changing-landscapes-courses-on-the-move/", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://www.shark.com/sharkwatch/news/fox-sports-op-ed-08-18-2015/", "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/golf/greg-norman-still-among-top-earners-at-60-20150216-13fypw.html", "http://advance.org/globalaustralianawards/", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/calls-to-convert-sydneys-privileged-golf-courses-to-housing-parkland-20150812-gixbm3.html"], "published": "2015-09-11T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:06:57.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
