It’s like: ‘nice beard dude, you’ve got enough testosterone to grow a beard’.”\nNothing like a well groomed beard. Source: AAP\nBeards are all the rage. Source: AAP\nMr Pelecas says he transformed his business from a hairdressers to a barber shop after the men-only walk-in salons came back into fashion a few years ago, something he says has been driven by celebrities and social media.\nWorldbeardday.com suggests clean-shaven folk spend today waiting on their hairy friends ensuring they “relax and partake in no jobs or chores”.
