Average fares in the six months to end-September were up 2 percent on a year ago, bettering the company's forecast that they would be flat, and impressive given Ryanair expanded capacity by 13 percent at the time. \nRyanair shares hit an all time high of 14.27 euros in early trade, up 10 percent, while its main rival EasyJet (Other OTC: EJTTF - news ) was up 2.6 percent, having already signalled an improved outlook. \nEasyJet last week raised its annual profit forecast to between 675 million pounds ($1.04 billion)and 700 million after record demand for beach holidays and city breaks. \nLufthansa, which Ryanair is targeting with a major expansion in Germany, also said last week it had experienced its strongest summer ever, with business substantially better in July and August than expected. \nRyanair said it still expected sustained fare wars across Europe this winter, but added that fares in the three months to the end of December would be flat, withdrawing an earlier forecast that they would fall by between 4 and 8 percent. \nFares will still drop by between 2 and 4 percent in the three months to March, traditionally the weakest of the year, as Ryanair boosts capacity by 20 percent. \nRyanair filled 95 percent of its seats in July and August and said it expected to fill an average of 91 percent across its financial year, up from an earlier forecast of 90 percent. \n($1 = 0.8966 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:58:13.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
