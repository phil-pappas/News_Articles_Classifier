This private presentation is scheduled for September 29th and September 30th, in Millbrae and San Rafael, respectively. The research that will be presented uncovers the latest insights on the challenges non-profits face as they continue to fund raise in today’s environment, as well as key donor concerns, and how to respond appropriately.\nThe presentation has been presented to over 40 non-profit organizations in the bay area this year and has been described as providing “current and valuable information about planned giving” by the founder of a community non-profit organization. Many attendees describe their biggest concern is how to build a successful and cost effective planned giving program.\nThe presentations given in February, April, and June were sold out and had Executive Director, Planned Giving Officers and Development Directors with local and regional representation in attendance. The 7 Most Influential Planned Giving Trends… And How Concerned Non-profits Can Take Action Now is an “excellent compilation of prior giving statistics presented in an organized fashion. It leads me to believe our biggest successes are in developing a planned giving program” said Treasurer of Bay Area Health Care Foundation.\n“The response we are receiving from the introduction of The Donor Motivation Program® into the San Francisco Bay Area has been phenomenal,” says Bruce Frankel, Managing Partner of Yerba Buena Wealth Advisors, the provider of the Donor Motivation Program® in the Bay Area. “This is a proven and successful research-based program in the United States and Canada.”\nMr. Frankel continued, “When Executive Directors, Development Directors and Planned Giving Officers see critical and common mistakes made by non-profits in their approach to creating and managing a sustained planned giving program for their organization, it resonates with them in their environment. We then illustrate some eye-opening trends and best practices for planned giving. Whether large or small, established or new, non-profits are beginning to realize how planned giving can be the perfect complement, not a competitor, to current year gifting programs because of its donor-centricity. In a well-established planned giving program, the needs of the donor are the primary concern, and what’s good for the donor is good for the charity as well. “\nThe September presentations are scheduled as follows:\nWhen: 11:30 AM – 1:00 PM Tuesday, September 29th, 2015\nWhere: Green Hills Country Club\n 500 Ludeman Lane, Millbrae, CA 94030\n Complimentary Lunch Provided\nWhen: 11:30 AM – 1:00 PM Wednesday, September 30th, 2015\nWhere: 1101 Fifth Avenue, Suite 310 – San Rafael, CA 94901\n Complimentary Lunch Provided\nTo RSVP please call Kelley at 925-219-0080, or RSVP at info(at)donormotivationnorcal(dot)com\nAbout Yerba Buena Wealth Advisors, LLC\nBased in San Rafael, CA Yerba Buena Wealth Advisors, LLC consultancy firm specializes in helping their non-profit clients, their donors, entrepreneurs, and accredited investors make an even greater impact on the people and causes they care about deeply.
