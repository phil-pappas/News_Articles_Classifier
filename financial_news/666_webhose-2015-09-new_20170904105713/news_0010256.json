The financing has a ten-year term priced at a fixed interest rate of 4.09%. The Company has also reached an agreement in principle on the pricing of an additional $50 million of unsecured notes. The additional notes are expected to be issued in two $25 million tranches with terms of 9 and 11 years and a blended interest rate of 4.17%. The sale of these notes is expected to close on or before November 18, 2015.
