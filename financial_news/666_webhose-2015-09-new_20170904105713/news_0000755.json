Separately, the head of high-yield sales at Jefferies, Stephen Sander, has left the firm, the people said.\nZucker joined New York-based Jefferies in 2013, and earlier worked at Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Sander has been with Jefferies, which is owned by Leucadia National Corp., since 2000.\nKristen Kaus, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment, as did Jefferies’s Richard Khaleel. Zucker and Sander didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n(An earlier version of this story corrected Zucker’s age.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:24:07.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
