Jessica Sier Loving the brand Vitor Epiphanio, 18, had camped out in front of the store since Monday, marking his place in the steadily growing line.\n\"I just love the brand,\" he said, grinning. \"There's a feeling of family when you go into these stores. I'm so excited for the new handset, but not half as excited as the new iPad actually. That's going to be great.\"\nThe new iPhone 6s has prices of $1079 for the 16 gigabit version, $1229 for 64GB and $1379 for 128GB. The larger 6s Plus will cost $1229, $1379 and $1529 for 16GB, 64GB and 128GB respectively.\nAmong the more novel in the line-up was a robot with a tablet attached, saving the place of Lucy, whose face smiled out from the warmth of her couch at home. Jessica Sier Apple has almost doubled the speed of its new iPhones, added toughened glass, 50 per cent more pixels and 4K video shooting to the rear camera, a new flash to the front camera, and Force Touch technology, which it is calling 3D Touch.\nThe 3D Touch uses pressure sensors behind the screen to measure how hard your finger is pressed on the screen, meaning more actions can be performed by different types of touches and swipes.\nBig expectations Apple never releases sales forecasts, but research firm Telsyte predicts 1.9 million iPhones of all models will sell in the second half of 2015, out of a total of 4.5 million smartphone sales in Australia.\nStaff wait to let in the waiting iPhone 6s buyers in the George Street store in Sydney. Jessica Sier Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said the new nature of 3D Touch would take a while for customers to get used to, but would differentiate the iPhone from rivals.\n\"It's something you'll have to try before you buy, but it's obviously a very strong feature that will lock people into the Apple ecosystem,\" Mr Fadaghi said\n\"It will be like it not having a right click after a while. People will find it hard to go back to even an old Apple device.\"\nIt is probable that many of the new iPhone owners drying off after standing outside for hours would have lined up for the new phones regardless of some of the new features.\nCustomers try out the new 3D Touch technology before buying their new phones. Jessica Sier \"We've been here since four this morning,\" said Shu Ngygen, 26, who was hundreds of places off George Street around the corner.\n\"It's been a bit cold, but it's always nice to get these things in person.\"\nof", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:02:24.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
