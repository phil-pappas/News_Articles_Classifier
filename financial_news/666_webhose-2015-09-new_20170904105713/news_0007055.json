Published by John Wiley & Sons, the new eBooks streamline the CMT curriculum into concise volumes - distinct for each level of the exam. Candidates can work from a comprehensive body of knowledge in a single place. Additionally, the curriculum revision has reduced the total page count for each level by eliminating redundant coverage in the prior collection of required readings, making candidates preparation more efficient. The curriculum is being released in electronic format only for the October administration. The digital platform VitalSource provides eReader textbooks that will help candidates quickly find the information they need and prepare more thoroughly for the CMT exams. E–textbooks also save on resources, eliminating the need for much of the material and transportation that goes into manufacturing hardbound books.\nIn January of 2015 the MTA conducted a Job Analysis to ensure that the CMT exams reflect the knowledge and skills required to perform technical analysis in an institutional setting. In addition to the traditional price and volume analysis found in most technical analysis study, the curriculum has expanded to include risk management of market volatility, topics in portfolio management and quantitative methods for system design. Participation from over 1000 investment professionals created robust data which was analyzed by Prometric, a professional testing firm specializing in psychometrics and statistics. The rigorous analysis ensures that the CMT exams focus on industry relevant material that best prepares candidates for career opportunity in today’s markets. The CMT test specifications were revised in March 2015 using the survey results and the input of the Test Specifications Committee.\nThe curriculum is organized into exam-specific knowledge domains that provide a framework for recognizing, analyzing and implementing investment strategies and trading opportunities. These domains are not equally weighted on the exam so it is important for candidates to have a sense of how much emphasis to place on each domain during their study efforts. As such the three levels focus on the following:\nCMT Level I (Definition) The Level I exam measures basic, entry-level competence and understanding of the candidate. The CMT Level I candidate needs to have a working knowledge of the basic tools of the technical analyst.\nCMT Level II (Definition/Application) The CMT Level II exam requires the candidate to demonstrate a greater depth of analysis and competency. The CMT Level II candidate is expected to demonstrate proficiency in applying more advanced analytical techniques. Overall, the candidate is responsible for the theory and application of concepts and techniques.\nCMT Level III (Integration) The CMT Level III exam tests the candidate on the development of logical and consistent research opinions, portfolio strategies and trading decisions based on a wide range of charts and technical data. The CMT Level III candidate must pass the ethics portion of this exam or risk failure.\nAbout the Market Technicians Association (MTA)\nThe Market Technicians Association’s objective is to educate members and the investment community in technical analysis. The MTA is responsible for the creation, administration and regulation of the Chartered Market Technician® (CMT) designation. The CMT® designation is the only technical analysis designation recognized by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) qualifying candidates for a Series 86 exemption upon passing Levels I & II of the CMT exam.\nEach of the three levels of the CMT exam are administered twice a year in April/May and October. The MTA offers the exams worldwide through Prometric testing centers. Candidates can sit for one exam each administration and therefore a successful candidate could complete the entire CMT Program in 12 months.
