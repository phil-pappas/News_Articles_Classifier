The religion, whatever religion you practise is your personal choice… The remark really shows the true colour of BJP which just believes in divisive politics,” said Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee.\nShaina NC of BJP reacted cautiously to Adityanath’s remark, saying that in a country like India “we cannot be judgemental on Raza academy or for that matter a comment made by an individual MP.”\nKamal Farooqui, member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, regretted that some people in the BJP are allowed to speak whatever they feel like without realising that they are spreading “venom” all around.\nVHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain on Wednesday said Hindus will “welcome” the noted composer with open arms and alleged that he had converted to Islam for commercial reasons.\n“I will appeal to Rahman he should return, he should do ‘Ghar Wapsi’. The Hindu society is waiting for its son. We will not only welcome him with open arms but also ensure that no harm is done to him irrespective of how many fatwas are issued,” Jain had told reporters in Delhi.\nA BJP MLA in Telangana on Thursday urged the VHP to reach out to more people like Rahman.\n“I request VHP functionaries to reach out to many more people like AR Rahman who are feelign suffocated after acacepting Islam,” said Raja Singh.\nRahman was introduced to Qadiri Islam when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. He converted to Islam (his mother’s religion) with other members of his family in 1989 at the age of 23, changing his name from R S Dileep Kumar to Allah Rakha Rahman (A.R. Rahman). His father’s untimely death had put several financial pressures on the family, which included four children.\nIn a long statement, posted on his Facebook page, Rahman had Quote: d verses from the Quran to explain his point of view and the decision behind boarding Iranian director Majid Majidi’s movie, which is a planned trilogy on the life of Prophet Muhammad.\n“I am not a scholar of Islam. I follow the middle path and am part traditionalist and part rationalist. I live in Western and Eastern worlds and try to love all people for what they are, without judging them,” Rahman wrote.\n 20, 2015 7:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:13:57.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
