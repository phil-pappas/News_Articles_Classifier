Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! HYDERABAD: The Centre has announced a special financial assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for Andhra Pradesh for the current fiscal. The Friday announcement from the finance ministry comes a day after the state's Chief Minister, N Chandrababu Naidu , demanded that the Centre should offer the support committed to under the state reorganisation Act. The assistance, which comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the state to lay the foundation stone for the greenfield capital city at Amaravati, is in addition to the Rs 4,403 crore that the Centre had released for Andhra Pradesh last fiscal. The fresh funds are earmarked for development of seven backward districts - four in the southern part and three in the state's north coastal region - and for supporting two large projects of capital city construction and Polavaram irrigation project. While each backward district will get Rs 50 crore, the new capital will get Rs 350 crore, while the balance Rs 300 crore will be spent on the Polavaram irrigation project. Addressing reporters in Vijayawada on Friday, Naidu said, \"We hope the Centre will release the balance funds as promised under the state reorganization Act and extend continued support till the state attains a level playing field to compete with other states.\" In a statement, the Union government said that it \"has decided to continue to support the programmes for the development of backward districts of Andhra Pradesh and provide assistance for creation of a new capital, including the Raj Bhawan, high court, government secretariat, Legislative Assembly, Legislative Council, and such other essential infrastructure.\" Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in June last year, leaving the latter as a deficit budget entity without a capital city, large educational institutions and infrastructure, including large airports. \"Having regard to the resource availability, the Central Government is required to make appropriate grants and also provide adequate benefits and incentives in the form of special assistance to the backward areas of the states,\" the Union government said in a statement. Last fiscal, the Centre had extended a financial assistance of Rs 2,303 crore towards bridging the resource gap, Rs 1,500 crore for construction of a Raj Bhawan and other infrastructure in the state capital, and Rs 250 crore for the Polavaram project. After a two-day visit to Delhi and meeting various central ministers, Naidu told reporters on Thursday that he was hopeful of a large financial package in a month's time for various projects. These include three international airports, seaports, national highways, power projects and 17 central institutions, among others.
