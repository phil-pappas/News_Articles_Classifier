Share on twitter by John Davidson As long as it doesn't kill the battery life, what's the harm in having a phone with a 4K screen, with pixels smaller than any human could ever hope to see without a whopping great magnifying glass?\nThat's what Sony must have been thinking when it designed the Xperia Z5 Premium, the world's first 4K smartphone that it just announced at the IFA gadget festival in Berlin.\nThe Z5 Premium, just one of three Xperia Z5s that Sony launched at IFA, has a 5.5-inch screen with a resolution of 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels. For those of you keeping score, that's officially nuts. That's a pixel density of 806 pixels per inch. I'd use an exclamation mark there if they weren't so frowned upon.\nThe pixel arms race has just gone ballistic!!!!\nThe Style Cover Window case for the Xperia Z5 Compact lets you see messages without opening the case. Now, if the Z5 Premium has the same brilliant battery life we've come to expect from Sony phones, then what's the harm in Sony playing the pixels number game? The upside is, 806 ppi will give Sony the option of using the phone in some sort of virtual reality headset that could be used in conjunction with a PlayStation, or something. Pixels that small should be just about remain invisible even under the huge magnification of a headset.\nBut if the 4K screen kills the battery like one might fear, then you might be better off with the 4.6-inch Xperia Z5 Compact, which Sony has also just announced, which if its anything like the brilliant Z3 Compact will have a battery life of two to four days depending on usage.\nThe Xperia Z3 Compact is one of my all-time-favourite phones. It's pocketable without being too small, it's waterproof, it's powerful and it just goes and goes. The Z5 Compact improves on it by offering a completely overhauled camera, a faster processor, improved audio and what looks like some really great covers. Also, it doesn't have a waterproof cover over the USB slot, so charging it (on the rare occasions you will have to) want be so fiddly. That cover was about the only thing I didn't like about the Z3 Compact.\nThe new camera is in the Premium, the Compact and the regular, 5.2-inch Xperia Z5 (the third phone Sony has announced), and it's worth mentioning because it's based on the sensors in Sony's cameras and itself has some pretty impressive numbers. It's got a 23 megapixel image sensor (one of the highest numbers you'll find in a phone, but not the very highest), an autofocus time of just 0.03 seconds (we don't keep track of that number, but it sounds pretty low to me), and a lens with an aperture of f2.0. That's better than the f2.2 number on the iPhone.\n The Z5 and the Z5 Compact are due in October. The Z5 Premium is due in November. Pricing has yet to be announced.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-09-03T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:08:57.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
