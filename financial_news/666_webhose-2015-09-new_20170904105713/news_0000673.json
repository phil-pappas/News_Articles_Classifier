KKR could grow its ownership interest over time to 39.9%. \nThe firm isn't exactly coy about why its doing this: \"Hedge fund assets, now at $3 trillion globally, are the largest part of the alternative asset management industry,\" it said in a statement Wednesday announcing the partnership with the hedge fund. \nKKR is one of a number of investment firms whose private equity deals came back to bite its founders. Its most recent flagship fundraising took in less than $10 billion, barely more than half what its pre-crisis funds took from eager investors a few years ago. \nNow, up-and-coming LBO shops are offering better terms and better performance to investors and luring more cash away from the biggest managers. \nPlenty of other private equity firms have bought into the hedge fund business this year. Activist investor Jana Partners sold a minority stake in itself to a private equity investor in March. \nAlex Wong/Getty Blackstone, which is led by Steve Schwarzman, has also invested in hedge funds \nAnd Blackstone backed hedge fund Magnetar Capital , a $13.6 billion investor, earlier this year. That wasn't the only one for Schwarzman this year. Blackstone seeded, and later invested more into, another hedge fund: Senator Investment Group , which runs around $7 billion in assets. \nAlready, thanks to Schwarzman's massive push into residential property, private equity isn't even the leading moneymaking line of business at Blackstone. That honour now goes to the firm's real estate division, which routinely raises funds as big as its flagship private equity vehicles. \nPrivate equity investor Apollo Global Management counts a handful of hedge funds among more than 100 subsidiaries in its annual filing, but doesn't break out performance figures. \nSome hedge fund bets have gone belly-up. Carlyle Group, which has enjoyed solid performance in its private equity funds in part thanks to its strategy of taking on smaller transactions than some of its competitors, has also operated hedge funds that underperformed and caused some reputational damage to the firm. \nBut it is AUM which is really the name of the game. Despite outpacing competitors' stock performance in the years since the financial crisis, Schwarzman is openly lamenting what he feels is an undervaluation of Blackstone's stock. In the time Blackstone's stock outperformed all other listed competitors, the firm also grew its AUM more than any others â€” in part through hedge fund investing, which represents $68 billion of the firm's activity. \nAs long as regulators keep giving so-called private equity investors room to go where investment banks and insurers can't, Wall Street should anticipate more hedge funds will be bought out, or bought into, by CEOs like Kravis and Schwarzman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:05:08.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
