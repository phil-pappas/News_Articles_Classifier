Growing up, I have watched women, whether it be my mother, aunts, or friends, sacrifice for the sake of those they love. I have watched them take lower paying positions they feel will give them more time with their kids. I have watched them not buy clothes for years to make sure that the kids are taken care of and raid their retirement plans to pay for their kid’s education. When I hear about women and financial stress, I think of my dear friend who is recently divorced with four kids paying more in daycare than most people pay for a mortgage.As I grow older, I am increasing watching my female friends become the primary caretaker of their family, which matches the statistic that an estimated 66% of caregivers are female with the average age being 49. This as well as a host of other factors have lead to most women being unprepared for retirement. Financial Finesse’s most recent Gender Gap in Financial Wellness report highlights the large gap in the retirement savings between men and women. The report showed the following:\nA 26% gap in the shortfall in retirement savings between the median 45 year old man and woman's retirement savings needed to replace 70% of their pre-retirement income plus estimated healthcare costs. t The gap climbed to a disturbing 95% when looking at the additional savings needed to cover the same estimated retirement expenditures such as housing, medicine and food. t A large “confidence gap” between the genders in the areas of money management and investing The largest gaps were in the areas of investment and money management, key behaviors in retirement preparedness. The smallest gap is in insurance and college planning (not surprising since women traditionally think of others before themselves) and there was virtually no gap in estate planning and retirement plan participation. The following are some steps women can take to get financially on track and help close the gender gap: We have a greater risk of outliving our savings so take all of the free money you can get. At a minimum, contribute at least up to the match so you capture all of the money your employer is giving you for retirement. I know there are some complicated formulas so if you are unsure, call your HR department and ask how much you need to contribute to get 100% of your match.If contributing that much seems out of reach, ask your employer about a 401(k) plan feature called automatic escalation (or automatic contribution escalator). This feature allows you to automatically increase your contributions annually starting as low as 1%. Consider setting the increase in the month you typically get a raise. The biggest step you can take to prepare for retirement is to run a retirement estimator to see how on track you are to retire. One of my favorite sayings is that people do not plan to fail. They fail to plan. No one plans on struggling to pay the bills at 80. Doing a retirement estimate will at least give you a clue as to how on track you are and give you time to develop a strategy.When I ask about plans for retirement, the normal response I get is that man women have no plans on retiring. According to a MetLife study , 54% of the first wave of Baby Boomers to retire quit working before they planned so come up with a plan B. It may be a part-time job doing something you enjoy. It may be downsizing your home. A retirement estimator can not only tell you if you are on track, you can also use the estimator to explore solutions like working longer, increasing your 401(k) plan contributions, or even starting a Roth IRA . Creating a spending plan can help relieve the financial stress many women face. Heck, as women we have enough to stress about. Not knowing whether your money is coming or going adds unnecessary stress that can be alleviated with a spending plan.The first step to all of this is having a written plan on how you intend to spend every penny you make. Websites like Mint.com or YNAB can make this as simple as a few clicks on an app. If doing a spending plan seems overwhelming, take it in baby steps. Track all spending for a month and then use those numbers to create a spending plan for the following month. Have an emergency fund and consider over-funding it if you are planning on taking additional time off for maternity leave or to care for a loved one. Many women feel financially stressed over the worry of how to pay for unexpected expenses. Having money in place for the unexpected can give people peace of mind. Ideally, you would want to have 3-6 months worth of expenses.If that seems daunting, start with the goal of having $1,000. Consider using bonuses and even your tax refund from next year to fund your emergency account. Then slowly start to build your savings. The less money you are paying towards credit card debt, the more money you will have for other goals. The National Debt Relief survey showed that 63% of women aged 18-24 carried some credit card debt, but only 36% of men in the same age range had any credit card debt. According to this calculator , making minimum payments on a $10,000 balance with an 18% interest rate will take 342 months to pay off, costing over $14,000 in interest alone. Use a calculator like this DebtBlaster to see how long it will take to pay off your debts if you keep making your current payments as well as how increasing your payments can get you out of debt faster. Increasing your income can also increase the amount of money you contribute to your 401(k) plan. Since women typically live longer, the more income you can make the better. Go on websites like Glassdoor.com to see what the average salary is for your profession. Even better, you may be able to find out what the average salary is for your current job.If it is low, consider asking for a raise . Contact your HR department about mentoring programs, internal training programs or tuition reimbursement programs and use those to build your skills. If you have a profession with an association, start attending meetings to know what skills you may need to build to advance, and make a business case as to why your organization should foot the bill (hint: make it all about the company, not you). Getting educated about personal finances can “close” the confidence gap women have in the area of investing. If your company offers a financial wellness program (you can ask your HR department) then please take advantage of the services to learn more about finances and creating a financial plan. If your company does not offer a program, consider advocating for one. There are also free online classes on investing from Morningstar , Stanford University , and Investopedia . If you would prefer to sit in a classroom, check out classes at your local library, community college, or university. My last piece of guidance is to please pass on whatever you learn to others. This could be starting an investment club or even a financial wellness club where you can encourage each other to set goals and learn one new piece of financial information per meeting. You could have a monthly financial book club. For those of you who are financially savvy, consider mentoring someone currently struggling financially or offering to help others at your place of worship or at a local community center.
