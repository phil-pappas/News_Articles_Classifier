Sam Bennett by Sam Le Cornu As investors seek to understand the impact of the Chinese economy and sharemarket on global markets, it's worth keeping in mind that China is a very different economy to those that many investors are used to investing in. Three of the areas in which China's unique attributes bear out are sharemarkets, its monetary policy toolbox and currency.\nLooking at the sharemarket first, it's important to make the distinction between the Chinese A share market and H share market.\nYear to date, the A share market has been a volatile one, up over 59.7 per cent as at June 12. More recently the A share market has attracted attention globally as it fell by 42.9 per cent from its peak to August 27. Essentially this market is fuelled by individual local investors, who make up 73 per cent of the investors and have had easy access to margin loans and, until recently, had witnessed stellar returns.\nThe majority of international institutional investors don't invest in the China A share market as access is relatively tightly controlled.\nIn contrast, the H share market which consists of Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and available mainly to non-Chinese investors has not had the same volatile ride; it gained 14.7 per cent and fell 30.9 per cent in the same period.\nSo while the A share market has been on a history-making journey, it is more reflective of the nature of the investors than a reflection of the state of the Chinese economy.\nMonetary easing When it comes to the Chinese economy, international investors are probably finding there are more questions than answers.\n At Macquarie we have long believed that China's gross domestic product growth will slow steadily. We also expect the drivers of growth to change, with consumption-led GDP growth holding up and investment-led GDP growth slowing. This change is supported by the recent manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) in August, which has slowed to 49.7, while the services PMI held steady at 53.4. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\nThe key focus for investors is: what will China do in face of slowing economic growth?\nWith its most recent rate cut of 25 basis points and reserve requirement rate cut of 50 basis points the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has confirmed our view that China will continue its monetary easing policies.\nChina has a significant monetary policy toolbox at its disposal, which it is likely to use to help stabilise growth. We believe the market has underestimated the amount of liquidity to come from the PBoC. The most recent rate cuts added about 680 billion yuan of liquidity to the market.\nSince November, China has cut interest rates four times and the reserve requirement rate three times. We expect significant liquidity to be injected in coming months to keep the cost of funding and rates low.\nFinally, the recent depreciation of the yuan will help some export industries but is too small to have a major impact on the overall economy. We believe the depreciation was to support domestic liquidity easing.\nOverall we are cautiously optimistic on the China story but stress it is a unique and evolving economy. As investors, we are focused on investing in Chinese companies that benefit from domestic demand and structural growth. We tend to prefer companies that generate the majority of their revenue domestically in Asia, avoiding exporters and state-owned enterprises.\nWe also tend to invest in companies in the healthcare, consumer, utilities and insurance sectors which we believe offer some compelling growth themes.\nSam Le Cornu is co-head of Macquarie Asset Management's Asian equities team and based in Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:31:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
