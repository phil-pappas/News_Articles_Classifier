Bloomberg Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Iron ore is holding up \"surprisingly well\" as prices track towards $US60 a tonne despite seasonal weakness, defying the doomsayers predicting September would kick off with big falls, analysts say.\nIron ore has been trading in a narrow band in the low to mid-50s, before clawing its way to within reach of $US60 a tonne this week.\nUBS mining analyst Glyn Lawcock says the latest trading band is at odds with most market commentators, who were been tipping a fall back below $US50 a tonne.\n\"So what gives, and why hasn't the price fallen? We suspect the market is balanced right now,\" he says.\nChinese imports are stable, but show the big players are making up a rising percentage of volume, with a commensurate drop in supply from high-cost marginal countries.\nIn addition, Australian supply has been stable now for the past three to four months, with the big three Australian players, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group, operating at capacity.\nThe big three shipped 66.4 million tonnes for the month of August to hit a new record, up 3 per cent on July. But volume is perhaps not rising as fast as the market is expecting, Lawcock says.\nNo material lift in Australian exports How much do you know about iron ore? Take our quiz to find out.\nPosted by Financial Review on Thursday, September 10, 2015 Unless one of the Pilbara majors pushes higher in a meaningful way, there should be no material lift in Australian exports until Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill – the only new Australian supply to come on in the near term – starts up in October this year.\n\"Rio is now starting to show some supply discipline with shipments from the Pilbara guided to fall in 2016 to 335mt from the current run rate of 350mt,\" Lawcock says.\n\"FMG is also moving ex-growth, Vale could close supply if prices fall, and Roy Hill is likely to ramp up slowly due to technical challenges.\"\nThis dynamic could support prices around $US55 a tonne into 2016, before Vale's mega expansion project, called S11D, starts up.\n\"The ramp up of Roy Hill is likely to be key to the iron ore market over the remainder of 2015 and into early 2016 as it represents the biggest increase over that period until Vale's S11D completes in late 2016, early 2017,\" Lawcock says.\nIron ore is the most consolidated of the major commodities, with the big four producers (the three Pilbara majors plus Vale) controlling about 80 per cent of the seaborne market.\nThis year has seen the iron ore price fall to a record low of almost $US44 a tonne, before rebounding to about $US65, before trading in a narrower band in the mid to low $US50s since August. It hit a two-month high of $US58.50 over Thursday night.\nLawcock says iron ore prices are \"holding up surprisingly well in a seasonally weaker period\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders", "https://www.facebook.com/financialreview", "https://www.facebook.com/financialreview/posts/968905233159719"], "published": "2015-09-11T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:07:15.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
