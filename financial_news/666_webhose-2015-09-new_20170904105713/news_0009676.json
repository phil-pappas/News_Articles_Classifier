Eight Chinese and US carriers now fly direct between the US and mainland China—Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. But while the US carriers have so far dominated the market, that is beginning to change.\nChinese carriers are adding more capacity on China-US routes versus their US competitors. For example, Hainan Airlines launched three new routes in June alone—Beijing-San Jose, Shanghai-Boston and Shanghai-Seattle. China Eastern launched Nanjing-Los Angeles in June and Shanghai-Chicago in August. China Southern launched Guangzhou-San Francisco in June.\nUS airlines are also launching new China services, but not as many. American began Dallas-Beijing in May, while Delta began Los Angeles-Shanghai in July.\nThrough this summer, Chinese airlines have increased capacity by some 25% and the “big four” of China Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan now operate 2,028 weekly flights to the US, compared with 1,853 weekly flights by US airlines.\nChina Airlines alone is expected to operate 2,576 US flights by the end of 2015 and Chinese carriers have increased their China-US market share to 47% compared with 39% in 2009.\nIndustry analysts predict Chinese passenger boardings to the US will continue to increase by 20% annually through the next five to 10 years, reaching 6.9 million by 2021.\nSo it’s not surprising that Delta agreed to invest $450 million to acquire a 3.55% stake in Shanghai-based fellow SkyTeam carrier China Eastern and the pair is planning to launch a commercial cooperation plan.\nDelta SVP-Asia-Pacific Vinay Dube said, “Our $450 million investment in China Eastern is only a part of our partnership. While the investment results in a 3.55% stake in China Eastern and an observer seat on the China Eastern board of directors, the true value in this agreement comes from our shared vision to build a long-term, profitable partnership by creating a world-class, customer-focused offering, and be the most successful franchise in the growing US-China market.”\nChina Eastern and its subsidiary Shanghai Airlines codeshare with Delta on 30 domestic US routes, 43 domestic Chinese routes and seven China-US transpacific routes. China Eastern operates 35 weekly Boeing 777-300ER flights from Shanghai to Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Honolulu. Delta operates 28 weekly flights from Seattle and Detroit to Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.\nThe Right Aircraft\nAn important driver behind this new US focus is the slowdown of Chinese economic growth in recent years has made it increasingly difficult for Chinese carriers to reap large profits from their domestic markets. They had to look beyond China and shift attention to overseas markets. But traditionally they would have selected the European market first because the Airbus A330, which dominates most Chinese airlines’ long-haul fleets, is better suited to China-Europe routes than to US routes.\nBut as Chinese carriers have taken delivery of Boeing 777-300ERs, 787s and 747-8s, they find themselves equipped with the “right aircraft” to operate China-US routes. In the first half of 2015, domestic carriers introduced a total of 10 long-haul Boeing widebodies, equaling the number of A330s they took delivery of in the same timeframe.\nAir China now has 20 777-300ERs and is scheduled to begin receiving the first of seven 787-8 aircraft by the end of this year—aircraft that will be focused on the US market.\nChina Eastern is scheduled to take delivery of 10 777-300ERs this year and in 2016, with another 10 to be delivered by the end of 2018. As the Boeings came in, the carrier launched its Pacific Strategy, which hinges on using these aircraft to open more new China-US routes over the next three years and boost flight frequencies to existing US city destinations, including Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.\nChina Southern, meanwhile, has begun taking delivery of the first of 10 777-300ERs, while the first of 10 787 aircraft is scheduled to enter service by the end of 2015. The Guangzhou-based carrier is using these aircraft to go to New York and San Francisco while an Airbus A380 is used on Guangzhou-Los Angeles.\nHainan Airlines\nOf all the Chinese carriers, it is Hainan Airlines that is leading the expansion into the North American market. In June, Hainan launched three China-US routes—Beijing-San Jose, Shanghai-Boston and Shanghai-Seattle. The airline is also applying to begin Changsha-Los Angeles and Shanghai-Tianjin-New York. The carrier now operates to five US cities, putting it second only to Air China, with six.\nHainan has a fleet of 10 787-8s with orders for 30 787-9s, of which eight are scheduled to be delivered in 2016 and will be operated on new routes to North America from Shanghai.\n“We have opted for a different business model in international expansion. We have chosen to open new routes from China’s first-tier cities [Beijing and Shanghai] to secondary cities in the US and Europe or from China’s secondary cities to the first-tier cities of US and Europe,” Hainan international director Li Xiang said.\n“This not only helps us to avoid fierce market competition, but also gives us more opportunities to become an exclusive operator in some international routes.”\nFor example, Beijing-Seattle and Beijing-Boston are exclusively operated by Haiko-based Hainan.\nBut while North America has become a market focus—and government talks continue that may lead to a further expansion of routes—Chinese carriers are also accelerating their expansion into the Japanese market following an increased traffic rights agreement between the two countries. Industry analysts predict the number of Chinese travelers who visit Japan will reach more than 4 million in 2015, which would make China the No.1 tourist source nation for Japan.\nChina Southern and its subsidiaries Xiamen Airlines and Sichuan Airlines are expected to open 30 new routes to Japan this year. It began new direct flights to Tokyo Haneda Airport in August, increasing China Southern’s Japanese destinations to 12.\nChina Airlines 777 cabins blend Taiwan culture with hotel feel By Karen Walker\nWhen Taipei-based China Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs , the airline decided it wanted to make a statement with the aircraft.\n“This is a very important aircraft to us, it’s our new flagship, so we saw a window of opportunity when we ordered [the 777-300ERs] three years ago,” China Airlines chairman Huang-Hsiang Sun said during a press briefing at the Paris Air Show in June, where one of the 777s was in the static display. “We said it must be unique, very bold and a very daring proposition for an airplane interior; we wanted to showcase the best of talent onboard the aircraft and for people to be able to feel, taste, see Taiwan and love Taiwan.”\nThe airline hired architect and designer Ray Chen to mastermind the cabin’s design. The result is a fusion of oriental traditions and culture with modern hardware. In business class, the private lie-flat seat units are finished with persimmon wood-grain and each has a small table lamp.\nChen, who joined the press conference, explained, “We wanted warmth and we wanted reading lamps that would make the cabin feel like a bookstore, intellectual and personal.”\nChen also created a “Sky Lounge” area where passengers embark and disembark so that it has the feel of a top-star hotel lobby. Words from Proust are inscribed on the walls and there are elegant tea and coffee stations as well as a self-serve noodle bar.\nThe refinement does not end with the business-class cabin. Economy-class features multiple-color seats—most sky blue, with the occasional red seat. Blue and red are important colors in Taiwanese culture, Chen explained. And China Airlines has adopted the “family couch” design introduced and patented by Air New Zealand and which allows three economy seats to convert into a flat sofa-bed. “It’s very nice for mother and child,” Chen noted.\n “[China Airlines] is a brand new customer for the 777-300ER, a very big customer and big airline and what they have done with that interior is phenomenal,” Conner said. “The attention to detail is stunning and for me, that says a lot about the airplane and the innovation going on in the airlines,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Ray Conner said.\nChina Airlines, a SkyTeam global alliance member, is using the 777-300ER on Taipei to Los Angeles and New York JFK routes as well as Frankfurt. It will add San Francisco later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:42:17.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
