Five charts you need to see before the ECB could unleash more firepower on Europe By Mehreen Khan | Telegraph – 3 hours ago 253.80 +0.65 \nSix months on from the start of its bond-buying blitz, the European Central Bank is poised to reaffirm its commitment to do 'whatever it takes' \nThe summer holidays are over for the euro's policymakers. \nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank will convene for its latest Governing Council meeting. Having spent months grappling with Greece, president Mario Draghi is now having to contend with global stock market turmoil , collapsing commodity prices, and deflationary headwinds from a Chinese hard-landing. * Ten charts you need to see on last week's market meltdown * Mario Draghi announces €1.1 trillion QE programme ECB-watchers now expect Mr Draghi to deliver a dovish message after both his chief economist, Peter Praet, and vice president, Vitor Constancio, made reassuring noises over the possibility of extending the central bank's $1.1 trillion quantitative easing (QE) programme . \nHere are the five things that will be weighing on the ECB's mind this month. \n= Inflation = \nHaving briefly dipped into deflation at start of the year, consumer prices in the eurozone face further disinflationary forces, brought about by collapsing commodities. \nInflation was 0.2pc in August, and although another slip into outright negative territory is unlikely, the ECB is widely expected to downgrade its inflation forecasts when the latest quarterly figures are released on Thursday. \nAt its June meeting, the central bank projected inflation to reach 1.5pc in 2016 and 1.8pc in 2017. Analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) now expect a downgrade to 0pc this year and 0.8pc in 2016. \nBut on a positive note, core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and energy prices, has continued to remain steady at around 1pc. \n= What do the markets think? = \nMarket expectations for future prices rises are perhaps the most important measure dictating the ECB's actions this month. They are the true \"acid test\" for central bank action, says Julian Jessop at Capital Economics. \nMr Draghi's preferred measure of inflation expectations is the 'five-year, five-year' forward swap rate. This influential guage of medium term prices (it measures the market’s expectation of what inflation will be starting in five years time and ending in 10 years time) fell to a seven-month low on \"Black Monday\" of August 24. \nThe gauge has since risen to 1.7pc on the back of comments from ECB officials that they will use more monetary firepower to fight off disinflation, but it still remains below the Bank's mandated 2pc target rate and a previous post-QE peak of 1.86pc in July. \n= The rise of the euro = \nOne peculiar feature of the summer's market tumult has been the appreciation of the euro, which has benefitted from safe haven flows amid concern over a September Federal Reserve rate hike. \nThe single currency's real effective exchange rate has risen by 6pc since mid-July, hitting levels not seen since January. This strengthening will worry the euro's policymakers as it exerts a further downward force on consumer prices and hampers export industries. \nMr Draghi successfully managed to talk down the value of the euro at the mere suggestion of QE at the start of the year. The Italian is now expected to provide further conciliatory language to keep down the exchange rate which has proven to be the \"main contributor to the tightening of financial conditions\" in the eurozone, according to Philippe Gudin at Barclays. \nMr Gudin expects the ECB to counter-act this unwanted appreciation by announcing a further cut to the Bank's deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.2pc, to -0.3pc before the end of the year. \n= Oil prices = \nA collapse in commodity prices has exerted the biggest drag on inflation. The price of Brent oil fell from an average of $56.6 in July to just $46.5 dollars in August, an 18pc monthly fall, on a par with the record collapses seen in December 2014, according to calculatations from Oxford Economics. \nThe declines mean the ECB's June forecasts, which projected an average oil price of $64 per barrel next year and $71 per barrel in 2017, are in jeopardy. Falling energy prices may be a boon to consumers, but are set to keep the outlook for near-term inflation far below the ECB's target rate. \n= Money supply = \nOne factor that could mitigate against further euro QE is the blistering pace of money supply growth in the eurozone. \nConsidered a leading indicator of economic activity, one measure of money supply - narrow M1 - has risen to its pre-financial crisis peak. Another measure of money supply that includes lending, known as M3 (Other OTC: MTHRF - news ) , has also spiked to a post-Lehman crash peak. \n= = \nThe bullish numbers are evidence that the euro's cyclical recovery has finally begun to take hold, despite turmoil in the stock markets. For some analysts, the rate of credit growth should be enough to push the ECB to end its €60bn-a-month bond purchases before September 2016. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will be clear by early next year that there is a lot more life in the eurozone economy than people think\", says Simon Ward of Henderson Global Investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:16:28.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
