PUBLISHED: 10:26, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:09, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 GETTY The FTSE staged a recovery in Thursday's trading \nThe FTSE 100 jumped up 1.7 per cent in morning trading to sit at around 6,188. \nInvestors have been on tenterhooks over the past few weeks over China's stock market crash and slowing economy. \nHowever, stock markets in Asian country are now closed for a three-day holiday, providing a welcome opportunity for markets in Europe and the US to rally. \nOne expert described today's respite from Chinese turmoil as \"euphoria\" for Europe. Today's increase helps to reverse some of the £50billion losses that the market suffered on Tuesday after a dismal day of trading when the index sank as low as 6028.\nThe losses were largely prompted by data out of the colossal country that showed that the Chinese manufacturing and services sectors were slowing faster than expected. The Shanghai Composite Index has also suffered huge volatility in recent weeks, which has rubbed off on markets across the world. The index dropped 8.5 per cent in one day alone at the end of August triggering panic in traders across the globe and leading to a huge day of losses now labelled as 'Black Monday'.
