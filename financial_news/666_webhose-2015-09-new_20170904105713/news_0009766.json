Rowe Price. In its study, the investment giant comes across with a clear and compelling message of their own for parents - kids who get an allowance are more money savvy than those who do not. According to the research, parents who give their kids an allowance are more likely to have kids who: - Say they are knowledgeable about managing personal finances (32% vs. 16%). - Feel they are smart about money (40% vs. 25%). - Think their parents are doing a good job teaching them about finances (52% vs. 31%). \"It's intuitive that talking to kids about money gives them financial knowledge,\" says Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. \"But we were surprised to see the extent to which letting kids experience money may have an impact. While giving kids an allowance is one way to let them experience money, parents can also consider opening up a savings account for them or letting them use a debit or credit card, with some guardrails of course.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:20:46.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
