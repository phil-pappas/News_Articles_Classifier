It is also indicated for prevention of DVT after major surgery, such as knee and hip replacement worldwide, the company said.\n“`Under the binding terms of the sale, Alchemia will receive $17.5 million in cash from Dr. Reddy’s upon the closing of the transaction. In addition to the agreed sale consideration, the company received a payment of $1.15 million for its share of net profit from the US – only sales of fondaparinux for the quarter ending 30 June 2015,” Alchemia said in a statement.\nIn 2007, Alchemia granted Dr Reddy’s non-exclusive rights to manufacture fondaparinux sodium in active pharmaceutical ingredients form and exclusive rights to market fondaparinux in the North America. In exchange for these manufacturing and marketing rights, Alchemia is entitled to receive 50% of the net profit generated from sales of fondaparinux in North America.
