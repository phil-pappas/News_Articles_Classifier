U.S. consumer spending rises; core inflation firms slightly Reuters – 34 minutes ago \nPeople are seen walking through Roosevelt Field shopping mall in Garden City, New York February 22, 2015. … \nBy Jason Lange \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending grew briskly in August and a key measure of inflation firmed a bit, signs of strength in America's domestic economy that could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates despite weakness abroad. \nThe Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent rise in July. \nThe figures give a bullish sign for economic growth in the third quarter. \n\"These data underscore the ongoing health of the consumer sector,\" said John Hoff, an economist at RBS Securities. \nThe report could help convince investors of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's view, most recently expressed on Thursday, that the economy was strong enough to warrant a rate increase this year. New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday also said a hike was likely this year and could come as soon as October. \nInvestors have been doubtful, with many betting that the Fed's first rate increase in a decade won't come until March. \nBut the U.S. dollar firmed following the consumer spending report, as did yields on U.S. government debt, signs that some investors were bringing forward their bets on a rate increase. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.3 percent last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. \nIt was the latest report indicating momentum in the economy as it confronted recent global financial markets turbulence, sparked by concerns over a slowing Chinese economy, which pushed the Fed to hold off hiking rates earlier in September. \nThe economy grew at a robust 3.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter. \nLast month, spending on long-lasting goods such as automobiles increased 0.9 percent. Outlays on services like utilities rose 0.5 percent. \nPersonal income increased 0.3 percent in August. \nOverall inflation remained muted, reflecting low oil prices. Inflation, which has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target in annual terms, rose just 0.3 percent in August from the same month a year earlier. \nHowever, prices were up 1.3 percent when excluding food and energy, a key metric used by the Fed to gauge the trend rate of inflation. In July, core prices rose 1.2 percent year-over-year. \nDespite the positive signals for consumer spending, the U.S. housing market appeared to loose a step last month, with contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes falling 1.4 percent. \n(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:18:30.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
