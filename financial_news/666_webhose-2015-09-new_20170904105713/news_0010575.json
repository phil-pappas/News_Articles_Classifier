The immediate focus for investors is policy response in the U.S.\"\nMarket players said investors are counting on Friday's release of U.S. non-farm payrolls data to signal whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in September.\nSpeculation over the timing of an expected rate hike has seesawed, but market participants said strong payrolls data on Friday would likely rekindle expectations around a September hike.\nInvestors dumped Toshiba Corp after the company further delayed release of its earnings for the year ending March, saying it had found new accounting irregularities. The stock fell 5.3 percent.\nPharmaceuticals, one of the best performing sectors so far this year, dropped 5.4 percent, becoming the worst performing sector in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry subindex.\nTakeda Pharmaceutical fell 4.4 percent while Astellas Pharma dropped 5.8 percent and Eisai fell 7.5 percent.\nFood companies, a sector favoured by investors, sank 4.5 percent, with Japan Tobacco falling 4.1 percent and Meiji Holdings shedding 6.2 percent.\nThe broader Topix dropped 3.8 percent to 1,478.11. Morgan Stanley affirmed its Topix target price at 1,740 and recommended investors raise weightings for Japan to buy back into the current weakness, which the house sees as overdone.\nOnly 47 shares gained while 1,837 shares declined on the TSE's main board.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 shed 4 percent to 13,267.48.
