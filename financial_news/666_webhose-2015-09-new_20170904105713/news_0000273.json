It was totally avoidable,” added Modi. Authorities in Chandigarh had ordered the closure of all 187 schools on Friday, blocked roads to ensure smooth movement for the prime minister’s cavalcade and even ordered that ambulances would have to take longer detours to reach hospitals. The main cremation ground of the city in Sector 25, which is located next to the rally ground where Modi addressed his official rally on Friday afternoon, too was out of bounds for people. Those who had to cremate their loved ones were forced to do in cremation grounds in nearby Mohali and Mani Majra.
