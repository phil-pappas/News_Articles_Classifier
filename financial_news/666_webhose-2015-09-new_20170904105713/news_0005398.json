Coping with hospital surroundings and the discomfort of treatment or surgery can be difficult for young children, and scrapbooking provides a natural outlet. These scrapbooks are especially dear to the families of terminally ill children since they create a lasting memory of their loved one.\n“Cleveland Children’s Clinic has always been on the forefront of treating young patients, and this charity drive will help them continue to do what they do best,” says Greg Brawner, owner and manager of the Westshore Agency. “I feel strongly that our community should do everything possible to help these children and their families find peace and comfort during an extremely difficult time.”\nMobilizing a network of personal and professional contacts, Brawner and his team are reaching out to community members in and around Cleveland to gather support for the medical scrapbooking project at Cleveland Children’s Clinic. Efforts are underway to build an online social media portal that the team hopes will draw in even more support from families throughout Ohio and across the nation.\nThe Westshore Agency isn’t stopping with Cleveland Children’s, and has recently announced an ongoing community involvement campaign. “We call it ‘Agents of Change,’ and we’re going to be helping at least one new charity every two months from here forward,” explains Brawner.\nReaders who wish to assist the Westshore Agency as they support the medical scrapbooking project for patients at Cleveland Children’s Clinic are encouraged to stop by the Westshore Agency website and make a personal contribution here: http://thewestshoreagency.com/Help-Sick-Kids-Create-Beautiful-Memories_5_community_cause .
