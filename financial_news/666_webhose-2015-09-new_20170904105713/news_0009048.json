But the figures may not be quite as positive as they seem. For one thing, the average worker put in 137 hours and 54 minutes at the coal-face in August, 44 minutes less than in August last year. As a result, the total number of hours worked - arguably a better guide to the level of employment - rose only 1.5 per cent through the year. As well, even after revisions published on Wednesday, the ABS may still be overestimating growth in the working-age population, and therefore measures based on it, including employment. The bureau's estimates depend on its own demographic data up to the end of 2014, but after that it uses projections from the Department of Immigration and Boarder Protection. In a research paper on Wednesday, ANZ economist Justin Fabo said the DIBP projections assumed a pickup in immigration this year which look \"little optimistic\". As well, measuring net immigration - a key driver of changes in population growth from year to year - is difficult. \"For both these reasons, we could see further downward revisions to growth in the civilian population and employment down the track,\" Mr Fabo said. The latest travel data from the ABS showed annual growth in long-term arrivals to Australia - returning residents, visitors intending to stay more than a year, and permanent settlers - slowed from 349,000 over the year to July 2014, to 291,000 over the latest 12 months. Yet growth in the working age population assumed by the bureau in its jobs data grew by 284,000 over the year to August, virtually the same as the 288,000 rise over the preceding 12 months. And the month-to-month growth rate for the working-age population estimates used in the August jobs data, 24,800 is, implausibly, even higher than the 22,700-a-month growth rate this time last year. Either net immigration has slowed sharply, or growth in the working age population has not slowed. But not both. And if, as seems likely, population growth has slowed more than the labour force data assume, then jobs growth is not as buoyant as it seems, even after allowing for the reduction in average hours worked. The ABS figures showed the trend in employment growth has slowed to 15,300 a month in August, from 24,300 six months earlier in February, but in reality it's probably slowed a bit more than that.
