Operating margins deteriorated to negative 31.7 percent for both firms.\nFirst-half revenues for Rocket Internet itself rose 5 percent to 71.3 million euros but it slipped to a loss of 45.9 million from a profit of 91.9 million a year ago due to a reduction in consolidation gains from companies it no longer owns stakes in.
