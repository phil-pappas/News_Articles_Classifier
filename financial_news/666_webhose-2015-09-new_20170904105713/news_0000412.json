Today’s winning paper is an excellent example of how evidence-based research must inform such policy choices and ensure that policy-makers learn from the mistakes of the past.” \nThe Miriam Hederman O’Brien prize is awarded by the Foundation for Fiscal Studies to recognise outstanding contributors in the area of Irish fiscal policy. The aim of the prize is to promote the study and discussion of matters relating to fiscal, economic and social policy and to reward researchers who make a contribution to informing or understanding evidence-based policy decisions. \nThe prize, a gold medal and a cheque for €3,000, will be presented jointly by Minister Harris and Dr Miriam Hederman O’Brien at an event in the Glass Room Suite in the Mansion House at 1pm, where the authors will present a summary of their paper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:45:00.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
