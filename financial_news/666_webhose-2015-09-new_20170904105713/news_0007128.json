In fact, the majority of Africa's population has never heard about the continent's most important governance assessment and promotion tool. \nThis is worrying for an initiative started in 2003, with 35 member states. The APRM focuses on diagnosing problems and improving governance in the political, economic, corporate and developmental spheres. 17 countries have been reviewed so far, but there is little follow-up and no new reviews have taken place since January 2013. The recent cancellation of an Extraordinary Summit in Kenya, intended to revitalise the APRM, sent out further negative signals. Why is the APRM in the doldrums? \nOne reason is failure to sell its successes. For instance, although government insiders in South Africa often speak about the impact that the APRM had on scrapping the contested 'floor-crossing' practice in the country's parliament, this link has not been publicised. While achievements in other countries have been more concrete, they do little to excite the public or the media. For instance Ghana established a Ministry of Chieftaincy and Cultural Affairs, Rwanda revitalised its economic and corporate governance, and Kenya developed a master plan on land use. Many of the APRM's reforms sadly drown in a sea of acronyms and technical jargon. \nFew also know that the APRM might have prevented two recent African tragedies. The high probability of both the 2006-7 post-electoral violence in Kenya and the 2008 xenophobic attacks in South Africa were flagged one year in advance in the countries' respective APRM reports. But governments ignored or denied the warnings. In fact, all reports have identified critical societal fault-lines. Envisaged 'peer pressure' has been mostly absent, and recommendations are routinely shrugged off. \nEnthusiasm and political will surrounding the APRM have steadily declined. Fewer new members are joining, existing members are not paying their fees, heads of states skip meetings and when media coverage does happen, it is usually negative. The APRM Secretariat has not had a permanent CEO since 2008. Despite promising signs, including a country review mission to Djibouti in July and plans to recruit experts for background papers on Chad, the overall picture is one of political apathy at the highest level, and institutional lethargy. \nWill Africa look back on the APRM and regret what might have been? In theory, it has the potential to improve governance, promote learning from best practices and hold leaders to account. In practice, however, it has fallen well short. The APRM has produced 17 mostly solid, thorough and honest governance reports. Yet due to their sheer bulk and level of detail - averaging 400-500 pages - few have read them. While each report has a concrete programme of action, these have been poorly integrated with other development initiatives and have not been implemented. \nThe APRM must send stronger signals. It needs to urgently: 1) Make a public re-commitment to the values of the APRM by heads of state; 2) Appoint a permanent Secretariat CEO and competent senior leadership; 3) Ensure payment of fees by member states in arrears; 4) Complete at least one new review; and, 5) Demonstrate real intent by member states to implement action plans. \nThe APRM also need to learn from past mistakes. Its overly complicated structure and processes fail to excite the public, especially when the results do not seem tangible. The APRM does make a difference - fostering dialogue, diagnosing deficiencies and proposing African solutions - but it does so without fanfare, and its media presence is often found wanting. Given that it is currently the only continental tool with the potential to improve governance in its member states, Africa cannot afford for it to fail. The modern world offers easy ways to spread ideas through social media. The continent's youth are embracing Facebook and Twitter to communicate and share, and the youth will benefit most from the positive changes achieved by the APRM. A strong social media campaign could help turn around waning interest and generate excitement around the APRM and the issues it champions. 2016 should be the year to #ReviveAPRM. \nYarik Turianskyi is the programme manager on Governance and the APRM at the South African Institute of International Affairs, and Steven Gruzd is the programme head.
