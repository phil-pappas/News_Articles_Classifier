Does Jeb Bush bring visceral passion to the event or open himself up to more “low energy” mockery? And can John Kasich or Marco Rubio steal the spotlight?\nParticipating Wednesday night are Trump, Bush, Kasich, Rubio, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie.\nHere’s what to look for when the 11 GOP White House hopefuls take the stage.\nWho lands a punch on Trump? As the GOP frontrunner, Trump is the other Republicans’ biggest target. He doesn’t seem very concerned. “Whatever” was his reaction to his rivals’ planned attacks against him . Yet a serious slip-up by Trump caused either by the other candidates or the moderators could break the stride he’s enjoyed in the polls. His manager says he’ll come prepared to discuss the issues. But he’s stumbled before, mangling a foreign-policy question on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show. Hewitt — who Trump later called a “third-rate radio announcer” — is one of the moderators for the debate.\nBen Carson: Carson’s star has risen in polls, and his interaction with Trump will be critical to watch. Now at No. 2 nationally, Carson is expected to try to separate himself from Trump and try to build on his good favorability ratings. His camp is expecting attacks from Trump, with a confidant telling the Hill the retired neurosurgeon will stand up to him as necessary. The two have some policy differences — Carson backs a flat tax; Trump has issues with it — but the most noticeable difference is clearly style.\nAlso read: The flat tax and two other policies that separate Ben Carson and Donald Trump .\nFight with Fiorina: Carly Fiorina has already begun hitting back at Trump after his comment about her looks. Wednesday will be the first time they’ve come face to face since he made his controversial comments, and she subsequently turned them into an ad for her campaign. Wednesday will also be Fiorina’s first time on the debate stage, so she’ll be looking to score points and get noticed in a big way.\nAlso read: Trump’s ‘face’ comment has been etched into Carly Fiorina’s campaign .\nBush needs a bounce: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was once the favorite in polls for the GOP nomination. Though political prediction markets still favor him , he’s now in third place in the RealClearPolitics average. “It’s still too early to rule him out, but Jeb needs a strong performance in [Wednesday] night’s debate,” writes Greg Valliere of Potomac Group. “Hit the espresso” is Valliere’s advice. Bush has been attacked by Trump for being a “low-energy” candidate, and Wednesday night he gets his chance to turn that jab on its head.\nDon’t forget Kasich or Rubio: Valliere also wrote Tuesday that a joint ticket between Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio “could win the general election.” Putting aside the question of whether they’d entertain that idea, they’re going to try to gin up more starpower for themselves Wednesday night. The bigger burden will be on Kasich, who’s running ninth in the national polls. But he got a bump since the last debate and another strong performance could help propel him higher. Rubio is running in fifth place.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016RepNomination"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:06:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
