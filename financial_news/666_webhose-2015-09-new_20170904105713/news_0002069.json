Tokyo markets will be closed for much of next week, reopening on Thursday.\nU.S. Treasury prices rose and yields skidded on Thursday, with two-year yields declining the most in a day in six and a half years.\nDespite some encouraging domestic signs, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the external outlook was less certain. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged, but left open the possibility of a modest policy tightening later this year.\n($1 = 119.6900 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:10:23.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
