DreamWorks Animation secured actor Liam Neeson for the voice over on the ad, which is timed to coincide with the International Day of Peace on Sept. 21.\nOther participating brands include MasterCard Inc, Burger King, Cargill Inc, Facebook, Google Inc, Twitter Inc, United Airlines , McCain Foods and OMD Worldwide.\nWFP says it needs more than $7 billion to provide assistance to hungry people around the world in 2015, but the agency is on track to bring in only around $4 billion, less than last year's total contributions of nearly $5.4 billion.\nThis year's funding shortfall forced WFP to drop hundreds of thousands of Syrians from its voucher program and to halve the value of remaining vouchers for Syrian refugees in countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, said Abeer Etefa, a WFP public information officer based in Cairo.\nAs a result, Syrian refugees with vouchers receive less than 50 cents per person, per day to buy food, which can include perishables such as fruit, vegetables, milk, cheese and eggs, she said.\nWithin Syria, WFP has had to reduce by about one-fourth the amount of food in baskets it distributes. Those contain basics such as rice, oil, dried beans, canned foods, sugar and salt.\nThe cuts are coming at a difficult time for many families whose resources have often been long depleted, said Etefa. \"They are in survival mode.\"\nWFP said the money raised in the new campaign will go to their emergency response fund which supports crises in and around the countries of Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen.\nApple Inc and Google separately have pledged millions of dollars in financial support to assist the waves of refugees streaming into Europe from war-torn countries.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Editing by Franklin Paul)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T15:43:53.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
