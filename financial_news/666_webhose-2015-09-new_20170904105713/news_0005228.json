Recalling that there was a time when the experts were talking about dropping India from BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), Jaitley said: “Today, India has become the fastest-growing economy among BRICS.”\nIndia is no more a nation suffering from policy paralysis and uncertain taxation regime, he said, adding that now-a-days states are vying with each other to attract investment.\nMoreover, he added, as a net importer, the country has benefited from declining oil prices in the international market. It has helped contain inflation as well as fiscal deficit.\nThe government, Jaitley said, has been trying to address the problems of some of the sectors which are going through a bad phase.\n“There have been some stressed sectors. Steel, power and discoms and sectoral interest of these sectors over the last few months have been specifically addressed,” he said.\nReferring to the banking sector reforms, he said the government is recapitalising state-owned banks and professionalising their management.\n“Banking sector is another stressed sector in India and we have started recapitalising and professionalising the banking system. The programme we have laid down…over the next 3-4 years, our banks will be back in shape. It is not a very challenging situation they were passing through… They will get out of that phase,” he said.\nA host of initiatives by the government, Jaitley said, have brought about “a positive environment which has built up across the country. Now every state is vying for global investment”.\nHe regretted however that the key indirect taxation reform Bill – Goods and Services Tax (GST) – could not be pushed through in the last session of Parliament.\nOn the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, the minister said it has helped in reducing subsidies and rationalising public expenditure.\n“Our direct benefit transfer…has actually rationalised a lot of expenditure which was otherwise going waste. Duplications have been done away with, and even in the case of food and fertiliser, the pilot projects are now taking off. Once these projects go through, our saving itself, without an impact on the underprivileged, is going to be reasonable,” he added.\nThe savings on these accounts, Jaitley said, would be diverted to improve irrigation facilities and infrastructure.\n“The economic returns of investment on irrigation are always the fastest. You build up a huge agriculture buffer and control food prices and you build up a large purchasing power among a majority of Indians. This impacts the manufacturing and services sector,” he said.\nThe government has been focusing on development of highways, which had slowed “terribly”, he added.\n“Infrastructure had slowed over the years. Rural roads to the national highway programme have picked up in a big way. Highways had slowed down terribly, but it’s one of the sectors (in which) in the last 12 months, a lot of public resources have been invested. We put in a lot of budgetary support in modernising the railways,” the Minister added.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 11:43 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:22:51.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
