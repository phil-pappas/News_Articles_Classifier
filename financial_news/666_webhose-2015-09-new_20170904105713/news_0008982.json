There's a lot of uncertainty,\" said Teich.\nOn the earnings front, Sears Canada shares jumped 4.7 percent to C$8.87 after the struggling retailer posted a smaller operating loss and the slowest decline in comparable stores sales in six quarters.\nResources stocks weighed, with Barrick Gold Corp off 3.9 percent to C$8.53 and Canadian Oil Sands declining 4.7 percent to C$6.46.
