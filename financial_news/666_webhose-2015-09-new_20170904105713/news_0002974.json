In line with EDAIFâ€™s holistic approach, 1,200 out-growers are also being supported to cultivate cassava in the three regions to feed the factories. \nEDAIF is working with implementation partners who are providing technical support in terms of best practice agronomy to the out-growers. \nThe second and third phases of the project will focus on the production of industrial alcohol and cassava starch and will be implemented in the other regions of the country. \nStory by Ghana/Myjoyonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:13:30.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
