Edwina Pickles Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates National Australia Bank will provide computer-generated financial advice to consumers through its online banking platform, as banks seek to cross-sell more advice to their vast customer bases.\nIn a move it hopes will prompt more customers to contact its adviser network, the bank will this month launch an online platform that produces free, general advice on retirement savings and insurance.\nIt will initially be rolled out to 40,000 customers but there are plans to increase this to 400,000 within a year and, eventually, offer the service to all 3 million online banking customers.\nThe platform, which NAB says is a first from a major bank, requires a customer to answer various questions on their circumstances.\nIt then produces advice based on the customer's responses.\nThe bank says the advice will be \"personalised\" but under the law it will be classified as \"general\" advice, meaning it does not take into account a customer's entire financial situation.\nOnce customers have provided details including their income, age, retirement goals and risk profile, they are provided with information such as how much more money they are likely to need in superannuation to support their desired spending patterns in retirement.\nThe move comes as most banks eye growth in financial advice, an industry that has been dogged by scandals but is tipped to grow in importance as the country's $2 trillion in superannuation swells .\n NAB's general manager of digital and direct services, Anne Bennett, said the aim was to provide customers with more information and education, which might prompt them to contact a NAB financial adviser.\n\"With only a minority of Australians actively seeking financial advice, this helps us open up the market to the majority and still, where needed, refer customers on to face-to-face conversations,\" she said.\nBanks are also trying to increase the cross-selling of wealth products to their transaction banking customers, including through online channels via so-called \"robo advice\".\n\"Both within the bank and among our advisers, our attitude is we embrace digital, it's where our customers are and what our customers want,\" Ms Bennett said.\nShe said the service, NAB Prosper, would not recommend specific financial products.\nJust what should be considered \"financial advice\" has been an area of some debate. Current laws allow banks to provide \"general advice\".\nHowever, the financial system inquiry recommended this be renamed because some of the information amounted to advertising or sales material.\nMs Bennett said NAB had met the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and received positive feedback from the regulator.\nThe reputation of financial advice has also been battered in recent years after banks including NAB, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Macquarie Group have been forced to pay out millions of dollars in customer compensation for shoddy advice.\nMs Bennett said the product was \"absolutely not\" a response to behavioural problems in the industry, and nor was it designed to reduce the role of advisers.\nWhile the product will only provide information on superannuation and insurance, the bank plans to expand the topics covered to include debt, estate planning and investments.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042"], "published": "2015-09-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:04:43.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
