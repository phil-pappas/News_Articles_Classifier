By Phalguni Soni 1 hour ago  \n( Continued from Prior Part ) Walmart’s profitability in 2Q16 \nWalmart’s (WMT) margins were pressured in 2Q16. Gross margin came in at 25.1%, almost flat from a year earlier. However, operating profit margin declined by 56 basis points year-over-year to come in at 5%. Operating income was lower by 10% in the quarter, coming in at $6.1 billion. All three segments reported declines in operating profit, with the greatest drop in Walmart’s International segment. The drags on US profitability \nOperating income for Walmart U.S. fell by 8.2% to $4.8 billion in 2Q16. The segment’s margins were adversely impacted by higher-than-expected shrinkage in inventories, pressure on reimbursement rates in its pharmacy business, and higher wage costs for store associates. International performance \nWalmart International reported a 14.2% fall in operating income in 2Q16. Excluding the impact of adverse currency movements, segment profits went down 1.5%. Besides the 9.6% decline in the top line due to currency factors, profitability was affected by higher competition and a more challenging macro environment in key markets. Cost outlook \nWalmart is improving asset protection initiatives in its stores for better inventory management. However, these are likely to take some time to implement and improve the bottom line. Headwinds from lower reimbursement rates are also expected to persist for Walmart’s pharmacy business due to industry pressures. Forex (foreign exchange) pressures are also not expected to ease in the near term. Mapping Target’s performance \nIn comparison, Target (TGT) reported higher profitability, with operating margin coming in at 3.1% in 2Q16 compared to 2.8% in 2Q15. The increase was primarily due to improved sales mix and expense management. Operating income rose more than 17% to $1.3 billion. Pharmacy sales \nRecently, Target (TGT) entered into a definitive agreement with retail pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS), divesting its pharmacy business to CVS for $1.9 billion. Target’s pharmacies earned sales in excess of $4 billion last fiscal year but didn’t contribute any profit. The deal is expected to further benefit Target’s profitability. \nWalmart and CVS together constitute 2% of the holdings in the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and 1.3% in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T08:00:35.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
