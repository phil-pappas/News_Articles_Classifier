Chinedu Eze writes that porous airports and inadequate manpower, among others, are major causes of insecurity at the nation's airports. \nLast week, a 25 year old man, Festus Chikeluba, who attempted to hide under the tyre carriage (wheel-well) of a Medview aircraft on a domestic flight was apprehended at the Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal 2 (MMA2) in Lagos. \nTwo other incidents had been recorded in the recent past. A few months ago, a decomposing dead body of a suspected stowaway was found in the wheel-well of Arik Air flight that just arrived from New York. Although many industry observers argue that stowaway in air transport is a worldwide phenomenon, they however agreed that such incidents are becoming very frequent in Nigeria. They have attributed it to a lot of factors: \nInadequate Manpower \nAviation security experts have warned that inadequate manpower in the Aviation Security (AVSEC) department of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) would create gaps that could threaten the total security apparatus of all the major airports in Nigeria. \nFor instance, Chikeluba said he scaled the VIP fence into the tarmac of the domestic terminal and entered the wheel-well of Medview Airline that planned to taxi to the international terminal where it would take off to Ghana. \nIndustry observers noted that it was surprising that no one saw Chikeluba when he scaled the fence in such a highly sensitive area of the airport. The VIP lounge located between MMA2 and the Air Force Base is under watch 24 hours, but he was able to scale the fence unnoticed. And the MMA2 tarmac, which ought to be under surveillance by both CCTV and AVSEC officials were not watchful and as such did not notice when he scaled the fence and entered the wheel-well of the aircraft. \nOver the years, there has been stoppage of recruitment of security personnel in FAAN. This has led to inadequate number of personnel manning the screening machines and conducting the profiling of passengers being checked to travel, a situation that gives rise to delays in processing passengers. \nTHISDAY learnt that many of the security officials work over time and those who monitor the x-ray screen spend hours on the screen against the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recommended 20 minutes per officer. \nIt is believed that when an official spends more hours monitoring the content of passengers' luggage he would lose concentration and inadvertently allow prohibited objects, including well concealed bombs, guns, knives and other dangerous goods and drugs to pass through. \nInformed source disclosed to THISDAY that the number of AVSEC officers working at the nation's airports currently is only 1396, and that the department needs additional 2916 to make up the total of 4312 needed to effectively man the security posts at the airports. \nPerimeter Fencing \nMany airports in the country todaay don't have comprehensive security fencing, the same with perimeter fencing, which barricades the airside of the airport from encroachers and other unwanted persons. They are known as inner and outer perimeter fencing. \nIn 2013, a 13-year old boy, Daniel Oikhena sneaked into the airside of the Benin airport and entered the wheel well of Arik aircraft, which brought him to Lagos. Also few years ago people gained access to the Lagos airport and stole INEC computers imported for the 2011 elections. They gained access through the broken fence along the Akowonjo area of the city. \nAVSEC officials are recongnised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as responsible for managing airport security. The experts said the support AVSEC is getting from the Nigerian police and Nigerian Navy for the landside of the airports can only go to the extent that it controls the entry and exit of passengers and other airports users but it cannot help in the profiling of air travellers, which is the sole responsibility of AVSEC personnel, who are trained in accordance to aviation standards to do so. \nThey also warned that insider threat becomes high when operatives who are not trained in aviation are made to take significant roles in aviation security management, noting that either government makes it a permanent policy that the other paramilitary operatives would now work permanently with AVSEC officials which now requires they must go for aviation security training. \nThe CEO of Centurion Aviation Security and the Secretary General of Aviation Round Table, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retd) said one of the major challenges facing FAAN today is delay of passengers during security checks and attributed it to inadequate AVSEC personnel, adding that passengers could take very dangerous goods and weapons to the aircraft when overworked AVSEC officials become too tired to properly examine hand luggage and effectively profile the passenger through the x-ray machines. \nStowaways \nThe story of stowaways is rife in the world. Besides the stowaway incidents in Nigeria, about a year ago another teenager in the US survived over an hour flight in the wheel well of a flight in freezing weather and the boy was described as being lucky to have survived and was unharmed after flying from California to Hawaii while he stowed away in a plane's wheel well, surviving cold temperature at 38,000 feet and a lack of oxygen. \nHe was reported to have jumped a fence to gain access to the airport and that he ran away from his family after an argument. Reports said when he was rescued; he could not even recall what happened. \nTwo factors made it possible. He escaped the scrutiny of the airport security, including that of Transport Security Agency and the security around the airplane. The airport is also porous to have made it possible for him to gain entry without notice. \nThe above is a reflection of what happened at the Benin airport in August, 2013, when Daniel Oikhena hid himself in the wheel well of Arik Air aircraft, flight WS 544, and flew from the historical city to Lagos. \nOikhena was the fourth person in the last few years to risk his life that way; the only difference was that like the young American, he survived while the others died. \nIn March 2010, a Nigerian, Okechukwu Okeke was found dead in the nose wheel compartment of the United States carrier, Delta Air Lines, Boeing B777 aircraft parked on the tarmac of the Lagos airport. \nAlso on September 19, 2010 another Nigerian man was discovered crushed to death in the wheel well of Arik Air flight, which arrived from Johannesburg, South Africa. Prior to Daniel's incident, another Nigerian was discovered in the undercarriage compartment of Arik Air aircraft, after it returned from a flight to New York. \nIndustry security experts said anyone, who undertook the risk of stowing away is looking for greener pastures. Chikeluba said the same when he was caught last week. He said he was frustrated with living in Nigeria and wanted to escape. Chikeluba who was charged to court for attempted suicide did not show contrition for his action; rather, he was disappointed he was not allowed to escape, an attempt that might have consumed his life. \nOjikutu said what makes stowaway possible is the airport where the access control to the security controlled area is defective and or there is no security fence or the perimeter fence is porous and not security enhanced. \nImplication of these loopholes includes the fact that the airports are exposed to terror attacks, and because an unauthorised person can easily gain access to the airport, it would be easier for insider threat, which terrorists take advantage of. It also indicates that security operatives are not alert to their duties. \nAirport Patrol \nWhile it is the duty of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria to provide security to protect these airports; the security for the protection of the airside of the airports begins with perimeter fencing; then the construction of perimeter road, which is regularly patrolled by AVSEC officials. \nMost of Nigeria's airports do not have perimeter fence, some of them lack perimeter road and although government owned the airports, the host communities where the airports are located still see the areas as their own. That is why they still use the facilities to dry their harvested crops in some states; some graze their cattle there and others cultivate farms around the airport runways. \nAt the Kaduna airport a fortnight ago, as the aircraft took off the passengers saw movements of people at the runway area. A man was dragging a motorcycle, accompanied by another as they walk towards the runway through a track road, while a woman who might have brought her wares to the market was returning home after a day's sales. The passengers saw her walking away from the runway. They were leisurely in their walk because the track road that empties into the airport is a well-known thoroughfare. FAAN must have to engage the host community and alternative routes found for these residents around the runway for them to abandon the roads their grandparents had plied to various destinations. \nIndustry observers said it is necessary for FAAN and other government agencies to interact with residents where airports are located. There are always footpaths to almost all the airports in Nigeria where the locals use to access the airport. This is not peculiar to Nigeria, but with constant interactions, the host communities could raise the alarm when unusual, suspicious incident or movement takes place. Government should carry the local communities, where airports are located, along, especially now that Nigeria is facing terror threat. \nTo significantly curb the incidents of stowaways, which may lead to catastrophic security breaches, government must review the activities of AVSEC, recruit more personnel and revive continuity training programme to ensure that security personnel are equipped with the right skill and the right equipment to protect the airports.
