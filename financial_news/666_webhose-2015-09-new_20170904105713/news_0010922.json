The statistics show that: FOS took on a total of 173,994 new cases in the first half of 2015 – an overall increase of 8% on the previous period (161,649); of these, PPI complaints made up 55% – with 94,091 new PPI complaints, a 10% fall compared with the previous period; the number of complaints about financial products other than PPI increased by 45% to 79,550, largely as a result of complaints about packaged bank accounts brought by claims-management companies; and the average uphold rate (where FOS found in the consumer’s favour) over the six-month period was 57%. \nThe statistics also showed 22 financial businesses featuring in the complaints data for the first time, meaning that 222 businesses in total had 30 or more cases referred to, and resolved by, FOS in this period.
