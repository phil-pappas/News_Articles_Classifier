Peter Rae by Simon Evans South Australia's business community is annoyed a push to move to the same time zone as Victoria and NSW was scrapped because of opposition by the Liberal Party and independent MPs.\nBusiness leaders say it would have given the state to chance to shift perceptions while economic modelling showed a 30-minute time change would have been worth $2.5 billion.\nNigel McBride, chief executive of Business SA, the body that oversees the interest of the business sector, said it was a disappointing outcome after several months of community debate because a decision to make a controversial change would have caused a big shift in perceptions about South Australia being \"open for business\".\n\"It was important for us to be seen to be in the main game,\" Mr McBride said on Thursday. \"To us its all about perceptions\".\nThe 30-minute time difference came about in the late 1890s. The change would have put South Australia on the same time zone as the eastern states.\nSouth Australian Minister for Investment and Trade Martin Hamilton-Smith said he was fuming. He said the process would be re-opened if Liberal Party leader Steven Marshall changed his mind. Mr Hamilton-Smith, who led the community consultation project, is a former Liberal Party leader who defected from the party last year to join Premier Jay Weatherill's Labor government.\n\"Steven Marshall is the captain of the anti-everything brigade,\" Mr Hamilton-Smith said.\nThe Liberal Party opposed the move because many people in rural electorates were against making any change. Communities on the west coast of the state were concerned that children would be going to school in the dark.\n Mr McBride said while it was \"disappointing\", with the business community having been the main driver of the change, it was now time to focus on other things in a state where the unemployment rate is the highest on the mainland at 7.9 per cent. \"We're disappointed because it was a debate worth having,\" he said.\nMr Marshall said the Weatherill government had \"failed to provide evidence\" that a shift would be a net positive for the state, with most people opposed to the move.\nThe proposal to shift the time zone was part of measures by Mr Weatherill to drive growth. These included holding a royal commission into a nuclear industry and removing stamp duty on commercial and industrial property transactions in a staged process where stamp duty is completely removed by mid-2018. The time zone change needed the imprimatur of the parliament to be adopted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:52:35.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
