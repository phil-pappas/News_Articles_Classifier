Medicine is a particularly acute example – we wouldn’t necessarily want a machine to decide whether to switch off a life support machine.\" \nThere is evidence a wide range of jobs are already being affected by AI. \nMore than half of trades on global markets are now being conducted by algorithms, according to the Financial Times, and robotic devices are already being used for surgery. \nMeanwhile IBM’s Watson - a super-computer that has analysed millions of pages of medical texts and tens of thousands of cases - is assisting in patients' diagnoses, according to the Business Insider. \nA new robotic kitchen is one of the inventions bringing AI into the food industry, and in Japan, the world’s first hotel staffed by humanoid robots opened earlier this year. \nDriverless cars are already legal in three US states, with the British Government investing millions in further developing the technology. \nThat has led to optimism about the capacity of machine intelligence to improve quality of life and create new employment opportunities. \n\"So sadly perhaps taxi drivers will be replaced by technology,\" said former science minister David Willetts. \n\"But 100 years ago there were people driving hansom cabs, we were using horse-drawn cabs to get around. \n\"As technology changes, so the types of jobs people do changes. \n\"I think in the future there will be new jobs that nobody has yet conceived.\" \nBut there are fears about the social impact of jobs being replaced by machines and how new opportunities and wealth will be distributed. \nAn exclusive Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) survey has found 30% of people in the UK think their own job could be at risk. \nA report last year by Deloitte suggested those fears are well-founded, predicting 35% of UK jobs are at risk from automation over the next two decades, with jobs paying less than £30,000 a year five times more likely to be displaced than those paying more than £100,000. \n\"We are at a dramatic point in the whole of humanity which is exciting on the one hand, but it’s also very dangerous,\" said Michael Osborne, co-director of the Oxford Martin School programme of technology and employment. \n\"What I find alarming is that those who will find the burden of automation resting most heavily on their shoulders are the least skilled, and hence the least equipped to head into whatever new jobs are created. \n\"We need to make sure that this enormous bounty that is created from technology is shared even with those who aren’t necessarily going to be able to find work in the workforce of tomorrow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T08:53:49.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
