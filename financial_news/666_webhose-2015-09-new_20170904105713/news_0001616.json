Chinese firms do not want to be exposed purely to their own slowing economy and wobbling share prices , and are instead increasingly keen to hunt overseas for businesses to buy. \nEstablished firms with big, respectable brands and a reputation for quality are favourites of both the Chinese consumer and corporate bosses when they are out shopping on Europe’s boulevards. \n“If there is a slowdown, it would be quite natural to accelerate the pace of acquisition of growth, and to do that outside of your region to balance your risk and your geographic exposure,” said Severin Brizay, head of mergers and acquisitions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Swiss bank UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) . \n“To date, we have not seen any slowdown in the requests we get from Chinese buyers looking at Europe, quite to the contrary.” \nHe notes that Asian firms have pumped six times more money into M&A in Europe this year than Europeans have into Asian businesses. \nFor the first time ever, the majority of mergers and acquisitions in Europe are coming from outside the region, as investment by business becomes well and truly global a development which is surely a boon for squeezed European firms who are unwilling or unable to splash the cash themselves on strategic deals. \nA key driver is the relative weakness of the euro , which makes the firms cheaper to foreign buyers, though they must hope for an upswing at some point in future as it also means their euro revenues are worth relatively less in their domestic currencies. \nOn top of that, European valuations are relatively low compared with those in the US, which has benefitted from a bull run on the back of the thriving economy. \nWhile politicians and sometimes even investors occasionally fret that Britain’s economy could be harmed by a high degree of foreign ownership, recent deals could suggest the opposite, particularly when China is involved. \nTake Italian tyre manufacturer Pirelli. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was acquired for $7.7bn this year by ChemChina, opening up doors to do business in Asia in a way almost unimaginable had it remained independent. \nDespite China’s moves to open up to the world, it is still difficult for foreign companies to work out exactly what is going on inside the world’s second biggest economy, making it hard to invest directly in Chinese businesses. Instead, foreign firms have to launch a greenfield development or invest in businesses that are already doing well in China. \nThe result should be more opportunities for a firm based in Europe, as well as a good payout for investors who sold up in the deal. \nPizza Express (NYSE: EXPR - news ) has followed the same route , using its new Chinese owners to expand into the market. \nHowever, the sustained surge of investment into Europe that the bankers hope for is far from guaranteed. \nFor a start, shares rather than cash make up an increasingly significant part of the payment in deals this year the cash element has fallen to a record low of 52pc. \nAs China’s shares take a tumble , it will be harder for acquisitive companies to use the stock to buy up European businesses. \nMeanwhile, investors who are used to benefitting from the roaring growth in China might not be impressed by the meagre GDP figures coming from the eurozone, and choose to invest in other emerging markets instead. \nAs China slows, India could take over as the fastest-growing big economy in the world , while Indonesia also offers an enormous population full of potential. \nThey could even stay in China regardless. Its current slowdown will leave it with growth of 6pc per year, compared with just 1.5pc for the eurozone. \nAlternatively, they could pick the US instead, where growth is at least somewhere around historical trend rates, rather than mired in depression. \nWhen interest rates rise it will surely trigger some movement of cash into Britain and the US, as returns increase and as monetary policy changes herald stronger growth. \nHowever, banks guiding flows of money from China to Europe and vice-versa caution that Chinese investors are not as swayed as their Western counterparts by short-term economic volatility. \n“Chinese investors tend to take a much more long-term view than those in Europe and the UK they have 5,000 years of history behind them,” says Peter Seah from Singaporean banking giant DBS (SES: 2N8B.SI - news ) . \nAs a result, he expects only minor changes in investment flows to come from either China’s slowdown or interest rate hikes in the UK . \nBut Mr Seah does think that Chancellor George Osborne’s visit to China will help: “Chinese firms like government-to-government links. It provides air cover under which private companies can operate. So this should build confidence.” \nThat confidence is exactly what chief executives need if they are to propose mega-acquisitions of companies on the other side of the world. \nPrepare for a new wave of Chinese businesses bidding for your shares (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:27:43.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
