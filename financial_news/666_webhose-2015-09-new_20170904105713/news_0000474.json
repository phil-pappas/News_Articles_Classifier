The previously announced non-brokered offering consists of 6,666,667 units of the Company (\"Units\") at a price of CDN$0.03 per Unit to raise $200,000. Each Unit consists of one common share without par value in the capital of the Company (a \"Share\") and one common share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Share at a price of CDN$0.05 per Share for 5 years. Bravada announced the closing of the first tranche of this financing on September 15 (NR-07-15), issuing 4,524,998 units for a total of CDN$135,750. \nAs described in detail in NR-06-15, dated August 21, 2015, the Offering was made in accordance with the provisions of BC Instrument 45-534 - Exemption from prospectus requirement for certain trades to existing security holders and in accordance with the provisions of various corresponding blanket orders and rules of other Canadian jurisdictions that have adopted the same or a similar exemption from prospectus requirement. \nPresident Joe Kizis commented, We are pleased that existing shareholders have subscribed for shares in sufficient quantities to provide funds for our Company to meet current sustaining fees on its Nevada based properties. Extension of the offering will provide an opportunity to shareholders to participate at attractive terms in the Unit equity raise as we continue to develop our Nevada based properties through joint venture agreements. The Company holds a portfolio of high-quality properties in Nevada, one of the world's best mining jurisdictions. Bravada has attracted partners to fund exploration and development on five of its 15 Nevada properties, and expects to attract new partners for several others over the next few months. Bravada's Wind Mountain project, for example, hosts significant Indicated and Inferred resources of gold and silver, and has exciting potential for new discoveries. The five currently partner-funded projects in aggregate include earn-in work expenditures of up to $6.5 million and payments to Bravada of up to $3+ million as cash and shares, with Bravada retaining residual working or royalty interests. \" \nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Bravada Gold Corporation \nJoseph A.
