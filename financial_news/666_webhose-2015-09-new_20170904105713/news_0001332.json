The coding change introduced an error into Latour's software.\nTrading firms are required to have direct and exclusive control of their financial and regulatory risk management controls.\nLatour agreed to pay a $5 million penalty, disgorgement of $2.8 million of gross trading profits and exchange-paid rebates, plus prejudgment interest of $268,564, without admitting or denying the charges.
