Andrey Rudakov Share on twitter by James Chessell One of the reasons investors reacted favourably to Glencore's plans to reduce debt by a third was that the Swiss miner and commodities trader's senior management had agreed to back their words with actions.\nIn a conversation with AFR Weekend chief executive Ivan Glasenberg says his hand was forced by investors who were preoccupied by a worst-case scenario. \"Investors were saying, 'We hear you, Glencore, but we've got to prepare for a doomsday scenario and we would prefer your company to be in a position where it could withstand anything',\" he says.\n\"It is clear that shareholders in the current market would prefer you have a more strict and tighter balance sheet than we are used to,\" he says. \"Shareholders have their view on doomsday scenarios and they want you to run their balance sheet according to those scenarios. That is the lesson we learnt.\"\nGlencore announced it would raise $US2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in fresh equity as part of the debt plan with investment banks Morgan Stanley and Citigroup underwriting 78 per cent of the capital raising while a group of nine top executives committed to taking up the remaining 22 per cent.\nThat means the senior managers, including Glasenberg, chief financial officer Steven Kalmin and copper chief Telis Mistakidis – who paid £46 million ($101 million) for an apartment in London's upscale Belgravia district in October – are on the hook for a combined $US550 million ($778 million).\nAt first blush, it seems unlikely they would have that kind of money lying around. Certainly there was speculation that the executives might have to borrow or take out margin loans to purchase the equity.\nHowever, it understood the $US550 million represents only a quarter of the total dividends Glencore paid them since its 2011 float.\nFor example, Glasenberg, who owns 8 per cent of Glencore, will need to spend up to $US200 million on new shares [the exact structure of the capital raising is yet to be decided]. Yet he has received around $US800 million in dividends since the float. Assuming he hasn't spent the money on superyachts and private jets – and it does not seem that that is the case – he won't have any trouble making the payment. Mistakidis's dividend cheques for 2014 alone should have paid for the apartment, so he should have plenty left over.\n \"Most of the senior management, it's not an issue for them,\" says a Glencore source.\nAll up, Glencore has returned around $US10 billion in dividends and share buybacks since its May 2011 float.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-09-11T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:04:48.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
