It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will start at £7.20 and is expected to rise to £9.35 by 2020 for all workers aged 25 and over. \nThe fact that Starbucks will pay the Living Wage to all workers will be welcome news to employees at the coffee chain, over half of whom are under 25. \nIts decision to extend the minimum wage to all of its workers silences critics who argued that companies who employ large numbers of low paid workers will merely employ more under-25s to avoid paying the higher rate. \nA spokesperson for the firm said: \"The company is ensuring the increase in salary applies to all employees and will not use lower rates for younger partners or apprentices.\" \nLidl announced last week that it, too, would pay the Living Wage to all of its workers. \nLast year, Starbucks boss Howard Schultz had a total pay package of $21.5m (£14.1m), equivalent to about 1,200 full-time baristas on the new Living Wage. \nMr Schultz is in line for another bumper package following the firm's 54% share price rise in the last 12 months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:04:40.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
