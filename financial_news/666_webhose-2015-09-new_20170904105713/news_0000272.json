Supplied by Michael Smith Richard Branson turns on the charm the second he walks into the Sydney airport lounge. The cameras are not rolling yet but the British entrepreneur turned adventurer turned philanthropist greets the line-up of cabin crew with an enthusiastic \"good morning ladies\".\nHe is hidden briefly in a cluster of blazing red heels and dresses as the star-struck Virgin staff have a laugh and grab selfies with the billionaire, who is clearly in his element. Dressed in his trademark relaxed style – jeans, an open-necked white shirt and leather jacket – Branson still stays at the Holiday Inn in Potts Point because that's where the crew stay.\nIt's only 10 in the morning and he has already been on breakfast television, where he snipped off co-host David Koch's tie, went on to launch a mental health campaign and will be on a plane in an hour to Brisbane to spruik a new Virgin lounge with the Queensland Premier.\nAt 65, Branson is not slowing down, although he spends most of his time these days promoting the Virgin brand or working on not-for-profit causes. He doesn't actually run any of Virgin's businesses any more. That is handled by a baby-faced New Zealander called Josh Bayliss, 42, who jokes that he has one of the best jobs in the world.\n\"Oh, I love you,\" Branson booms when Bayliss enters the lounge, clearly relieved his right-hand man has arrived to answer all the nitty-gritty operational questions.\nThe Auckland-educated lawyer is the global chief executive of Virgin Group, spearheading a web of transport, telecommunications, lifestyle, healthcare and financial services businesses across 34 countries.\nTransition phase Bayliss is also in charge of finding new investment opportunities for Virgin, which is in a transition phase as it redirects funds from 2014's Virgin America and Virgin Money initial public offers into new hotels, cruise ships and healthcare ventures, as well as pushing ahead with Branson's dream of flying tourists into space.\n \"Josh does the making-the-money side and I then spend it on the not-for-profit side. We overlap quite a bit,\" Branson tells AFR Weekend later.\n\"I still love life and being involved, love people. I do play a figurehead role for the brand and enjoy it and will continue to do so. But I will try to get Holly and Sam to hold my hand a bit more when they are not holding their children's' hands – they have three young children.\"\nBranson is referring to his daughter – a qualified doctor who works on business development and charity projects – and his son, who owns a television production company. They have three children between them. Both, who are photographed regularly with royalty and actors, are increasingly taking a higher profile but Branson remains the key to the branding strategy, which underpins everything.\nHis image as a larrikin adventurer has been fuelled by years of publicity stunts, the record-breaking attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon and attempt the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing, as well as the unashamed ogling of statuesque flight attendants.\nSurprisingly shy In private, Branson is surprisingly shy, to the point of appearing nervous, but on the dozen times I have met him he is always charming and up for a chat. He is said to be happily married but having an eye for the ladies and the high life is part of his image. I will never forget emerging from a lift full of supermodels at an event he hosted in London 10 years ago. \"Claudia darling,\" Branson hollered as he and Claudia Schiffer showered each other in air kisses.\nIt is hard to get a read on what Branson and the Virgin Group empire is actually worth. The Financial Times said in November the Virgin companies made about £15 billion ($33 billion) in the 2014 financial year but this is not a reflection on the value of the holding company. Virgin Group Holdings owns 27 per cent of the 12 largest Virgin companies by revenue. Another British newspaper says Virgin Group encompasses 400 companies owned by offshore trusts and overseas trading companies.\nVirgin, which Branson famously founded as a teenager when he opened a chain of record stores, generates income from royalties companies pay for using the Virgin name, which is the case in Australia for Bank of Queensland's use of the Virgin Money brand, for example.\nThe $US1 billion float of airline Virgin America in 2014 and $US2 billion Virgin Money IPO in Britain – which took place just 10 days after the fatal crash of a Virgin Galactic spacecraft – means there is money in the bank for new growth opportunities, and some of that cash is expected to make its way to Australia.\n\"It was an intense time for us as a group. Having brought in that new investment to allow those companies to continue to grow it gives us the ability to focus our efforts on the new opportunities we've got – Virgin Sport, hotels,\" Bayliss tells AFR Weekend in a joint interview with Branson.\n\"We will continue to invest in Virgin Galactic, which we very much believe in, both in the satellite business and the passenger business.\"\nBig setback The Virgin Galactic business is still alive, although 2014's accident was a big setback. There are no firm dates for the first space trips but bookings have reportedly recovered. Branson is also investing in satellites. He met Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull this week to suggest using satellites owned by his OneWeb venture as a cheaper alternative to the National Broadband Network.\nBranson, who lives on his private island in the Carribean, usually visits Australia twice a year but has not been here for the past two. After last week's whirlwind of engagements, including visiting a Kings Cross needle exchange as part of his increasing focus on social causes, he was planning to \"get the batteries recharged\" kite-surfing on an island off Noosa this weekend.\n\"There are great opportunities here. The Australian dollar is at an all-time low and that is an ideal time to get tonnes of tourists to come.\"\nBayliss says Virgin remains focused on Australia, the United States, Britain and South Africa more than any other countries. The most high-profile investment here is the 10 per cent stake in airline Virgin Australia. As well as Virgin Money, it retains an interest in telecommunications through the Optus-owned Virgin Mobile network and has the Virgin Active health club chain.\n\"We will continue to invest in and develop Virgin Active in Australia and use Australia to grow an Asia footprint,\" Bayliss says. Virgin Active has already moved into Singapore and Thailand.\nThere are also plans to capitalise on Australia's national obsession with sport – something Bayliss says he understands well growing up in New Zealand – by bringing the Virgin Sport business to Australia. Virgin Sport is a relatively new business being run by Mary Wittenberg, the woman behind the New York City Marathon. It is focused on big community sporting events such as marathons and triathlons.\nGrowth area Tourism is the other growth area, with the launch of Virgin Cruises and a new hotel chain. Virgin has opened the first one in Chicago and Bayliss says Australia is an ideal location for the concept.\nOn the burgeoning cruise ship business, which launches in 2020 with vague promises of \"making waves\" with something different that passengers really want, Branson quips: \"Maybe a big red ship will come into Darling Harbour.\"\nBranson is not for everyone and seasoned journalists love to criticise the endless stunts that generate so much publicity for the Virgin brand. But they still report on them anyway because the public can't get enough of him. There has also been negative press over his decision to live in a tax haven on the Virgin Islands and the Virgin Galactic crash.\nBut Branson understands better than most the need to innovate and reinvent yourself. His Virgin Record and Megastores were killed off by digital disruption, but then he moved into mobile phones early in the game. \"One of the advantages of being in 100 different companies is that if an industry is attacked, another industry will flourish. A lot of the money that went into kids buying music then went into them spending it on their phones,\" he says.\nA Virgin Group without Branson is harder to define, but for now the little-known Australasian at the wheel will be making a lot of the big investment decisions.\n\"I'm incredibly lucky to have somebody like Josh who is fun, delightful, pleasant, and has committed a lot of his life to Virgin when he could be doing any job in the world. I will forever look 20 years older [than him] though,\" Branson quips.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:04:33.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
