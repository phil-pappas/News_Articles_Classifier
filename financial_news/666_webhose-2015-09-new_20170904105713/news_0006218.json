Bangladesh's reserves crossed $26-billion mark last Thursday mainly due to lower import-payment pressure on the economy.\n\"We may provide foreign currency for big infrastructure projects through receiving the equivalent amount of local currency from the implementing agency so that it cannot create any adverse effect,\" Atiur explained.\nHe said the central bank is ready to provide adequate foreign funds for big projects, adding: \"We may easily invest $6-7 billion from our foreign exchange if it serves the interest of people.\"\nS A Samad, executive chairman of the state-run Board of Investment, on Saturday told business leaders from bilateral foreign chambers of commerce in Bangladesh that the government wants to invest $8 billion over the next few years in infrastructure to improve the economy.\n\"If the government provides favourable support like credit from banks or issuing sovereign bonds, then the private sector can come forward to invest,\" Masud Rahman, president of the Canada-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CanCham) told Reuters after the meeting with Samad.
