TSLA, +0.96% rose 3% on Monday as the electric-car maker sent out invitations for the official launch of its Model X. The SUV will roll out the Fremont, Calif., assembly line on Sept. 29 as Tesla's Chief Executive Elon Musk previously disclosed. An event is set for 7 p.m. that day. The invitation had no other details and showed a shadowed Model X with its distinctive falcon-wing doors up. The car is the third Tesla vehicle to be sold, after the discontinued Roadster and the current Model S sedan. The Model X is thought to appeal particularly to women and families with children and its launch has been slightly delayed. Tesla has promised a third car, the mass-market Model 3, in the next two years. Musk has said the company will start taking Model 3 orders in March 2016. The Model 3 is expected to cost $35,000. A fully loaded Model X sells for $132,000 without upgrades, while a base Model S starts at $75,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:42:10.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
