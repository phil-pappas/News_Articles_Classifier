The miner raised its forecast for gold production in calendar 2015 to a range of 380,000 to 410,000 ounces, from a previous estimate of 295,000 to 335,000 ounces, reflecting a lift in its Didipio mine in the Philippines, its Macraes and Reefton mines in New Zealand, and the addition of Waihi. It also lifted its expected 2015 copper production forecast to a range of 22,000 to 23,500 tonnes, from a previous estimate of 21,000 to 23,000 tonnes, reflecting increased output from Didipio. The company lowered its expected 2015 cash costs to a range of $US420 ($A590) to $US470 per ounce sold from a previous forecast of $US450 to $US530 per ounce. \"The inclusion of (the) economic benefit from Waihi not only increases our production but also further reduces our unit cost base,\" said managing director Mick Wilkes. \"Waihi is a solid asset in a highly prospective gold region that will generate significant free-cash flows and further insulate our business in a lower gold price environment.\" The company plans to look at ways to further reduce costs, and increase productivity and reserves, and extend the mine life after the transaction is finalised, he said. OceanaGold shares, which trade in New Zealand, Canada and Australia, on Monday closed at $A2.55 on the ASX. On the NZX on Tuesday morning, it lifted 1.1 per cent to $NZ2.86.
