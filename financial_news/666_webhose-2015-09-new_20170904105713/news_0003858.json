In many cases, the borrowers are forced into their lender's high standard variable rate, which costs even more. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) very wealthy borrowers who have a stable income in retirement are being told they cannot extend their mortgage term to allow them to repay the debt. \nThis newspaper is still receiving letters and emails from readers in their 50s and 60s who are in the same nonsensical position and who fear they will lose their home. \nRules were tightened in 2012 to ensure interest-only mortgages were no longer offered without a repayment plan, resulting in a major drop in the numbers sold. \nBut due to previous peaks in sales of the home loans sold to millions in the 1980s and 1990s the FCA has predicted waves of potential repossessions in 2017/18, 2027/28 and in 2032. \nGillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said interest-only mortgages had forced many people into a \"financial black hole\". \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) said: \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is good that rules around these mortgages have changed, but there are many people who previously took out these products and face losing their home. \n\"Lenders have to exhaust all other options when borrowers get into arrears. It's time to level the playing field so that interest-only customers get the same protections when their mortgages mature.” \nMortgage calculators \nHow much can I borrow? \nMonthly cost of your repayments \nAround 3.3 million UK homeowners have interest-only mortgages. \nThe loans were popular because borrowers only had to repay the interest every month, rather than any capital, so regular repayments were considerably lower. However the full debt must be cleared at the end of the mortgage term. \nIn 2013 the FCA called on banks to contact all borrowers with interest-only mortgages due to end before 2020 to discuss how they plan to repay, but only 30pc of borrowers responded. \nCitizens Advice said people who already have the loans need more support because they do not have the same protections as other mortgage holders if they fall into arrears. \nLenders should have to do more preventative work to help customers prepare for the end of their mortgage, such as phoning customers or offering face-to-face meetings, it added. \nThe charity said lenders should have to follow steps before taking an interest-only borrower to court, including discussing a range of repayment options, offering an alternative mortgage product, including extending the duration of the mortgage, and allowing enough time to sell their home for market price if necessary. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nnicole.blackmore@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:02:37.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
