( http://bit.ly/1iutQKj ) \nApple has said just a fraction of its customers have upgraded to the iPhone 6, suggesting there is plenty of room to grow this year. \nSales of iPhones accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the latest quarter. First released in 2007, it is Apple's best-selling device to date. \nRepair firm iFixit, which opened up an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus on Friday, said battery capacity was down \"a bit\", probably to accommodate the Taptic Engine. Apple has said battery life is unchanged in the new phones. ( http://bit.ly/1OxY5xs ) \nThe new iPhones use chips made by, among others, Qualcomm Inc, Avago Technologies Ltd, Qorvo Inc's TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices, Texas Instruments Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc. \nThe iPhone 6S houses NAND flash memory chips made by Toshiba Corp, while the iPhone 6 used memory chips made by SanDisk Corp. The 5s used memory chips made by SK Hynix Inc. \nLackluster offerings this year from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will help Apple stand out in the marketplace, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy wrote in an email. \"Over the long haul, the 6s will eclipse the 6 as Apple is even more competitive versus Samsung in emerging regions and is gaining share in traditional regions,\" Moorhead said. \nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus start at $199 and $299 respectively with a two-year service-provider contract. \nApple's shares were trading at $116.20 in premarket trading on Friday. Through Thursday's close, the stock had risen 2.4 percent since Apple unveiled its latest iPhones on Sept. 9. \n(Reporting by Pauline Askin in Sydney, Siddharth Cavale in New York, Julia Love in San Francisco and Supriya Kurane, Lehar Maan and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Writing by Lincoln Feast and Robin Paxton; Editing by Stephen Coates and Ted Kerr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:59:07.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
