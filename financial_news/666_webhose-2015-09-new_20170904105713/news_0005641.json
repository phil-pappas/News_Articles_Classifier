When it comes to China’s slowing economy, it isn’t always clear which U.S. sectors and companies are most in danger.\nFor instance, most analysts agree that a prolonged Chinese economic slowdown will impact Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.54% which counts the country as its second largest market after the Americas. But other tech giants in the diversified information technology industry such as Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, -2.99% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.40% are mostly immune given that the country represents less than 5% of total revenue for the sector, according to a report published Tuesday.\nMoody’s Investors Service analyzed how different industries are likely to be affected by weakness in China and concluded that metals and mining, oil and gas, chemical, steel, auto manufacturing and gambling were the most vulnerable.\n“Metal and mining companies are exposed both in terms of export volumes and the knock-on effect of lower prices. The oil and gas sector has indirect exposure via the impact of weaker demand on prices,” said Tom Marshella, an analyst at Moody’s.\nChina currently accounts for about half of the world’s metal consumption and that is particularly bad news for Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CLF, -2.75% which derives 23% of its revenue from China.\nAmong coal stocks, metallurgical coal producers such as Arch Coal Inc. ACI, -12.01% and Peabody Energy Corp. BTU, -13.14% are comparatively more vulnerable than thermal coal producers.\nThere are no rated U.S. oil and gas companies that report revenue exposure to China of more than 15%, but slowing demand for crude, liquefied natural gas and petrochemicals will adversely affect volumes, prices, and margins, the report said.\nOne potential silver lining for the oil sector is that China’s oil consumption remains well below the U.S.\n“China’s share of global oil consumption has grown to 11.5% in 2014 from 8.1% in 2005, that remains slightly more than half the level of the U.S.,” Marshella said.\nWaning demand for U.S. automobiles in China is likewise bearish for auto makers, especially for General Motors Co. GM, -1.93% which is the second-biggest seller in the country with a 14.8% market share.\nGM’s China business accounted for roughly 22% of earnings before interest and tax of $9.1 billion in 2014. Ford Motor Co. F, -2.79% which has a market share of 4.5%, reported contributions of $1.3 billion from its Chinese joint venture, accounting for 20.7% of its pretax profit last year.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:27:56.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
