We hope to soon sign these key contracts with the government which will enable us to then begin the next phase of project implementation.\" \nHe said just like any project there will always be unexpected challenges that Symbion is likely to face in Lake Kivu. \n\"Although much of the technology that will be used is standard in the gas and power industries, the methane resource in Lake Kivu is in itself unique. \n\"The lake also has sensitive environmental considerations, and Symbion is taking great care and attention to ensure our design complies with the Lake Management Prescriptions. Safety is always at the forefront of our decision making process.\" Hinks said. \nOrganizers said this forum has an important role in the transformation of Rwanda into a dynamic global hub for business, investment, and innovation.
