(HFF) announced today that it has brokered the sale of 210 and 220 East 22 nd Street, two adjacent mid-rise apartment buildings totaling 208 units in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park neighborhood. \nHFF marketed the properties on behalf of the seller, a joint venture between Broad Street Development and Crow Holdings Capital – Real Estate. Stone Street Properties, LLC purchased both properties for $123 million and assumed the existing mortgage. \n210 and 220 East 22 nd Street are situated between Second and Third Avenues, two blocks from the 23 rd Street subway station and within half of a mile of Gramercy Park, Union Square and Madison Square Park. The properties are proximate to the First Avenue medical corridor and the Midtown South office market, as well as numerous retail, dining and entertainment options. Renovated most recently in 2014, the properties are collectively 99 percent leased and have studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units averaging 519 square feet each. Some of the recent renovations include the lobbies, common areas and tenant outdoor space.
