The US currency touched three-week lows versus the euro and two-week troughs against the Swiss franc, with the greenback's outlook darkening after revisions in the interest rate trajectory for the world's largest economy.\nUS short-term interest rates futures jumped after the Fed decision. The December federal funds contract peaked at 99.775, its highest level in about 3-1/2 weeks. This implied traders see a 47 per cent chance the US central bank would raise interest rates at its December policy meeting. Earlier in the day, December fed funds futures suggested traders placed a 64 per cent chance of a Fed rate hike.\nCommodities\nOPEC is assuming the oil price will rise gradually to $US80 a barrel in 2020 as supply growth outside the group weakens, a slower recovery than several member nations have said they need. The average selling price of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' crude will increase by about $US5 annually to 2020 from $US55 this year, according to an internal research report from the group seen by Bloomberg News.\nStill, the immediate outlook is clouded by continuing oversupply.\nA glut of crude may keep oil prices low for the next 15 years, according to Goldman Sachs Group. There's less than a 50 per cent chance that prices will drop to $US20 a barrel, most likely when refineries shut in October or March for maintenance, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at the bank, said Wednesday in an interview in Lake Louise, Alberta. Goldman's long-term forecast for crude is at $US50 a barrel, he said. \"The last time we saw a period that was similar to today was 1986, 29 years ago,\" he said. \"We waited 15 years\" for oil to start rising again.\nUnited States\nThe S&P 500 and Dow industrials ended lower on Thursday, giving up a 1-per cent rally in a choppy session, as investors struggled to interpret the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on raising interest rates.\nIn what amounted to a tactical retreat, Fed chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference that developments in a tightly linked global economy had in effect forced the US central bank's hand. \"In light of the heightened uncertainty abroad ... the committee judged it appropriate to wait,\" Yellen said. \"Given the significant economic and financial interconnections between the US and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.\"\nFresh economic projections showed 13 of 17 Fed policymakers foresee raising rates at least once in 2015, down from 15 at the last meeting in June. Four policymakers now say rates should not be raised until at least 2016, compared to two who felt that way in June.\nEurope\nEuropean shares closed little changed on Thursday ahead of the Fed decision, with M&A activity on the radar.\nFrench telecoms group Altice agreed to buy Cablevision for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth $US17.7 billion including debt. Shares in Altice were up 0.68 per cent after gaining 13 per cent at the open. Phoenix Group rose 0.47 per cent. It had initially gained almost 3 per cent after confirming talks to buy Guardian Financial Services. The planned Altice and Phoenix deals came a day after brewer ABI approached rival SAB Miller.\nBankia and Banco de Sabadell were up 9.25 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively, leading Spanish banks higher and outperforming the market thanks to broker upgrades.\nWhat happened yesterday\nAustralian investors were optimistic ahead of the Fed decision, rallying strongly for a second day. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9 per cent or 47.9 points to 5146.8 , after earlier in the session rallying as high as 5193.4. The All Ordinaries closed 0.9 per cent or 47.5 points higher to 5171.2.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-quiet-before-storm-20150916-gjoila.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:19:45.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
