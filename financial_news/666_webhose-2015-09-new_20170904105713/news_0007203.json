Now they have to make sure they don’t drive people crazy in the process.\nDraftKings was the single biggest advertiser on television in the last seven days as of Monday: 5,800 airings for about $20 million, according to ad tracker iSpot.tv. Since Aug. 1, DraftKings has spent $81 million on ads that have aired more than 22,000 times, according to iSpot.tv. FanDuel, for its part, has spent $20 million on 7,500 airings since Aug. 1.\nENLARGE Photo: YouTube/FanDuel Both companies advertised heavily over the weekend as the NFL kicked off its season. With 28 national airings during NFL games, FanDuel had the most appearances of any brand, according to iSpot.tv. DraftKings had 20 national airings, and only Verizon spent more on spots over the weekend than the pair, iSpot.tv estimates.\nThe ad glut underscores the growing competitiveness in the burgeoning daily-fantasy sports category, where fans draft teams of players on a short-term basis in order to win cash and prizes, as opposed to seasons-long quests managed among groups of friends.\nThe risk for both companies is that the ad binge will alienate viewers. Indeed, many Twitter users complained during games this weekend that they felt inundated with repeated commercials.\nMatt King, chief financial officer of FanDuel, said that the company is aware of the pitfalls of ad wear-out, and that it takes into consideration feedback from customers. Still, advertising is FanDuel’s greatest expense, and Mr. King says the direct-response style TV ads are highly successful for growing the company.\nMr. King also said that FanDuel, which aired seven different unique spots over the weekend, would create new ads throughout the year to reflect how fans feel in different stages of the season.\n“The anticipation of week 1 is different from that lull period in week 9 or 10, and we want to have creative that reflects that,” Mr. King said.\nFor now, FanDuel’s ads have the same look and feel and are mostly about explaining how the product works — and how fans can win prizes.\nKate Sirkin, global director of audience and measurement solutions at Publicis-owned Starcom Mediavest Group, said that it is best to limit a brand to two or three spots in a single game. After that, “You’re irritating people and you’re wasting money,” said Ms. Sirkin, who has researched ad wear-out.\nDraftKings CEO Jason Robins said that, despite a few negative tweets, the advertising is working well. Since the week leading up to the NFL season, DraftKings began adding hundreds of thousands of new users per day, growing from 3 million users to 4.5 million users, Mr. Robins said. (A FanDuel spokesperson said the run-up to the first weekend of games was the biggest week in the company’s history.)\nThe deluge of ads is also relatively temporary.\n“This is not something that is year-round for us,” Mr. Robins said. “It’s a brief window where you can fish when the fish are biting.”\nSome of the Twitter backlash was a “good lesson learned” that DraftKings should mix things up with different kinds of ads, Mr. Robins said. The company only had four unique spots air during the weekend NFL games, according to iSpot.tv.\nDraftKings and FanDuel are able to spend so much in part thanks to massive recent investment rounds. Both are fresh off major funding involving big media companies: DraftKings recently raised $300 million and FanDuel scored $275 million. The pair have also signed advertising deals with major broadcasters, in some cases to close the other rival out.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KH831_fandue_J_20150915151141.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KH831_fandue_TOP_20150915151141.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-18T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T23:25:41.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
