Net (LSE: 0LN0.L - news ) debt totalled $5.7 billion in the same period. \nTatyanin said the company's priority was reducing its net debt and it would not be paying out special dividends or carrying out new buy backs in the near future. \n\"Every half year our aim is to demonstrate a decline in net debt,\" he said. \"In the long-term, we should have a net debt/EBITDA ratio below 2.\" \nEvraz's net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6 at the end of June. \nFor more summit stories, see (Writing by Polina Devitt and Jack Stubbs, editing by David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:50:12.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
