There are no inspections scheduled. by Richard Wakelin Do you remember when we were being urged to invest in properties in mining towns? Back about 2012 there was supposedly a mint to be made in Port Hedland, Karratha and Moranbah, where property values were rocketing 20-plus per cent a year and modest dwellings were selling for more than $1 million.\nBut just as the good times arrived with the mining boom, so have the bad times with the bust. Properties in those far-flung places are now selling for a third of what they brought a few years back.\nOf course, it's now too late to warn anyone who invested in these places at those elevated prices. Most of them cannot find a buyer at any price. A simple decision to buy in a mining town, one that was meant to secure financial security, has instead been so many people's undoing.\nIn too many cases they and their families face financial ruin.\nIt's a depressing story. If I were looking for a silver lining I'd suggest it was a cautionary lesson for the rest of us on not being suckered in by get-rich-quick schemes.\nBut I'm not that optimistic. And that's because I've seen this situation so many times before. The mining property boom is only the latest in a long line of misadventures. Think Gold Coast units in the 1970s and 1980s, the time share craze, houses in south-east Queensland, land banking, serviced apartments, buying off the plan for stamp duty savings, positive cash flow assets and apartments sold with guaranteed rents.\nSome of those ploys were more outlandish than others and many readers think they would never have been fooled. Perhaps not. But in many ways it is the more subtle schemes – the seemingly harmless-sounding ones like guaranteed rents and stamp duty savings – that do the greatest damage.\nFor every person who's lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in a mining town, there are thousands lured to invest in mediocre property who may not have lost much money but definitely didn't make any either, despite the strong growth in overall values in the past 20 years.\n What has been stolen from these people is the more precious commodity of all – time.\nMost of us have only a 20-to-30-year window to build an asset base. The typical victim of property spruikers usually loses 10 years from one dud investment. Some of that relates to the holding period for the asset, but it also includes the years they invariably sit on the sideline after such trauma.\nThe problem will continue to plague us. There are just too many unscrupulous people who do well out of these schemes and, sadly, always a ready supply of naive buyers.\nAnd I don't blame only the greedy spruikers and developers who knowingly market rubbish to the credulous. These people couldn't get away with it on their own.\nIt's also the cottage industry of hotspotting commentators urging on mum-and-dad investors to seek out and buy into these fantasies; these cheerleaders with their pom-pom analysis that is alluring but ultimately spurious.\nIt's also the glossy magazines that run the hotspotting claptrap and readily accept the full-page advertisements from the promoters.\nBut some blame can also be attached to more-reputable organisations for their lack of attention or care. Call it malign neglect.\nNone of the misadventures above required superhuman foresight at the time to foretell they would go wrong (hey, it was called fly-in, fly-out mining for a reason!). I include mainstream journalists who fail to submit these schemes to the level of questioning scepticism they deserve and also point the finger at government and regulatory bodies, which seem capable of addressing a get-rich-quick scheme only after it has gone wrong.\nRichard Wakelin is a director of Wakelin Property Advisory, wakelin.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:46:17.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
