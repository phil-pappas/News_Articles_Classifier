Chris Hyde Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow It's a suggestion that will illicit a response of 'tell him he's dreamin\". But acting Queensland Premier and mad North Queensland Cowboys supporter Curtis Pitt says it's time the National Rugby League acknowledged the state was the new heartland of the sport and moved the grand final north of the Tweed.\nWith the Brisbane Broncos to play the Townsville-based Cowboys in an all Queensland contest on Sunday – and after a decade of State of Origin dominance – Mr Pitt said it was time for a change.\nBut Mr Pitt, who is also Treasurer, conceded it would be hard to wrestle control of the grand final away from NSW Premier Mike Baird who is planning a $1 billion overhaul of Sydney sporting stadiums – an investment that appears conditional on keeping the rugby league grand final in Sydney.\n\"They [NSW] are going to be fighting tooth and nail to keep it there, we know that,\" Mr Pitt told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"But it would be remiss of me as Treasurer, or as the government generally, to not put our best foot forward to say we've got a great product in Suncorp Stadium. It's the best rugby league stadium in the world.\n\"We can't compete with the crowd size but it's as much about creating a great atmosphere at the game.\"\nAs thousands of Queenslanders prepare to fly down to Sydney for the biggest game on the state's sporting calender, Mr Pitt is also bemoaning the $30 million boost in economic activity which is flowing over the border to NSW.\n\"They will no doubt get a boost out of it but ultimately that's why we think, when the time's right, we need to ask the question whether it is still the spiritual home and whether it should be the home in the future,\" he said.\n The NRL grand final is locked into Sydney until 2019, but NSW Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres says the event is not going anywhere.\n\"The home of the National Rugby League is Sydney regardless of who plays in the finals,\" Mr Ayres said earlier this week.\nAs part of a much-needed overhaul of Sydney's ageing sports stadium, the NSW government is proposing to build a new 55,000 seat stadium at Moore Park, while the Olympic Stadium would be redeveloped in a $350 million push to make it better suited for rugby league games.\nMr Baird wants to keep NSW ahead of the game when it comes to attracting major sporting events. It is understood the NSW government will insist the NRL guarantee the grand final and at least one State of Origin game will be played in Sydney for the next 20 years.\nOther purists have scoffed at the idea of moving the NRL final from Sydney saying it would be akin to moving the AFL final from Melbourne – which the football mad West Australian government would love to do.\nThe American football or gridiron grand final, the Super Bowl, moves to a different city each year, but it appears unlikely the NRL would jump at that opportunity. That said, it did recently hawk a State of Origin game to the highest bidder, with the second game of the three-match series being played in Melbourne this year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:46:05.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
