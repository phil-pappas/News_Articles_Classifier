Fully operational Gigafactory needed,\" he said in a tweet. \nThe car will be unveiled in March 2016, and Tesla will begin taking preorders at that time. \nTesla currently only sells the Model S four-door sedan, but should begin releasing the long-awaited and heavily pre-sold Model X, a new gull-wing all-electric SUV, at the end of this month, Musk said. \nLast week a high-performance version of the Model S, the P85D, earned the best marks ever given a car by the independent Consumer Reports group. \nThe car \"performed better in our tests than any other car ever has, breaking the Consumer Reports Ratings system,\" said Mark Rechtin, automotive editor for the consumer group. \nConsumer Reports gave the P85D a 100/100 rating, topping the 99/100 rating of the Tesla S two years ago. \n\"Its significance as a breakthrough model that is pushing the boundaries of both performance and fuel-efficiency is dramatic,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:02:19.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
