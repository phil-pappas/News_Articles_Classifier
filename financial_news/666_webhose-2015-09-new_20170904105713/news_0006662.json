conduct.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission today said it was concerned about the way in which Woolworths and Aldi were presenting new grocery supply agreements.\nThe agreements program is part of the Federal Government's voluntary food and grocery code of conduct, which covers the relationship between suppliers and retailers.\nACCC chairman Rod Sims said today that the way the supermarkets had been presenting the agreements might give the impression that the supplier was not able to negotiate the terms.\n“We are concerned by reports we have received from suppliers that suggest that some retailers have not got off to a good start when it comes to implementing the code,” Mr Sims said.\nThe code of conduct requires supermarkets to deal with suppliers in good faith and prohibits behaviours such as requiring payment for food wastage on supermarket shelves — unless suppliers opt out of such rules or if a payment is reasonable.\n“The aim of the code is to redress the imbalance in bargaining power that can exist between suppliers and large grocery retailers by prohibiting certain types of unfair conduct,” Mr Sims said.\n“One of the purposes of the code is to provide certainty to suppliers, who are often in a much weaker bargaining position when dealing with retailers.”\nThe ACCC said it was concerned about the lack of detail in some grocery supply agreements about the circumstances in which payments might arise.\nIt said suppliers should not feel compelled to sign the agreements.\nColes, Woolworths, Aldi and Sydney-based retailer About Life have signed up to the code.\nThe ACCC said it had written to retailers about their implementation of the code and said it would continue to monitor compliance.\nWoolworths hit back at the consumer watchdog in a statement, saying it was “surprised and disappointed” that the ACCC's comments “failed to recognise our prompt actions some weeks ago”.\n“We engaged quickly and constructively with the AFGC, the ACCC and our suppliers on this issue,” it said.\nThe supermarket giant said some suppliers raised a “minor wording issue” regarding a letter offering to amend agreements designed to comply with the grocery code.\n“The wording in question has been used in letters to our suppliers for many years and was designed to avoid changes to agreements being missed or misunderstood,” Woolworths said.\n“Wanting to deal with this issue promptly, two weeks ago we changed the paragraph in the relevant letter.”\nWoolworths said it had re-sent letters to suppliers, and at the ACCC’s request, agreed to contact those who had already signed new agreements.\n“Woolworths considers that the code process has worked exactly as it was intended to,” the retailer said.\nThe company added the ACCC only raised its new concerns with the retailer late yesterday, a matter of hours prior to contacting the media.\n Watchdog probes Woolies, Aldi", "external_links":
