The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) \nBy Andy Home \nLONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Aluminium producers' pain is becoming acute. \nAgain. \nU.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . producer Century Aluminum (NasdaqGS: CENX - news ) warned last week it would begin shuttering its Hawesville smelter in Kentucky in October \"unless the current pricing environment substantially improves\". \nBarring some sort of miraculous divine intervention, the number of operating smelters in the United States looks set to fall to just seven from 13 prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009. \nAnd more cuts will have to come, given a consensus view, even among producers, that the aluminium market is both in current over-supply and burdened by the dead weight of legacy stocks from past over-supply. \nBut will Century (Shenzhen: 300078.SZ - news ) 's actions make any difference? \nAfter all, we've been here before. \nOvershadowed by its announcement on Hawesville was Century's decision in July to dismantle permanently its Ravenswood smelter in West Virginia. Ravenswood has lain idle since 2009, a reminder that producer pain is nothing new in this sector and a warning that successive waves of cutbacks have failed to correct aluminium's structural problem of excess capacity. \nThe uncomfortable truth for Century and its peers is that until something changes in China, there won't be much change to the \"current pricing environment\". \nLOCAL RIPPLE \nHawesville, which started production in 1969, has a capacity of around 255,000 tonnes per year, although it has been operating at around 80 percent of that rate since a labour dispute in May, subsequently resolved. \nFour of its five potlines produce \"high purity\" metal grading 99.9 percent rather than the industry-standard 99.7 percent, according to Century's website, although any corresponding \"competitive advantage\" has evidently been eroded by the collapse in aluminium prices. \nHawesville's closure is likely to have a ripple effect on U.S. supply-demand dynamics. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will increase further the country's already significant reliance on imports and more of these will have to come from further afield since traditional U.S. suppliers, such as Brazil and Venezuela, are also much diminished producing nations. \nIn theory, that should be supportive for local physical premiums. As the distorting effect of long load-out queues from London Metal Exchange warehouses in Detroit fades, the premium boom has turned to bust. \nOn the CME the September premium contract, indexed to Platts' assessment of the U.S. Midwest market, is currently trading at 7.1 cents per lb, or around $157 per tonne. \nThe loss of yet another U.S. smelter should, at the very least, put something of a firmer floor under that premium. \nWhat Hawesville's closure won't do, however, is change the global supply-demand dynamics. It is simply too small a plant to do so. \nMore will be needed. \nMaybe from fellow U.S. producer Alcoa (NYSE: AA - news ) , which still has around 400,000 tonnes of annual capacity under active review. \nMaybe from Russian giant Rusal (HKSE: 0486-OL.HK - news ) , which has guided, albeit vaguely, to around 200,000 tonnes of higher-cost capacity cutbacks. \nTHE NEW GLOBAL MARKET \nBut even if these two aluminium giants delivered on 600,000 tonnes of extra capacity cuts, would it make any difference? \nOnce, it would have done. \nThat was when the aluminium world was a different place, neatly divided into two \"parallel universes\", in the words of Klaus Kleinfeld, chairman and chief executive at Alcoa. \nThere was China. And there was the rest of the world. The two were separated by China's prohibitive 15 percent export tax on primary aluminium. \nBack then what giants like Alcoa and Rusal did really counted in the world outside of China. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , however, those parallel universes have collided in the form of fabricated aluminium products flowing out of China in ever greater quantities. There were 340,000 tonnes of such exports in July alone, more than Hawesville's annual capacity. \nAdding perceived insult to injury for producers such as Century is the persistent speculation that some of those products are not really products at all, just metal that has been sufficiently transformed to duck the export duty and qualify for a VAT rebate. \nOr, to quote Michael Bless, chief executive and president of Century: \"The simple fact is that the recent significant decline in the aluminum price is being driven by unfair trade behavior over which our industry has no control.\" \n\"Chinese overcapacity and the improper export of heavily-subsidized Chinese aluminum products have undercut an otherwise viable plant.\" \nThe problem is that no-one is claiming that anything other than a small part of those Chinese exports are \"fake semis\", as they have been nicknamed in the market. \nThe rest are \"real semis\". And they have reduced to rubble China's previous great aluminium wall. \nThe new aluminium market is a genuinely global one and one that is now dominated by China. \nThat's why the world is still awash with aluminium. \nNon-Chinese producers have taken some 2.5 million tonnes of capacity out of operation since the GFC. \nChina, with a brief interruption at the height of the crisis, has simply carried on adding capacity and kept on producing more aluminium. \nThe country now accounts for 55 percent of global primary metal output, almost double its share of output at the end of 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:09:54.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
