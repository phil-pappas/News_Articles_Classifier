If PM Modi has given a go ahead for this, though delayed, it is a step in the right direction even if it has political ramifications.\nTake Our Poll 18, 2015 9:35 am", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9083606"], "published": "2015-09-18T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:08:00.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
