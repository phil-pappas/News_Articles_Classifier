Illustration: Steven Moore by Andrew Leigh Two of Australia’s most significant leaders owe their careers to lucky losses.\nGough Whitlam missed out on being elected to the NSW state seat of Sutherland in 1950 by just 456 votes. John Howard lost the NSW state seat of Drummoyne in 1968 by 420 votes. In both cases, if just 2 per cent of people had switched their vote they would have sent a future prime minister into state parliament.\n“I think back how fortunate I was to have lost,” says Howard. “If I had won that seat, I might have been in State Parliament for a term or two and then would have lost and then people would have said, ‘Well, he was a lousy local member, that’s why he lost.’ And they would have said the same about Whitlam, that he hadn’t connected with his people.”\nIn each case, their failure to win a marginal state seat left Whitlam and Howard able to contest a preselection for a safe federal seat. The rest, as they say, is history.\nWhen former US president Theodore Roosevelt was shot in the chest in 1912, he was saved by the luck of having a folded 50-page speech in his breast pocket. Two years later, World War I was sparked after Franz Ferdinand’s motorcade took a wrong turn onto a narrow street, putting his car into the path of an assassin.\nPolitics, so often, has been shaped by luck. In Australia, long-serving premiers Henry Bolteand Joh Bjelke-Petersen only came to office because of the unexpected deaths of the incumbent party leaders. In 1966, Whitlam was saved from expulsion from the Labor Party by a national executive vote of seven to five. Neville Wran might have entered federal politics if not for a botched throat operation.\nLook across to the government benches today and you can see luck at play. Former prime minister Tony Abbott beat Malcolm Turnbull for the 2009 Liberal leadership by one vote. Joe Hockey won his seat only because popular North Sydney independent Ted Mack decided to retire before becoming eligible for a parliamentary pension. Scott Morrison won preselection after the NSW Liberal Party executive overturned the previous ballot by a vote of 11 to nine.\nFive hundred years ago, Niccolò Machiavelli argued that luck accounts for at least half the outcomes in politics. Today, we know that incumbent governments do better if it’s cool and rainy on election days. Candidates gain about 1 percentage point if they draw the top spot on the ballot paper. Those with popular first names and short surnames get more votes. The child of a federal politician is 354 times more likely to enter Parliament than the average Australian.\n Understanding the role of luck can change the way we think about politics, helping build a system that allows us to learn from failure. We do this in other spheres of life. At its best, our health system guards against the bad luck of sickness; unemployment benefits protect against the bad luck of job loss and farm assistance absorbs some of the bad luck of drought. Such policies are not just about reducing suffering – they also recognise the waste in losing the skills of the unlucky.\nSome of history’s greatest leaders suffered unfortunate setbacks in their early careers. But the bad luck that befell them ultimately served to make them more effective politicians. All of which goes to show the folly of a system that throws the unlucky onto the political scrap heap. Treat them better and they just might, one day, become prime minister.\nAndrew Leigh is an economist, Labor politician and the federal member for Fraser.
