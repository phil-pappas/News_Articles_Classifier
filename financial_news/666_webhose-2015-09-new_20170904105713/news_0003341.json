Photo: Getty Images\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens is expecting an increase in the US interest rates \"by Christmas\".\nAddressing the Australian parliament's economics committee in Canberra, Mr Stevens said he \"was not especially concerned\" by the prospect.\n\"A lot of people working in financial markets have never known anything but zero rates. But sooner or later it has to happen. \"\nThe US economy was well into recovery, he said.\n\"They've got an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy,\" Mr Stevens told the parliament. \"It's nine years since they last raised the rate and they went down to the current setting in 2009, so they've been down at zero for six years.\"\nAdvertisement \"A lot of people working in financial markets have never known anything but zero rates. But sooner or later it has to happen.\"\n\"The argument is that as the vehicle is speeding up, you don't need the foot to the floor anymore. This isn't jumping on the brake, but it is easing on the accelerator.\n\"There will be furious debate in the eight to ten weeks in the lead to Christmas as to whether they will go in December...There will always be one piece of data that says hold off, but in the end they are still going to have to do it.\"\nThe US Federal Reserve left its key funds rate on hold Friday morning Australian time, defying markets and many pundits who expected a cut.\nMr Stevens said the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee has two more meetings this year and that he thought an increase in the funds rate was \"probably going to happen before Christmas\".\nHe signalled that he wasn't particularly concerned about the recent slide in the Australian dollar to around US70Â¢ before a bounce on the Fed's decision, saying the dollar would normally be expected to fall after a period of sliding commodity prices and that was exactly what was happening.\nInflation was contained and it would take a very sharp fall in the dollar to push inflation up, he argued.\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660"], "published": "2015-09-18T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:37:46.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
