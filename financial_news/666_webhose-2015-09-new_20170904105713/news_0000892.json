Or bored to pieces with it? Either way, you're going to hear a lot more about the world's emerging economic powerhouse in the coming days. \nGeorge Osborne is in Beijing for his biggest trade visit to the country yet. \nHe has taken with him a host of financiers, chief executives, some cultural leaders and even one or two journalists. \nWe touched down in China's capital this morning to begin a week-long journey across the country, from Beijing and Shanghai in the east to Chengdu, Urumqi and its far west reaches. \nIt is all intended to set up what the Chancellor calls \"a golden decade of UK-China relations\". \nThere will be announcements about cultural exchanges and exhibits, new investment projects and financial deals. \nWhy all the noise? It’s all part of the Government’s attempts to try to boost its trade with China. \nFor despite the fact that China’s contribution to world GDP has risen from under 2% in 1990 to almost 15% last year, it still only accounts for 3.6% of the UK’s exports. \nThat makes it Britain's sixth-biggest goods export market, somewhere beneath Belgium. \nThe Chancellor is determined to push China higher. \nAnd walking around Beijing you can understand why. \nThis is a thriving metropolis full of increasingly wealthy consumers who are now finally starting to spend. \nThe Chancellor's hope is that they spend this money on British luxury goods. \nHowever, he is faced with a number of problems. \nOne is that Chinese firms are competing desperately with British ones for business on their own soil. \nAnother is that China has its own problems. \nIts stock market crash last month was a sign that the country’s economic bubble may be starting to burst. \nThere are some who fear its breakneck growth, fuelled largely by borrowing, could end in an almighty slump. \nThose jitters have not stopped the Chancellor’s long-planned visit. \nBut they are likely to come up repeatedly as he meets with Chinese leaders and businesspeople.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T11:07:32.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
