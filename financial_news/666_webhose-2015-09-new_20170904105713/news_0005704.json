Written by: Mark Henricks 09/21/15 - 8:19 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Nobody lives forever, which oddly enough may be a comfort when you are planning for a financially secure retirement. The only thing keeping you from needing an infinitely large balance in your r etirement account is knowing that you won’t live forever. But before you can realistically plan to have enough money to sustain you for life, you need to have some idea how long you’ll live. \nThe difficulty of making that kind of projection is part of the reason why half of people polled in a 2014 Wells Fargo/Gallup poll said they were worried about outliving their money in retirement. This is where online lifespan expectancy calculators come in. \nLifespan expectancy or longevity calculators are free online tools that use mortality statistics to generate estimates about the average length of time someone can expect to live. Usually, estimates are modified by risk factors, such as a history of smoking or family medical problems, that are specific to the individual using the calculator.

More recently, corporate pension actuaries employ them to estimate how to pay for defined benefit pension plans. Today, as individuals have become primarily responsible for funding their own retirements through defined contribution plans, they’ve entered individual retirement planning. \nUsing a lifespan calculator can be as simple as taking your next breath. The Social Security Administration ’s lifespan expectancy page tells you in a glance that a man reaching age 65 today can expect to live, on average, to 84.3, while a woman turning age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 86.6. If you want a more tailored forecast, you can use the Social Security calculator to enter your gender and birth date. The result is likely to differ little from the overall average. \nFor a more individualized look, the “ How long will I live? ” calculator created by a University of Pennsylvania Wharton School computer science professor asks dozens of questions about height, weight, race, education, family medical history and more. The intended use of the calculator, according to creator Lyle Ungar, is to show effects specific behaviors have on average life expectancy. Ungar’s idea was to help people decide whether or not to, say, quit smoking or start exercising. “In fact,” he said, “most people use my calculator for financial planning.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:11:53.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
