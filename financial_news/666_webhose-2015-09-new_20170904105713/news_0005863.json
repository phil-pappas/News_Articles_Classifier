It will initially go to a handful of states, such as California and parts of the Northeast, where demand for electric and hybrid vehicles typically is stronger.\nThe move, said Chevrolet spokesman Michael Albano, is due to a production change and a need to get Volt to the hottest markets quickest, a strategy employed with other vehicle launches. The 2016 version, which is beginning its production run in Michigan, will be sent to the handful of states.\nMr. Albano said production of the 2017 Volt was pulled ahead to get the model—equipped with more features—into the hands of consumers faster. The 2017 Volt will go into production in early spring.\nThe new Volt is re-engineered with several improvements, including more seating in the back row and updated styling. Among the more important changes is a sizable increase in battery capacity so that the vehicle can travel as far as 53 miles on a charge.\nChevrolet Volt sales have been tumbling as gas prices hover around $2.50 a gallon, with deliveries off 37% through August compared with the same period in 2014. GM sold 8,315 Volts through the end of August.\nThe Detroit News reported the Volt strategy earlier Tuesday.\nWrite to Jeff Bennett at jeff.bennett@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T02:54:30.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
