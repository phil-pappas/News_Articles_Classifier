During the first half, the new executive and leadership teams have been listening hard to colleagues, customers, suppliers and shareholders. \n\"They tell us there is a lot for us to do. \n\"The immediate priority is to deliver a better shopping trip to stabilise trading performance. Our six strategic priorities will then deliver improvement in the core supermarkets, where we have the greatest opportunity.\" \nThose priorities were: to be more competitive, to serve customers better, find local solutions, develop popular and useful services, to simplify and speed up the organisation and to make the core supermarkets strong again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:27:39.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
