China's takings jumped 34 percent in the same period.\nWhile foreign films still often top China's box office charts - action flick \"Furious 7\" currently holds the number one spot - Chinese movies have raked in 18 billion yuan so far this year, 60 percent of the total, Xinhua reported SARFT as saying.\nChinese blockbuster \"Monster Hunt\", China's highest-grossing film ever, is also likely to steal the top spot after raking in 2.4 billion yuan since its debut on July 16, Xinhua said.\nChina's box office lure has also led some studios to remove scenes from their films and add characters to help get past censors and appeal more to a Chinese market, stoking concerns of self-censorship.\n($1 = 6.3681 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Sunil Nair)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:41:25.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
