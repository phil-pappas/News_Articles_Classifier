These applications enable companies become both smarter and healthier, as well as helps them connect business lines as it relates to sales and services forecasting, capacity planning, and salary planning. “We are very excited for this expansion.“ said Anthony Hutchins, Senior Vice President, Product Development. “The introduction of these new applications is enabling OpenSymmetry to expand our footprint. As both developers and users of the applications, we not only have the ability to identify barriers early on and make adjustments to our own numbers, we are better able to serve customers, providing best practices to ensure the products are being used to their fullest capacity.”\nThe goal of the forecasting and capacity planning applications is to help Professional Service Organizations move to a predictable revenue model. The features include the ability to collect forecast and capacity requirements for organizations to get a holistic view, in real-time, view forecasted vs. actual targets and properly allocate and optimize resources based on forecasts and budgets, respectively. Salary Planning has HR professionals in mind. This tool provides a foundation of salary analyses to support reward planning initiatives. For organizations that are on the FinancialForce platform, the Service Revenue Forecasting and Resource Capacity Planning provides an easy way to view financial forecasts vs. actuals and resources against revenue expectations set forth by both delivery and sales. With planning season in high gear, it is imperative for organizations to move away from a siloed mentality and work together in order to reach success. By being able to connect the dots between Sales, Finance, and HR, customers have the opportunity to go close the gaps, finish the year out strong, and have a clearer line of sight into the future.\n“At OpenSymmetry, we want to make your life easier by simply removing the pain.
