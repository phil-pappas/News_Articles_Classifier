The Fiat Chrysler-UAW agreement may be rejected by union members in an ongoing ratification vote that has shown stiff opposition in early returns.\nIf the Fiat Chrysler tentative agreement is rejected by the company's 40,000 UAW members, the union will decide whether to go back to the table with Fiat Chrysler, focus on national talks with Ford or General Motors Co or call for a strike at Fiat Chrysler plants.\nThe union and each of the Detroit Three automakers including Ford, Fiat Chrysler and GM have separate national agreements covering all of its UAW members as well as agreements at each union \"local\" branch.\nThe local and national contracts for all three companies run for four years and expired on Sept. 14 before the union and each company agreed on extensions.\nSettles claims that Ford has not negotiated for Kansas City workers in good faith on \"issues surrounding manpower provisions, the national heat stress program, and skilled trades scheduling amongst others.\"\nSkilled trades, which include such workers as electricians, get paid a few dollars more per hour most production workers.\nThe F-150 is the best-selling Ford vehicle in North America and is key to the company's profit.
