Photo: Ben Mulligan\nPatrons of the Red Star Roasters Espresso Bar in Port Melbourne are being offered a glimpse into the future of urban food production with the recent installation of a new 12-square-metre vertical growing bed in a tiny four-square-metre space.\n\"Vegies produced in the Foodwall will be used in the cafe,\" says Marc Noyce, chief executive of Biofilta, the company that developed the innovative system.\nOur aim is to transform cities into catchments and food bowls.\nMarc Noyce While vertical plant and vegie gardens aren't new, Biofilta's modular version is no trendy gimmick. What sets it apart is that it has been designed for sustainable food production using the latest in \"wicking\" (self-watering) technology.\n\"Our aim is to transform cities into catchments and food bowls,\" he says. \"Within a tiny four-square-metre inner city space, the Foodwall can produce over 130 kilograms of vegetables a year. Due to its tiered garden bed design, it can provide three times the growing area for its given footprint.\"\nAdvertisement Water is stored efficiently so the plants can withstand heatwaves and use only what they require. The water level can be varied by a simple lever to grow a wide range of plants with different watering needs and an aeration loop keeps the soil and water healthy.\n\"The fact that it's free-standing adds to the places the garden system can be installed. It can also be set up to filter pollutants out of city rooftop run-off from going into food production,\" Biofilta director Brendan Condon says. \"We recently installed two stormwater systems in far north Queensland to protect the water quality of run-off from developments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\"\nThe company's stormwater harvesting and treatment system was included by Melbourne in the 2015 BlackBOX international exhibition in Milan, which celebrated 64 outstanding innovations to come out of Melbourne since the city was founded.\nNoyce and Condon first met when Noyce worked at Melbourne Water managing large scale wetland planting and revegetation projects conducted by Condon's other business, Australian Ecosystems. In 2009, Noyce contacted Condon to form Biofilta in order to collaborate on stormwater harvesting systems for installation in heritage parks and under roads to treat and store millions of litres of urban run-off for irrigation.\nBoth men share the view that more food needs to be produced within city limits. Condon studied criminology at Melbourne University, then changed careers, designing and constructing a large-scale nursery, community gardens and a sustainable housing development. Noyce, who grew up on a market gardening farm, studied civil engineering at Adelaide University then spent 18 years working across all levels of the water industry in rural and metropolitan Melbourne. He also led a stormwater design team for an international engineering consulting firm.\nBiofilta's stormwater systems are made in Australia and the plants for Foodwall are grown in local nurseries. \"The Foodwall was specifically designed to boost self-sufficiency in backyards and rooftops as well as community, school, hospital, aged care and cafe gardens,\" Noyce says.\n\"Fresh produce in a typical Australian food basket may travel a combined 21,000 kilometres – or more than halfway around the earth – from its origins to our kitchen tables. If we can reduce the distance to mere metres it must be a good thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:04:26.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
