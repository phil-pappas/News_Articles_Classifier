The level of radiation from the spill, thought to be around the volume of a teaspoon, is currently unknown, school officials said. \nThe cleanup involves setting up a perimeter around an area where radiation is no longer detected and then physically removing material inside the perimeter, said Scott Holmstrom, an associate professor at the university in the Department of Physics & Engineering Physics. \n\"One of the simplest methods for removal is the same as when you want to remove lint from clothing; you use tape or a sticky roller,\" he said. \nThe university found that 21 people were at risk for exposure and it is having those people evaluated by medical experts, the school said. \nPeople routinely are exposed to very small amounts of cesium-137 in soil and water, but higher levels of exposure can increase the risk of cancer, according to the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Environmental Protection Agency. \nAfter being notified of the spill, the university immediately restricted access to the building and contacted the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, which has since inspected the site and the surrounding areas, said Mona Chamberlin (LSE: CMH.L - news ) , spokeswoman for the school. \nTracerco officials were not immediately available for comment.
