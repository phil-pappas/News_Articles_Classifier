Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey It is going to be some weeks, even longer, before anyone really knows whether the dumping of Tony Abbott will achieve the desired result.\nAs intended and expected, the first polls have bounced for the Coalition. A Reachtel poll conducted Tuesday night had the major parties level pegging at 50-50. A Galaxy poll published Friday had the Coalition ahead by a nose, 51-49, the first time it has led Labor in well over a year.\nTomorrow's Canning byelection is expected to be a more comfortable victory to the Liberals than if Abbott were still at the helm\nIn politics, nothing breeds unity like success, or the prospect thereof, but there are still plenty of people grumpy at what transpired on Monday, and there will be more next week after the new frontbench has been announced.\nOne aspect of whether the Liberals can make this stick is whether they behave.\nAs Labor found to its detriment, there is no such thing as a clean kill, especially when the quarry is a first-term Prime Minister.\nIn this regard, the Liberals have sought to minimise the backlash by ensuring two key differences between the dumping of Abbott and the June 2010 dumping of Kevin Rudd.\nWhen Rudd was punted, the national reaction was one of shock. Apart from the political establishment, the mob literally went to bed and woke up to a new prime minister and were unhappy about it.\n Certainly, the people had started to work out that Rudd was not the person for whom they had voted and his poll ratings, which had been stratospheric since he became leader in December 2006, had started to plunge.\nWhile those who dumped him were of the view he could not win the next election and needed to be removed, the public had yet to reach that conclusion.\nThe second fundamental error Labor made was the way Gillard spun the coup. She told a stunned public that she had acted \"because I believed that a good government was losing its way\".\n\"I know the Rudd government did not do all it said it would do and at times it went off track,\" she said.\nAs her legion of detractors pointed out, Gillard had not just drawn a line under Rudd's failures, such as the mining tax, but his rather significant success of steering the nation through the global financial crisis.\nAt the subsequent election, Labor could not boast it had saved the nation and people's jobs from recession.\nNo such shock this time\nWhen Abbott got rolled on Monday night, there was no shock. If there was a definable reaction nationally, it was relief.\nThe West Australian reported on Friday that on the Qantas flight from Perth to Canberra on Monday night, the passengers, from business to economy, cheered as one when the pilot announced the coup over the intercom.\n(This column was reminded of the 1995 Australia Day test match at the Adelaide Oval when the crowd - including the Adelaide establishment in the Members' stand - erupted in applause when it was announced over the public address system that Alexander Downer had been replaced by John Howard as Liberal leader).\nAbbott's ouster did not come as a surprise because he had been very publicly on notice since the first attempt to dump him in February. It was made clear at that time that he would face another spill if he was unable to reverse the government's fortunes.\nSecondly, between tapping Abbott on the shoulder and the conducting of the leadership ballot, Turnbull explained why he was moving. The problem was not the government nor its policy direction, but the leader.\n\"It is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.\"\nAs coup co-architect Arthur Sinodinos said during the week, Turnbull was not looking for fireworks.\nBoring government promised\n\"What we want is boring, predictable, confident government,\" he said. Turnbull was \"a step towards regaining the trust of the Australian people\".\nTurnbull's core business is the economy . Yes, he will dump dumb policies like excising a section of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to prevent third party legal challenges, but otherwise he's not out to change the world, just fix it.\nThe progressive voters who have long been relishing a Turnbull prime ministership may be disappointed in the short-to-medium term. Politics is always about compromise and the man has had to sign a Faustian pact with fellow Liberals and the Nationals, the latter of which were on the brink of deserting the Coalition last time Turnbull was leader.\nThe Nationals and the conservative Liberals have made him swear off a price on carbon and to adhere to Abbott's view, and that of the party majority, that same-sex marriage be put to a plebiscite after the election. To the concern of South Australia, control over water from the Murray-Darling Basin will be handed back to the East Coast Nationals who destroyed the system in the first place.\nOver time, presumably, Turnbull will effect change from within. Rather than complain, proponents of same-sex marriage, for example, should consider that if Turnbull wins the election and there is a plebiscite, both the prime minister and opposition leader will be backing the \"yes\" case, maximising chances of success. No sneaky wording of the question, nothing else underhand.\nLabor is not panicking but there is trepidation. Clearly it would have preferred to face Abbott at the election. It did the right thing this week to try and damage Turnbull in the eye's of the progressives by painting him as a sell-out.\nIts strategy is to erode Turnbull's progressive bona fides and leave the Liberal Party right to eat at him from the other side. The opposition was encouraged by Ray Hadley and Andrew Bolt going to DEFCON 1 upon news of Abbott's ouster .\nUltimately, the fight has begun anew and both sides left Parliament this week feeling as though they had started with a win.\nPhillip Coorey is the Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent.\nRead next: Why Julie Bishop isn't the PM", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-18T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:09:35.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
