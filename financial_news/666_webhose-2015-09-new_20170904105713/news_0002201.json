The new series succeeds the \"TD62783 series\" of bipolar transistor arrays, which have found wide use in applications including LED drives. All four products in the \"TBD62783A series\" are scheduled to start sample shipments on September 30, and mass production will start in December 2015. The new transistor arrays are the industry’s first [3] DMOS FET source-output drivers. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150929005818/en/ Toshiba: a new-generation transistor array \"TBD62783AFG\" (Photo: Business Wire) Toshiba will also launch the \"TBD62083A series\" with a DMOS FET type sink- output [4] driver, successor to the \"TD62083 series\" of bipolar transistor arrays for applications including motors, relays and LED drives. All eight products in the \"TBD62083A series\" are scheduled to go into mass production on September 30. Demands from customers developing systems such as power supply and ON/OFF controls that combine source output and sink output products are increasing. With the launch of the new devices, Toshiba provides a DMOS FET transistor array for both output types. Toshiba adopted DMOS FET type output drivers to secure the high efficiency that customers need to cut power loss—DMOS FET do not require a base current, and can accept high current density per device area, keeping on-resistance low. Toshiba has also applied the latest BiCD [5] technology. The company has positioned this as the future mainstream for analog ICs fabricated on its standard 8-inch manufacturing line, the wafer size widely used in the industry for mass production. Main features of new products 1. High efficiency drive \"TBD62xxxA series\" transistor arrays cut power loss by about 40% [6] compared with the \"TD62xxxA series\". 2. High-voltage, large-current drive The absolute maximum rating of the output is 50V/0.5A. 3. Packages to suit various needs. Available packages are DIP, SOP/SOL for surface mounting and small SSOP (0.65mm pitch) for space saving. Applications Amusement equipment (pachinko and slot machines), home appliances (air-conditioners and refrigerators) and industrial equipment (vending machines, banking terminals such as ATMs, office automation equipment, and factory automation equipment)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:32:57.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
