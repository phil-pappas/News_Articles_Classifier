It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has decelerated further this year, increasing 7.0 percent in each of the first two quarters. \n\"We are quite concerned by deepening PPI deflation,\" Nomura economists said in a research note. \n\"Month-on-month deflation has worsened in the third quarter, which is consistent with weaker growth momentum.\" \nPPI is a leading indicator for consumer inflation, which rose to 2.0 percent in August, the NBS said, its highest in 12 months. \nChina is looking to move its economy from the investment- and export-led model of the past to one driven by consumer demand, and Premier Li told a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian that it \"is going to be a painful and treacherous process\". \nBut he insisted China did not threaten the world economy, and was itself buffeted by global trends. \n\"China is not a source of risk for the world economy but a source of strength for global growth,\" Li said, stressing that it accounted for about 30 percent of world economic expansion in the first half of this year. \n\"Given the weak growth of the global economy, China cannot stay unaffected and the deep-seated problems that have built up over the years are also being exposed.\" \n- No 'hard landing' - \nChinese stocks closed lower with Shanghai's benchmark composite index losing 1.39 percent. It has plunged nearly 40 percent since mid-June. \nCommunist authorities are estimated to have spent more than $200 billion trying to prop up share prices. \nIn recent weeks they have also lowered the yuan's value against the dollar and cut interest rates for the fifth time since November. \nBut Li said that policymakers would not be moved by short-term movements in the economy, while standing ready to take action as necessary. \n\"The Chinese economy will not head for a hard landing,\" he said. \"We have the capability to achieve all the major targets of economic development for this year.\" \nThe yuan would be kept \"basically stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level\", he added, saying that Beijing \"will not want to see any currency wars\". \nA key lesson of the global financial crisis was that \"quantitative easing alone cannot address the structural hindrances to growth\", he told the audience, calling for strengthening the \"real economy\". \nChina's finance ministry on Tuesday said it will adopt \"stronger\" fiscal policies to bolster the economy, including accelerating major construction projects. \nIn a sign of weakness on the consumer front, car sales in China fell 2.98 percent in August from a year ago to 1.66 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said, the fifth straight month of decline. \nThe consumer price index (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) rise was higher than July's 1.6 percent and the strongest since last August, driven by rising pork costs. \nThe growth slowdown and declines in commodity prices have helped keep China's consumer inflation in check, with some economists even voicing concerns about possible deflation. \nCPI touched 0.8 percent in January -- its lowest in more than five years -- but the measure has now risen for three straight months. \nJulian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, expected price measures to \"rebound over the coming quarters\". \nSteep falls in pig numbers will keep food prices high, he said in a note, while global commodity price declines late last year will soon lower the bases for comparison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:27:22.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
