Photo: Kerrie Leishman\nWe have recently seen a report by the Foundation for Young Australians claiming that between 58 per cent to 71 per cent are training for occupations that are going to disappear or radically change in the near future. In one sense the report offers nothing new. For instance, it argues that change in work is being driven by automation, globalisation and collaboration – a view popularly voiced by Dan Pink and Thomas Friedman in their books A Whole New Mind and The World Is Flat more than a decade ago.\nSome of the conclusions about the impact of technology seem on first reading to be unduly alarmist, but there is a big difference between jobs being totally lost to technology and those jobs looking very different. It is certainly true that automation has had a large impact on some low-skilled jobs. For instance, there are fewer car park attendants as automatic licence plate readers and ticketing machines become more common. However, not all car parks can afford to invest in such technology, and nor is the technology available in the foreseeable future that can do valet parking.\nNassim Taleb​, the author of The Black Swan, makes the point that most technological advances do not arrive on time or as predicted. For instance, the 1960s futuristic cartoon The Jetsons , had us all using flat-screen TVs and whizzing about on personal jet packs. Well, flat-screen TVs have certainly taken over the world, but I am still waiting for my jet pack.\nOther technologies that were as dead, buried and cremated as Workchoices, have risen like Kevin Rudd in a leadership contest to live again. My home contains not one, but two record players, and a lot of vinyl. It also includes a typewriter, and yesterday I bought a load of paraphernalia to develop black and white films. From a shop in Fitzroy only a couple of kilometres from the Foundation for Young Australians' headquarters.\nAdvertisement There are some conservative forces that can slow down or even prevent the introduction of technology such as legal liability and ethics. If machines take over from people who gets sued? The operator, the owner, the manufacturer? Jeremy Clarkson made this point in regard to self-steering cars. If confronted with a choice between unavoidable collisions with either a tree or a pedestrian – one taking the car occupant's life, the other taking the pedestrian's life – what does it do? Where the report is bang on the money is, regardless of precisely how quickly or extensively technology will affect occupations, we need to prepare people to be able to cope and even thrive on continuous and unexpected change and that such career education is required from primary school onwards. That is also one of the central messages of a theory of career development that I have been working on for more than a decade with my colleague Robert Pryor. It is called the Chaos Theory of Careers.\nJim Bright is professor of career education and development at ACU and owns Bright and Associates. Email opinion@jimbright.com.
