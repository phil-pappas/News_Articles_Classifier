DataLab competed against 340 teams, with a total of 2,355 algorithms submitted over a 90 day period.\nProvided with usage data and a set of fabricated non-personally-identifiable IDs, contestants were tasked with making individual user connections across a variety of devices. The foundation of multi-touch attribution is the ability to link multiple devices and touch points to an individual or household.\nAaron Davis, Chief of Analytical Services at DataLab, stated “We’re very impressed with the depth of analytical talent our employees regularly demonstrate. Competitions like this help us stay on top of our game and we thank Kaggle, ICDM, and Drawbridge for organizing.”\nAlex Aigner, Chief Operating Officer of DataLab’s Digital Division, stated “This is a nice feather in our hat amongst the other national analytical awards we have won. In the real world we do not build one algorithm but rather we create custom solutions for each client. Multi-touch attribution, while more difficult to implement and execute, gives marketers a clear view of their multichannel marketing efforts. This leads to improved campaign optimization and better return on investment versus last-touch attribution. For many marketers this is a serious challenge that we’re able to help solve.”\nAbout the Competition:\nAs the adoption and use of laptops, tablets, and mobile devices becomes more widespread it is now common for consumers to use multiple devices to complete their online tasks.\nIn doing so, the consumer’s identity becomes fragmented. This creates a challenge for marketers, as they are unable to discern when activity on different devices is tied to one user vs. many users.\nBy identifying which devices represent which prospects, marketers can deliver customized messaging at every stage of the customer journey and can significantly improve attribution.\nAbout DataLab USA:\nDataLab USA is a customer relationship marketing consultancy that focuses on optimizing multichannel marketing programs. DataLab has won more DMA (Direct Marketing Association) analytical awards than any other company in the United States.\nOver the last three years DataLab has been focusing on complementing its industry leading direct marketing solutions with audience based marketing from its digital solution areas.
