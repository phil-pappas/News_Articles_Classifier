The good news is that the MDGs have dovetailed into the SDGs. Some targets are now goals in the SDGs. This indicates that the unfinished business of the MDGs will be addressed in the context of the SDGs,' the Director-General stated. \n'One of the main lessons of the MDGs is that implementation and monitoring should be localized. This will ensure stronger ownership and better prospects for attaining the SDGs in record time,' he added. \nDr Christine Evans-Klock, UN Resident Coordinator, in her remarks said it was important to begin by recognizing that the MDGs had been the most successful anti-poverty movement in history. \nShe said: 'They proved that setting goals and sticking to them could lift millions of people out of poverty, empower women and girls, and improve health and well-being. They decreased misery and made it possible for millions to lead better lives.' \nDr Evans-Klock said the launch was an opportunity to take stock, draw lessons, and celebrate achievements and recommit to tackle the unfinished business of the MDGs, as Ghana joins with other nations later this week to adopt the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. \n'We are proud to celebrate Ghana's achievement of halving poverty ahead of time,' she noted. \nShe urged the government to take a critical look at environmental conditions because the nation is particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. \nAlso key economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and energy production were sensitive to rising temperatures, changing rain patterns and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, he said. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:39:13.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
