Europe's top economy is the fourth biggest producer of cars in the world after China, the United States and Japan. And it is the leader in Europe. \n- 'One in seven jobs' - \nSeveral years ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the one in every seven jobs in Germany were \"directly or indirectly\" linked to the sector. \nThe estimate is still freely bandied around today, even if it is a touch exaggerated. \nStrictly speaking, the sector employed around 770,000 people last year, out of a total working population of more than 40 million. \nAround a third of the sector's turnover is generated in Germany, while the other two thirds comes from abroad. \nCars are Germany's top export, accounting for 18 percent of the value of total exports last year. China, in particular, is one of the biggest customers for German cars. \nOn the stock exchange, no other sector is more widely represented on Frankfurt's blue-chip DAX 30 index, with the three big makers VW, Daimler and BMW, as well as parts manufacturer Continental having a combined market capitalisation of 225 billion euros. And it was even higher before the meltdown in Volkswagen shares this week in the wake of the scandal. \nGermans love their cars and they are particularly fond of German cars, which made up two thirds of all new registrations in the country last year. \n- A revolving door? - \nTies between the auto sector and politicians are traditionally very close, too, and Volkswagen serves as a prime example. \nThe northern state of Lower Saxony, where the group is headquartered, holds a 20 percent stake in the carmaker. \nThe regional state premier and his finance minister both sit on Volkswagen's supervisory board. \nPeter Hartz, a one-time advisor to former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder who gave his name to the swingeing labour market reforms, was a former head of personnel at the group. \nAnd more recently, former Merkel advisor Eckart von Klaeden, became a lobbyist at Daimler. The switch was the target of a judicial investigation but nothing ever came of it. \nAware (NasdaqGM: AWRE - news ) of the sector's importance and weight, Merkel is keen to look after its interests - too much so, for some observers. \nWhile keen to see herself as a \"chancellor of the climate\", she has argued against strict European emission limits, much to the ire of non-government organisations. \n\"People have known for years that the diesel models of almost all the large manufacturers pollute a great deal more than is allowed under testing, but the politicians don't do anything about it,\" complained Daniel Moser of Greenpeace Germany. \n\"The fraternising between politicians and the automobile industry is at the expense of people's health,\" he said. \nOther critics have pointed out the slow speed with which the sector has embraced the electric engine, which remains very much a niche segment in Germany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:45:13.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
