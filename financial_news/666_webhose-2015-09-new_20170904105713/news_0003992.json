Written by: Robert McGarvey 09/11/15 - 9:37 AM EDT Tickers in this article: AAPL TMUS T S VZ More Headlines America’s Best-Selling Luxury Vehicle Has a New Model \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Apple wants to cut out the middleman. That is the bottomline of its recent unveiling of two plans that encourage consumers to buy iPhones direct from Apple, not from mobile carriers such as T-Mobile and AT&T But one carrier - T-Mobile - has already fired back with what may be a sweeter deal. The other carriers - just maybe - are steaming about Apple's move. (Neither Sprint nor AT&T responded to a request for comment.) Start, however, by taking in what Apple is offering. In Plan A a consumer pays Apple $27 to $31 per month for 24 months and at term’s end, the phone is yours; this plan is a straight purchase-on-time plan. Plan B is more tantalizing. Buy the iPhone 6S for $32.41 per month, or the 6S Plus for $36.58, and you get multiple benefits. The phone is shipped unlocked - no carrier tie-in. The phone is covered by the AppleCare warranty. And get this: you can trade it in after one year for the next iPhone , no penalties. This second plan is really for the tech nerds who need that upgrade every 12 months to have the latest and greatest. Of course, the trade-in plan works only if you are a consumer who insists on having the newest phone and know you want to trade in yearly. If you are still - happily - using a flip phone or a Blackberry with a physical keyboard, stop reading right here. This is not for you. It's also worth noting that, separately, Apple's so-called recycling program will buy your old iPhone from you, in a separate transaction. The price is determined on a case by case basis. Even though you may not be able to trade in your Verizon iPhone to start Plan B with an iPhone 6S, you can still get some money back for your old clunker. It's also important to realize that Apple is not the only such game in town -- and in just about every way the T-Mobile Jump on Demand deal is a sweeter offer. T-Mo CEO John Legere unveiled the offer Thursday in his blog : “Starting this Saturday morning at midnight PT, you can pre-order a new iPhone 6s for an unprecedented $20 a month for 18 months with JUMP! On Demand – and iPhone 6s Plus is just $24 a month – both with $0 down. Of course, with JUMP! On Demand, you don’t pay a penny out of pocket upfront with qualifying credit – not even sales tax – and you have the ultimate flexibility to upgrade your phone whenever you want. Not once a year. Not with fees or waiting periods. Just turn in your working phone and start with a brand new one, absolutely whenever you want (up to 3x per year).” Note: Jump on Demand does not include device insurance. But that’s about its only lack. A variant, called Jump, provides insurance and various other perks for a monthly $10 fee. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:09:56.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
