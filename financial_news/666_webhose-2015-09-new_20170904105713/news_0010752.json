Wall Street was sharply higher on Wednesday while European shares and commodities prices fell as investors balanced strong U.S. economic data and interest rate comments with fears about China's slowing economy. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Photo: Reuters\nGlobal equity markets tumbled and the dollar was mixed on Friday after a US jobs report for August kindled uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in two weeks.\nThe unemployment rate dropped to a near 7-1/2-year low and wages accelerated, data that favours a rate hike when policy-makers meet September 16-17. But the Labor Department report showed job growth was a less-than-expected 173,000.\nAdding to the uncertainty, the report may be flawed due to a statistical fluke that has led to sharp upward revisions in the past to payroll figures for August after initial weak readings.\nWhether the Fed boosts rates in September or holds off for later, investors are preparing for an eventual raise, said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. A rate hike would be the US central bank's first in almost a decade.\nAdvertisement \"Regardless of the global dislocation for equities, investors still seem to be preparing for a lift-off in the fed funds rate. There's not a lot to stop the onset of tightening at some point in the near future,\" Wilkinson said.\nThe equity selloff suggests there is deleveraging as investors are forced out of positions they can no longer afford, while high volatility still \"hasn't been swept under the carpet,\" Wilkinson said. \"When the volatility indexes are running at those levels, be on the watch,\" he said.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, closed up 7.89 per cent at 27.63, or about double this year's mostly calm level until it erupted in mid-August.\nUS and European stocks ended the week lower. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 2.5 per cent to 1,392.63 points, and was off 3.0 per cent for the week. MSCI's all-country world stock index slid 1.65 per cent, and its emerging markets index fell 1.96 per cent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 272.38 points, or 1.66 per cent, to 16,102.38. The S&P 500 slid 29.91 points, or 1.53 per cent, to 1,921.22 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 49.58 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 4,683.92.\nUS medium- and long-dated Treasuries prices rose, while short-dated prices were slightly lower.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.1297 per cent, while the US two-year note fell slightly to yield 0.7046 per cent.\nEuro zone bond yields fell further following a strong signal from the European Central Bank on Thursday that it is willing to take further steps to shore up the currency bloc's economy.\nGerman 10-year yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell 7 basis points to 0.67 per cent, their lowest level in more than a week.\nFor some, strong US average hourly earnings and a drop in the unemployment rate to 5.1 per cent support the view that the Fed will hike rates when policy-makers meet Sept. 16-17.\n\"It's one of the closer calls,\" said Marc Bushallow, director of fixed income at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York.\nBut with US investors heading into a long US Labor Day weekend, lingering worries about China add to their unease.\n\"The market's confused. It doesn't know what to buy,\" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Trust in Columbus, Ohio. \"What markets seem to be playing today is a weaker China and a more hawkish Fed.\"\nThe dollar index of major currencies fell 0.20 per cent, while the dollar last traded at 118.99 yen, or a loss of 0.89 per cent.\nThe euro rebounded, up 0.26 per cent at $US1.1150.\nCrude futures fell as traders paid little heed to a drop in the number of US rigs drilling for oil, focusing instead on a supply glut and declining stock prices on Wall Street.\nBrent crude, the global benchmark for oil, fell $US1.07 to settle at $US49.61 a barrel. US crude's front-month settled down 70 cents to $US46.05.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:52:04.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
