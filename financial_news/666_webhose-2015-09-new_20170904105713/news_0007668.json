The price has fallen more than 30 per cent since the start of the year.\nIndependence Group, which mines gold, nickel and copper, zinc and silver from three WA mines, has seen its share price fall around 50 per cent from its peak in May this year.\nâ€œWe deeply regret the impact that these changes will have on our people and it is a decision that has not been taken lightly,\" managing director Peter Bradford said.\n\"These steps were necessary in the current environment,\" he said.\nThe miner said it was making the changes in response to weakness in nickel prices and to ensure its mine remained profitable. The moves aim to cut costs by between 11 and 13 per cent.\nIndependence lowered its nickel output target to between 8500 and 9000 tonnes for the 2016 financial year, down from between 9000 and 10,000 tonnes.\nThe miner said sustaining and exploration capital expenditure had been reduced to a range between $16 million and $20 million, down from an original forecast between $23 million and $26 million.\n\"While the Long operation is highly efficient operationally, it requires a higher nickel price environment to recommence the discontinued mining methods,\" Independence said.\n Independence Group cuts jobs, costs", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/independence-group-slashes-capex-costs-and-jobs-at-nickel-mine/story-fni0dcne-1227519095273"], "published": "2015-09-09T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:19:06.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
