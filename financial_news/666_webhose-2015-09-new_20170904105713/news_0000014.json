Now it's going after the tricky world of Obamacare.The new Affordable Care Act requires that all U.S. employers with more than 50 full time or full time \"equivalent\" employees offer health insurance to those full timers. Unfortunately, many small business owners don't have the time or expertise to know how to deal with the complicated rules within that mandate. That's where Zenefits is trying to become indispensable.With a new (free) ACA compliance tool announced on Monday, Zenefits wants to automatically generate and file the required 1094-C and 1095-C forms with the IRS. It's potentially a strong offering to help hook new businesses on its cloud HR software. The startup already has more than 10,000 small business customers, serving over 100,000 total employees in 48 states.“Zenefits’ mission is to make it effortless for small businesses to manage their companies and employees,\" Zenefits cofounder and CEO Parker Conrad said in a statement. “The biggest compliance headache about to hit small businesses is the new ACA rules coming live next year, so we decided to build this compliance tool that can take what could be burdensome and complicated and make it easy for our customers. And unlike our competitors who charge hefty implementation fees and a few bucks per employee per month, our solution is free.”[caption id=\"attachment_14573\" align=\"\" width=\"1469\"] The Zenefits ACA compliance dashboard.[/caption]Zenefits can offer businesses a free compliance tool, along with other free apps that handle benefits, payroll, hiring, taxes, and more, because it makes money as a broker of services. For example, when small businesses sign up for health insurance through the Zenefits platform, the insurers pay Zenefits a fee.[caption id=\"attachment_14574\" align=\"\" width=\"1469\"] The Zenefits ACA compliance dashboard.[/caption]Back in May, Zenefits raised $500 million at a valuation of $4.5 billion , vaulting it to the top 20 most highly-valued venture-backed tech startups. It employs more than 1,000 people now, up from 15 at the beginning of 2014. Its success has prompted new competition. ZenPayroll, a former partner with Zenefits, last week changed its name to Gusto , and plans to go head to head for new small business customers.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/zenpayroll-is-now-gusto-adds-benefits-to-take-on-zenefits/"], "published": "2015-09-22T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:09:00.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
