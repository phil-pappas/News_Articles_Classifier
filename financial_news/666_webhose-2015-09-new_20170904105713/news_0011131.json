Debit card purchases incur an average 9p fee. \nThe resulting loss to card issuers could reach £2.4 billion, according to industry estimates. \n\"All it takes is for a major provider like Tesco to cut deals for others will follow,\" said Rachel Springall of analysts, Moneyfacts.co.uk. \"Card issuers can't sustain deals any longer unless they pass the costs to customers in some other way.\" \nRBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) , NatWest and Capital One have already cut cash incentives paid on credit cards as a result of the changes. \nCapital One (Dusseldorf: 27078815.DU - news ) , one of the UK's biggest card providers, was the first company to cut its cashback deal. As of June, customers now no longer earn 1p per £2 spent using the card. \nAnd despite pledges that they had no plans to cut perks, both RBS and NatWest closed their \"YourPoints\" card scheme that paid 1p per £2 on purchases, taking effect in July. \nRBS and NatWest will also axe the 10pc cash paid on spending in some restaurants using a Cashback Plus credit card at the end of the month. \nTesco's 700,000 World MasterCard holders will be the first group of customers to see perks shrink, from November 1. The remaining 2.1m Clubcard Credit Card customers will see earnings shrink from December 1. \nIts Clubcard scheme and credit card spending in-store will remain unchanged, Tesco is expected to tell customers in letters delivered today. \nOne point is worth a penny, so in order to earn £1 on spending outside Tesco, a shopper will need to spend £800 instead of £400 as before. \nEarnings on spending in Tesco will remain unchanged. Customers with a Tesco World MasterCard, withdrawn from sale in 2013, will still earn 1p per £2 in-store, with all other cardholders earning 1p per £4. \n= '£14' profit per card holder at risk = \nCredit card issuers earn £14, on average, per year, from each credit card customer, according to calculations by financial consultants Simon Kucher and Partners (Other OTC: PGPHF - news ) . The changes have cut this to just under £10, the firm said. \n\"We use that income to fund the Clubcard benefits we give back to our customers,\" a Tesco Bank spokesman said. \"As a result, we’ve had to make some changes to the amount of points our customers earn. \n\"We are disappointed that the industry changes have resulted in the need to reduce the Clubcard earn rate on our cards when they are used outside of Tesco.\" \nJens Baumgarten, a banking consultant at Simon Kucher and Partners, said: \"Generous introductory rates and cashback offers will be under heavy scrutiny and will probably be cut back in the future.\" \n• Five tricks to shave supermarket shopping bills without buying basic \n• 15 ways to endear yourself to a mortgage lender \nBut EU policymakers have defended the policy insisting that it will save consumers money in the form of lower prices in shops. \"Retailers pass on the costs of accepting card payments to their customers by raising prices,\" a spokesman for the European Commission said. \nMs Springall, of Moneyfacts, warned that Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) 's Nectar points could be at risk as well as the generous 3pc cashback paid on Santander's 123 Credit Card. \n\"If they're using MasterCard or Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) they will be affected by the new rules and will have to think carefully about pulling these schemes altogether, or increasing charges,\" she said. \nSantander said its cashback credit card scheme is \"under review\" as a result of the changes. \nAmerican Express (Swiss: AXP.SW - news ) cards, which offer airmiles and 5pc cashback credit cards, will be unaffected by the legislation as they operate on a different payment network. \n\"But there's nothing to stop the legislation covering Amex in the future, which is a relatively small provider compared with MasterCard and Visa,\" Ms Springall said. \n- kate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:04:29.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
