Photo: Andrew Goldie\nEXCLUSIVE\nTelco giant Vodafone has stepped into the upper echelons of retail location with a proposed move to Pitt Street Mall to take advantage of the unparalleled demand for mobile phones and tablets along one of the most sought after shopping strips in the country.\nRecently the group lodged a development application with the City of Sydney Council for an outlet on the mall in Westfield Sydney, currently occupied by Wanted shoes.\nUnder the application, Vodafone has asked to erect signs of its name and characteristic comma, both facing the street and in the corridor entering Westfield Sydney.\nAdvertisement The documents show there is no objection from the council.\nOnce ensconced on the eighth most expensive shopping strip in the world – by rent per capita – the telco will be in direct competition with the other global giant, Microsoft, which has leased the store next to fast fashion group H&M at the King Street end of Pitt Street Mall.\nH&M Australia is opening the doors to its first Sydney city store at the end of October.\nThe new tenants along the strip reflect the changing shopping habits with banks, telco outlets and retail services, encroaching on prime retail, which was once the domain of fashion and footwear.\nKnight Frank's senior director of retail leasing, Alex Alamsyah said normally, it is not an ideal tenancy mix for Westfield Sydney to put two technology retailers on Pitt Street Mall next to international fashion retailers like Zara and Sephora.\nHowever telecommunication tenants can pay much higher rents than other retailers, so the return for real estate investment trusts and landlords is much stronger.\nIf the passing rent of Wanted Shoes at Westfield Sydney was about $1 million per year for 100 square metres ($10,000 per sq m a year), then technology retailers might easily pay more than $1.5 million a year for a 100 sq m store.\nIt is understood that this situation is also occurring on George Street where banks are committing to prime George Street locations such as Charter Hall's 333 George Street.\n\"Banks can pay premium prices for the right sites and right configuration, such as 333 George Street's double storey glass façade, but more importantly banks are the strongest covenant compared to any fashion retailers; even to any telecommunication tenants,\" Mr Alamsyah said.\nKnight Frank's director retail leasing, Michael Hanscomb said the trend of technology retailers and financial institutions dominating the prime locations is also true for Australia's other capital cities especially in Brisbane and Melbourne's CBD.\nThis has been exemplified in Melbourne with Optus' brand new flagship on the corner of Bourke & Elizabeth Streets at the London Stores Building.\nCBRE's head of Melbourne retail leasing Zelman Ainsworth said banks and telco groups are emerging as strong competitors for prime retail space across the Melbourne CBD.\nMr Alamsyah said the same was occurring around the world including Hong Kong where the big four banks, HSBC, Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, are fighting back against luxury shops for prime space in Canton Road, Hong Kong; some of these banks are paying a rent of $HK70 million to $HK90 million a year ($13 million to $16 million a year) on Canton Road competing with luxury retailers.\nThe 383 George Street Fife Capital site has also attracted a lot of interest from telecommunication tenants as it is located next to Apple and opposite Telstra.\nIt is rumoured that Optus, Vodafone, Samsung, Google, HP and JB Hifi are all looking for a spot in this prime location/technology precinct in Sydney's CBD.\nMr Alamsyah, who is the appointed leasing agent for both 333 George Street and 383 George Street, declined to comment on specific tenant names but said, \"a good landlord agent will put the right tenant in the right location at the highest rent\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:21:55.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
