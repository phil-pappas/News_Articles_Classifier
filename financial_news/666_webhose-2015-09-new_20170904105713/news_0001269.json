Alex Ellinghausen by Alan Mitchell Important reforms that could boost national income are being ignored while controversy rages over a proposal to protect small business against big business, the Productivity Commission chairman, Mr Peter Harris, will tell a competition policy summit in Sydney on Tuesday.\nThe reforms, recommended by the Harper review of competition policy, have been \"noted\" by the Council of Australian Governments, Mr Harris says in a speech to be delivered to the summit.\nHowever, there is \"no sign of any structured effort to promote the remainder of the report to the states and territories\".\n\"It is rare to recover bureaucratically from the fate of being noted by COAG,\" Mr Harris says.\nSo far most controversy attracted by the Harper committee review has been on its proposal to strengthen section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act to protect small business against anti-competitive behaviour.\nSmall Business M inister Bruce Billson was dumped from cabinet by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, prompting small business to accuse him of caving to the big end of town. Council of Small Business chief executive Geoff Strong said Mr Billson's removal was \"disappointing and disturbing\".\nGains small Mr Harris argued that the likely gains from the section 46 change would be relatively small.\n \"The rest of the report is where the scope for serious gains lies,\" he says.\n\"The degree of interest in section 46 as a totem for competition policy reform is actually pretty absurd, when considered in the context of the gains that may come from it,\" he says.\n\"Indeed, it probably is more a totem for how far we have fallen off the pace in national economic reform.\"\nMr Harris says the opportunities for much larger gains in areas such as human services and road transport have been identified by the Harper review, the Productivity Commission and others.\n\"Take health, on which Australia presently spends about $150 billion per annum, the Productivity Commission has estimated gains of up to 20 per cent in health budgets from applying known clinical best practice across the board,\" he says.\n\"More recently, Victoria University research suggests the gains from applying in Australia a known program to comprehensively address diabetes conducted in Finland would equate to 0.3 per cent of GDP, through increased labour-force participation.\nAgeing population \"This is a gain well in excess of any traditional measures to lift labour-force participation, and at a time when the imminent burden of an ageing population is becoming much more obvious.\"\nAt a more prosaic level, he says, the Queensland government has eliminated a waiting list of 62,000 for public dentistry by offering payment vouchers and allowing recipients to choose private services. And the NSW government is considering private provision of ambulance services.\nIn addition, the Productivity Commission, working with medical practitioners, funders and regulators, has also identified 22 efficiency improvements that could be applied by governments or private health funds to known system failures today.\nThe Harper review recommended cost-reflective road pricing with the prices subject to independent oversight and the revenues used for road construction, maintenance and safety.\nIt said other charges and taxes on road users should be reduced so there was no total increase in charges for road users.\n\"The electricity sector has learned to ignore consumers at its peril,\" Mr Harris says.\n\"Gas markets have exhibited quicker responsiveness to consumer interests. Even commercial water markets are now developing to some extent, as it proves cheaper to buy-back water than to invest in additional infrastructure.\n\"But in roads we don't even bother.\"\nMr Harris said the Harper review's proposals to apply competition principles-based thinking to areas such as health and other social welfare, road reform and urban planning, demanded a serious response from governments.\nThere would have to be \"serious detailed Commonwealth-State working groups with report-back dates and guidance from ministers and leaders if they are to ever amount to anything,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:49:53.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
