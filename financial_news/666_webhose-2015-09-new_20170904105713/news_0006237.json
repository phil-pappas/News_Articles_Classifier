(File photo: Bill Klotz) Top Projects: University of Minnesota Amundson Hall Gore Annex By: Marisa Helms September 18, 2015 7:04 am 0 \nProject Name: University of Minnesota Amundson Hall Gore Annex \nAddress: 421 Washington Ave. SE, Minneapolis \nProject cost: $30 million \nProject size: 42,314 square feet \nOwner: University of Minnesota \nArchitect: Perkins + Will \nEngineer: BKBM Engineers Inc. (structural), Affiliated Engineers Inc. (mechanical, electrical) \nIn recent years, the University of Minnesota has had to turn away applicants to its chemical engineering and materials science department. Demand for this fast-growing major was outstripping the department’s capacity in Amundson Hall on the Minneapolis campus. There just wasn’t enough space to accommodate the influx of new students. \nNow, thanks to the university’s 7,500 square-foot renovation and infrastructure upgrades to Amundson Hall, and a new, 42,000-square-foot addition called the Gore Annex, the department has enough room to welcome students and conduct research on polymers, coatings, and other materials used in industries including energy, electronics and pharmaceuticals. \nThe new Gore Annex houses office space, collaborative workspaces, and state-of-the-art research labs. The annex is named after Bob Gore, creator of GORE-TEX, who graduated from the university in 1963 with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Gore donated $10 million to the department for the expansion. \nThe annex sits four levels above grade, and is anchored by two below-grade levels. The second-level basement includes a tightly controlled room designed specifically for the department’s newest acquisition: an FEI Tecnai Femto ultrafast electron microscope. This super-sensitive machine must be isolated from any vibrations and electromagnetic waves that could be coming from the Green Line light rail line just a few hundred feet away. Inside the new lab, the microscope sits on a 35-ton concrete slab that was poured directly on soil, and a gap between the lab walls and the rest of the building mitigates vibration. \n“[The microscope] is as far away from light rail as we could get it and still be in the building,” notes department professor Jeff Schott. \nAesthetically, the renovation and addition have transformed Amundson Hall from a non-descript academic facility into a campus landmark and a showcase of materials science in action. For example, an old curtain wall facing Washington Avenue is now an expansive rainbow of changing colors. The effect was created by sandwiching 3M’s multi-layered dichroic film between rows of 16-inch glass fins. \nBelow is a gallery of submitted images of Amundson Hall:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:22:08.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
