Use your key for the next article Comment Photo courtesy of Provision Theater Company \nSince its inception in 2004, Provision Theater Company has produced a number of plays that have been nominated for Joseph Jefferson awards, including their critically acclaimed productions of Shadowlands, The Hiding Place, Cotton Patch Gospel, A Christmas Memory & The Thanksgiving Visitor, The Spitfire Grill and Beast on the Moon. \nIn its own words, Provision Theater is “devoted to producing works of hope, reconciliation and redemption; works that challenge us to explore a life of meaning and purpose.” \nOne of Chicago’s few non-profit equity companies devoted to producing works of faith, Provision Theater will open its 12th season with a world-premiere adaptation of Colin S. Smith’s ‘Heaven, How I Got Here.’ The play will run September 9 - October 25 with performances on Fridays & Saturdays at 8:00 p.m. and Sundays at 3:00 p.m. at Provision Theater, 1001 W. Roosevelt Rd., Chicago, IL 60608. \nI recently caught up with Provision's Founding Artistic Director Timothy Gregory and discussed the play. \nApril Neill: You have a history with this play. Can you tell us a little about your new adaptation and how it will be different? \nTimothy Gregory: This new version of Heaven, How I Got Here is expanded. The original play that I wrote, based on the intriguing book by Colin S. Smith, was a one-man show. Actor Stephen Baldwin came in last spring and performed it at Orchard Evangelical in Arlington Heights and it was very successful. I felt it could be even more dynamic if the cast was expanded to three characters and so I fleshed out a little more of the thief's background and created more dialogue. \nNeill: The play touches on a compelling question asked by many. Tell us about that. \nGregory: The play and the book ask a really important question: What if you woke up one morning knowing that it was you last day on earth? Heaven, How I Got Here is the story of the thief on the cross, the person closest to Jesus as he died. Very little is said about him in the Bible, so this play imaginatively fleshes out who he was and how he got there in a compelling, faith-building journey. It gives a first hand account of this nameless thief that had a front-row ticket to the crucifixion of Christ in one of the most dramatic moments in history. \nNeill: What about the cast and crew, how have they added to the production? \nGregory: The cast is really terrific and led by one of my favorite actors, Rod Armentrout. He gives a performance as the thief that is incredibly moving and powerful. In addition to Armentrout, the cast of Heaven, How I Got Here includes Kona Burks and Patrick Thompson. Additional production team members include Set & Light Designer John Weygandt, Sound Designer Ray Reyberg, Costume Designer Paula Kenar, Composer Dan Wells, Production Manager Annie Sander, Assistant Stage Manager and Wardrobe Supervisor Emily Svendson, and Stage Manager Sarah Knoke \nNeill: How did you get into directing? \nGregory: I started out as an actor but would occasionally direct if the opportunity arose. I made a living as an actor for many years. I got to work with some enormously talented people on some incredibly successful productions. I would observe everything directors would do and try to retain all the good stuff. Storytelling and the power of it to transform thought, feelings and beliefs was always interesting to me. However, as an actor, you mostly tell other peoples stories. You get hired by a director or producer and you tell what they want to tell. I had all these stories that I wanted to tell that, as long as I was just acting, would continue to be untold. So, my writing and directing came out of the reality of feeling compelled to tell all these untold stories. Some of these stories are original and some are adaptations of books. They include: The Hiding Place, Jacob, The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, Shaw vs Chesterton: The Debate, The Christmas Memory & The Thanksgiving Visitor, Anne of Green Gables and Heaven, How I Got Here. \nNeill: Timothy Gregory, thanks so much for your time. I look forward to following your work in the future. \nGregory’s world-premiere adaptation of “Heaven, How I Got Here’ will run September 9 - October 25 with performances on Fridays & Saturdays at 8:00 p.m. and Sundays at 3:00 p.m. at Provision Theater, 1001 W. Roosevelt Rd., Chicago, IL 60608. Catch a sneak preview behind the scenes of the play here . \nTicket prices for Heaven, How I Got Here are $30. Senior, student, and military discounts are available. Free parking is included, and groups of 10 or more receive 10% off (adult tickets only). Church groups are welcome! \nFor tickets, call the box office at 312-455-0066 or visit ProvisionTheater.org .
