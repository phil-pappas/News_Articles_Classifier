Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell The next phase of ASIC Registry's potential $3 billion sale is finally within reach.\nThe Department of Finance and adviser Greenhill are expected to call for expressions of interest in the next two weeks.\nIt's the second phase of the transaction and will be accompanied by an information pack for interested parties.\nRegistrations of interest were due on July 27 and bidders have been patiently awaiting guidance on the next phase, while the government works out whether it's a sale, a strategic investment or an outsourcing contract that is on offer.\nBidders are in the process of signing confidentiality agreements.\nOne issue that is expected to play a part in the auction is the government's preference for ASIC Registry employees based in regional Victoria to be retained.\nThe sale appears tipped in favour of strategic buyers; existing registry owners and database such as Link Market Services, Veda Group, ASX Ltd and the like, rather than the big financial investors and superannuation funds who are also scratching around.\nThe ASIC update comes as the government pulled the pin on ARTC's scoping study, as reported by Street Talk Online on Wednesday , to finalise its inland rail strategy.\n The government is expected go back to investment banks and lawyers for the tender later in the year, following work on a potential ARTC restructure.\nSources said it was a sensible decision, with the Department of Finance needing to consider more careful how to manage ARTC's likely sale.\nFinally,Citi handled a 2.5 per cent stake in Evolution Mining on Wednesday night at $1.125 a share, as revealed by Street Talk Online.\nThe 36 million share trade was believed to have been on behalf of Newcrest Mining and would take Newcrest's stake to below the 5 per cent mark.\nThe deal was done at a 0.5c premium to Evolution's close on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:04:09.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
