Jacquelyn Martin Instead, she warned investors to expect the Fed to begin raising its key interest rate later this year. She argued that stronger growth had reduced the amount of slack in the US economy, which meant that inflationary pressures should start building in coming years.\nSo far, she said, these inflationary pressures were being masked by the strong US dollar, the lower oil price and falling import prices which were putting temporary downward pressure on US consumer prices.\nBut she predicted inflation would rise towards the Fed's 2 per cent target as these temporary factors started to wane. As a result, Yellen argued that it was \"prudent\" for the Fed to move earlier , to avoid having to raise rates sharply later on to avoid the economy overheating, and to prevent excessive speculation in financial markets.\nBut investors are sceptical the Fed will be able to reach its inflation goal. In trading in futures markets before Yellen's speech, traders were only putting 35 per cent probability on an American rate rise before the end of the year. At the same time, a market-based measure of US inflation expectations dropped to the lowest level since 2009.\n Uncertainty about the Fed's next move has increased after the US central bank policy-makers last week decided to keep rates on hold.\nThe decision has roiled global financial markets, with investors dumping high-risk investments such as shares. In the wake of the Fed's decision to maintain an ultra-easy monetary policy, central banks in Norway, Taiwan and Ukraine this week cut their interest rates.\nMeanwhile, the turmoil in foreign exchange markets has continued, with both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real slumping to record lows against the US dollar this week.\nMany economists believe that the Fed is underestimating both the extent to which the US economy will be hurt by slowing demand in offshore markets, and the strength of the deflationary pressures now sweeping through global markets.\nAs a result, they argue that, instead of raising rates, the US central bank will soon be forced to restart its controversial bond-buying program in an effort to support US economic activity.\nBut some worry that central banks may adopt even more controversial methods in an attempt to encourage people to boost their spending.\nAnd their fears gained after the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, raised the prospect of abolishing cash altogether, and replacing it with a government-backed digital currency on which negative interest rates can be charged.\nHaldane warned the global economy could be slipping into a \"third phase\" of the economic crisis that started in 2008. In order to boost activity, central banks would want to stimulate spending by cutting interest rates even further.\nThe problem is interest rates are already close to zero in most major developed countries, and if central banks introduced negative interest rates – which amounts to a charge on people who hold money in the banks – people would turn their deposits into cash.\nA solution to this would be to introduce a government-backed electronic wallet, which, Haldane argued \"would allow negative interest rates to be levied on currency easily and speedily\".\nHaldane's proposal drew a negative reaction from many commentators, who saw it as a form of financial tyranny. But in a world where even normally staid central bankers are openly speculating about how best to impose negative interest rates on savers, it's little wonder that investors are finding a fresh attraction in traditional safe havens such as gold and bitcoins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:07:42.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
