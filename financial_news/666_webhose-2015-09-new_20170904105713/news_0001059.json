Sean Davey by Sally Rose The head of the government's financial system inquiry, David Murray, has called on the new Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to abandon his predecessor's pledge not to touch superannuation tax breaks for the rich.\nThe current framework for superannuation tax concessions was \"particularly harmful\" to low income people, he said.\n\"In order to deliver value to the Australians in the superannuation system, policymakers will have to come to grips with the fact it doesn't deliver the value it should, given the vast amount of money people are putting into it via contributions and as a taxpayers\".\nHe added, \"Not only do those people with the lowest balances in the super system get no value from the tax concessions, but as taxpayers they are giving back into that system.\"\nBusiness leaders have urged the new Prime Minister to re-consider the Coalition's stance to not tighten tax concessions available to those with high superannuation balances .\nThe Business Council's chief executive Jennifer Westacott said \"It is critical is that the government commits to everything remaining on the table and that the tax policy taken to the next election is comprehensive, because cherry picking reforms will not solve our challenges.\"\nWhen Mr Turnbull ousted former Prime Minister Abbott in the Liberal party leadership spill on Monday evening it delayed a cabinet meeting that had been poised to rubber stamp the government's formal response to Mr Murray's inquiry .\nThe inquiry has called for a comprehensive review of retirement incomes policy, changes superannuation and other welfare policy together.\n Mr Abbott and then Treasurer Joe Hockey were criticised for pre-empting the findings of the inquiry, and the government's tax whitepaper, by repeatedly promising \"no adverse or unexpected changes to superannuation\".\nWhen asked whether he wanted Mr Turnbull to demonstrate he was more open to considering reform of the tax concessions on super Mr Murray said: \"There is value missing from the super system. To fix that someone, sometime, is going to have to rule it in rather than out\".\nPatricia Pascuzzo who heads up the Committee for Sustainable Retirement Incomes, a group formed to support the implementation of Mr Murray's recommendations in relation to retirement incomes policy, was more direct.\n\"I urge Prime Minister Turnbull to use this pre-election period to talk about what a cohesive retirement incomes system might look like\", she said.\nThere was widespread agreement among stakeholders at the National Reform Summit last month that Australia needs a proper review of the entire retirement income system, including pension and superannuation taxes.\n\"By reforming superannuation tax concessions for the wealthy, the Turnbull government could deliver a fairer system and and save billions of dollars,\" Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney said.\nSuper tax concessions cost the budget around $35 billion a year, with this cost rising as the baby boomer generation enters retirement.\n\"The change in leadership provides a fresh opportunity for the government to take recommendations from the tax whitepaper process to the next election,\" Australian Council of Social Services chief executive Cassandra Goldie said.\nSpeaking at a GST conference in Canberra on Wednesday, Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg sought to dampen expectations of a major policy shift in superannuation policy under the Turnbull government .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:53:49.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
