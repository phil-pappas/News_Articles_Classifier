The school was also in dire need of tables and chairs as many students were forced to sit on the bare floor in the open. \nAs part of their Shelter 4 Education initiative, the management team of Tigo organized a way to respond to the school's needs. The community has not only received a brand new school block, but a headmaster's office, staff common room, public place of convenience, free school uniforms, exercise books and other learning materials. \nAt the handing over ceremony, the Kontihene of Ejura, Nana Odiasempa Antwi the II, commended the effort of the company for not only bringing to light the plight of the school, but coming to its aid in such a profound way. He tasked management of the school to carefully maintain the project for future generations. \nThe Director of Corporate Communications and CSR for Tigo, Mrs. Gifty Bingley, said the project forms part of their focus on education for 2015. \n'We believe that the future belongs to children and education holds the key to success for every nation. That is why we are creating a conducive learning environment for them now in order to make a positive difference in their future', she added. \nMrs. Bingley stressed that the Shelter 4 Education project initiative in deprived communities is Tigo's way of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning across the length and breadth of the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:40:47.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
