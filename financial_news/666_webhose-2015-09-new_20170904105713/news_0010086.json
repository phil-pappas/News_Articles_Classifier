It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) doesn't know what to buy,\" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Trust in Columbus (Copenhagen: COLUM.CO - news ) , Ohio. \"What markets seem to be playing today is a weaker China and a more hawkish Fed.\" \nThe U.S. dollar index of major currencies fell 0.20 percent, while the dollar last traded at 118.99 yen, or a loss of 0.89 percent against the yen. The euro edged up 0.26 percent at $1.1150. \nExpectations of a September rate hike by the Fed have waned as a slowdown in China has brought increased market volatility across asset classes, causing the U.S. dollar's rally of the past year to wane. \nCrude oil futures fell as traders paid little heed to a drop in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for oil, focusing instead on this year's ongoing supply glut. \nBrent crude, the global benchmark for oil, fell $1.07 to settle at $49.61 a barrel. U.S. crude's front-month settled down 70 cents to $46.05. \n\"Oil is only the beginning of this story,\" Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, noted this week. \n\"In fact, the value that producers of oil, gas, metals, minerals and other commodities have lost just in the past year comes to about $2 trillion, the size of India's entire economy,\" he said. \n\"China by itself accounted for about 17 percent of the world's overall GDP in 2014, but its demand for imports has already fallen 14.6 percent over the first seven months of 2015.\" \nThe Reuters commodity index ended down 0.9 percent Friday and is down 14.0 percent for the year to date.
