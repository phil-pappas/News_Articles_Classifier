We believe that this would help the developers and the Ghanaian community,' Mr. Owusu-Kyerematen stated. \nHe added that the Vodafone Appstore has developer portals at the backend where developers could access and publish their apps, adding that Vodafone would conduct checks to ensure that the apps met all the required standards before there are finally published. \nAccording to him, subscribers who use the Vodafone Appstore would also have the opportunity to participate in contests and win numerous prizes including smart phones and free data bundles. \n'Consumers' needs are increasingly becoming very sophisticated and as a company we have made it our business to always be ahead of the competition in ensuring that customers are truly satisfied,' he noted. \nAkuaOdoom, Head of MEST, encouraged developers, including students of MEST to take advantage of opportunities offered by Vodafone to showcase their technological capabilities. \nThe Vodafone Appstore is accessible on all major mobile platforms like Windows, IOS, Android and Java, among others. \nTo access the appstore, smartphone users would have to visit appstore.vodafone.com.gh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:02:51.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
