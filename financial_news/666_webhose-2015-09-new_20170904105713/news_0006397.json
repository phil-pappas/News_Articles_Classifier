Charles Schumer, D-New York, says in a statement released early Sunday that the FTC, which is reviewing its regulations on eyeglasses, should require eyecare providers to give complete eyeglass prescription information to consumers. Schumer says consumers could then use this information to shop around for the best deals on glasses.\nSchumer is also calling for the FTC to require eyecare providers to verify information about a prescription to third-party sellers in a reasonable amount of time.\nHe adds that the FTC should pass a rule mandating that the prescriptions last longer than one year, a move Schumer says would give consumers more time to shop.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
