The 2068 offering will price as early as Tuesday, Vatsala Datta, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London, wrote in a Sept. 17 client note.\nWhile primary dealers have been reducing bids at bond auctions, orders at sales conducted through banks have consistently outstripped the amounts actually sold since 2009, data from the DMO show.\n“They never seem to have trouble covering the whole book and usually they sell more than they were initially intending,” said Jason Simpson, a London-based fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA, one of the primary dealers which trade directly with the DMO. “There’ve been no issues with the syndicated method of distribution of bonds.”\nThe average order book in gilt syndications has been 13.5 billion pounds ($21 billion) so far this fiscal year, on track to exceed the 14 billion pounds in 2014-15, according to the DMO.\nFalling Demand Auctions have meanwhile seen deteriorating appetite. The bid-to-cover ratio -- a gauge of demand relative to the amounts allotted -- fell to an average of 1.59 times this year, DMO data show. That’s the lowest since at least 2008-2009 and partly reflects changes in regulations that have made banks more reluctant to buy large amounts at auction. The data cover auctions of both conventional and index-linked bonds across all maturities.\nForeign investors remain keen buyers of U.K. debt, despite the prospect of an interest-rate increase by the Bank of England. Higher rates tend to reduce the allure of the fixed payments offered by bonds.\nOverseas money managers bought a net 13.3 billion pounds of gilts in July, the most since they took on 14.8 billion in March, according to BOE data.\nHaven Appeal Demand was underpinned by the rout in emerging markets and China’s surprise devaluation last month, which fueled a flight to safer assets.\nLong-dated gilts have generated strong appetite. An offering of securities due 2068 sold in July attracted record demand for an ultra-long gilt offering, with more than 15 billion pounds of orders received for the 4 billion-pound transaction, DMO Chief Executive Robert Stheeman said at the time.\nAs for this week’s sale, linkers have proved to be a solid bet this year.\nU.K. inflation-linked bonds with maturities of at least 15 years have earned investors 4.9 percent so far in 2015, compared with a 1.1 percent gain across the gilt market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:30:01.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
