About one in five of all airliners currently flying in the US is made by Airbus but the company wants this figure to rise to more than half, in line with its share of the global market. \n= 'American manufacturer' = \n“Airbus is now a truly American manufacturer,” said Fabrice Brégier, president and chief executive of the business. “This is the most significant and game-changing event in US aerospace in decades.” \nThe plant has 260 staff at the moment working on the first two aircraft to be produced there, but staff levels at Mobile will rise to more than 1,000 by the end of 2017, when it will produce one new A320 a week. All these aircraft will go to US customers. \nDespite the expense of establishing itself in Alabama, Airbus denied that location was a major selling point for customers. \nBarry Ecclestone, the British president of Airbus Americas, said setting up in Mobile had had a “very positive impact” on US airlines looking to buy new jets but added: “It’s difficult to know if we have secured an order because the airliners will be built in Mobile. We have had customers who are very excited to be able to say the aircraft will be built in Mobile when they announced the order. \n“In a dead heat where all the other factors are the same, an airline that might have traditionally gone Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) could be picking us because our aircraft will be built in Alabama.” \nThe company brushed off concerns about the extra costs and time incurred by shipping major components to Alabama in order to assemble its planes. \n“We will manage; we know how to have a competitive final assembly line,\" said Mr Brégier. \"When we put it all together - exchange rates, efficiencies, salary costs, budget costs - they are all part of our competitiveness.” \nAirbus has gained incentives including $150m in tax breaks and staff training paid for by the local authorities, but Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus Americas, said this was not a major factor in the decision to locate in Mobile. \n= Defence = \nAirbus had previously earmarked Mobile for production of air-to-air refuelling tankers when the company won the contract to build the jets for the US air force in 2008, but this decision was latter reversed, with Boeing being selected for the huge deal. \nBeginning production in the US would create leverage for Airbus should it try to access the lucrative US defence market, Mr McArtor added. \n“Having industrial capacity in the US clearly gives us an advantage,” he said. “It gives us political cachet on Capitol Hill and it makes a big difference having your flagpole planted here.” \nBut he denied Mobile signalled a stepping up in the fight between Airbus and Boeing. \n“This in not about poking a finger in Boeing’s eye,” he said. “[Mobile] is an opportunity for us. Our strategy is not driven by what Boeing does or is perceived to be doing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T19:08:25.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
