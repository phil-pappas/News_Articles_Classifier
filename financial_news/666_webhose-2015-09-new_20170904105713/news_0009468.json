The two banks’ arrangement may cut down on the number of loans put into deals by such originators in favor of their own, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.\n\"Investors like having a narrower list of loan originators in a deal,\" said Chris van Heerden, head CMBS analyst for Wells Fargo & Co. \"More bank-made originations could produce a better pricing.\"\nSelena Morris, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, and UBS spokeswoman Erica Chase declined to comment.\nCrisis Memories CMBS became a byword for distress during the crisis, when the value of loans linked to everything from skyscrapers to strip malls plummeted. Issuance of the securities dried up after peaking in 2007 at $232 billion. But as the U.S. real-estate market has revived, so has that for CMBS, with Wells Fargo analysts including van Heerden forecasting $105 billion by year-end.\nYet even as issuance of the securities surges, Wall Street banks that bundle the mortgages into bonds are fighting for the smallest share of commercial real estate loans since 2011. The securities market has financed 19 percent of commercial real estate in 2015, down from 27 percent last year, according to Morgan Stanley.\nPart of that is because of competition from government-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurance companies, and commercial banks, all of which typically seek out higher-quality loans. That has stoked concern that the market’s appetite for risk is allowing the worst quality to be filtered into the securities banks package.\n‘Reduces Quality’ “Competition in underwriting reduces quality in general,” said Lamont Black , an assistant professor of finance in the Driehaus College of Business at DePaul University in Chicago and a former Federal Reserve economist. “Fannie, Freddie and insurers are lenders to the highest-quality borrowers. That reduces the quality of the borrower pool.”\nSmaller originators have been responsible for contributing some of the riskiest debt securitized this year, as seen in property location and market, loan-to-value ratios, debt-service coverage ratios, and debt yields, according to Wells Fargo data.\nBank of America and UBS sold about $700 million in commercial mortgage bonds this month using the issuance vehicle, which hadn’t been active since the height of the crisis, according to the two people. All of the underlying loans came from the two banks, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nThe strategy doesn’t come without downsides, according to Wells Fargo’s van Heerden.\nPart of the reason to include third-party originators is to keep deal velocity going -- that is, the third-party loans have already been made and can quickly be packaged and sold. Also, by limiting the number of originators, banks may have to hold mortgages for longer and risk losses amid recent volatility, van Heerden said.\nWells Fargo is the leading CMBS underwriter in 2015, followed by Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, Bloomberg data show.
