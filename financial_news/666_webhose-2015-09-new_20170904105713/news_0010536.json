The offering is for the redevelopment of the Shoppes at Godwin, a mixed use retail center in Midland Park, New Jersey. Click Here to learn more. Accordia Realty Ventures LLC, the sponsor of the deal, is raising a total of $1.2 million on EarlyShares. To welcome as many eligible investors into the opportunity as possible, Accordia has set the minimum investment amount at just $5,000 – EarlyShares’ lowest minimum for a commercial real estate offering.\nAccordia acquired the property in the summer of 2013 for a total acquisition cost of $3,240,163. The property is a two story mixed-use building consisting of retail, apartments and office space situated on a main thoroughfare in an affluent area of Bergen County, N.J. Retail space in the area is in high demand.\nThe property was originally developed in the 1960s and will be redeveloped into a Class A shopping center complete with new facades, storefronts, and tenancies. The center is already 65% leased and showing strong leasing activity, with rental rates for new tenants now 200% higher than in-place, going from $10 per square foot to over $30.\nThis is Accordia’s second real estate crowdfunding offering on EarlyShares. Accredited investors who are interested in learning more should click here and request access to the deal.\n“With the Shoppes at Godwin Plaza, we’re working with a poorly managed property in a highly attractive location – providing huge upside to this opportunity,” said Joseph Romano, principal of Accordia Realty Ventures. “We’ve already made significant progress on our redevelopment plans and are in negotiations with new national tenants to occupy the property following construction.”\n“We’ve brought this deal to EarlyShares because we see this as a highly compelling opportunity for investors throughout the U.S. to capitalize on our redevelopment experience and knowledge of the Bergen County, New Jersey market,” Romano continued.\n“Accordia is exactly the kind of reputable, experienced sponsor we like to introduce to our investor community,” said Joanna Schwartz, CEO and Co-Founder of EarlyShares. “We look forward to helping our investors add this commercial real estate opportunity to their portfolios for a minimum investment of just $5,000.”\nTo browse all current investment opportunities on the EarlyShares platform, click here .\nUnder current SEC regulations, only accredited investors who are registered users of EarlyShares are able to invest in the Shoppes at Godwin offering and other opportunities on EarlyShares.
