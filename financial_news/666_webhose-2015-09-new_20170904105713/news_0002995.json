On Friday, August 28, the spread was $13.728 per barrel. For context, the US Gulf Coast crack spread had peaked at ~$26 a few weeks earlier on August 12, and the lowest crack spread levels this year reached ~$3.50 early in January. \nThe above chart illustrates the US Gulf Coast 3:2:1 crack spread over the last few days. The 3:2:1 crack spread reflects a theoretical calculation of the difference between the price of two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of distillate fuel and the cost of three barrels of crude oil that these products are assumed to be produced from. \nCrack spreads usually decrease when crude oil prices (USO) increase by more than product prices or when product prices fall more than crude oil prices. In the week ended September 4, WTI prices increased by 1.83% during the week, while gasoline prices fell by ~6%. Diesel prices rose ~2.4% in the week ended September 4. Why watch crack spreads? \nCrack spreads represent the price difference between refiners’ revenues, derived from the sale of finished refined products, and refiners’ costs (or the price of crude oil). So, they’re an important metric that drives refiner profitability and market valuation. This is something investors in refiner stocks should watch. \nA wider crack spread increases the profit margins of refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Tesoro (TSO). It enables them to purchase raw materials or inputs (or crude oil) at a lower rate and sell the refined products at higher prices. Conversely, narrower crack spreads reduce profit margins for refiners. Together, the companies mentioned above make up ~12% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE). \nValero Energy Partners (VLP), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), MPLX (MPLX), and Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) have spun off some of their midstream assets to form MLPs. A higher crack spread would also indirectly benefit these companies, as the higher volumes produced by their refining parents, if they choose to take advantage of these higher margins, would mean more volume to transport. This would boost the revenues of these MLPs.
