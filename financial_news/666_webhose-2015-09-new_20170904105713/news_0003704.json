In a new survey [entity display=\"Fidelity Investments\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"fidelity-investments\" natural_id=\"fred/company/11267\"]Fidelity Investments[/entity] found that 69% of people with children under 18 were saving; that's up from 64% last year. Another smart move? More than half of the savers are using tax-advantaged 529 accounts. Millennial parents, which Fidelity is defining as those born between 1981 and 1997, turn out to be the most aggressive with 74% reporting that they are saving for their kids' college. Plus, 46% of them say they plan to cover the full cost of college for their children, compared to 35% of the broader group surveyed.It makes sense that this generation has an above-average desire to shield their offspring from the cost of college. Many of them have student debt themselves, including 56% of the 642 surveyed by Fidelity. This generation has been a part of, and even leaders of, a nationwide conversation about the downsides of indebtedness. In fact, a debate continues about whether student debt is causing delayed marriage , delayed home buying and delayed parenthood among young Americans.While Millennials may be more realistic about the drawbacks of debt, they may be less realistic about their ability to save. Two key questions: [tweet_Quote: display=\"Is it delusional for parents in their 20s and early 30s to think they can save enough to cover the cost of college?\"]Is it delusional for parents in their 20s and early 30s to think they can save enough to cover the cost of college?[/tweet_Quote: ] And, even if they can, should they?First let's look at the question of delusion.Currently many elite colleges cost over $60,000 per year, or about $240,000 for four years. Earlier this year FORBES' contributor Troy Onink wrote a headline declaring: In 18 Years A FORBES Top College Will Cost You Over $500,000 , referring to our annual ranking of America's Top Colleges . He got there by adding 4% to the cost of college each year, which is the roughly the speed with which college costs have been increasing. Onink quipped, \"With a headline like that, who needs birth control.\"With a 4% average annual rate of investment return, Onink figures, you would need to save $1,584 a month in a tax-advantaged account for 18 years to cover the projected cost of college. That's a lot. The median household income for a married-couple is $81,000 in this country (let's assume our sample Millennial parents are married since couples earn the most and it makes the math slightly less sad). So $1,584 would eat up more than 20% of pre-tax income.You might be thinking that if college costs are going up so fast, wages must be growing too. Not so fast. They are increasing a little, but not enough. Average hourly earnings have grown by about 2% since 2014, that's well below the norm for periods of economic expansion (which technically we've been in for awhile). Some economists argue wages will eventually go up since jobs are being created. The idea is that with a smaller pool of candidates job seekers gain negotiating power compared to when the unemployment rate was 10%, nearly double the current rate . Others warn slow wage growth may be the new normal.Regardless of what happens with wages over the next few decades one things is clear -- Millennials will need to save more toward retirement than their parents and grandparents did. (Advisors suggest saving 10% to 15%.) There are three key reasons for the increased need for savings: more and more retirement savings responsibility is being pushed from employer to employee, Social Security may or may not be around when this generation retires and Americans are living longer.This brings us to the second question: if Millennials, or any parents, can't save for retirement and college -- not to mention a home, food and a little bit of fun -- what should they prioritize? Both retirement and college advisors say retirement savings must come first. The standard rationale? You can take out loans for college; you can't take out loans for retirement. This is true, but let's dig a little deeper.Money in retirement accounts -- such as employer sponsored 401(k)s or independent retirement accounts -- isn't counted in financial aid formulas as an asset that can be used toward college costs. If this isn't incentive enough to start saving for retirement ASAP, consider that the need to save for retirement is not factored into how much income parents can afford to put toward college. So max out your 401(k) and then worry about sending your little angel to school. You may need to divert some of your usual retirement contribution toward tuition when your kids are college age. Thanks to the power of compounding interest, pausing some savings later would do much less harm than not saving enough now.(For more on financial aid formulas and retirement read Janet Novack's, \" Parents' Choice: Save For College Or Retirement? \" and \" Another Reason You Shouldn't Be Saving For College \")Millennials, it seems, have not quite gotten the message: 21% ranked college their top savings priority in Fidelity's survey. Just 16% gave retirement that rank. (Note that paying off their own student loans was a separate survey option and got 7% of the vote.) Prioritizing retirement does not mean you shouldn't be saving to send your kids to college.
