But at the same time its costs jumped, sending its losses up from £2.6m to £5.6m. \n“We are delighted that we have doubled revenue in 2014, and we are on track to more than double it again this year to in the region of £23m,” said Zopa’s chief executive Giles Andrews. \nHe said the firm is hiring more staff to enable the business to grow , and is spending heavily in areas like TV advertising to promote the brand. \n“We will see profitable periods next year although 2016 will not be profitable overall, and then in 2017 we will become profitable, if we continue on the same business plan,” he said. \nBy the end of last year the firm had around 90 staff, a level it has since increased to 140. \nThat rapid growth has also shown up in lending numbers Zopa has processed a total of £1bn of loans over its decade in existence, and expects to lend out £550m this year alone. \nThe platform is part of a wave of peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders who have positioned themselves as a threat to traditional banks , arguing that savers can get a better return by lending their money more directly to borrowers, while those borrowers may have a better chance of accessing credit from the P2P lenders, or be able to do so at a better interest rate. \nHowever, there are also more risks involved if the P2P borrowers do not pay the money back then Zopa’s savers could lose out, as the platform does not come with the state-backed guarantee that bank accounts have. \nNonetheless, Zopa has struck a partnership with Metro Bank, a high street banks that was established in 2010 and seeks to challenge the big banks through its branch network. \nThe deal will see the bank use Zopa’s platform to find suitable borrowers, in an unusual instance of a bank outsourcing its credit decisions to a third party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:18:57.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
