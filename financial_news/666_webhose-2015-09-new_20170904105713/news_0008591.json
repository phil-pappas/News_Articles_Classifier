The market has responded and investors are committed to helping Orchard flourish. We’re excited to help continue shaping the future of credit.” \nHans Morris, Managing Partner of Nyca Partners, and existing investor in Orchard Platform, stated: “We expect marketplace lending to be a large segment of the institutional marketplace, in the developed as well as less developed economies. One can only believe that the essential tools for institutional investors must exist, such as order management, statementing, benchmarking, and standardization of data for investors and issuers. This is what Orchard does.” Got a news tip?
