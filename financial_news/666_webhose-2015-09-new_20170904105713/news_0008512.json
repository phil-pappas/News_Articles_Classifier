Think about that question for a second and ask yourself if you really know how to assess the progress you are making toward important financial goals. Even more important, are you actually taking the time to measure your progress?Before we look at these simple steps, I’ll acknowledge that you don’t have to be a numbers geek who easily gets amped up to start running some quick financial calculations. If that’s you, great!!! If you never really were eager to sit down in stats class, have no fear because it’s not too hard to begin using some important methods to track your financial life. Hopefully, you will find these to be relatively easy methods of getting an accurate financial snapshot of where you are (or at least a helpful reminder that it’s time to put those skills to work). Here are some of those same important financial calculations you can use to examine how you are doing at least once per year: Net worth analysis – The ideal place to start assessing your current financial situation is to run a quick net worth analysis. This is a simple breakdown of everything you own (assets) and everything you owe to others (liabilities). Subtract the liabilities from your assets and BOOM – you’ve got your net worth figure. Every single item on this net worth statement tells a financial story (some good and some bad). Putting these pieces of your financial life together is a good start to gaining that true sense of awareness about where you are today. Resource: You can assess your net worth situation using this spreadsheet or if you prefer, just take a piece of paper, draw a big “t” and list your assets in one column and your liabilities in the other. Emergency fund – This is sometimes referred to as a basic liquidity ratio. Simply take your liquid assets such as cash, savings, or money market accounts (cash equivalents) and divide that amount by your total committed or fixed monthly expenses. I choose to include our health savings accounts in this calculation just because health related expenses are a potential emergency. Just use caution if your HSA is a big proportion of your overall emergency savings.The basic liquidity ratio will reveal how much you have in available emergency funds. For example, if someone has total emergency savings of $15,000 and their basic living expenses are $5,000 per month, they would be right in the suggested window of having at least 3 to 6 months worth of basic living expenses ($15,000/$5,000 = 3 months). However, if there was $2,500 in savings, that’s obviously a different story and the emergency fund would only last a couple of weeks ($2,500/$5,000 = 0.5 months). Resource: This emergency savings calculator from Practical Money Skills for Life allows you to choose the quick path (enter total monthly expenses) or the detailed path of itemizing monthly expenses. Debt-to-Income ratio – This ratio shows how much of your income you use to pay monthly debt obligations. It includes monthly housing costs (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance), minimum credit card payments, and other monthly loan obligations (student loans, auto loans, and personal loans). Most people only pay attention to their debt-to-income ratio when seeking a mortgage. Lenders will usually allow you to have a debt-to-income ratio as high as 43% to qualify for a mortgage.The lower this number is the better. Ideally, as a general rule, this number should be kept below 36% to minimize debt-related stress. So let’s assume your monthly income is $5,000 per month and you have a $1,500 mortgage payment, $500 student loan, and $300 credit card payments. The total monthly debt obligations divided by monthly gross income (before taxes and other deductions) will look like this:Debt-to-Income Ratio example: ($1,500 + $500 +$300)/$5,000 = 46% (exceeds the 36% target goal) Resource: Debt-to-Income calculator Savings ratio – How much should we be saving as a percentage of our total income? That’s a tough one and my best answer is as much as possible. The savings ratio is your total savings divided by total income.I look at this on an annual basis because we have some irregular income sources like my wife’s self-employment. But if you have consistent monthly income, a monthly approach will work too. Simply take your total savings (regular savings accounts, 401(k), IRAs, mutual funds, ETFs, HSAs, etc.) and divide this amount by your total household income. Rather than provide a benchmark, my guidance here is to save as much as possible. Resource: How to Calculate your Personal Savings Rate & How to Assess your Financial Wellness Creating and following a budget or personal spending plan is perhaps the best way to track how you are currently managing your money. But there are other ways to assess how you are doing in order to give yourself a quick progress report. Knowing these other important financial calculations can be great for overall awareness but it is also important to stress the “why” behind it all. This is why I recommend that you write down your financial ratios so you can track your progress and see exactly where you stand today, at least financially speaking.On a personal note, my wife and I just did this together over the weekend and it was a healthy reminder of our goal to fast track paying off our mortgage by a few years. It took us a grand total of 10 minutes to run the numbers AND talk about them. When we do our next checkup in December, our goal is to see continued progress across all of these measures. But even if life gets in our way, we understand that this whole financial planning thing is a process, not a one-time event.The main thing to realize when it comes to planning is to just do something . The real difference maker is the fact that most people don’t take time to do these things. Running these simple yet effective calculations can be a simple something you can do to continue moving your financial planning efforts in the right direction.", "external_links": ["http://credit.about.com/library/calculators/bl_debttoincomeratiocalc.htm", "https://secure.financialfinesse.com/go/3004", "http://www.financialfinesse.com/blog/2014/09/how-to-assess-your-financial-wellness/", "http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/calculators/calculate/emergencyFund.php?calcCategory=budget", "http://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/2013/how-to-calculate-your-personal-savings-rate-and-start-thy-purse-to-fattening/"], "published": "2015-09-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T18:33:04.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
