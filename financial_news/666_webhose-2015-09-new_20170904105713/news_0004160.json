ADVERTISEMENT The American Petroleum Institute says the gas tax increase will bring the total amount of money that drivers in Alabama are charged at the pump to more than 44 cents per gallon. \nThe state is the latest to consider increasing its own gas tax in recent years as federal transportation funding has dried up. \nLawmakers in Congress are currently facing an Oct. 29 deadline for the expiration of the law that allows federal transportation funding . They have been struggling to come up with a way to pay for a long-term extension of the measure after passing a patch in July that lasts only three months . \nTransportation advocates in Washington have pointed to the willingness of states such as Alabama to raise their own gas tax as evidence that a national hike would be politically palatable this year. \nConservative groups in Washington have made clear that they would consider an increase in the federal fuel levy a tax hike , however. \nThe national gas tax has been the traditional source of transportation funding since its inception in the 1930s. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and improvements in auto fuel efficiency have sapped its purchasing power. \nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in approximately $34 billion annually at its current rate. \nLawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the $16 billion per year gap, but transportation advocates have said the resulting temporary funding measures are preventing states from completing large construction projects.
