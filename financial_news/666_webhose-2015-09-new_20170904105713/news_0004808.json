Selfies controlled 30 per cent of market share of Australian superannuation assets 12 months ago, a figure which has since declined to 29 per cent, or $590 billion.\nThat loss has \"almost exclusively\" been to industry funds, with retail funds holding steady.\n\"We believe much of the reason why selfies are losing market share is because of their relatively poor recent performance,\" said Credit Suisse.\nSelfies had 40 per cent of their assets in Australian equities in June 2014 and little in international equities. By contrast, industry funds had 24 per cent in Australian equities and 26 per cent in global stocks.\nThis allocation was to prove unfortunate given the respective performance of global and Australian shares over the past year. Australian equities returned 6 per cent while global stocks piled on 23 per cent.\n\"The main reason why selfies have gone backwards over the last quarter is because of their investment losses in Australian equities,\" said Credit Suisse. \"We calculate (selfies) suffered $19 billion of Australian equity capital losses in the June quarter which is equivalent to around 3 per cent of assets.\n That was the biggest quarter of losses since September 2011, when they lost more than 5 per cent in Australian equities.\n\"The average Selfies member would have endured a draw-down of about $18,000 in the June quarter and a further $20,000 in the current quarter - maybe enough to fund that extravagent safari in the Kalahari.\"\nHowever, Credit Suisse said that selfies would \"stand their ground, for now\" and plough new funds into Australian equities.\nOne of the main reasons for this is history. Selfies demand for Australian equities had remained strong after previous losses, such as the global financial crisis and the Euro crisis of 2011-12.\nSecondly, Australian equities offered good yields.\n\"Selfies buy what they know and Australian Tax Office data suggests they have a cleat domestic bias. Perhaps this is appropriate given their liabilities are in Aussie dollars. Within Australia, there are not many assets that come close to providing the post-tax dividend yield opf offer by the equity market.\n\"Our findings suggest selfies will be buyers of Aussie equities in the year ahead.\"\nWith regards to individual stocks, the four banks and Telstra would remain selfies' core holdings. Selfies would be weary of potential dividend cutters, which \"may include ALS Services and Alumina\".\nConversely, stocks that could produce good income included AGL Energy, Macquarie Group and carsales.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:07:56.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
