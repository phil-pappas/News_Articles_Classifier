Policy options to prevent a recession exist but are, in our view, unlikely to be exercised in time.\"\nHowever, Lombard Street Research director for Australia and New Zealand Matthew Williamson said this position was far too gloomy as major economies proved more resilient despite the significant decline in emerging markets.\n\"For a global recession in 2016, we would need to see a much more extreme deterioration in investor sentiment. While possible, that is not a likely outcome,\" Mr Williamson said.\nEarlier this month, economists at Barclays lowered their expectations for Chinese growth, cutting 2015 forecasts to 6.6 per cent from 6.8 per cent and by even more in 2016 â€“ from 6.6 to 6 per cent.\nMr Williamson said they were not expecting 2016 to be easy however.\n\"We expect a slow-burn emerging market crisis rather than a 90s-style crash. While the shock to global GDP is potentially large, certainly larger than in 1998, the impact on the US and Europe looks manageable. Direct trade and financial links are still fairly modest, while lower oil/import prices should provide crucial support to consumers.\"\n Those who are forecasting a global recession do not argue the big advanced economies such as the United States and those in the euro area would enter their own, but rather the combined force of China and associated emerging markets entering recession would drag enough on larger economies to slow global growth significantly. A global recession does not require outright negative growth or a minimum length of time, and is instead defined by the International Monetary Fund by a decline in growth to 2 per cent as economic indicators lag and do not factor in the growing population entering the economy.\nEmerging markets now make up between 40 to 60 per cent of world GDP. But they have been hit hard by the slump in commodity prices. Also concerning for many emerging markets, such as South Korea and Taiwan, is that their major trading partner is China, which will slow.\nThe International Monetary Fund has already downgraded its forecast for global growth in 2015, from 3.5 per cent to 3.3 per cent.\n\"We have entered a period of low growth,\" IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in July as he explained the changed forecasts.\nBut earlier this week its chair Christine Lagarde said even this goal was not realistic.\n\"We are in a recovery process whose pace is decelerating. There is a shift between emerging countries and developed countries. The first ones, who were driving a global recovery not so long ago, are slowing down. The others are seeing their momentum accelerate. This should lead us to revise downwards our growth forecasts,\" Lagarde told Les Echos in an interview.\nMr Williamson also said growth had slowed rather than entered an outright global recession.\n\"Even now, markets remain jittery with some economists warning of an EM-led global recession in 2016. Overall, we are more sanguine about global economic prospects and think talk of a recession is premature,\" he said.\n\"The most serious risk comes from China but we do not think China's weakness poses a threat to wider global stability, not least because the country's credit bubble has been funded by domestic savers rather than international lenders, which distinguishes it from the US subprime crisis.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:03:31.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
