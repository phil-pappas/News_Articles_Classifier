The resource estimate for Invicta shows a Measured resource estimate of 131,000 tonnes grading 6.65 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold equivalent for 28,000 contained ounces of gold. As well, the Invicta resource estimate shows an Indicated resource estimate of 8,513,000 tonnes grading 3.43 g/t gold equivalent for 939,000 contained ounces of gold and an Inferred resource estimate of 2,534,000 tonnes grading 2.90 g/t gold equivalent for 236,000 contained ounces of gold. See Table 1 below and the technical report dated April 16, 2012, titled \"Technical Report on Resources, Invicta Gold Project, Huaura Province, Peru\", and prepared by SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. (\"SRK Technical Report\"), which is available at www.sedar.com under Lupaka Gold Corp's profile. Table 1: Invicta Gold Project: Summarized extract from the SRK Technical Report, detailing the above-mentioned resource estimate \n*Notes: Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimate will be converted into a Mineral Reserves estimate; Resources stated as contained within potentially economically mineable underground solids stated above a 1.3g/t Au Equivalent cut‐off; The resource is stated at a 1.30 g/t gold equivalent cut‐off contained within potentially economically mineable mineralized solids. Metal prices assumed for the gold equivalent calculation are US$1,500/oz for gold, US$32.50/oz for silver, US$3.90/lb for copper, US$1.05/lb for lead and US$1.00/lb for zinc. The gold equivalent calculation assumes 100% metallurgical recovery, and does not account for any smelting, transportation or refining charges; Metal prices used in the mineral resource estimate completed in October 2012 are significantly lower than current spot metal prices and this may materially impact any current mineral resource estimates; Mineral resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding. \nThe Company holds an option to earn a 65% interest on the Josnitoro Gold Project from Hochschild Mining PLC. The project is located approximately 600 kilometres by road southeast of Lima in the Department of Apurimac, southern Peru. Historical work on the disseminated gold zones includes over 170 shallow drill holes and extensive surface trenching. \nLupaka Gold holds a 100% interest in the Crucero Gold Project, a 5,500 hectare gold property located in southern Peru. Crucero has an Indicated mineral resource estimate of 1,003,041 ozs Au contained in 30,919,873 tonnes at 1.02 gpt gold (capped) and an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 1,027,806 ozs Au contained in 31,201,648 tonnes at 1.03 gpt gold (capped). These mineral resource estimates have been constrained by a conceptual pit shell in order to confirm reasonable prospects of economic extraction as set out in the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and NI 43-101. \nQualified Person \nThe technical information in this document has been reviewed and approved by Julio Castañeda Mondragon, MAIG, the President of Lupaka Gold Peru S.A.C. , a Peruvian subsidiary of the Company, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.
