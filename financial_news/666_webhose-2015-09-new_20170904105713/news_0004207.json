Mr Dale said there were little prospects for further growth in new home construction in 2015/16. However following three years of strong growth that have helped prop up the domestic economy, Australia is in for another healthy year in new home construction, he said. Detached house sales rose 0.7 per cent in July, while multi-unit sales fell 4.2 per cent.
