Amid rising fears that a housing market bubble could threaten economic growth, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in December warned lenders not to expand their credit to the sector by more than 10 per cent annually. More recently, APRA has flagged an increase in the amount of capital banks have to hold for their residential property lending. Despite the slower rise in July, annual growth in this component of credit stayed above APRA's red line, at 10.8 per cent over the year to July, although it was down from 11.1 per cent. Taken together, growth over June and July averaged 0.8 per cent, not much different from the 0.9 per cent average of the preceding year, so it is not clear whether the July figure is the beginning of a slowing trend or just volatility in the data. If slower growth in credit can be sustained it would make the booming housing market less of a constraint on the RBA if it wished to cut interest rates again to support economic growth.
