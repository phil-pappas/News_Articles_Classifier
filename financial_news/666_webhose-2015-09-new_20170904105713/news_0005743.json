The ministry is also working to involve beneficiaries of its services in planning and management of services to achieve the principles of participation and transparency, Al Sada said.\n What distinguishes Qatar’s adoption of a human rights-based approach in public service is the establishment of the Administrative Control and Transparency Authority, a watchdog on the government’s performance to contribute to the achievement of the highest integrity and transparency indicators in the civil service sector and combat corruption in all its forms and manifestations, she added.\nShare: Someone You Know Needs to Hear This", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:17:05.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
