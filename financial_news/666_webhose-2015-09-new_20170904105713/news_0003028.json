Lyft and Uber are some of the best of those places,\" added Mehul Patel, CEO of Hired, a tech recruiting firm.\nTwitter employees are especially valuable as they have data skills that help Lyft and Uber understand consumer behavior, critical for the ride services as they look to personalize customers' experiences with their apps.\n\"These people are some of the brightest talent out there,\" Carvajal said.\nRecruiting has grown increasingly competitive in Silicon Valley as start-ups valued at more than $1 billion, including Lyft and Uber, ramp up hiring as they look to go public.\nLyft's staff has grown more than 70 percent since the start of 2015, a spokeswoman told Reuters, but she declined to say how many employees it has. Uber has added nearly 1,000 employees over the past year, according to the company. The numbers do not include drivers, who the firms class as contractors rather than employees.\nTwitter did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb, editing by Stephen R.
