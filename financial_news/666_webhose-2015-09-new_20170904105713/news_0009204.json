Rentrak, based in Portland, Oregon, focuses more on television and film. Both companies analyze usage, viewing behavior and demographics. The combined company's key rival would be the better-known ratings and media analysis firm Nielsen.\nRentrak Corp. will merge into a unit of ComScore and each share of Rentrak will be converted into the right to receive 1.15 shares of ComScore. Upon completion of the buyout, ComScore shareholders are expected to own approximately 66.5 percent of the new company and Rentrak shareholders are expected to own about 33.5 percent.\nComScore's current chief executive, Serge Matta, will lead the combined company as CEO. The new company's board will consist of eight directors from ComScore and four from Rentrak.\nShares of ComScore Inc. rose $3.53 to $45.02 in premarket trading while shares of Rentrak jumped $5.61, or 12.9 percent to $49.06.\nComScore Rentrak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:35:16.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
