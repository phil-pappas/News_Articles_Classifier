Pat Scala Share on twitter by Agnes King For the first time, professional services giant Ernst & Young has admitted publicly that women doing the same job as men are paid 1.8 per cent less in its Australian office.\nErnst & Young closes this gap each year. But within 12 months it is back.\nIt follows similar disclosures by PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG earlier in September.\nChief executive Tony Johnson admits the gap is due in part to unconscious bias in the annual performance-rating process.\n\"We're still trying to get to the bottom of why males exhibiting the same competency as females are being awarded a higher rating,\" Mr Johnson said.\nRatings dictate salary bumps at Ernst & Young. A higher rating means a bigger pay increase.\n\"Unconscious bias, it's like peeling an onion. You reveal and peel the first layer, only to find another layer and another layer,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"It is at manager and senior manager level where the gaps start to get bigger.\"\n Constant role changes Also to blame are constant role changes – promotions, resignations and redundancies – as well as a ferocious external recruitment rate of one or two new consultants a day.\nErnst & Young revealed an 8.3 per cent gender pay gap in its Australian office across all roles, excluding equity partners. Much of this is explained by the fact that it hires more men than women.\nThis puts it well below the national gap of 18 per cent, and lower than PwC, which revealed last week an 11.4 per cent gender pay gap across its 6300 Australian employees.\n\"Our biggest issue is getting women into senior roles in the firm,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"That will be the biggest boost in fixing the balance.\"\nErnst & Young has set a strategic goal of 30 per cent female equity partners by 2020. It was promoting more than 30 per cent a year to hit that benchmark and was open about its positive discrimination policy in favour of women, Mr Johnson said.\n\"What's really important to us is to get more women in the partnership. We do make decisions about who gets promoted on that basis,\" he said.\nLine-ball calls Ernst & Young Australia's head of human resources McGregor Dixon said this policy didn't have a negative impact on the meritocracy. High achievers would always be admitted to the partnership, he said. It was in line-ball calls where divisional heads might promote a female over a male to advance the firm's strategic goal around diversity and inclusion.\nPwC's 11.4 per cent figure does not include crucial data about the firm's 536-strong partner group, 83 per cent of which are male.\nAlmost 9 per cent of PwC's gender pay gap is attributed to the fact it hires more men than women at each grade.\nPwC's pay gap drops to 2.4 per cent when this factor is stripped out.\nPwC chief executive Luke Sayers said in a blog that this \"doesn't mean we are paying women 2.4 per cent less than men in identical roles\". Rather, the market rate for an accounting or human resources manager is lower than it is for managers in the field of technology or engineering. And these lower-paid professions are dominated by women.\nA gap emerged if more men than women were employed in higher-paying manager roles, Mr Sayers said.\n\"As a society we have to support and encourage more women to take on roles in these higher-paying disciplines,\" he said.\nPlan to narrow gap PwC said it allocated more money for women in its recent June-July pay review as part of a plan to narrow the firm's gender pay gap.\nThe pay difference between male and female chartered accountants in New Zealand blew out to its widest gap since 2010, a 2015 remuneration survey by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand showed.\nMale accountants earned an average of $45,573 more than females, the survey showed. This result was based on a 29 per cent response rate from New Zealand members of the organisation.\n\"Our research shows that around 20 per cent of the gap can be attributed to gender only. That is unacceptable,\" CAANZ chief executive Lee White told Stuff.co.nz .\nThe gap starts early and compounds significantly over the years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Agi_King", "http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/70768048/Gender-pay-gap-widening-in-NZ-accounting-industry", "http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gender-pay-equity-disrupting-status-quo-starts-luke-sayers?trk=prof-post"], "published": "2015-09-22T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:44:02.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
