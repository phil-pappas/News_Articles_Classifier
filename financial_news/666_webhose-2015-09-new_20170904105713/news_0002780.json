Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he plans to get on with economic reforms to cement the sharp rise in business and consumer confidence that has accompanied his ousting of Tony Abbott.\nIn an interview with Sky News on Tuesday, the Prime Minister said: \"I don't believe in spinning my wheels.\"\nAt the same time, the Prime Minister said there would be no bringing forward the mid-year budget update from its scheduled release in December to use as some form of mini-budget.\n\"I don't believe in rushing things, but we can take well-considered decisions quickly,\" he said.\nConfidence has soared since Mr Turnbull took over as Prime Minister which has raised expectations for him to deliver to sustain those high levels.\nMr Turnbull attributed the confidence boost to the perception he and his new cabinet would bring better economic leadership.\n\"We have a government that is talking confidently about our future, we are talking optimistically about our future,\" he said.\nHe repeated that it was not right that business confidence and investment had been so low during a low-interest rate environment - a point Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens had been making.\n Mr Turnbull declined to rule anything in or out, including revising weekend penalty rates, and showed no inclination to deal with Labor's concerns about the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\nHe admitted he had read only the summary documents of the deal, but accused Bill Shorten's concerns about safeguards for Australian workers as a union-driven \"alarmist scare-mongering campaign\".\nHe said the government would be willing to talk to Labor, but there had been no specific proposals.\nMr Turnbull alo left open doing something to relive the plight of asylum seekers stranded in campais in naura and Manus Island.\n\"I have the same concerns about the situation of people on Manus and Nauru as you do and as I think all Australians do and the minister [Peter] Dutton does,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\"Our policies will change, all policies change, but when we do make changes we will do so in a considered way and they will be made by the minister, myself [and] the cabinet.\"\n'Important for us to have stability'\nMr Turnbull also signalled that his first overseas trip would be the G20 leaders summit in Turkey this year, and possibly the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila just afterwards.\nHe said his schedule was \"still a work in progress\".\nMr Turnbull would not be drawn on the details leading up to him replacing Mr Abbott.\n\"The decision to challenge was entirely mine,\" he said.\n\"The leader of the party serves at the pleasure of the party room, full stop.\"\nMr Turnbull defended the dropping of Immigration MInister Peter Dutton form the National Security Committee of cabinet.\nHe said the immigration minister was not a permanent member of the NSC during the Howard government, which was \"the gold standard' of cabinet processes.\nMr Turnbull said the decision would be reversed if need be.\n\"This is a modern, 21st Century government and we will adapt all our arrangements as circumstances require,\" he said.\nDeputy prime minister and National leader Warren Truss defended Mr Abbott's legacy in a radio interview earlier on Wednesday.\n\"We've gone through a bit of a season now, of five leaders in five years, and I don't think that's good for the government of the country,\" he said.\n\"It is important for us to have stability.\n\"Certainly Tony Abbott had delivered significantly on his agenda, way beyond what I think many Australians thought was even possible and his achievements are an important legacy for the Coalition government and it's a legacy that we should be proud of and continue to refer to.\n\"It's an ongoing government. It has a new prime minister, but the achievements of the Abbott government are certainly a part of its legacy.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-23T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:09:33.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
