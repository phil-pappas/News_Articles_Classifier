JGC, Tenaga and Acwa Power declined to comment. Engie was not immediately available for comment. \nPreviously set to end on Sept. 15, bidding is now due to close on Nov. 1, said one of the sources. \nThe project will be based on a build, own, operate and transfer basis and the power agreement will be for 20 years, SEC said on its website. SEC will hold 50 percent of the project, Saudi Aramco 10 percent with the bid winner taking 40 percent. \nThe plant will use 475 million standard cubic feet per day (scfd) of Low BTU Gas per day from the Khursaniyah oilfield. \nCommercial operation of the project is expected in February 2020, SEC said on its website.
