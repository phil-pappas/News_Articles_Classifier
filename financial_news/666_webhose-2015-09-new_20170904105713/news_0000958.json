Michele Mossop by Joyce Moullakis Macquarie Group has appointed Peter Warne as chairman after Kevin McCann flagged he will step down in March next year.\nMr Warne, who is also chairman of ALE Property Group and OzForex Group and a director of the Australian Securities Exchange, will take the reins on March 31.\nMr McCann, 74, was due to retire from the board last year but extended his tenure due to a string of other non-executive director changes at Macquarie.\nIn announcing the appointment, Mr McCann cited Mr Warne's knowledge and \"deep experience\" in financial services and investment banking. That included various roles at Bankers Trust Australia, including head of its financial markets group from 1988 to 1999.\nIn addition to his chairmanships and ASX director roles, Mr Warne is a director of NSW Treasury Corp, a patron of the Macquarie University Foundation, and a member of the Australian Office of Financial Management's advisory board.\nMr Warne, who was re-elected to the Macquarie board in July, has, however, faced some criticism for his substantial workload and long tenure on various boards, including the ASX.\nHe received a shareholder vote of more than 20 per cent against his re-election to the ASX board last year.\nMacquarie director Gordon Cairns had been tipped as the likely successor to Mr McCann prior to his appointment as chairman of embattled supermarket giant Woolworths .\n Mr McCann has presided over a return to bumper profits at Macquarie following a torrid period after the global financial crisis. He was acting chairman from November 2008 until August 2009 and succeeded founding chairman David Clarke in 2011.\nMacquarie upgraded its first-half guidance earlier this month and is on track to post a record full-year profit of $1.9 billion.\nMore to come", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/new-woolworths-chair-gordon-cairns-faces-enormous-challenge-20150826-gj8poo.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/macquarie-group-tips-40pc-rise-in-profit-as-australian-dollar-weakens-20150913-gjlsmu.html"], "published": "2015-09-24T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:03:25.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
