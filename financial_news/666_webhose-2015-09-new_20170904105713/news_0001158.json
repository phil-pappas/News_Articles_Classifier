It was Rs 60,663 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal.\nHowever, after discounting for the additional excise collection on account of change in duty structure in petroleum and other sectors, the increase in excise duty collections works out to be 9 per cent.\nExcise duty has contributed around 40 per cent of the total indirect tax collection during April-August.
