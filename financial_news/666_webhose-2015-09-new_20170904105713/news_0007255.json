Photo: iStock Photo: iStock\nThere are just over six million lost super accounts in Australia, with a total value of over $16 billion – a staggering figure considering these funds could be tucked away providing for a more comfortable retirement.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nThere are just over six million lost super accounts in Australia, with a total value of over $16 billion.\nData released by the Australian Taxation Office reveal the top 10 lost super accounts, with a female in Victoria topping the list with $2.4 million in one forgotten account.\nAt the end of the financial year, more than 14 million Australians had a super fund account. About 45 per cent of them have more than one account.\nAdvertisement Those between the ages of 31 to 45 are more likely to have two or more accounts, and those living in the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia have the highest number of multiple accounts.\nThe ATO is making it easier to recover lost super and you can now consolidate your super online with a few clicks but there are some traps to be aware of.\nHere are some simple steps to keeping a track of your super and ensure you don't lose it.\nPrevention is better than cure Most people generally accumulated multiple super funds in their early working life, so to avoid doing this, choose a fund that suits you and continue to use the same fund as you change jobs and progress during the course of your career. A Choice of Super Form, provided by the ATO, is essential in ensuring your employer uses your nominated super fund, so lodge this form as soon as you start working for a new employer.\nKeep in touch If you have moved, ensure you tell your super fund of your new contact details. Super accounts become lost and unclaimed when you don't keep in touch with your fund, or when your super account hasn't been used for a long time. If you haven't received a statement at least in the last year, call up your fund to ensure they have your correct details on file.\nFees If you have multiple super accounts, this is likely costing you money. The median fees charged by even a low cost super fund are around $532 a year, so multiply this across the number of your funds and you might find that your money is being eaten away faster than you think.\nConsolidate There are now new ways to keep a track of your superannuation, and the Australian's Taxation Office myGov account can now show you details of all of your super accounts, including any you have lost track of or forgotten about. It is not only keeping your more informed about your super accounts, but you can now combine multiple superannuation funds in a few clicks at no cost.\nConsolidating your super will take you less than a few minutes, but ensure before you close your super accounts that you check with your fund about insurances, fees and charges.\nCheck on the lost super register To find your lost super, you can either contact your super funds directly if you have an old statement, or use the ATO's Super Seeker online service. This is a free service and can be completed with basic details such as your date of birth and tax file number.\nIn addition to this, you may also need details such as your previous residential address, previous employers and a tax assessment notice to confirm your identity. As long as you have this information, the process of finding your lost funds can take as little as an after tea break.\nThe process to transfer the funds may take a few days to several weeks, depending on further information requested from the Taxation Office or the Super Fund, but be prepared with certified copies of your driver's licence, passport and/or Medicare card.\nBy taking these simple steps, not only will you avoid losing your super but you will maximise the pool of monies you are building for your retirement.\nAfter all, your superannuation is your money; why wouldn't you want to make the most of it?\nOlivia Maragna is the co-founder of Aspire Retire Financial Services.
