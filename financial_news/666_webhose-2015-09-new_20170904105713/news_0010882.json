He was then recruited by the band to tour with them in the early 1990s and teach them about the internet. \nHis music connections led him in 2003 to take a role heading up internet search engine Yahoo’s music service as its vice president for three years. He later became chief executive of Topspin Media, a Los Angeles-based company used by Paul McCartney, David Byrne and the Beastie Boys to help musicians sell to fans online. \nIn 2013 he joined rapper Dr Dre's headphones and music streaming service Beats Music, which was bought by Apple for $3bn in May last year . Mr Rogers was then promoted to a senior role within Apple's iTunes team and helped with the launch of Apple Music. \nMr Roger's appointment at LVMH is fresh evidence of the growing importance of digital marketing to luxury brands. Industry analysts say that top brands have been reluctant thus far to engage in online marketing as they believed an ecommerce site would dilute their exclusivity. \nHowever, booming smartphone use means that shoppers frequently do most of their research on products online via their mobiles and tablets before purchasing. \n\"I am happy to welcome Ian into our group to strengthen our digital ecosystem,\" said Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire owner of LVMH. \n\"He will build on the foundations laid by Thomas Romieu, take the Houses to the next level and explore new opportunities for the group in the digital sphere. Ian will bring his extensive experience in high-end digital ventures and his innovation-driven spirit to develop LVMH's leadership in the digital luxury field.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:38:10.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
