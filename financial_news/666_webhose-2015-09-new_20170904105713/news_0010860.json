HSBC has consistently said it respected Argentine law. \nRicardo Echegaray, head of Argentina's AFIP tax agency, called the central bank's move \"positive\". He said the bank's clients who had moved money abroad through secret channels should accept criminal liability and pay the taxes owed. \n\"They will have to recognize that together with Martino, and the HSBC authorities here in Argentina, they looked to cheat Argentina, to move funds abroad that they had never declared and on which they had never paid taxes,\" Mr Echegaray told a news conference. \nArgentina's central bank has the authority to revoke the licences of officials who legally represent commercial banks before the financial regulator. \nEurope's largest bank faces probes in several countries of allegations it helped clients dodge taxes (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:33:58.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
