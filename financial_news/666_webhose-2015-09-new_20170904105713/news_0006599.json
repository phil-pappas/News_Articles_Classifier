(AP) - A judge in California says one of the nation's largest fruit growers committed unfair labor practices by trying to block the United Farm Workers from representing its workers.\nAdministrative law judge Mark Soble says Gerawan Farming tainted a vote nearly two years ago by workers on whether they want the union's representation. The votes remain uncounted.\nGerawan Farming employs thousands annually to harvest nectarines, peaches and grapes grown in California's Central Valley.\nThe judge says its employee Silvia Lopez was unlawfully paid $20,000 to fund the anti-union fight. The decision says Lopez physically blocked workers from the farm while collecting signatures.\nDan Gerawan says his workers are denied the right to choose after the United Farm Workers abandoned them for 20 years.\nThe union's Armando Elenes says the ruling is a victory for farmworkers.\nGerawan Farming says it will appeal.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:47:36.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
