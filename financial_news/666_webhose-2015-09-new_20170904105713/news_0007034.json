Scott Walker's administration is likely to succeed. \nLa Follette says the cuts are an unconstitutional infringement on his office and are so severe that he can't do his job without causing delays in services. He says he'll have to talk to his lawyer about their next step. \nThe Wisconsin State Joural reports ( http://bit.ly/1KxhT3d ) the judge held out a glimmer of hope for La Follette. She's not definitively stating that there's no infringement on his constitutional duties, just that the evidence presented so far doesn't support such a finding. \nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T21:00:33.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
