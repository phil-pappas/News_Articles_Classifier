Financial terms weren't disclosed and neither City Airways nor ICBC Financial commented immediately on the COMAC statement.\nThe ARJ21, China's first locally built regional jet, is designed to compete against Brazil's Embraer SA and Canada's Bombardier Inc. The aircraft, which seats about 90 passengers, has not yet been put into commercial service.\nCOMAC is also making the self-developed narrow-body C919 jet, the first Chinese-built jet of its type, targeted at eventually competing with Boeing Co and Airbus Group NV .\nChina is keen to develop a successful commercial aircraft to rival Boeing and Airbus. But it has been held back by inexperience, a shortage of local aerospace design and engineering talent, as well as a lack of home-grown companies with the technology to help drive the project.
