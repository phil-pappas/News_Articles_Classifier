AJ Bell has an annual £100 charge for regular income payments, while others including Legal & General have fees for ad hoc income payments. \nAlongside standard account closure fees, some providers also levy exit charges and “early encashment” penalties for closing the plan within 12 months of opening the contract. These can amount to several hundred pounds. \n“I’ve been looking at investment and pension platforms in a professional capacity for 16 years but I find pricing analysis and like-for-like comparison of drawdown platforms very hard to do,” says Holly Mackay, an independent investment expert and founder of BoringMoney.co.uk, a consumer finance website. \n“The charging models tend to be like Ryanair — the advertised fee can bear little resemblance to the total cost by the time you’ve made a few trades, withdrawn some cash, requested a report and changed a few admin details.” Deeper complexity \nAdding to the difficulties for investors trying to compare deals is the fact that many providers include other investments you may hold with them, such as individual savings accounts (Isas), to determine the charge band you will fall into. \n“Someone with £200,000 in a self invested personal pension [Sipp] and £50,000 in an Isa with Fidelity will pay 0.25 per cent on both Sipp and Isa, not 0.35 per cent, whereas someone with Hargreaves will be charged 0.45 per cent on both Sipp and Isa,” says Alan Higham, an independent pensions expert and founder of PensionsChamp.com, a consumer website. \n“You need quite a lot of knowledge and information just to compare what seems a simple concept of an annual percentage charge.” Charge cap call \nWith such a big variation in charges and charging structures, consumer groups say more needs to be done to ensure everyone can benefit from the pension freedoms. \n“In particular, we need to see greater protection for those with smaller pension pots, who could have thousands of pounds wiped off their savings by higher charges,” says Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, the consumer group. \n“We’re calling for the government to introduce a cap on charges for drawdown products sold by someone’s existing provider, and establish a state-backed drawdown provider to ensure everyone can access a low-cost product.” \nWith the mass drawdown market expected to continue growing, regulators are under pressure to force providers to make their charging information much clearer. \n“The Financial Conduct Authority also needs to make it clear to firms that it is unacceptable just to highlight low headline rates of charges whilst keeping other charges back in the smaller print,” adds Mr Higham. Serious Money \nA long winding road from pensions easy street to Generation Tent \nFor our summer holiday this year, my husband and I travelled back in time. He was turning 50 and wanted to do something different. So we left London, hired a luxury camper van, and spent a fortnight cruising around the Scottish Highlands and islands. Having boarded our time travelling machine in Glasgow, we pulled over half way to Fort William to check that the exhaust hadn’t fallen off, as so many couples in campervans on the other side of the road kept tooting and waving at us. \nRead more \n“It is hard enough to compare products when you have all the data without having to prise details of the extra charges from the companies. There are so many variables to take into account that it is very difficult to shop around, and there are no comparison sites that yet cover this area reliably.” \nIn its defence, the pensions industry says it is investigating ways to make it easier for drawdown investors to shop around. \n“A challenge will be to avoid reducing any analysis of drawdown to a simple question of who is the cheapest,” says Tom McPhail, head of pensions research with Hargreaves Lansdown and chair of the Pension Income Choices Association, the industry group. \n“Functionality, investment choice, supporting information, service and administration capabilities are all critical.” \nMs Mackay agrees that any comparison should not focus solely on cost, but also consider efficient service and good communications. Recent research by the Boring Money website found that it can take up to 45 seconds just to find pricing information on some platform websites. \nStandard Life, which adopted its charging model for the mass market, also cautions against investors becoming too focused on charges, as cost is not the only risk to consider. \nFollowing the recent volatility on world stock markets, this is something that smaller investors who have recently switched to drawdown will be only too aware of. Annuity, anyone? \nBeing stung by high charges is not the only risk for drawdown investors who are at the mercy of market swings and must make complex decisions about how to make their money last. \nBefore the 2015 pension freedoms, savers were steered towards professional advisers before going into drawdown where they would get a risk profile and recommended suitable investments. \nBut the freedoms are opening drawdown to a new generation of less experienced DIY investment managers, potentially putting savers’ lifestyle in retirement at risk. \nMetLife , a pension provider, estimates that new retirement investors taking out drawdown since the launch of the freedoms lost more than £160m from their fund values due to recent stock market volatility . That is based on their estimates of 27,000 individuals investing more than £1.75bn since April. \n“The recent crash in the Chinese stock market would have given investors a scare,” says Mike Morrison, of AJ Bell, a Sipp provider. \n“The market has since corrected itself but investors will be wondering about their future income. If they’d bought an annuity they wouldn’t be worrying at all.” \nRecent figures on life expectancy have also brought into sharp focus the need to make funds stretch throughout retirement, however long that may be. \nThe ONS data showed life expectancy at birth had increased by nearly three years per decade over the past 100 years with the average lifespan for men now 79, rising to 83 for women. \nProviders are responding to a new appetite for flexible access to pension cash, but also secure income, by creating “hybrid” products that blend annuities and drawdown. \nMetLife is to launch a new “guaranteed drawdown” plan which offers a guaranteed income for life, but also the possibility of capital growth. More of these hybrid products are expected to come to the market in future. \nAdvisers say people who are not sure of their capacity for loss, how to make their funds last, or who have not previously made investment decisions, should consider alternatives to drawdown, including traditional annuities. \n“We have people who say that annuities are really bad value but our view is that is not necessarily the case,” says David Woodhouse, head of advice services with Chase de Vere. “Nailing down some secure lifetime income should certainly come into play.” \nWith more hybrid products expected to hit the market, advisers say pensioners need to carefully consider their options and that for many with small funds, that will still be a traditional annuity. \n“Products which provide a buffer against market swings while offering opportunity to benefit from fund growth will be attractive,” adds Gary Smith, pension specialist with Tilney Bestinvest. \n“But security and flexibility does come at a cost, either the guarantee or restrictions on fund choice. For many with funds of £50,000 or less and few other assets in retirement, a traditional annuity is probably still best.” The lowdown on drawdown", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T08:14:33.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
