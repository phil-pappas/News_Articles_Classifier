Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The auction of two Sydney apartments in prime locations over the weekend produced two very different results, highlighting a more cautious market and more discerning buyers amid a swathe of new listings.\nOn Saturday, a three-bedroom unit across from Manly Wharf failed to sell under the hammer but sold later in the afternoon after a protracted negotiation by McGrath's Lincoln McCarthy.\nA fatigued start to the auction saw one bid of $1.1 million for the unit in the former Bank Of Commerce Chambers property, a slightly rundown building due for a major refurbishment. The owner had expected $1.25 to to $1.4 million.\nAfter it was passed in, a separate non-auction offer provided the competition to help close the deal at $1.355 million.\n\"I had the one bidder in one room, and the owner in the other and after two hours, we had a deal,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\"The one bidder did have capacity for $1.3 million but they were testing the market. The offer on the table helped to springboard the sale.\"\n\"I was expecting a ferocious auction and was pretty shocked when it was passed in. There was lots of emotion for the owners who wanted a good price for a unit they had put a lot of work into for 18 years.\"\nDifferent story Over in Potts Point, just a few kilometres from the city, it was a different story.\n15a/13 Springfield Avenue, a 152-sq m penthouse in a 1914 \"Vanderbilt\" Neo-Georgian building, got hearts racing, reaching $1.545 million, well above the expected price of about $1.4 million.\nThe two-bedroom apartment with a rooftop patio enticed three spirited bidders and Pitt Capital Partners' investment banker Dean Price bought the unit as his new home.\nBoth the vendor and agents, Ray White's Seaton Jones and Peter Taylor, attribute the successful auction to having a \"point of difference\".\n\"A property needs to be unique with an agent who knows what he's doing,\" vendor Charlton Hill said.\n\"A strong campaign and reading the market well are key,\" Mr Jones said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-09-27T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:06:13.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
