A swipe during a show displays information about the show, for instance, and users can quickly scrub backwards and forwards through a show through another gesture.\nThe remote control also has a gyroscope and accelerometer, making it useful as a games controller and (presumably, though Apple never demonstrated this) allowing it to work a little like LG's Magic Remote, which can be waved in the air to give mouse-like control of smart TV features.\n Australian pricing has yet to be announced, but in the US the new Apple TV will be $US149 for a model with 32 gigabytes of storage, and $US199 for a 65 gigabyte model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:10:10.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
