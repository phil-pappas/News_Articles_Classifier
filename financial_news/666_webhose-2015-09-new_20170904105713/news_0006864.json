We have dug a huge well where we will throw all the political leaders against us including the leaders of the ruling party.\n“Due to this agitation, the ruling party will face adverse results in the upcoming local body elections. They will have to pay the price for the deaths of our nine youths,” Hardik told reporters in Surat while referring to the deaths that occurred during the violence that had spread after the August 25 rally of Patels.\nThe municipal and local bodies’ polls are likely to be held next month.\nEarlier, Hardik put posters asking politicians “not to enter the housing societies of Patels for votes or for holding rallies.”\nThe posters had a punchline reading “the option of NOTA is self-respect for Patidars (Patel).”\n“This is request from youths of the Patel community to leaders of BJP, Congress and any other political parties to not enter into our society for the purpose of political rally or for seeking votes.\n“If they come to society and if any untoward incident happens, the residents of society will not be held responsible for them,” reads a poster.\nWhen asked which political parties he is aiming at in the posters, Hardik said, “We are not putting banners to oppose any particular political party, but neither BJP nor Congress have as of now uttered a single word for police atrocities on our youths resulting in death of nine of them and injuries to thousand others.”\nHardik said Patels will oppose all those leaders.\n“Therefore we have clearly written in that poster addressing the leaders of BJP and Congress to not come before us begging for votes. If you do not care for us, we don’t care for you.\n“It (the poster war) is a strategic movement which will be taken out to villages and talukas of Gujarat,” he said.\nBlaming the government and police for sporadic violence that took place yesterday, Hardik said, “They can go to any extent to break this movement.”\n 21, 2015 1:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:52:26.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
