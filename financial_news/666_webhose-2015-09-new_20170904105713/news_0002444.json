With four cohorts under its belt, the industry’s only accredited intensive data science bootcamp is already filling its classes well ahead of schedule. Since opening its doors last September, Metis has held several events with over 1,000 registrants, hosted more than 50 industry leaders as speakers, and created relationships with more than 150 hiring companies including IBM, Columbia Law School, BuzzFeed, The Ladders and Morgan Stanley. \nMetis will operate in the SOMA space of sister company Dev Bootcamp, located in the heart of San Francisco’s startup district. \n“We’ve spent a year honing what was already a best-of-class data science curriculum, and are inspired by how well the program has been received,” said Jason Moss, co-founder of Metis. “Our goal is to prepare individuals for success as data scientists, and as our number of success stories continues to multiply, we’re excited to bring our course to San Francisco, one of the nation’s leading tech cities.” \nThe Metis curriculum combines human-centered data science design with the proprietary learning science and assessment insights of global educational services provider Kaplan, which owns Metis as well as Dev Bootcamp. The 12-week bootcamp trains students how to derive insights from data and to communicate those insights effectively. During the course, students tackle five data science projects, designed to help them learn to ask good questions, use cutting-edge open source tools to compile and analyze their own data sets, and refine their product designs through a dynamic iterative design process. The bootcamp exposes students to data science through daily use of Python and its related packages. Students are taught a variety of machine learning algorithms (Regression, KNN, SVM, SGD, Bayesian models, Random Forests, K-means), databases (SQL and NoSQL), and visualization techniques (including Seaborn, HTML, CSS, and D3) for understanding and presenting data -- forming a functional toolbox ready for immediate on-the-job use. Students are also exposed to cloud-based computing and the foundations of big data as preparation for future work. \n“Metis is a really nice mashup of practicing data scientists and a company that knows education deeply. The programs focus on the core view that data science is primarily learning knowledge and practicing skills,” said Randy Carnevale, Director of Data Science at Capital One Labs. “Metis focuses more heavily on the student aspects than other programs, cementing deep education and teaching with practical project-based work to deliver something that’s extremely employer-friendly.” \nMoss added, “We’re looking forward to sharing space with Dev Bootcamp, pioneer of the coding bootcamp model. Programming is a necessary skill for data scientists, so learning alongside aspiring developers who share the same mindset of passion and collaboration will only amplify the existing digitally minded, dynamic, innovative culture on both sides.” \nApplicants must have a background in programming and statistics. Under the competitive admissions process, Metis applicants submit written applications, which are reviewed by the admissions team. Qualified applicants are then invited to participate in a 48-hour coding challenge and a video interview following the completion of the coding challenge. Classes are limited to 20-24 students. Metis offers a $2,000 scholarship for women, underrepresented minority groups, and veterans or members of the U.S. military. \nAccording to GlassDoor.com , there are more than 2,500 job openings for data scientists in San Francisco. An O’Reilly survey finds that nationally data scientists earn $130,000 a year with startups; $110,000 annually at public companies; and $80,000 a year with government agencies.
