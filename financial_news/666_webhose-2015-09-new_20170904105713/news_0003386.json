The stock index shed 3.02 percent to fall below a 30,000 point psychological level. \nIn response to the decision, the CBN and ministry of finance said in a join statement signed by CBN spokesperson, Ibrahim Muazu that \"while we respect the right of the J.P. Morgan to make this decision, we strongly disagree with the premise and conclusions upon which the decision rests.\" \nCBN said it took all the measures to improve the market. Despite the fact that oil prices have fallen by nearly 60 percent in one year, which should expectedly reduce the amount of liquidity in the market, the CBN ensured that all genuine and effective demand were met, especially those from foreign investors. \n\"On transparency, the CBN mandated that all FX transactions were posted online in the Reuters Trading Platform so that all stakeholders can easily verify all transactions in the market. In addition, the Official FX Window at the CBN was closed to ensure a level-playing field in the pricing of foreign exchange.\" \nMeanwhile, FBN Holdings was the top decliner on the MSCI frontier market index, down 5.15 percent, followed by Guinness Nigeria, by 5 percent, and Dangote Cement and Guaranty Trust Bank, which were both down by 4.98 percent.
