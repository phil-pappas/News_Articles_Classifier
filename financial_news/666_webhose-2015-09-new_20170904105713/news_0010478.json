Interested parties can visit QPMC's Head Office or visit the company's website http://www.qpmc.qa/ for terms and conditions of sale. \n\nThe Public Works Authority (Ashghal) and QPMC had recently signed a framework of agreement and according to the agreement, QPMC will supply Ashghal with 91mn tonnes of gabbro and limestone for next five years. \n\nTo support the growing demand of aggregate for Qatar's infrastructure development, QPMC is increasing the capacity of the bulk materials with Gabbro Berth Terminal in Mesaieed Port, which will have an unloading capacity of 34 million tons a year by \n201 6 through the conveyor stacker system.\n\nQPMC has also revealed lately the launch and full operation of a second jetty at Lusail. QPMC's second and newly added jetty is located in the Lusail city, where many construction projects are taking place. QPMC's jetty will supply 3mn tonnes of construction material per year to support all construction work in the new city.\n\nLusail jetty meets the needs of the large-scale projects in the City. Its former capacity was about 500 tons per hour, and with the new expansion, the handling and unloading capacity of the port has gone up to about 1,000 tons per hour, and it is aimed at reaching a discharge capacity of 3 million tons per year. \n\nThe company also disclosed the allocation of 250,000 thousand square meters of temporary unloading and storage area near the Lusail jetty to receive and store the next gabbro loads to Qatar from September 1 of the current year 2015.\n\nQPMC has set up two floating jetties in Ras Laffan to supply the needed primary materials. The jetties consists of two floating docks each that accommodate 4 barges with an extra dock that can accommodate an extra marpol jetty (totaling up to 5 barges) with a handling capacity of 12,000 tons each, with total port receiving capacity of 9 tons a year, pointing out that the port operates around the clock and boasts a gabbro storage area of 1,800,000 meters.\n\nQPMC's conveyor belt facility in Mesaieed is one of the largest in the Middle East, the first of its kind in the region and one of the mega projects in the world in this area. Conveyor belts, expected to be completed this year and are being set up for up to 5 kilometers starting from the port leading to the storage area using the latest equipment. They will be operating around the clock to deliver gabbro all over Qatar. \n\nConveyor belts will also be set up in the Mesaieed area, in the first quarter of 2016. The unloading and storage facility for the project in Mesaieed has an area of 1,000,000 square meters.\n\nWhile QPMC has a cutting edge Cement Silo plant, once operational, during the first quarter of 2016, the plant equipped with cutting edge technology, will be able to load 1,000 tonnes of cement per hour and is designed to \n\ndischarge 1.8 million tonnes of cement per year into the 12 silos (circular structure for storing bulk materials) with the total storage capacity of 60,000 cubic metres.\n\nQPMC was set up in 2006 on the instruction of the Qatari Government with the mandate to boost the efficiency of port facilities used to import construction materials, primarily aggregates including limestone, gabbro, sand and other free-flowing bulk construction materials. QPMC is driven by three key values, quality, reliability and \nefficiency. \n\nAbout QPMC \nQPMC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:17:13.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
