The one-year expectation was also down, to 2.79 percent from 2.96 percent.\nBoth price measures have edged lower since the survey began in mid-2013, reflecting broader data showing spot U.S. inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target.\nThe central bank wants to be reasonably confident that prices will rebound in order to hike interest rates, a move that could come as soon as Thursday.\nThe survey taps about 1,200 respondents on a 12-month rotating basis.
