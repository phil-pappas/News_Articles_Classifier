The trend measure, which is a smoothed out version of seasonally adjusted, showed that lease financing was down by 0.1 per cent. The value of new personal loans fell 2.6 per cent in July to $7.36 billion. Commercial loans, which include investor housing finance, fell 2.7 per cent to $46.31 billion, according to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Housing finance for owner occupiers rose 2.2 per cent to $19.23 billion.
