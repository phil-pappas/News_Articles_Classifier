They can’t,” Rove wrote. “That’s why any Republicans who engineer a shutdown will be unwitting allies of the abortion movement.” Rove, former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, cited recent polls that indicated majorities of the public oppose cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood and oppose a government shutdown that would result from the defunding strategy. ADVERTISEMENT He also reiterated that the GOP’s favorable rating plummeted to a record low of 28 percent after the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013, arguing Republicans did not prevail in last November’s midterm elections because of that shutdown. If it happens again, Rove said Planned Parenthood would benefit. He also pointed out that a regular funding package would only touch a small portion of the funding it receives from the government. “A shutdown would give Planned Parenthood an opportunity to play the victim, and the majority of taxpayer dollars it receives are from mandatory spending programs like Medicaid, which is not subject to a shutdown,” he said. Rove accused GOP presidential candidates who have called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood of engaging only in “self-promotion” because they’ve failed to propose a realistic game plan. “Life is too important to let the GOP’s suicide caucus damage the cause with such an ill-considered effort,” Rove said. Rove’s op-ed comes a day before the Senate is slated to vote on a government spending bill, lasting through Dec. 11, that would cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. Senate GOP leaders have acknowledged that Senate Democrats will likely block that bill. After that, McConnell is widely expected to file a “clean” funding bill that would continue to fund Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has not yet said whether he would take up a “clean” measure. He will meet with House GOP leaders Thursday and with the rest of the GOP conference Friday morning to discuss their plan.
