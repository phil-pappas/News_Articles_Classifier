Salem and the Alice B. Salem Family Trust. \nLoring was using a walker in August 2013 when he leased one of the apartment building’s rental units. After Loring fractured his left tibia in January 2014, he spent three months recovering in a skilled nursing facility while using a wheelchair. \nThe government alleges that after visiting Loring at the skilled nursing facility, Salem wrote a February 2014 letter to the facility saying that Loring was not capable of living independently, that he should be in a nursing home and that he could not return to the apartment using a wheelchair because it could damage the carpet. \nThe lawsuit alleges that Salem’s actions violated Loring’s rights under the Fair Housing Act. \n“The discriminatory actions of the Defendants were intentional, willful, and taken in reckless disregard of the rights of Mr. Loring,” the lawsuit said. \nA phone message left for Salem on Monday was not immediately returned.
