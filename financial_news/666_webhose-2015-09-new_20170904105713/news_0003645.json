The concerned automakers are Tesla Motors, Inc. TSLA, Volkswagen AG VLKAY, Daimler AG’s DDAIF Mercedes-Benz, Tata Motors Limited’s TTM Jaguar Land Rover, Suzuki Motor Corp., Volvo Trucks and Spartan Motors Inc.\nPer the reports, Takata recently informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) that it supplies airbags with ammonium nitrate propellant to these automakers. The propellant is touted to be one of the possible reasons for the malfunctioning airbags.\nHence, the regulatory body contacted these companies, seeking their response on the possible impact that a wider recall would have on them. The letters also aim to find out the number of vehicles of these automakers carrying Takata airbags with ammonium nitrate propellant.\nEarlier, 11 automakers, including the likes of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. HMC, BMW, Toyota Motor Corp. TM and General Motors Co. GM, had announced recalls due to the malfunctioning airbag inflators.\nThe defective airbags can explode, shooting metal fragments and injuring passengers, in case of a car crash. There have been at least 8 fatalities and 100 injuries globally due to these faulty airbags. Around 4.4 million inflators have already been replaced in the U.S. However, some of these have only been repaired with the help of a temporary solution and may require a further replacement.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
