It should come to $4.5 billion this year,\" said Patrick Corcoran, spokesman for the US National Association of Theatre Owners. \nDergarabedian attributed the box office uptick to the diverse slate of movies on offer and the need for audiences to seek entertainment outside the home. \n\"Jurassic World,\" the long-awaited fourth installment in the blockbuster dinosaur franchise launched by Steven Spielberg in 1993, has already taken in $643 million in North America and $1.6 billion globally, putting it right behind \"Avatar\" and \"Titanic.\" \n\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" has for its part grossed $457.7 million in North America and $1.4 billion worldwide. \nAnimated films \"Inside Out\" and \"Minions,\" musical comedy sequel \"Pitch Perfect 2\" and music biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" which charts the rise and fall of the iconic hip-hop group N.W.A., also contributed to this summer's box office success. \nBeyond the quality of the movies on offer this summer, Corcoran said movie theaters are also going all out to draw in audiences. \n\"In the last decade and a half, there has been some enormous changes in the cinema experience -- in auditoriums, recliner seats, very large screens, food and alcohol serving,\" he said. \n\"3D has also been a useful addition to box office attendance,\" he said. \n\"And the mix of movies means there is a little something for everyone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:53:19.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
