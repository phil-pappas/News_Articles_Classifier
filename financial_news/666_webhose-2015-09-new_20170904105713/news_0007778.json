Written by: Brian O'Connell 09/18/15 - 11:44 AM EDT More Headlines Ready for the Robo-401(k)? \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Adjustable rate mortgages , the bane of consumer advocates, and the trap door for hundreds of thousands of homeowners who saw their mortgage payments rise in the heat of the Great Recession, are staging a comeback. \"Now there are signs that adjustable rate mortgages, which faded out of sight a few years ago, may be achieving a new life of sorts,\" says Michael Moskowitz, president of Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender in New York. \"Some borrowers see them as a way to save money and to make it easier to qualify for a mortgage.\" Mostly, ARMs are rallying around larger mortgages. The Wall Street Journal reports that ARMs comprised 22% of all mortgages between $417,000 and $1 million in 2013, but that rate jumped to 31% in 2014, and continues to climb. Moskowitz says adjustable rate mortgages work best if you only plan to live in a home for a short period of time. In that case, an ARM is worth it. \"If you have a choice between a 30-year fixed loan at 3.82% and a hybrid 5/1 ARM, which stays fixed for five years, at 3.32%, the savings over the first five years can save big bucks on mortgage payments,\" Moskowitz says. Those who may want to consider ARMs include those who work for a company that moves people around every five years or so or those who are planning to sell their home in five years and move to Florida, he adds. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:46:48.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
