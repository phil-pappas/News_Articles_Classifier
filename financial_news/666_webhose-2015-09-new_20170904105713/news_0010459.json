(FET) is pleased to announce the signing of a contract with Egyptian Refining Company (ERC) to engineer, design and build eight Edge™ II desalters. The desalters will be utilized in the Cairo Oil Refinery Company’s expansion project near Cairo. The units are scheduled for completion April 2016 and have a contract value of more than $20 million. \nForum’s proprietary Edge II technology has been used in many refineries around the world and maximizes desalting performance and feedstock capacity while minimizing demulsifier and solids-wetting chemicals of most chemical suppliers. The desalters also utilize Forum’s Kick Amp Responder (KAR) technology. KAR allows operators to achieve better optimization and efficiency by controlling the output voltage of any crude or desalting coalescing operation using the existing electrostatic setup. \nAbout Forum Energy Technologies \nForum Energy Technologies is a global oilfield products company, serving the subsea, drilling, completion, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry.
