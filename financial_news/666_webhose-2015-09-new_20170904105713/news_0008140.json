AP Share on twitter by Karen Maley The most important question confronting investors is whether the United States and Europe will remain insulated from the economic turmoil that is now sweeping through the emerging markets .\nJanet Yellen, who chairs the US Federal Reserve , is confident that the prospects for the world's largest economy \"appear solid\", clearing the way for an interest rate rise by the end of the year.\nIn a speech last Thursday, Dr Yellen acknowledged that the Fed was keeping a close eye on what she described as \"developments abroad\", before adding that that \"we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the US economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy\".\nDr Yellen's optimism appeared to be vindicated by revised US GDP figures released by the US Commerce Department on Friday , which showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 3.9 per cent annualised rate in the second quarter, after its disappointing 0.6 per cent pace in the first quarter.\nWhat's more, the stronger US jobs market appears to have increased the willingness of US consumers to open their wallets, which could help insulate the US economy as China's slowdown ripples across emerging markets. US consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of US GDP, grew 3.9 per cent in the second quarter.\nBut many analysts believe that the US central bank is being dangerously complacent about the resilience of the US economy. They argue that although direct US trade with emerging markets is limited, a slowdown in, say, European capital goods exports to China will inevitably translate into lower US exports to Europe.\nAnd the outlook for the emerging markets is continuing to darken. The preliminary Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index, a measure of Chinese factory activity, fell to 47 in September, its lowest reading since March 2009. At the same time, the Brazilian real plunged to a record low last week, and only rebounded when the country's central bank said it would use foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. And even though the Mexican peso is close to a historic low, the country is experiencing a severe slump in export sales.\nBut even if the US is able to withstand the effects of a sharp economic slowdown in emerging markets, the risk is that the continuing outflow of capital from emerging markets will result in increasing turmoil in financial markets, which will disrupt the US economic recovery.\n On the precipice Indeed, an increasing number of leading hedge fund managers are positioning their portfolios in the expectation that an emerging markets crisis will eventually spread to the United States.\n\"I think we are on the precipice of a liquidation in emerging markets, and this feels the way that the fourth quarter of 1997 felt,\" John Burbank, who runs the successful US hedge fund Passport Capital, said.\nMeanwhile, one of Britain's most highly regarded fund managers has moved heavily into cash. Crispin Odey, who founded the London-based hedge fund Odey Asset Management in 1991, says the turmoil in global stock markets, which erupted last month, is likely to continue.\n\"Our overriding conviction is that we are nearer the beginning of this process than the end,\" he warned clients in his latest report. Sharemarket valuations around the world \"are so overextended that they will need to fall 30-40 per cent\" before they represented compelling value.\nBut even without a global sharemarket rout, it's clear that US and European manufacturers of capital goods are already feeling the squeeze from collapsing sales in many emerging markets.\nLast week, US heavy equipment maker Caterpillar , whose bright yellow trucks and bulldozers are seen as a key indicator of health of the global economy, shocked investors by cutting its 2015 sales forecast and predicting a further drop in revenue in 2016. This would mark the first time in its 90-year history that the group has suffered four straight years of falling sales.\nThe Illinois-based group, which generates 60 per cent of its pre-tax profit outside the United States, has been hard hit by the slowdown in the global mining and energy sectors. In response to falling sales, Caterpillar unveiled plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs by 2018. The group has already slashed its global workforce by 31,000 since mid-2012.\nAnd the woes of the capital goods producers show little sign of abating as slower growth in China has translated into lower prices for oil, copper, iron ore and other commodities.\nResources giant BHP Billiton is planning to cut capital and exploration expenditure by $US2.5 billion ($3.6 billion) to $US8.5 billion this financial year, while the French oil and gas giant Total has said it will cut capital spending – which hit a peak of $US28 billion in 2013 – to between $US20 billion and $US21 billion from 2016, and to between $US17 billion and 19 billion a year from 2017 onwards.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-27T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:09:39.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
