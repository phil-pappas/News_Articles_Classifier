To receive the LEED certification, building projects must satisfy prerequisites and earn points to achieve different levels of certification.\nThe arena was a joint venture between NH Architecture and Populous, while Lend Lease was the managing contractor and builder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:23:41.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
