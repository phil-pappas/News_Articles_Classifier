But that didn&apos;t happen during August&apos;s carnage, at least for the currencies in the DXY index.\nA mitigating factor in this instance is that the upheaval has been limited to financial markets, rather than the real economy. In the event that economic conditions were deteriorating notably around the globe - think widespread contractions and not just slower growth - the dollar could potentially reclaim its safe-haven status.\nAnd in the wake of the Great Recession, which elicited a high degree of unconventional monetary policy in response, the weaker U.S. dollar, lower bond yields, and subdued growth outlook fostered a pick-up in the use of the greenback as a funding currency. That is, traders would sell U.S. dollars and use the proceeds to purchase higher-yielding foreign assets in what is commonly known as a carry trade.\nDue to the fact that longer-dated U.S. Treasuries command a sizable premium relative to most debt denominated in other major currencies, the greenback&apos;s role as a funding currency has been largely supplanted by the euro.\n\"At the moment, significant further dollar strength is dependent on both longer-dated U.S. yields and equities rising.,\" writes Juckes. \"That’s possible on a quiet day like today, but if we get back to more risk-averse markets, the dollar is unlikely to out-perform the yen and euro, even as all three do well against everything else.\"\nThe phenomenon was on full display for a key moment early this morning. European stock markets plunged on the open, dragging down S&P 500 futures and the dollar down relative to the euro in tandem.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i5nBTpuKIgpA/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iuc6DPcE0L.Q/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-09-22T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:18:47.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
