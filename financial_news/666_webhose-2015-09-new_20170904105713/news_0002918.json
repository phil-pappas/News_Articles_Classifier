Photo: Christian Sprogoe Photography\nBHP and Rio Tinto would have to trim their dividends in coming years due to crashing commodity prices, according to research released on Monday by Macquarie, with Rio tipped to be the better performer of the two.\nBoth companies remain committed to progressive dividend policies, in which dividends rise in line with earnings per share.\nThe dividends would continue, said Macquarie. But the bank nevertheless trimmed its forecasts for both companies.\nFor BHP, \"we now only factor a flat payment of $US1.24 a share for the next three years, a payment of $US6.5 billion\".\nAdvertisement For Rio, \"we have reduced our dividend growth assumptions ... with our dividend compound annual growth rate reducing from 4 per cent to 2 per cent over the next three years.\"\nBHP's dividend per share in 2015, averaged over 12 months, was $1.68. Rio's interim 2015 dividend per share was $1.44.\nBut while the dividends should keep coming, said Macquarie, \"on our forecasts neither BHP nor Rio generates sufficient free cash flow to cover the dividend payment.\n\"As such, both companies are expected to utilise their respective balance sheets to partially fund the dividend.\"\nThe cash flow shortfalls for the dividend for the next three years were $US5 billion for BHP, peaking in the first half of 2018, and $US3.5 billion for Rio, peaking in the second half of 2018.\nHowever, the picture for dividends could be a lot worse for BHP if current commodity prices persist, said the bank.\n\"At spot prices our cash flow forecasts for BHP remain below our dividend payment requirements, which as a result sees BHP's cumulative cash flow shortfall rise to over $US10 billion by 2020.\n\"Clearly, under this scenario BHP would need to either materially reduce capital expenditure or cut its progressive dividend.\"\nRio, by contrast, would do a lot better under current prices.\n\"Rio benefits significantly from the buoyant iron ore price and weak Australian dollar, which reduces its cumulative cash shortfall to just $US1.5 billion in 2017 and 2018. Rio would be 'back in the black' in terms of dividend coverage by 2020.\"\nIn order to maintain their progressive dividend, both BHP and Rio would have to take on substantial amounts of debt â€“ $US5 billion for BHP and $US4 billion for Rio.\nBut at current commodity prices, it's a different picture. BHP would require $US10 billion and Rio just $2-3 billion, said Macquarie.\nAs well, BHP would have to slash capital expenditure.\n\"We expect BHP would make further cuts to its petroleum drilling budgets, potentially reducing the shortfall by as much as $US1 billion per annum, should oil prices remain at current levels.\"\nTaking on more debt to finance dividends could cause credit rating downgrades to BHP and RIO, said Macquarie. But the impact would not be too bad: \"the immediate impact of additional borrowing costs is limited, equivalent to a $US1.10 per tonne increase in the iron ore cost of production for BHP and $US0.50 per tonne for Rio over the next 12 months.\"\nMacquarie maintained its outperform ratings on both companies, with a preference for Rio. \"Given the spot price scenario significantly favours Rio, we maintain our preference for Rio over BHP despite the absence of a material valuation gap on our base case forecasts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:26:22.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
