Already the number-one pre-school property in the UK, Australia, Spain, Mexico and Brazil, and a leader in other territories around the world, the growth opportunities for Peppa Pig are big.\" \nMr Throop believes the group can double retail sales generated by the pink cartoon porker, which currently stand at around $1bn a year. The lion's share of sales are royalties paid by licensees across a number of categories, such as toys, clothing and DVDs. \nThe acquisition follows speculation last month that Entertainment One was being offered for sale to media giants including Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) and Vivendi (Milan: VIV.MI - news ) as its investors seek to capitalise on strong global demand for content rights. \nAdvisers to the FTSE 250 company were approached by potential bidders in recent months, according to sources (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:19:05.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
