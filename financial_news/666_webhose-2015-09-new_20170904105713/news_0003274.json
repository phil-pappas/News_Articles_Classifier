They have all these levers to pull which they aren't even as data gets more negative.\"\nGlobal financial markets have been rattled in recent weeks by fears that China's slowdown could be a drag on sluggish global growth, prompting some investors to bet that the U.S. central bank will delay a rate hike until the end of the year.\nAt 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.33 points, or 0.18 percent, at 16,282.9, the S&P 500 was up 2.98 points, or 0.15 percent, at 1,945.02 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.84 points, or 0.29 percent, at 4,770.37.\nSix of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher with the energy index's 0.79 percent rise leading the advancers. Apple's 0.8 percent rise was the biggest boost on the three major indexes.\nData released on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting a moderation in job growth in August was an aberration. Initial claims fell by 6,000 to 275,000.\nPalo Alto Networks was up 4.3 percent at $172.36 after the cyber security company reported its strongest revenue growth in 10 quarters and forecast better-than-expected growth in the current quarter.\nKrispy Kreme Doughnuts fell 16.4 percent to $14.83, a day after the doughnut chain cut its 2016 profit forecast.\nLululemon Athletica was down 7.6 percent at $59.37 after the yogawear retailer's gross margins continue to be under pressure as it spends more on product development and sourcing.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,387 to 1,191. On the Nasdaq, 1,180 issues rose and 997 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 3 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 3 new highs and 20 new lows.
