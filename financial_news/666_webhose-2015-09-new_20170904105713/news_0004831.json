He denies any wrongdoing. \nA year after HP acquired Autonomy it took an $8.8bn writedown on the acquisition, the majority of which it attributed to the alleged fraud by Dr Lynch and his chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain. \nKPMG due diligence specialists highlighted issues in the Autonomy accounts such as “sell in vs sell through”. \nThe report said: “Target [Autonomy] recognises revenue for licence sales upon sell-in to its VARs [resellers] rather than on a sell-through basis to end customers.” \nThe accountants also appeared to warn HP that Autonomy’s growth rate would be lower if American accounting standards were applied. \nThey also flagged up the fact that Autonomy sold hardware, another area in which HP said it was defrauded. \nDr Lynch said this also strengthened his defence, although KPMG’s report said Autonomy “will ship its software pre-installed on hardware to its customers”, while HP’s allegations focus on sales of hardware without software. \nThe due diligence report has been made public after a protracted legal battle in California between HP and shareholders, who sued its management over the Autonomy disaster. \nDr Lynch said: “It’s a great shame that HP has slowed releasing these key documents when they make it absolutely clear that it knew how Autonomy was functioning.” \nHe is due to file his formal response to HP’s claims at the High Court within weeks. \nA spokesman for Hewlett-Packard said: “Mike Lynch and Sushovan Hussain conducted a systematic and sustained scheme to make Autonomy look like a rapidly growing, pure software company whose performance was consistently in line with market expectations. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was a lie. \n“HP had no knowledge of Lynch and Hussain’s contrived sales to value-added resellers and other improper transactions and accounting practices, all of which artificially inflated Autonomy’s reported revenues, misrepresented its rate of organic growth and overstated its gross and net profits.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T23:42:51.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
