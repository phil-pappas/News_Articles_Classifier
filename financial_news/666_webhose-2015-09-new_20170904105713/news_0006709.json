That's on top of the $152.5 million A-B has spent on Super Bowl ads since 2010 (far outspending No. 2 Chrysler's $89.5 million) and on top of the countless millions the brewer has spent on Super Bowl exclusivity during the last three decades. There's a reason you see almost solely Budweiser or Bud Light ads during the Super Bowl, and it's the amount of money A-B is willing to pay to make that monopoly possible. \nAll that said, this doesn't stop competitors including AB-acquisition target SABMiller and MolsonCoors joint venture MillerCoors from airing ads during games or from serving beers at their stadiums (as Coors has in Denver , for example). More Headlines Say Goodbye To Craft Beer As You Know It \nHowever, even as the league realizes that it has to do something spectacular to pry fans out of homes filled with high-definition screens, cheap and plentiful snacks and beverages and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket supplementing games on every broadcast network and ESPN, discounting hasn't been the answer. Otherwise, NFL owners have been content to boost average ticket prices 2.1% from 2014 to nearly $86 this year, according to Team Marketing Report . That's nearly triple the cost of the average Major League Baseball ticket. \nThat's also before you factor in the cost of taking a family of four to the game and, well, introducing a future generation of potential customers to a live-game experience. The average cost to take a family of four to a game, park, have a beer, hot dog and soda and go home with a program and a cap also jumped 0.5% to nearly $481. \nEven the lure of beer buying hasn't swayed the league. After prices dropped to roughly 41 cents an ounce in 2013 from 43 cents an ounce a year before, they're up to roughly 46 cents per ounce this year. That's still $7.42 for little more a pint and scarcely a concession for fans feeling squeezed by ticket prices and taxpayer-funded NFL stadiums. \nWith help from Team Marketing Report's Fan Cost Index , we found the 13 lowest beer prices in the league and the teams that are raising a toast to their beer-loving fans: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:08:14.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
