Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Disgraced former Labor MP Craig Thomson misused more than $300,000 from the Health Services Union, spending union funds to pay for escorts and his campaign to enter federal parliament, the Federal Court has found.\nFederal Court judge Christopher Jessup found Mr Thomson improperly used his position as the HSU's national secretary to gain an advantage for himself, including spending about $4700 on escorts in 2005 and 2006.\nThe bulk of the expenditure charged to the HSU related to his campaign for the seat of Dobell at the 2007 election, including advertising, campaign mailouts, office costs, printing and the employment of two staffers.\nJustice Jessup found Mr Thomson entered the HSU into a $96,000 three-year sponsorship of Central Coast Rugby League, but executed the contract without the authority of the union's national executive or national council.\n\"It is, in my view, unthinkable that a responsible manager or administrator, especially one in charge of a trade union, would commit his or her organisation to a liability of this size without reference to higher authority,\" Justice Jessup said in a judgment on Friday.\nHe found Mr Thomson caused the HSU, without its knowledge, to make a series of donations to advance his preselection prospects, including $5,000 for the \"Central Coast Convoy for KIds, a fundraising event run by the Transport Workers Union.\nThe Fair Work Commission had sought more than $243,000 in compensation plus penalties for 48 alleged breaches of federal law and 15 breaches of union rules.\nMr Thomson walked out of the civil proceedings in March after asserting hat his mental health problems were too severe for him to continue. He said he was not in a position to pay fines.\n Last year, he was found guilty of 13 charges of theft by the County Court, and ordered to pay a $25,000 fine.\nJustice Jessup said Mr Thomson sought to conceal the use of $2475 in HSU funds on escorts by describing the expense as 'meetings'. He said this action was the \"clearest of improprieties\" and was \"conspicuously calculated\" to deliver him an advantage.\nJustice Jessup said the natural inference is that Mr Thomson also used HSU funds to pay for services at a Sydney brothel, Tiffany's Girls, in 2005. The amount charged was equal to the cost of a prostitute for 90 minutes in the brothel's Red Turbo Spa Room.\nFair Work Commission general manager, Bernadette O'Neill on Friday welcomed the court decision. Justice Jessup listed a hearing for November 9 to hear submissions on any financial penalties to be imposed on Mr Thomson.\nLast month, the Federal Court found another former HSU national secretary, Kathy Jackson, misused union funds and ordered her repay $1.4 million.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-11T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:52:34.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
