Manufacturing exports also contracted in August after three months of expansion, Ai Group said.\nThree of the eight manufacturing sub-sectors expanded: Food and beverages for a fifteenth month; wood and paper for a sixth month; and textiles, clothing, footwear, furniture and other manufacturing.\nThe progressive closure of local automotive assembly, and further declines in mining and other business investment in machinery and equipment “are heavily affecting other parts of manufacturing, with ongoing reports of business consolidation and closures”, Ai Group said.\n“Despite the benefits from a lower Australian dollar and higher residential building activity on some building-related segments of chemicals production, [mining sub-sector] respondents raised concerns about a decline in exports to the Asian markets in recent months,” it said.\n Food, drinks fuel manufacturing", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/manufacturing-sector-expands-as-strong-demand-bolsters-builders-food-and-beverage-makers/story-fni0dcne-1227507601396"], "published": "2015-09-01T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:45:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
