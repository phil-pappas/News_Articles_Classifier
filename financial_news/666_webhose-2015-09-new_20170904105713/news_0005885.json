Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Five months ago, our Prime Minister famously responded to distressing scenes of an unfolding refugee crisis in south-east Asia by saying \"nope, nope, nope\" to questions about whether Australia would help resettle a flotilla of Rohingya people adrift on the ocean.\n\"I'm sorry. If you want to start a new life, you come through the front door, not through the back door,\" Tony Abbott said.\nFive days ago, our Prime Minister was asked about the images of a little boy – who had also been seeking to start a new life – lying dead on a Turkish beach.\n\"It's obviously a crisis right now on the borders of Europe,\" he said, \"and I think a lot of people right around the world are looking at what we've done and said, 'Well, if Australia can stop the people smuggling trade, if Australia can end the deaths at sea, perhaps we can learn from them'.\"\nIt was the last time he tried to reduce the humanitarian crisis flowing out of Syria into a simple debate about Australia's success in stopping the boats.\nBecause events – and people on both sides of politics – have dragged him, and the country, into a new place on refugees. It's called the rest of the world. It is no longer just about boats and people smugglers, but about being compassionate, and being a global citizen.\nOn Sunday, the Prime Minister still looked like he was resisting at every step: announcing an increase in refugee spots, but only within an unchanged humanitarian program. That quickly became not enough when Labor called on Monday for an additional 10,000 spaces. This from a party that has been terrified to move first on asylum seekers for almost 15 years.\nEven on Wednesday the Prime Minister was still at pains to emphasise that the people being helped would be in minorities and women and children.\n Political implications The political implications of the turnaround are as stunning as the turnaround itself.\nDomestically, it reinforces the fact that Labor's change of position on boats in July has not only neutralised an issue that dogged the opposition, but given both sides space to look more generous.\nJust as important, however, has been how the conservative side of politics has trod in the past week.\nThe leadership has come from figures like Mike Baird and Jeff Kennett outside federal politics and an eclectic range of figures inside it, notably Western Sydney backbencher Craig Laundy and the Nationals' Barnaby Joyce.\nOf course they were matched by an appalling collection of Coalition figures on the other side of the debate.\nIt is a sign of the breakdown of the Prime Minister's authority that no one is really sure whether their interventions were authorised. It doesn't really help Abbott either way. If they weren't authorised, they tell us he can't control his MPs. If they were, it shows the Prime Minister on the wrong side of a debate that has well and truly jumped the fence and escaped him in the past week.\nOf course, the Prime Minister was still able to link the humanitarian crisis to an extension of military operations into Syria.\nSignificance of the shift But for a lot of MPs, the significance of the shift in the debate in the past week is that it might also mark the high mark of the push to make everything a national security issue.\nThe militarisation of border protection, MPs on both sides of politics say, might have just been that step too far.\nIf that is the case, the Prime Minister might be even more devoid of things to talk about now than he was a week ago.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/assylum_gallery_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-09-09T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:08:11.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
