The ECB is widely expected by analysts to keep interest rates, the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 0.05%, -0.205 and 0.30% respectively. \nHowever, ECB executive board member Peter Praet last week prompted rumours of further QE after saying: \"The ECB is ready to expand or extend its QE programme if needed, as a slump on commodity prices and risks to global growth threaten its inflation goal of 2%.\" The ECB has said it would continue QE until at least September 2016. \nPraet's remarks come amid growing concerns about China's slowdown which were heightened after the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) devalued its currency on 11 August. \nWeak inflation has added to speculation on a possible extension of QE, with data last week revealing the consumer price index remained at 0.2% in August. \nThe ECB governing council is due to meet in Frankfurt at 1330 BST for a press conference after the policy announcement at 1245 BST. President Mario Draghi will explain the latest decision and whether more QE could be on the cards. \n\"We expect the ECB to deliver a dovish message at the press conference on Thursday, although it remains uncertain whether recent developments have been significant enough to spur a boost to the QE programme,\" according to Barclays Research analysts. \nMeanwhile, Draghi is also likely to face questions about the situation in Greece ahead of the elections this month after former prime minister Alexis Tsipras resigned in August. \nTsipras stepped down to seek a new mandate for a bailout agreement he made with Greece's creditors under stringent conditions after months of difficult negotiations. \nLast week ECB official Ardo Hansson said the need for emergency liquidity assistance for Greece may ease as the country's outlook appears more upbeat. \n\"The agreement negotiated during the Eurozone summit in mid-July, restart of negotiations and reasonable easing of capital controls helped to increase the confidence of depositors so that the deposits' outflow from Greece was replaced with a small inflow, and the volume of ELA has slightly decreased,\" the governor of Estonia's central bank and member of the ECB's governing council, said on the bank's website. \n\"The development is fragile, but nevertheless positive. One could predict a further small decrease of ELA, if news from Greece will remain positive.\" Thursday 03 September INTERIMS Empresaria Group (LSE: EMR.L - news ) , Fairpoint Group (LSE: FRP.L - news ) , Forbidden Technologies (LSE: FBT.L - news ) , Total Produce (LSE: TOT.L - news ) INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Melrose Industries (Other OTC: MLSPF - news ) , St. Modwen Properties, Tyman (Other OTC: LPUSF - news ) , VPC Specialty Lending Investments INTERIM EX-DIVIDEND DATE 888 Holdings, Acencia Debt Strategies Ltd., Aggreko (LSE: AGK.L - news ) , AL Noor Hospitals Group, Amino Technologies (LSE: AMO.L - news ) , Amlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) , Arbuthnot Banking Group, ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , Avesco Group (Other OTC: AVGPF - news ) , Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) 8 3/8% Cumulative Irrd Preference 1, Baronsmead VCT 3, Baronsmead VCT 4, Baronsmead VCT 5, BlackRock Latin American Inv Trust, Capital & Counties Properties (LSE: CAPC.L - news ) , Capital Drilling Ltd (Stuttgart: C8D.SG - news ) .
