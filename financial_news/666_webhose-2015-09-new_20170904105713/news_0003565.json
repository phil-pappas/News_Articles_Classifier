And along with the strings of lights all over the place will be a set of emotions that accompany the presents we are supposed to give.\nA recent question from a reader provides an opportunity to talk about gift-giving expectations for all occasions. In this case, an upcoming wedding triggered the gift dilemma.\nThe background: The reader's niece is getting married. The bride and groom both work part time. The reader relayed that her niece had dropped out of college after a year and a half. The reader checked out her niece's bridal registry and was \"kind of blown away\" by the high-end items, including pots and pans that cost $200 each and Kate Spade dish towels.\n\"I sent my sister a gentle text about being surprised that Kate Spade even made dish towels,\" the reader wrote, \"and she responded saying, 'Don't buy her anything. I will get you the information on her student loans (which she has not been responsible about) and pay those down instead of buying her anything.' \"\nThe gift suggestion about the student loans didn't sit well with the aunt, who already is upset since she co-signed. \"My credit score is down 100 points because of it,\" she wrote.\nThe conflict: \"There are many issues here to deal with,\" the aunt explained, not the least of which is that when her own daughter got married several years ago, the reader's sister did not give a wedding present.\nShe continued: \"I know my sister has struggled financially since her divorce, so I didn't let it bother me. It just feels weird to pay down someone's student loans as a wedding gift. My husband thinks I shouldn't pay down the student loans. I am inclined to pay down something, but also get her some small items (no Kate Spade dish towels!). Any ideas?\"\nThe bottom line: Here's the crux of the family financial drama: \"My sister [is] basically asking me for money, when she did nothing - not even a card - for my daughter's wedding.\"\nThere are three issues as I see it: the student loans, the pressure to buy from a registry and retribution.\nThe student-loans problem shouldn't be lumped in with the whole gifting issue. The reader refers to the debt as \"someone's student loans.\"\nBut those are her loans, too. When you co-sign, you're not merely providing your good credit name as a reference. Paying the loans isn't a gift. It's her responsibility.\nIf I were the reader, I would sit down with my niece and talk about how we both are going to handle the debt going forward. It may be that the she has to make payments until the niece is in a financial position to pick them back up.\nAs for the gift registry, some people list big-ticket items they couldn't afford or they expect that perhaps a group of friends or relatives may share the cost. However, sometimes it does feel like registries are an excuse for the couple to be greedy. I routinely ignore what's picked out if I can't find something in my budget. A registry shouldn't be seen as a mandatory shopping list.\nBy the way, just because someone is underemployed or having financial troubles doesn't mean he or she shouldn't want nice things or even brand-name items.\nNow, let's address the core issue here. The reader is hurt that her daughter didn't receive a wedding present.\nGifts sometimes are interpreted as a symbol of what people think of you. But if the reader's sister and niece attended the wedding and wished the bride and groom well, shouldn't that count for as much as, if not more than, some gaudy gift?\nJudith Martin, the etiquette columnist known as \"Miss Manners,\" says a wedding invitation is not an invoice. Yes, it's a thoughtful gesture when people give. Nonetheless, be careful about your sense of entitlement whether it's for a wedding or the holiday season.\nI believe it's our presence - not presents - that matters most.\nYou might wonder: Well, should the reader in return simply attend the wedding and wish the couple well?\nIf she doesn't give a wedding gift, that's being ill-mannered.\nJust because you didn't get doesn't mean you shouldn't give. And if a family member fails to give, be gracious and remember it really is better to give than to receive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T05:43:33.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
