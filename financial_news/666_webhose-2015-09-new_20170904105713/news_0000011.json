We are committed to investing in our branch network to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\"\n\"Bank branches are here to stay. The more complex the issue, such as home loans or retirement plans, the more customers ask for direct, personal service.\n\"It was about empowering the customer to choose what they need and the bank to deliver,\" she said.\nThe new branch at 333 George Street, where the format is still being finalised, is expected to offer a range of ATMs that count change, allow direct deposits without cards and interactive internet banking. The bank will also cater for one-on-one contact for more complex businesses or home loans and financial services.\nThe owner of 333 George Street, Charter Hall's office fund, is developing a $250 million three-level retail and 15-storey office complex in the heart of the city opposite Martin Place. Both areas are set to be revitalised with a pedestrian mall for George Street and a multi-million dollar upgrade of Martin Place.\nThis follows from the rash of new international tenants coming into the City, with fast fashion and the major telcos, Vodafone and Microsoft, all calling Pitt Street Mall home.\nAlex Alamsyah, Knight Frank's senior director of retail and the retail leasing agent for 333 George Street, said Martin Place is once again becoming the financial hub of Sydney as landlords choose the strong covenants that banks offer.\n\"Major local and international banks, are returning to prime locations in the Sydney CBD, where high rents had previously forced them to make way for global retailers. The decision by NAB to locate their flagship at 333 George Street is a major boost for the revitalisation of Martin Place,\" Mr Alamsyah said.\n'With light rail coming to George Street and increased pedestrian access, the major banks are relocating back into the Martin Place.\"\nCharter Hall's head of development services office and industrial, Andrew Borger said the current development pipeline includes major office projects at 333 George Street, Western Sydney University, Parramatta and the recently announced new Aurizon headquarters in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:47:25.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
