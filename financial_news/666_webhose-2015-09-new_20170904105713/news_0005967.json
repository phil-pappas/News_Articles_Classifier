View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150929006512/en/ \nIn these select clubs, all will offer the Organic Estate Blend made with only the top 2% of Arabica coffee beans for a deliciously rich and full bodied coffee that has subtle hints of cocoa with a smoky flavor. Some clubs will also offer Fair Trade Organic Peruvian Coffee, which is roasted perfectly to bring out the Peruvian origin natural flavors of a subtle nutty undertone with some hints of fruit. \nMembers in the select 50 clubs will have the choice of two varieties and, across the nation, members have the choice of twelve that can be ordered online and freshly delivered right to their doorstep. With this program, Sam’s Club members can explore the various blends and single origin varieties that are sure to offer a wide range of coffee experiences. \nLuna Roasters owners and brothers, Douglass Barrow and Jason Barrow, are passionate about coffee and believe in understanding where coffee comes from. That is what separates Luna Roasters craft coffee from the larger commercial roasters. “We want to know about our coffee farms, we want to ensure every batch is perfectly roasted, and we care how our coffees are prepared,” says the Roastmaster, Douglass. Jason, President, goes on to say, “Sure, it takes more time and effort but we believe in the process and the extra effort because every coffee bean is not created equally and we want to ensure that people can taste the nuances different regions and roast types have to offer.” \n“Our members have asked us to bring them more organic options at the same high quality they expect from Sam’s Club. Our goal for this year is to double our organic offerings, and we’re on track,” says Bryant Harris, senior vice president for grocery at Sam’s Club. “The Luna Roasters coffee brand is a great fit for our members who shop the coffee aisle. The product is certified organic, innovative because it offers freshly roasted coffees in our clubs or online, and delivers a stellar quality at an amazing value.” \nAbout Sam’s Club \nSam’s Club ® , a division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
