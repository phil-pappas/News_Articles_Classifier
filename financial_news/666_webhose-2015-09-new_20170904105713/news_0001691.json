However the FTSEurofirst remained down by more than 1 percent from the end of last week. \nGermany's DAX, which has suffered this week due to the problems at Volkswagen, rose 3.2 percent but remains some 20 percent below a record high of 12,390.75 points in April. Some traders said they would look to play it safe by selling out on market rallies in case the market were to resume a downwards trajectory later. \n\"I think the best strategy for now is to sell into strength on the DAX,\" said Logic Investments' Ryan Mitchell. \nEuropean auto shares were the leading gainers with a bounce of 3.8 percent, while basic resources stocks and energy plays were lifted by higher commodity prices. \nVolkswagen, which has admitted cheating on exhaust emissions tests, rose 2 percent, although its shares are still down some 30 percent on the week. \nTraders said signs that VW would name Matthias Mueller, head of its Porsche sports car brand, as chief executive showed VW's determination to tackle the crisis. \nRival carmaker BMW also rose 4.6 percent after German car magazine Auto Bild clarified an earlier report to say it had no evidence of emissions data manipulation at the company. \nZodiac Aerospace slid 6.1 percent after media reports and an industry blog said the French company - which makes airplane seats and other equipment - had lost a contract with American Airlines (Xetra: A1G.DE - news ) , one of its main clients. \nHowever, France's benchmark CAC equity index rose 2.6 percent, partly boosted by data showing a French consumer confidence index at its highest level since October 2007. \nSome investors said they were positive on the longer-term outlook for European shares, despite the weak data coming out of China and a possible rise in U.S. interest rates. \nThey pointed to signs of an economic improvement in Europe, and stimulus measures from the European Central Bank as helping to support the region's stock markets. \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:43:46.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
