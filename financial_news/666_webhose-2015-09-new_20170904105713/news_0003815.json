Chinese customers value manuka honey highly for its medicinal benefits.\nCapilano removed its bulk-sized offerings in supermarkets, which created a de-facto price rise and was a key factor in the company's 70 per cent rise in full-year net profit to $7.8 million, UBS's co-portfolio manager Victor Gomes said.\n\"A lot of Australian farmers might be feeling the pinch from Woolies and Coles, but with significant export demand for your product, particularly when the Australian dollar goes down, the ability for the supermarkets to lever you effectively goes out the window,\" Mr Gomes said.\nARB Corporation If someone you know drives a four-wheel-drive, chances are they have an accessory from ARB. The bull-bar maker's share price has risen 16 per cent since the start of 2015 to $13.29.\nNot content to sell just to the tradie set, it has its sights set on overseas, aiming to boost foreign sales from 25 per cent of revenue now to 50 per cent.\nThe $1 billion company reported a 3.6 per cent rise in net profit to $44.1 million in 2014-15.\n\"It is a testament to the company. With the resources boom ending you would think the company would have a really tough 18 months, but such is the quality of the brand they've outperformed the market,\" Mr Wood said.\nBeacon Lighting If you find yourself humming \"it has to be Beacon\", you're well familiar with the lighting retailer. Shares in the family company have more than doubled since its April 2014 listing.\n\"The success of the Beacon IPO is really down to the wholesale conversion to LED lighting,\" Mr Wood said.\nThe company had tapped into the rising demand for LED lighting and had also benefited from the housing construction boom, he said.\nSeaLink Travel Group SeaLink operates the Kangaroo Island ferry and Captain Cook cruises in Sydney. The stock has risen 28 per cent from $1.95 in January to $2.50.\n\"Sealink is a well-managed company that is well positioned to leverage its brands, locations and assets as the Australian tourism sector grows with the rising in-bound trend,\" Prime Value Asset Management joint chief investment officer S.T. Wong said, adding the falling Australian dollar would give it a boost.\nAmaysim The recently listed mobile provider was the fourth-largest by subscribers, Mr Wong said. Amaysim would benefit from the trends of people bringing their phone to work and eschewing lock-in contracts.\nThe stock has risen 23 per cent since listing in mid-July, from $1.80 to $2.21.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-10T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:05:49.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
