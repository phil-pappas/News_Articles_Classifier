Brendan Esposito Share on twitter by Michael Smith They say charity begins at home but it also often ends in death. There is a huge disconnect in how people look at philanthropy when they are alive compared to what they leave behind when they die.\nThe role philanthropy plays in the intergenerational transfer of wealth will be a hot issue next week when more than 100 Australian not-for-profits and wealth advisers come together to look at some of the complex issues facing charities.\nThe issue deserves attention, given that Australia and the rest of the world are in the middle of the biggest transfer of wealth between generations in history and charities are in danger of missing out. The latest Wealth-X Report on the issue says $US16 trillion of global ultra-high-net-worth wealth will change hands in the next 30 years. About $US3 trillion of this is on Australia's doorstep in the Asia Pacific.\nResearch by fund manager Perpetual, which distributes more than $80 million to charitable trusts a year, found that while 89 per cent of Australians support a charity while they are alive, only 7.5 per cent actually leave anything behind in their estates. This is despite 29 per cent of people surveyed saying they would like to leave something behind in their wills.\nCaitriona Fay, Perpetual's national manager for philanthropy, says this is a disappointing figure and the gap can be narrowed. Research in the United Kingdom shows that when an adviser asked a client if they would like to leave something behind to charity, the rates of bequest rose from 5 per cent to 11 per cent.\n\"We don't necessarily have a culture of it across our advice organisations. Talking about someone's death is a difficult conversation at the best times, so raising charities and what an individual wants their community legacy to be can be a difficult conversation,\" Fay says.\nIt is an issue which the advice industry and charities want to tackle during Include A Charity Week next week. More than 100 not-for-profit groups and financial advisers and lawyers will be talking about some of the ways to wealthy individuals to pass on some of their fortunes when they die. At the moment, generation X and Y are the big winners, as the majority tend to leave everything to their families.\nThere is a push to give the advice industry more education about how to tackle the sensitive issue with clients. One issue complicating the debate is contestable estates.\n Victoria is in the process of tidying up estate laws, which means it will be harder for non-family members to contest estates, but Fay says there is also evidence that family members are increasingly contesting wills. That is a challenge for charities, which are reluctant to fight family members contesting a will because of the signals it sends out.\nThere are also statistics which show donation rates increase to 15 per cent if people are given examples of how relatively modest donations can lead to big things. You don't necessarily have to be Bill Gates or Paul Ramsay to have an impact.\nFay uses the examples of Miles Franklin, who left $17,000 which has become one of the country's biggest literary awards; Eliza Hall, who left funds which created the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research; and Vera Ramaciotti, who donated $15,000 to help Graeme Clark develop the prototype for the cochlear implant.\nCharitable donations in Australia have plateaued, but more money is now being given by fewer people. Corporate Australia has lagged behind the United States where there is a culture, largely driven by peer pressure on wealthy individuals, to make donations.\nInvestment structures called private ancillary funds (PAFs) account for the bulk of large-scale giving in Australia, but they have not delivered the levels hoped for. They were introduced by the Howard government in 2001 and offer tax breaks for charitable donations. The system was modified by the Rudd government in 2009 following a review designed to improve their integrity, although this created some uncertainty, which coincided with the financial crisis and a downturn in the number of funds being established.\nPrime Minister's Â­Community Business Partnership is looking at ways to improve philanthropy through different trust and tax structures.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:03:03.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
