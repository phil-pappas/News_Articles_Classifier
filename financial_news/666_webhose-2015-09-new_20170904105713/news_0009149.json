It infamously hung over the entrance to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. \nIn a statement Ronan said: \n“I apologise for any offence which has been caused by quoting the phrase ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ at the end of my submission to the Oireachtas Banking Inquiry. It was genuinely unintended. \n“The reason for the quote I believed (perhaps mistakenly) was evident from the context of my submission – Nama promised its borrowers that they would be treated fairly if they co-operated, but that unfortunately was not the case; co-operating businesses, including Battersea Power Station, Treasury Holdings and our China business (Forterra Trust) were destroyed, with all the consequences of that for Irish jobs and the taxpayer.” In my view Nama operated outside the law with no regard for people’s legal or constitutional rights. The significance of this and continuing anger I feel over what occurred is not however comparable with the horrors perpetrated by the Nazi regime. I recognise that I used an inappropriate analogy in my submission and have written to the Oireachtas Banking Inquiry to request the offending phrase be removed. \nFormer Justice Minister Alan Shatter, who is Jewish, had said it was “beyond my personal comprehension that the notorious and diabolically misleading” statement would be used by an “internationally known Irish businessman”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T10:03:39.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
