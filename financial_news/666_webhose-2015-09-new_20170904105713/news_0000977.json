Stewart’s brother Michael Parnell, a food broker on behalf of Peanut Corp, was sentenced to 20 years. \nPeanut Corporation of America operates a large processing plant in Blakely, Georgia and it is here where the criminal action originated. According to the prosecution, the Parnell’s were each involved in what is officially a case of federal conspiracy due to knowingly shipping salmonella- tainted food from the plant and into the hands of consumers. \nIn a related sentence, U.S. District Judge Louis Sands handed down a five year prison term to Mary Wilkerson, a quality control manager at the plant, for obstruction. \nThe trial against the Parnells and others took place last year and lasted nearly seven weeks. According to prosecutors, Stewart and Michael Parnell were fully aware of salmonella contamination at the plant, but went ahead and shipped the peanuts anyway. The lawsuit even claims that the Parnells covered up the results of laboratory tests confirming contamination by issuing fake certificates in their place. \nThe Parnells claim they did not know about the danger and family members claim that they even consumed the peanuts from the supposedly tainted batches. Stewart Parnell’s daughter, Grey Parnell, said that her own family ate the peanuts regularly, which should prove that there was no intended harm toward the public. \n\"No one thought that the products were unsafe or could harm someone. Dad brought them home to us. We all ate it\", said Gray. \nStewart Parnell, who still maintains his innocence, was understandably anxious to put the ordeal behind him. \n“This has been a seven-year nightmare for me and my family. I’m truly, truly sorry for what’s happened”, he said.
