AP One new app in iOS 9, the News app, may even change the way you interact with news articles like this one. It's a news aggregation app not unlike the Android/Windows/iOS news app Flipboard, which monitors what you read and adjusts the news it shows you to suit your tastes.\nOther features in iOS 9 include a split-screen mode for iPads, similar to the split screen in Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows 10 and in Samsung devices, that lets you look at more than one app at the same time â€“ something Apple users have been crying out for, but which Apple has only now acquiesced to, perhaps because it's going to be pitching its huge iPad Pro tablet as a productivity tool for multitasking business professionals.\nLike the stylus, the iPad Pro is something else that Apple said it would never make: a tablet designed to work like a notebook PC. But with tablet sales having flattened out, Apple is pressing the iPad into the corporate market. At the launch of the iPad Pro, it even had Microsoft executives up on stage, showing off new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel designed just for the device. The crowd didn't know whether to cheer or boo. For a moment it did both.\nBut Apple's biggest iOS device continues to be the iPhone, and its biggest new feature is 3D Touch.\n 3D Touch isn't an entirely new technology for Apple. It introduced it under another name, \"Force Touch\", when Apple launched its Watch and MacBook devices earlier this year. But now on the iPhone 6S and the larger 6S Plus, 3D Touch adds a new level of control to the phone, which can now measure how hard a user is tapping or pressing on the screen, and adjust its response to suit.\nApple demonstrated the iPhone's phone dialler app behaving differently according to the force applied. A light press on the screen brought up a \"peek\" of the dialler that let the user quickly place a call to a favourite contact without having to dive fully into the app. A harder press, which Apple calls a \"pop\", fully opened the app. Similarly, a light press on an email previewed it, and a hard press opened it.\nApple also demonstrated a video game for the iPhone, in which players pressed down on the screen to zoom the sights of whatever weapon they were shooting, and in which pressing harder still changed the weapon.\nWhere many of the new features in the new iPhones are simply catching up with features that owners of other phones have had for years (the 12 megapixel camera on the iPhone wouldn't even have been a market leader two years ago, at least in terms of sheer pixel count), 3D Touch is something only Apple has.\nIn its battle against Android, a battle in which Apple has been getting the upper hand of late, 3D Touch could prove to be one of its best weapons yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:06:17.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
