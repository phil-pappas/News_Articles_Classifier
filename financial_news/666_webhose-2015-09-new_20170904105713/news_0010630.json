It made a profit in the previous year of 342.7 million pounds.\nIts first-half pretax profit before exceptional items fell 26 percent to 96.7 million pounds due to the pension problem and higher costs at the John Lewis department stores business.\nUnderlying trade at John Lewis was solid, up 3 percent in the half, as strong demand for fashion and home products offset weakening demand for items such as tablets and TVs.
