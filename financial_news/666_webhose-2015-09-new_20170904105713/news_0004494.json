This decision delivered the company's assets into the arms of Seven due to its control of Nexus' debt.\nVoelte is suing the ABC for defamation claiming that a report by one of its programs The Business implied he had breached his duty to Nexus and its investors.\n\"It seems to me to be plainly suggested that Mr Volte, in making the move he is reported to have made, deserted Nexus Energy contrary to the interests of the shareholders of that company,\" said a Supreme Court judgment in February this year that turned down the ABC's application to strike out some of Voelte's imputations.\nThe matter is still before the courts.\nFly guy CBD suspects Voelte will not be flying in for any of the court dates, not with his beloved Nebraska Cornhuskers about to kick off their NFL season.\nWhile running the show at Seven, Voelte would head back to the States for a long weekend to catch the Cornhuskers, or baseball games involving his Kansas City Royals, depending on the season.\n\"I've been known to take off on Virgin Friday afternoons, get to LA Friday morning, get to Lincoln, Nebraska, watch the game on Saturday, come back Sunday night,\" he once told a gathering in Sydney.\nThis did leave a small gap in his working week, which did not always go unnoticed it seems.\n\"And then Kerry [Stokes] asks me, 'Where were you at yesterday?' on Tuesday morning,\" said Voelte.\nNot so EZ That $US80 million pay day might be looking a little optimistic for former Bank of Queensland boss Stuart Grimshaw , but at least he is keeping busy since joining Texan pay day lender EZCorp.\nOn Thursday, Grimshaw was appointed chairman of its Perth outpost, Cash Converters, which is facing further class action lawsuits and abandonment by our major banks.\nGrimshaw replaces Reginald Webb as chairman at Cash Converters, which got the kind of publicity that money can't buy with its recent appearance on the ABC's Four Corners .\nHe will be helping to review the whole operation, including its board, aided by new CEO Mark Reid who replaces the long-serving Ian Day .\nReid walked away from Greenstone Financial Services on Monday, two months after its $1 billion float flopped and one year after he joined Greenstone as boss.\nHe was expected to pocket $15.5 million from the aborted float.\nAt least Reid knows where to go for a loan if he needs some spare cash until the next pay packet rolls in.\nSeek disruption Team CBD are putting in our last-minute application for the 2015 Talent Unleashed Awards in Sydney this Friday to unearth our most \"disruptive tech entrepreneurs\".\nIt will the latest stop on Richard Branson 's Tour Downunder with Sir Rich (very rich) acting as a judge and providing the main prize, with finalists joining him at his British Virgin Islands getaway, Necker Island.\nYes, he owns the whole island.\nAlong for the ride will be Branson's right-hand man, Virgin Group CEO Josh Bayliss , as well as Seek boss Andrew Bassat .\nPax Qantas The industrial relations noise must be toning down a bit at Alan Joyce 's Qantas.\nThe airlines IR boss, Sue Bussell , is stepping down at the end of the year, but will remain in a part-time role.\nCBD thinks it is safe to assume that she won't be planning any tell-all tome on her role in the grounding of the Qantas fleet in 2011.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:52:22.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
