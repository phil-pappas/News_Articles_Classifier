Cathryn Tremain Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow The Melbourne Club, on the Paris-end of Collins Street, functions as a sanctuary from the modern world in the Victorian capital, a place redolent of an earlier, more confident age.\nThe conservative members-only club has everything a gentleman could want: a stuffed Bengali tiger hanging in the billiards room, the city's most handsome tree in the courtyard, a \"no phones\" rule â€“ and, once his application inevitably gets the tick from the Membership Committee, Peter Costello .\nThe club makes great sense for the former Treasurer. It's an easy stroll along Collins Street from his personal offices and those of the $117 billion Future Fund that he chairs .\nAnd, even better for the former Treasurer, Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger isn't a member. Costello's former lunch mate, now Liberal nemesis, is signed up to The Australia Club, which sits just over 1 km across the Melbourne CBD.\nRod Clement The pair, when they were friends and Australia Club members, used to catch up there regularly.\nBut now no single Melbourne club is big enough for the two of them.\nYou will remember back in 2012, Kroger publicly roasted his former friend live on both Jon Faine and Neil Mitchell 's radio programs, one after the other.\n\"Lunch with Peter is an agony. It's a nightmare,\" said Kroger. \"You sit there and listen to him unload on Howard.\"\n The gentry at the Melbourne Club disagree. Among the club's Costello supporters are former ANZ chairman Charles Goode and former Liberal Party vice-president Tom Harley .\nWhile Kroger is not a member, earlier this year he was invited to give an after dinner speech. The Napoleon fetishist spoke at some length about the Battle of Waterloo.\nUnless there is a rapprochement with the club's incoming member, we'd be surprised if he receives a similar invitation in a hurry.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/a-napoleonic-era-ends-as-liberal-powerbroker-michael-kroger-farewells-his-antique-empire-20111003-1l5e2.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/costello-kroger-tension-explodes-20120511-1ygjy.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-09-03T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:07:49.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
