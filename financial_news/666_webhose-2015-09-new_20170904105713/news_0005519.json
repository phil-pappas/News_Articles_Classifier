RSA, which has caught the eye of Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) , said the Swiss insurer has been made aware of the sales process in recent discussions and the transaction is not conditional on the outcome of their possible offer for RSA. \nChief executive Stephen Hester said: \"With RSA's focus on its largest markets in the UK & Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada, it has become increasingly clear to us that RSA is no longer the best strategic owner of these businesses. In Suramericana we have an experienced and committed regional player who can make the business a much more central part of their strategy.\" RSA added that the deal is expected to be strongly accretive to capital, enhancing its operational flexibility. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) added that the disposal is consistent with its stated target to substantially complete its strategic refocus by the 2015 year end results announcement. \nNomura said the disposal was \"incrementally positive\" for the Zurich/RSA deal to go through. \n\"LatAm was a low returning business, and although there will be slightly less synergies, we believe this overall creates more value for Zurich at possible offer price of 550p versus previously,\" it said. \nAt 0835 BST, RSA shares were up 1% at 508.50p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:03:47.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
