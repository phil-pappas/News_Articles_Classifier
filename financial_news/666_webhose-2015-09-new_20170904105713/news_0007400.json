Bradley Kanaris by Patrick Durkin, Michael Smith, Ben Potter Leading business figures broke ranks on Monday night to support Malcolm Turnbull's challenge , fed up with a lack of reform and political paralysis in Canberra.\nMillionaire businessman Dick Smith, Flight Centre chief executive Graham Turner and leading director James MacKenzie backed Mr Turnbull and argued that regardless of the result, a change in leadership style was needed.\n\"I think we do need a change in leadership,\" Mr Smith told The Australian Financial Review . \"I'm a friend of Tony Abbott, but he was elected on a platform of cutting red tape and all we've seen is more red tape. I notice New Zealand have a businessman as Prime Minister and they seem to be doing much better than us.\"\nMr Turner said Tony Abbott's \"lack of being able to get anything legislated\" had made things tough for business, \"including ours\".\nDick Warburton backs Abbott. \"It's an intolerable way of running the country. I'm just staggered that so many ministers would go to the press and do it all behind the cover of the press,\" he said. \"The hostile Senate doesn't help him, but the denial of climate change and what seems to be a total lack of interest in Australia's environmental future to me is very, very shortsighted,\" Mr Turner said. \"Also, there seems to be no obvious direction and no indication of working with other parties to get important reforms of all kind through Parliament – hard, of course, with the Senate being obstructive on most fronts.\"\nVictoria Funds Management Corporation chairman Mr MacKenzie – who last year audited the Victorian Labor government's economic policies – warned that business was fed up with the Abbott government's \"vindictive politics\".\n\"Business is looking for 21st century leadership, rather than hyperpartisan, vindictive and reactionary politics,\" the former Mirvac chairman said. Mr MacKenzie pointed to the \"vindictive\" policy of the Abbott government to remove directors who had been appointed by Labor when their term expired, a policy revealed by former CSIRO chair Simon McKeon and confirmed by Mr Turnbull earlier this year.\nGarry Weaven, the chairman of IFM Investors and former ACTU union boss, agreed with Mr Turnbull that a new style of leadership was needed in Canberra.\n Chairman of Victoria Funds Management Corporation and director James MacKenzie - who last year audited the Victorian Labor government's economic policies - warned that business was fed up with the Abbott government's \"vindictive politics\". Luis Ascui \"I think the issue is whether the next Prime Minister is Malcolm Turnbull or [Labor leader] Bill Shorten or Abbott; I definitely think there needs to be a different style of leadership and it definitely needs to be one that focuses on the opportunity for a greater degree of national unity,\" he said.\nOne leading managing director, who declined to be named, also welcomed Mr Turnbull's challenge against the Prime Minister. \"It can never be a bad thing to replace bad leadership with good leadership,\" he said.\nOther business figures called for an end to the political instability which has plagued the nation for past six years, warning it was damaging confidence in the economy and the most important outcome was a quick and clean result.\n\"I'm of the view that we've had political instability for too long, instability is not good for the economy and not good for confidence in Australia; the best outcome is there a quick resolution to it,\" said Paul Scurrah, chief executive of DP World Australia.\nEntrepreneur Dick Smith backs Turnbull. \"I'm a friend of Tony Abbott but he was elected on a platform of cutting red tape and all we've seen is more red tape.\" James Brickwood However, Dick Warburton, who was handpicked by Mr Abbott to lead the review of the renewable energy target and recommended deep cuts which proved politically unsaleable, said he still supported Mr Abbott.\n\"It's an intolerable way of running the country; I'm just staggered that so many ministers would go to the press and do it all behind the cover of the press,\" he said.\n\"I recognise the things that have led towards it, but I'm horrified, 2½ years later, we are going through the same thing again. It's just people talking out of place. Most of my colleagues feel the same way.\"\nFormer Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett also savaged Mr Turnbull in a series of tweets, suggesting he had more in common with failed Labor leader Kevin Rudd than the \"disciplined\" Liberal candidate for the Canning by-election, Andrew Hastie.\n\"Malcolm Turnbull, you self-centred, selfish individual,\" Mr Kennett tweeted. \"You and K Rudd have so much in common.. Pity you did not have the discipline that is represented by Andrew Hastie. If you win the spill you lose. You have ignored the Govts wins and put your own interests above all.\"\nProfessor John Phillimore, of the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy in Perth, said Canning Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie appeared to be the \"sacrificial lamb\" as the party determined its leader.\n\"If it turns out to be a Turnbull frolic and he loses, it will be viewed as instability. Even if Turnbull wins, there will be the inevitable changes to the government and it will take away all the oxygen from Hastie's campaign. If you were Andrew Hastie you would be pretty annoyed.\"\nWith Julie-anne Sprague, Jonathan Barrett, Mark Ludlow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:12:36.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
