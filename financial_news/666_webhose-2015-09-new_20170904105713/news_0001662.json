Data, mobile money and SMS are in progress. \nAccording to Uganda Communications Commission Executive Director Godfrey Mutabazi, Ugandans had no national IDs as plans for harmonisation were first brought into play in 2013. Kenya leads in the SIM card registration. \nIn 2013, millions of unregistered subscribers were switched off from the local networks and stringent measures put in place to penalise operators for unregistered SIM cards. \nRwanda and South Sudan are also tightening their SIM registration regulations to make them seamless across the borders.
