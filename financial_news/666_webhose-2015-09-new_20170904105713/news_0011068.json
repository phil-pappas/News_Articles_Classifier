BES, then Portugal's second largest bank, collapsed under the weight of its founding family's debts. It was the country's biggest ever financial collapse.\nPortuguese authorities hope to sell Novo Banco to recover some of the money and started the sale process in December and then opened exclusive talks with Anbang earlier in August.\nThe Bank of Portugal said a third-placed bid, made by China's Fosun International, was still valid. Fosun would only be invited for talks if negotiations with the second-placed bidder also failed.\nA Fosun spokesperson said: \"After the decision of Banco de Portugal, Fosun would like to reaffirm its strong commitment to Portugal ... We will continue to pay attention to new investment opportunities.\"\nNeither Apollo nor Anbang were immediately available for comment.\nAnalysts have said bids for Novo Banco could be limited by concerns about legal challenges launched by holders of commercial paper issued by the Espirito Santo group which was sold to BES clients.\nAlthough most of the BES rescue package came from public funds, the capital came via the Bank Resolution Fund, the joint responsibility of Portugal's banks, meaning any losses on the sale would be incurred by banks.
