The union leadership has authorization to call a strike if a deal is not reached. \n\"At this time there is no decision on extensions of the September 14 deadline,\" the UAW said in a statement Sunday. \nThe powerful union is currently renegotiating its contracts with all three big US automakers, FCA US, General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) and Ford. On Sunday the UAW tapped FCA as the 'lead bargaining company'. \nThat means that the deal reached with FCA will be used to shape the contracts at Ford and GM. \nThe union has historically ensured that its employees do not face competitive disadvantages by negotiating identical wages and benefits at the Detroit Three carmakers. \nThe lead or target company has more influence over shaping the contract, although minor details like work rules at specific plants are negotiated separately with each company. \n\"All three companies are working hard toward a collective bargaining agreement,\" UAW president Dennis Williams said Sunday. \nFiat Chrysler declined to comment on the status of the negotiations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:56:21.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
