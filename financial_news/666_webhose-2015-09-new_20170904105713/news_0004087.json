This represents more than €566 million worth of works involving some 5,975 contractors. The potential total cost to the Exchequer in respect of these properties is approximately €38.26m. The incentive generates employment in the tax compliant construction sector, increases sales and provides support for homeowners and landlords for building works. \nThis scheme provides a tax relief by way of an income tax credit on repair, renovation or improvement works on principal private residences or rental property carried out by tax compliant contractors. In addition to providing an income tax relief, the HRI also aims to support tax compliance in the building industry by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy. \nSeeing the success of the measure, and to provide some security to the sector, I’m announcing now my intention to extend the HRI for a further year, until 31st December 2016. This will allow extra time for homeowners and landlords to make the necessary changes to their properties, and provide additional support to the construction sector for another year.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:53:27.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
