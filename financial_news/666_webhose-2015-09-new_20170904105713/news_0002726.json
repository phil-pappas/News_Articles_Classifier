Energy giants blasted over failure to pass on wholesale cut AS Britain prepares for the coldest winter in 50 years, energy providers are once again under fire for rip-off bills. PUBLISHED: 00:17, Tue, Sep 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:16, Tue, Sep 22, 2015 GETTY Wholesale energy costs are falling \nSince January 2014 wholesale gas and electricity prices have plummeted by as much as 40 per cent. Over the same household energy bills, however, have fallen by a measly 10 per cent.
