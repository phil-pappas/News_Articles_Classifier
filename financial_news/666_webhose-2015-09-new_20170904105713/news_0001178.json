Traders can breathe a sigh of relief with the September Federal Reserve rate decision out of the way, but the guessing game over when the central bank will deliver a rate increase continues—and so will volatility for gold.\nAfter the Fed stood pat on rates Thursday —but also suggested that it’s still aiming for a hike later this year—gold futures GCZ5, +1.92% rallied in the overnight trading session and extended strong gains into Friday.\nRead: Why the Fed is driving gold prices higher\nOn Friday, December gold temporarily traded above $1,140 an ounce on Comex, and ended the session at its highest level since Sept. 1.\nGold has suffered in 2015 in part due to expectations for the Fed to begin raising rates. Higher interest rates are typically a negative for gold, which offers no yield and suffers by comparison to bonds and other yield-producing assets. Tighter monetary policy can also boost the dollar, which tends to weigh on commodities priced in the U.S. unit because it makes them more expensive to users of other currencies.\nThe Fed “decided to hold off on rate hikes once again, both out of concern for the potential impact of the global market problems and the U.S. economy, and also due to fear of possibly exacerbating those problems,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter.\nBut even though gold reacted positively to the news, it is still stuck in the “same ‘no man’s land’ as it was before,” he said. Investors are betting that the Fed “won’t be able to raise rates until next year, if at any time in the near future.”\nAnd if inflation and global uncertainties “remain the focus, then interest rates will never be raised by the Federal Reserve,” said Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants in New Delhi.\n‘We might have a better chance of seeing Santa Claus and…the Easter Bunny before the Fed raises rates.’ Ken Ford, Warwick Valley Financial Advisors Ken Ford, president of Warwick Valley Financial Advisors, echoed the sentiment: With the “U.S. dollar rolling over and the two-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.63% plunging, the market is telling us we might have a better chance of seeing Santa Claus and maybe even the Easter Bunny before the Fed raises rates.” The Fed’s next policy meetings are in October, December, January, and March. Easter is set for March 27 next year.\nRead: Traders now see Fed first hiking rates in 2016\nAnd “with the recent breakdown in the U.S. dollar index DXY, +0.68% investors that are waiting on the sidelines might just find themselves left out of the next explosive rally in gold and [precious metals] mining indexes,” said Ford.\nGold prices likely already put in a bottom in July under $1,100 an ounce and are likely to retest the 2015 high near $1,300, as some of the “primary pressure factors on gold the past few years are diminishing, notably Fed tightening expectations, the stronger U.S. dollar and record-breaking stock market rally,” said Mike McGlone, director of research at ETF Securities.\nThen again, if the stock market resumes its rally and the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +5.39% declines again to below normal levels, “Fed tightening is more likely and that may be a primary pressure factor on gold,” he said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:17:06.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
