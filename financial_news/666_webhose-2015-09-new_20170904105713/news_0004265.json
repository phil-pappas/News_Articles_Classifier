The teachers are demanding for KShs 16bn in increased pay. \nAt this stage, many were ready to negotiate, until he stated that Kenyan teachers were better paid than their regional counterparts; indeed, the third highest paid in Africa after Morocco and South Africa. According to the Kenyan president, the country's lowest paid teachers are taking home KShs 23,000 (about UShs 828,000) per month. \nWhile Kenyatta left the door open for further negotiations to end the crisis, the opposition seized the moment to make further inroads into an already charged environment, with one eye on the next election. \nBoth the Orange Democratic Movement party leader Raila Odinga and Wiper Democratic Party's Kalonzo Musyoka called a major rally at Uhuru Park, where they lambasted the government for its callous attitude to the whole problem, before establishing a 'Teachers Solidarity Account'. \nAt the rally, Odinga and Musyoka each donated KSh100,000 (about Shs 3.6m) each to the account. The Opposition leaders also unveiled an M-Pesa account (mobile money facility) through which the public can donate money to the 'Teachers Solidarity Account' in solidarity with teachers. \nAnother of the opposition parties, Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) have vowed to rally their supporters to block Harambee Avenue, where the presidency has its offices, every Tuesday until teachers' pay demands are met. \nThe opposition leaders are also planning a parliamentary motion to impeach Kenyatta, although analysts argue that they lack the numbers in the House to upset the president. \nHowever, with such significant support from state organs as the Teachers' Service Commission (TSC) and parliament, some Kenyan teachers must not be shocked that the government is in a corner. \nAfter all the drama surrounding the strike, deputy president William Ruto was left to appeal to the TSC and teachers to work out a way to end the strike and allow children to return to school, with crucial end-of-year exams, due in a few weeks from now. At this rate, Kenyatta must envy his counterparts in Uganda, who have teachers under the thumb, despite repeated calls for a pay rise.
