Brendan Esposito Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby The federal government is willing to take the patronage risk on road projects, even though it means taxpayers will lose out if the projections are wrong, newly appointed Cities Minister Jamie Briggs has said.\nThe government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also came closer than ever to saying it would fund urban rail projects, with Mr Briggs saying it was willing to back greenfields transport projects at an earlier stage than the private sector.\n\"We're not a business,\" Mr Briggs told AFR Weekend . \"We have a role in whether there is a social good and an economic importance to play, to do what we can to make these things happen.\n\"If there are ways we can find the capacity – particularly with big mass-transit projects, which are extremely expensive – to assist the states using our balance sheet in getting those projects up, to get them over that finance risk in the early stage, we're absolutely interested in that.\"\nThe increased appetite for transport projects is part of a wider move, under which the government will also establish a Cities Taskforce – a unit within the environment department, where Mr Briggs is based – that will include staff from a range of departments, to advise on policy affecting city development.\nA string of road projects, including Sydney's Lane Cove and CrossCity tunnels and Brisbane's Airport Link, have shown the private sector's failure to accurately forecast usage patterns.\nDirect involvement preferred As a result, the NSW government in 2013 said it would take the patronage risk – the uncertainty around how much traffic, and revenue, would be generated – until the WestConnex toll road was generating a predictable revenue stream that could then be sold.\n In Victoria, the previous Coalition Victorian government had said it would take the patronage risk on the now-cancelled East West Link project.\nThe Turnbull government is keen to draw a big line between itself and the leadership of former prime minister Tony Abbott by showing a willingness to be more closely involved in projects than just handing over cash to state governments.\n\"Having a direct involvement may mean we have more of a role in the outcome rather than just relying on the states to deliver,\" Mr Briggs said.\nThe new commitment did not mean the federal government would throw money at every project, he said.\n\"The right judgment needs to be made.\"\nEndorsement required Mr Briggs said any candidate project would need the endorsement of the government agency, Infrastructure Australia. Brisbane's $4.5 billion Cross River Rail project got that endorsement in 2013.\nBut the change of direction comes at a time when Australia's cities face a growing challenge of productivity, which threatens to choke and stifle economic development unless new infrastructure is funded to make them work better and unless rapidly changing technology is used to maximise the efficiency and use of existing infrastructure assets, whether those be public transport systems, planning systems or housing.\n\"We've got globally competitive cities and we constantly get cities rated – whether it's Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth – in the top cities on the globe,\" Mr Briggs said.\n\"The battle for global talent is ever-increasing and the smartest thing we can do is make ourselves an attractive place for people to want to live, work and make their life.\"\nThe taskforce, to be headed by deputy secretary from the Environment Department, would be more substantial than the Major Cities Unit created by the former Labor government and which former prime minister Tony Abbott abolished after taking power in 2013.\n\"It'll actually have some depth to it,\" Mr Briggs said. \"The Major Cities Unit before, frankly, was a small group within the infrastructure department.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:09:27.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
