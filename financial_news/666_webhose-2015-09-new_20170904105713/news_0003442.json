This week Volkswagen said 11 million cars were fitted with engines that had shown a noticeable deviation in emissions levels between testing and road use.\nThe EPA said it will improve its ability to detect so-called defeat devices or software that can reduce emissions during testing. But it will not tell automakers specifically how it is improving the testing. \"They don't need to know,\" Grundler said.\nIn the past the EPA has been mostly focused on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles but it is improving testing of light-duty cars, agency officials said.
