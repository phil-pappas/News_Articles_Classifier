Maybe. Or somewhere else. Adventurous travelers have a trick to finding a cheap fare: Book a ticket to somewhere, just about anywhere. The airline picks your destination.\nGermanwings, a discount European carrier owned by Lufthansa LHA, +0.04% , offers what it calls “blind booking’’ tickets as cheap as €33 ($37) each way. You pick your dates and your interest: party, culture, shopping, sun-and-beach, gay friendly, metropolis or nature. Then Germanwings picks your destination. Once your payment goes through, the confirmation comes with your destination listed. You can book a hotel room then.\nBlind bookings are one way airlines try to generate some excitement and capitalize on the spontaneity and sense of adventure among younger travelers. They are also a clever way to offer dirt cheap fares without making them available to business travelers or other customers willing to pay more, and without any risk of competitors matching the fares.\nFor Germanwings, the cheap prices have been particularly popular with American expats and military families in Germany interested in seeing more of Europe. Increasingly airlines try to find ways to market and sell directly to travelers rather than through broad advertising and travel agencies. They send sale prices or discount codes directly to customers through social media, email and other means and get them to book directly with the airline.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-airline-bargains-if-you-have-a-taste-for-adventure-1441214282?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:13:11.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
