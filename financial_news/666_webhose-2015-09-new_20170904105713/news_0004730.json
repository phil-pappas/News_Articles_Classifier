Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Serviced office providers Servcorp and Regus have laughed off any threat from office-leasing giant WeWork, saying the United States company will meet just one need in a market that has many niches.\nNew York-based WeWork, which subleases office space it rents and has grown in just five years to an estimated valuation of $US10 billion, has not confirmed plans to move to Australia but is looking for space in the Sydney market .\nMarcus Moufarrige, chief operating officer of ASX-listed Servcorp, which operates 26 sites in Australia and New Zealand, poured scorn on the idea that the US start-up resembles Uber, the disruptive taxi app it is often likened to .\n\"They're nothing like Uber,\" Mr Moufarrige told The Australian Financial Review . \"They are not the Uber of office space because Uber don't own a taxi, don't employ taxi drivers. Uber are a technology platform that is a real disrupter in an industry. WeWork would probably love to wear the badge of a disrupter but in reality, they are a different niche in an industry that's been around for a really long period of time.\"\nWeWork's likely entry to Australia is well timed, however, as it comes when corporate tenants were increasingly seeking flexibility, and landlords – whether Dexus with Dexus Place , The GPT Group with Space & Co , ISPT with Dialogue or Lend Lease with The Porter – were looking for ways to exploit their space to better meet that need.\n\"We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at present,\" said John Preece, Knight Frank's head of office agency for Australia. \"Australia already has more co-working space per capita than anywhere else in the world, and changing demographics, technologies, and shift towards the sharing economy will ensure that the demand for co-working space grows exponentially.\"\nChanging work styles will also require a greater need for co-working spaces that create a sense of community. By 2020, as many as 40 per cent of workers would be freelance, Mr Preece said.\nGlobal giant Regus's development director for Australia and New Zealand Clive Dale said the growing market was creating niches for providers of space.\n \"No one operator is going to successfully target every one niche,\" Mr Dale said.\nEven so, both ServCorp and Regus are diversifying their offering. Servcorp has opened premium co-working spaces in Sydney – on Level 57 of the MLC Tower – London, Tokyo and New York. It's an experiment, Mr Moufarrige said.\n\"We are running test co-working facilities to really establish if there is demand for five-star co-working facilities.\"\nRegus this year acquired Netherlands-based Spaces, a more casual and hip co-working business that takes entire buildings – like WeWork – and offers private rooms as well as large communal spaces. The first Australian Spaces site occupies 1100 square metres in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond.\nIt was not an effort to pre-empt new competition, Mr Dale said.\n\"It's not to compete with someone, it's a better understanding of what the requirements are in the market and having a suite of products to meet that market,\" he said. \"There are price propositions, there are location propositions, but there's also the look and feel of something.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/dexus-place-opens-its-doors-20150528-ghbsjf.html", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-16T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:03:11.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
