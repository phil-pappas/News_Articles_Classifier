Bringing down government stakes in these banks to 52 per cent would further augment their capital.\nThe government’s first objective was to strengthen fragile public sector banks (PSBs), he said.\n“After this (measures) if there is a fragile bank we are looking at consolidation with stronger banks. So it’s not that banks don’t get a priority. In fact, after inheriting the banks in a fragile situation, we are systematically trying to address each of these problems,” Jaitley said.\nOn NPAs, he said: “It is (banking system) a matter of concern. It’s not the main worry. There is no ground to panic. The banking system that we inherited primarily, the public sector banks, was actually very challenging.\n“When the economy slowed down, and when you inherit the economy at sub-5 per cent level, it has an impact on the banking system as well… primarily three or four sectors… (have) added to the NPAs of the public sector banks,” he said.\nHe said the NPA was mainly in sectors like highways, steel, state discoms and textiles.\nJaitley further said the government has addressed the highway issue in a “big manner”, large investment is going in highways and it has “started moving”.\n“As far as the discoms are concerned, I am in touch with each of the states where the discoms need to be reformed,” he said, adding government was looking at more steps to check dumping of steel in the country.\nGross NPAs of the state-run banks at the end of March quarter stood at 5.2 per cent compared with 5.63 per cent in December.\nOut of Rs 1.80 lakh crore capital requirement estimated by the Finance Ministry for state-run banks, the government would be providing Rs 70,000 crore — Rs 25,000 crore each in the current and the next fiscal, and Rs 10,000 crore each in 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 1:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:18:47.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
