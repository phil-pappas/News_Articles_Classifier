Share on twitter by John Davidson Apple is finally going to update its aged Apple TV set top box, it's going to cost around double the price of the existing box, but it could have shows on it that are made just for Apple, the way Netflix does.\nJust days ahead of Apple's expected September 9 launch of a new iPhone, rumours are flying that Apple TV, the tiny black box that converts a regular TV into an Apple content player, is finally getting the attention its users have been calling for. A new version, Apple TV Fourth Generation, is expected to be announced alongside the iPhone 6s.\nThe entertainment newspaper Variety is reporting that \"Apple is exploring getting into the original programming business\", a story that could explain why Apple is again showing interest in its TV box, which hasn't been updated since Adam (Sandler) was a boy.\nVariety's Hollywood sources tell it that Apple has been meeting with Hollywood execs to \"suss out\" their interest in making Apple Original programming, the way they make shows such as Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards for Netflix. (Hard as it may be to believe, Netflix doesn't actually make its Netflix Original shows, but has them made for it by people who very clearly know what they are doing.)\nSome sources have told Variety that Apple is almost at the headhunting stage for its Netflix-like offerings. Other sources say it's just flirting with the idea.\nIf it does make shows, then you have to think they'll be available on the rumoured Fourth Generation Apple TV box.\nIt's already thought that the new box, which is expected to cost either $US149 or $US199 , will have the ability to play cable TV services using an internet connection. It's thought that the cable option will at least initially require an account with a separate cable provider, making Apple TV just another box you can watch existing services on, but that it eventually might have some cable offerings of its own.\nObviously Apple Original programs would slot neatly into those plans, especially in countries outside the US where it's unlikely Apple would be rolling out a cable offering, leaving the Apple TV a sandwich short of a content smorgasbord.\n Now that Telstra is planning to release the Roku box, a competitor to the Apple TV that will be rebadged as Telstra TV for the Australian market, Apple needs to find content to differentiate itself, and its own shows could be just the ticket.\nBut what will they be? Will there be violence in Apple Original programming?\nWill there be nudity?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs", "http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/apple-eyes-move-into-original-programming-exclusive-1201582020/", "http://9to5mac.com/2015/08/30/apple-tv-4-200-october/"], "published": "2015-09-01T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:25:20.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
