The upcoming edition will convene high profile government and private sector representatives, and address several investment-related issues and activities.\n\nHeld under the theme 'The New World of FDI, Key Features and Best Practices', the event will emphasize the prominent role of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in emerging and developed markets, and its contribution as a key driver of economies. Successful case studies on attracting FDI flows and overcoming obstacles to this investment vehicle will be highlighted at the three-day global event.\n\nA series of investment-related activities will be introduced at AIM 2016, in addition to featuring the previous installment's most significant components. The event will include a thought leadership conference that is expected to bring together FDI experts and specialists, as well as a global leaders debate, a ministerial roundtable, country presentations/investment destinations, G2B and B2B meetings, capacity building workshops, an exhibition, and a gala dinner. \n\nIn addition, an investment awards ceremony, an FDI experts' corner, an investors' zone and SME zone are value-added features to this year's event.AIM 2016 will also see the launch of the third edition of the Annual FDI Report focusing on the latest trends in FDI on a global and regional level, and illustrating ways of procuring FDI investment in different types of markets, especially the developing ones.\n\nHis Excellency Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, UAE Minister of Economy, said: \"The Annual Investment Meeting draws the attention of elite specialists in investment sectors. From a simple platform to highlight investment opportunities, AIM has emerged as a must-attend annual calendar event for reaching mega deals and strategic partnerships between decision makers and investors from different categories. Most of these entities are prime beneficiaries of FDIs that have evolved as a viable investment method in the current socio-economic milieu.\" \n\nThe Minister added: \"While oil used to contribute to more than 90% of the Gross National Product in the 1970s, in a reversal of fortunes it today accounts for less than a third of the GNP. Meanwhile, the contribution of non-oil sectors to the GNP registered 69% at the end of 2014. The move towards diversification of the economy was largely aided by attracting the right investments. Through AIM we are keen to promote more effective investment solutions that are not only limited to bringing in capital but will also lead to the transfer of expertise, technology and know-how that are so critical in the country's goal to shape a knowledge economy.\"\n\nDawood Al Shezawi, CEO, AIM's Organizing Committee said the 2016 edition will serve as a platform for FDI experts, investors, professionals and businessmen to discuss how the FDI landscape has changed dramatically in recent years as well as identify new sources of FDI. \n\nShezawi added: \"AIM 2016 will tackle the importance of identifying new forms of investment and discuss the policies that promote and facilitate such investments and best practices. In addition, it will examine developments in the FDI sector against the backdrop of geo-political changes sweeping the world and explore ways of attracting investment from new sources and emerging markets.\n\n\"There is little wonder that FDIs have become the main item on the agenda at AIM. Numbers indicate that there are presently 50,000 multinational enterprises headquartered in emerging markets. Among these, a significant number are state-owned enterprises that are important investors in countries such as China, Singapore and the Arab world.\"\n\nThe Ministry also plans to expand the scope of the accompanying exhibition of AIM 2016 to include new investment sectors for the benefit of participants and visitors. AIM will play a prominent role in facilitating communication among new investors and companies interested in emerging markets.The upcoming edition will be the largest and most diverse to date and witness individual initiatives organized by knowledge partners, sponsors and supporters of the event as well as investment promotion agencies. \n\nThe UAE model and the country's experience in developing a safe environment that boasts an advanced infrastructure, ensures investor protection and high return on investment will be highlighted as part of a key case study by a designated country at AIM 2016. \n\nThe 2015 edition drew the participation of 124 countries and 145 prominent personalities, including heads of states and governments, ministers, mayors, governors, heads of international organizations and senior officials. The event was attended by 14,687 participants, and saw the announcement of projects worth billions of dollars. \n\nAIM 2015 included four knowledge partners, 56 sponsors and supporting partners, 119 media partners, 85 investment promotion agencies, and was hosted across 8,000 sqmts of exhibition space. \n\nAbout AIM 2016 \nAIM 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:16:20.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
