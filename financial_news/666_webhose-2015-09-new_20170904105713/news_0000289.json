MARY, England—When beavers surfaced in the River Otter, Mark Owen smelled a rat.\nIt had been centuries—probably before poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge was born in this village in 1772—since wild beavers plied the region. In recent years, any local beavers were kept as curiosities or for research, living behind electric fences.\nENLARGE Eurasian beaver “Nobody, as far as I know, has reported that they’ve lost beavers,” says Mr. Owen, freshwater director of England’s Angling Trust, a sportfishing-advocacy group that wants the rodents removed. His conclusion: “The beavers were illegally released.”\nU.K. law prohibits introduction into the wild of any animal that doesn’t already live there, even if it once did.\nYet the Otter’s beavers are multiplying, and the mystery of how the rotund rodents came to Coleridge’s “wild streamlet of the West” has fanned the flames of a national beaver conflict.\nThat decadelong fight has pitted biodiversity advocates against anglers and landowners, leaving at least a dozen beavers dead and countless willow trees chewed.\nThings are looking up for the beavers. Their population has grown to an estimated 212 in the U.K. wild.\nAnd while the government last year decreed that the River Otter’s beavers should be removed, early this year it ruled they could stay, though it didn’t bar landowners from killing them.\nENLARGE Devon landowner John-Michael Kennaway holds a beaver pelt.

As in much of Europe, hunting for pelts, meat and castoreum—a secretion used in perfumes—extirpated them centuries ago. Wild beavers survive in parts of Europe.\nBeaver believers say the species could help restore England’s countryside to something like before medieval policies encouraged exterminating animals that competed with people for land or food. Advocates say beavers fell trees that choke streams and build dams that improve wetlands for fish and other animals.\nENLARGE John-Michael Kennaway leaves carrots for his captive beavers. Photo: Justin Scheck “That’s why we love beavers so much,” says Mark Elliott, beaver coordinator for the Devon Wildlife Trust, which says the U.K. has for centuries been “suffering from the loss of beaver activity.”\nHardly, says angler advocate Mr. Owen. Beaver dams may block trout from spawning in streams like the River Otter, where fish already struggle with river otters, he says. And chewed trees are “a health-and-safety risk for anglers.”\nHe cites a 2005 study finding floods from beaver-dam breaches responsible for 13 U.S. deaths over 20 years.\nThe study’s lead author, Texas State University geography professor David Butler, says “the beneficial aspects of beaver dams in my opinion far outweigh any negative effects.”\nScotland’s National Farmers Union says members struggle to remove beaver dams and fix damaged streams. This year, it asked the government to “not exacerbate the existing issues by giving beavers protected status.”\nNonetheless, Scotland is considering allowing beaver reintroductions. And the Beaver Advisory Committee for England, a nongovernmental group of people interested in beaver issues that includes supporters and skeptics, cites studies saying beavers could offer economic benefits, pointing to Belgium’s late-1990s reintroduction.\nBrowse Recent A-heds ENLARGE At Fairs This Year, Fake Fowl Play Chicken At U.S. Open, the Ball Boys and Girls Are Grown-Ups Who Wants to Ring the Closing Bell on Bad Days? “A dynamic marketing project based on a palatable combination of ‘Beavers, Beer and Castles’ in the Belgian Ardennes,” the committee wrote, “has resulted in beaver-watching holidays being advertised world-wide.”\nThe British beaver brawl began in 2006, when one was confirmed in Scotland’s River Tay, says the Tayside Beaver Study Group established by beaver supporters and skeptics in response to a Scottish-government decision to study beavers.\nAs the beavers multiplied, landowners called for their removal and shot at least a dozen, says Roisin Campbell-Palmer, who manages conservation projects for Scotland’s Royal Zoological Society. She says the beavers were probably escapees but some may have been introduced illegally.\nIn 2012, Scottish officials said the critters could stay if they were healthy and were Eurasian beavers, not the nonnative North American variety. Beavers captured and DNA tested have proven to be Eurasian, which look similar to their cousins but can grow larger.\nIn England’s Devon county, Holstein farmer Dave Lawrence got surprising news in 2013 from a friend who strolled a field by the River Otter: “I think you’ve got beavers.”\nLocals noticed chewed trees and occasional beavers on evening swims.\nMr. Lawrence and his wife, Vicki, began advertising the beavers to draw tourists to their farm, but “no one’s actually called and said, ‘we’re here to see the beavers,’ ” Ms. Lawrence says.\nIn March, the U.K. decreed that since the beavers are native and disease-free, they can stay in the Otter without government eviction for at least five years while Britain ponders their future.\nIt remains a mystery how beavers got there. Mr. Owen, the angling advocate, suspects a beaver collector released them but says “it would be impossible to prove.”\nJohn-Michael Kennaway says it wasn’t his doing—not that anyone has implicated him.\nMr. Kennaway, who lives on a Devon estate, several years ago toured Poland with the Devon Mammal Group of conservationists. “We saw beavers,” he says, “and I just thought ‘I’ve got to get a pair of those.’ ”\nHe got government permits and obtained two animals through a local wildlife-restoration expert, Derek Gow, who he says is known as “the person for importing beavers.”\nMr. Kennaway is trying to restore parts of his family estate, Escot, to something more like it was before a drastic 18th century alteration. He has dedicated one area to red squirrels and is fostering a wild dormouse population.\nIn 2007, he enclosed a wet depression with electric fencing for two Bavarian beavers, which built a dam on a River Otter tributary.\nAt dusk recently, Mr. Kennaway pointed out a new dam. A beaver glided across the enclosed pond, then another.\nMr. Kennaway says he doesn’t know how beavers got into the wild. His are all in their enclosure, he says, save a baby that was killed by a tree its mother felled—he says he cooked it in a tagine—and another that likely died several years ago.\n“I didn’t do it,” says Mr. Gow.\nStill, “it’s an animal that comes back from the past,” he says. “It’s an animal we will have to give land back to.”\nWrite to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE539_BEAVER_P_20150907143756.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE538_BEAVER_P_20150907143651.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT865_Beaver_G_20150907160032.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE539_BEAVER_M_20150907143756.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE538_BEAVER_M_20150907143651.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-08T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:33:23.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
