VRX -16.53 % to provide documents explaining hefty price increases for two heart drugs.\nValeant shares fell 16.5% to $166.50 Monday following news of the request for a subpoena. The stock had fallen more than 12% over the previous several days amid increasing criticism from law makers about drug-price increases.\nValeant refused early this month to submit documents sought by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) explaining the 525% and 212% price increases the company took on the two drugs the day it acquired their rights, saying the requested information was “highly proprietary and confidential.”\nOn Monday, Rep. Cummings, ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and its 17 other Democratic members sent a letter to the committee’s Republican chairman asking him to issue a subpoena compelling Valeant to furnish the documents.\nThe Democrats also requested that the chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah), ask Valeant CEO Michael Pearson to testify before the committee.\nRelated Heard on the Street: Valeant Has More to Fear Than Congress Lawmakers Question Valeant on Drug Price Increases (Aug. 14) Drug Companies Buy Rivals, Then Jack Up Prices (April 26) “We believe it is critical to hold drug companies to account when they engage in ‘a business strategy of buying old neglected drugs and turning them into high-price ‘specialty drugs,’ ’ ” the Democrats wrote in their letter, citing an article in The Wall Street Journal in April about the industry practice , which used Valeant’s drug-price increases as an example.\nThe Democrats wrote they are also seeking the testimony of Martin Shkreli, CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, which raised the price of anti-parasite drug Daraprim more than 50-fold after buying the U.S. rights in August. After an onslaught of criticism, Mr. Shkreli later said Turing will cut the drug’s price from its current $750 a tablet.\nValeant and Turing declined to comment on the Democrats’ letter.\nIt is up to Mr. Chaffetz to decide whether the committee will issue a subpoena or hold a hearing, but it is far from certain he will. The Democrats wrote in their letter that Mr. Chaffetz had declined to sign the initial request to Valeant seeking documents and other information about the price increases for the two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel.\nMr. Chaffetz didn't respond to a request for comment.\nEarlier on Monday, Mr. Pearson, in a letter to Valeant employees, dismissed Wall Street’s concerns regarding the company’s growth prospects.\nHe said just 15% of Valeant revenue comes from U.S. government reimbursements, and that the company generally relies on selling more drugs to up its sales, not price increases.\n“Valeant is well-positioned for strong organic growth, even assuming little to no price increases,” Mr. Pearson wrote.\nHospitals use Isuprel during procedures to treat heart-rhythm problems, and give Nitropress to emergency patients whose blood pressures have increased to life-threatening levels. Rep. Cummings and Sen. Sanders sought documents such as sales contracts for the ingredients used to make the two drugs and information such as the total gross revenue from sales of the drugs.\nValeant didn’t provide any documents, but said in a letter dated Sept. 3 that it raised the prices because the drugs were “significantly underpriced” and the company has patient-assistance programs to help patients get the drugs if they face financial obstacles.\nWrite to Jonathan D.
