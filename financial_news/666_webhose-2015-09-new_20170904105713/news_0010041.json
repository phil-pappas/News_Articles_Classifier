Despite closing in the red yesterday, the mining heavy index rose 74.84 points, or 1.24pc this week. After recent bouts of risk aversion, Rebecca O’Keeffe, of Interactive Investor, said “profit hunting saw investors buying commodity related stocks, with some viewing the recent falls in the sector overdone”. \nWith further Chinese data due for release over the weekend and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision due on Thursday, Joshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , warned “Monday is likely to start with a bang”.“If recent data is anything to go by, it will most likely point towards yet more trouble in the beleaguered Asian powerhouse,” Mr Mahony added. \n* European shares on track for biggest weekly gain since July * Interest rates must rise sooner to combat inflation, warns Bank of England rate setter Supermarkets dominated the FTSE fallers for a second-consecutive day, with Wm Morrison becoming the biggest casualty, down 3.3pc to 165.2p. UBS slashed its target price to 170p, a day after the grocer announced a 50pc slide in profits and the loss of 900 jobs. \nAn unexpected twist in the supermarket price war came as Lidl announced its plans to move into central London in a bid to shake off its discount limage. Mr Mahony warned “customers want low prices, and if Lidl manages to provide low prices with a perception of quality simply through a rebrand , it seems like a no brainer”. Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) fell 2.3pc to 181.4p, and J Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) slid 2.3pc to 233.4p. \nBAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) became a late contender for the FTSE top spot, jumping 1.9pc to 451.7p in afternoon trade, after reports surfaced Kuwait had signed a deal to buy Eurofighter jets for about $9bn. The defence group was listed among the companies thought to be producing the aircraft. \nElsewhere, “ripe for recovery” Kingfisher (LSE: KGF.L - news ) inched 5p, or 1.4pc, higher to 365.3p after Bernstein issued a bullish broker note. The broker said better macroeconomic outlooks in the UK and France, suggested the group, which owns B&Q, could benefit from underlying market recovery in DIY spending. \nA rating upgrade from UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) also boosted the stock. Analysts believe plans by new management to simplify the group will drive significant cost savings. Meanwhile, weak construction data, which showed output fell by 1pc last month, dragged Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) and British Land Company down by 0.8pc and 1.7pc, respectively. \nUBS also upgraded Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , helping the stock climb higher. Despite a challenging backdrop, Myles Allsop, of UBS, said “Rio Tinto has high quality low cost assets that should continue to generate cash flow even during sustained periods of depressed commodity prices”. The iron ore miner climbed 0.8pc to £23.83. Finally, unfounded takeover rumours catapulted Regus (Other OTC: RGSJF - news ) to its highest level in 14 years, up 7.7p to 302.4p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:06:45.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
