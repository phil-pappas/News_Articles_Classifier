Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) profits of enterprises are being further eroded.\" \n- Li tries to reassure - \nOn Wednesday China's Li said the government was capable of maintaining high growth, trying to stem fears about the latest crisis to the global economy. \nLi's comments came after China said the day before it will adopt \"stronger\" fiscal policies to support growth. \nHe also defended Beijing's decision last month to devalue the yuan currency -- which sparked a worldwide rout -- saying it \"will maintain a reasonable equilibrium level\". \nDespite his promises regional markets sank Thursday, with Shanghai losing more than one percent in the morning, Hong Kong 2.20 percent lower and Tokyo almost three percent off by lunch. Sydney, where several firms with close business ties to China are listed, was more than two percent lower. \nOn currency markets high-yielding, or riskier, assets retreated as well as traders fret over a possible Fed monetary tightening. \nThe Labor Department's so-called JOLTS report on the US jobs market showed vacancies rose to 5.75 million in July, the highest level since the data was first reported in 2000. \nThe news revived talk of a September rise in borrowing rates, which would likely drag on investment opportunities and fuel a flight of capital back to the the United States in search of better returns. \nWhile such a move would boost the dollar, the yen, a go-to unit in times of unease, picked up. \nThe dollar bought 120.24 yen, compared with 120.54 yen in New York where it at one point earlier it broke 121 yen. \nThe euro eased to 134.88 yen from 135.05 yen in US trade. The single currency had touched 135.15 yen earlier Wednesday. \nThe Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent, while emerging market units also suffered with the South Korean won 0.33 percent down and the Malaysian ringgit 0.8 percent lower. \nNew Zealand's dollar sank 1.8 percent after its central bank cut interest rates again and indicated further easing could follow in coming months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:58:06.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
