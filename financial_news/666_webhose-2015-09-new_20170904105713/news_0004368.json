Customers will receive the news later this week, it is understood. \nFor many, the higher charge will negate the current account's benefits, which include 3 per cent interest and cashback on bills. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may remain attractive only to those with large savings pots. \nFees for the credit card, which offers up to 3 per cent cashback on spending, will rise from £24 to £36 a year. \nThe changes may prompt rival firms to act and come just weeks ahead of proposals to stop banks exploiting customers. \nCritics said the moves \"made a mockery\" of the Santander's advertising strapline: \"simple, personal, fair\". \nJames Daley, founder of bank account analysts Fairer Finance, said: \"Santander had been one of the few to offer a genuine alternative to the traditional banks and as well as a blow for the millions of customers who were lured in by its attractive offers, this will reduce competition in banking, which is already weak.\" \nAround 17 million people have banked with the same institution for at least two decades . The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog will next month publish a two-year investigation into concerns that the big four banks, which control three-quarters of all current accounts, offer poor deals and service because they are not challenged . \nMany of those who are switching are choosing the Santander 123 account because it offers up to 3 per cent interest on balances between £3,000 and £20,000 and between 1 per cent and 3 per cent on household bills. \nMr Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has advised savers to use the account instead of Isas, where interest rates have fallen to record lows. When the 123 account was created in 2012 the best easy access savings rates was 3.5 per cent; today it is 1.65 per cent. \nHigher charges on the country's most popular current account could allow other banks to introduce smaller fees. \nMPs and banking chiefs have already urged the CMA to bring an end to the practice of \"free\" in-credit banking. \nAndrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, said free banking is a \"misnomer\" because \"no one actually knows how much they are getting charged and this helps stifle competition\". \nAccountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said free banking would disappear \"within a decade\" . \nThe Santander 123 credit card pays between 1 per cent and 3 per cent cashback on spending in supermarkets, department stores and on travel. \nThe bank makes money from customer fees and by charging retailers for each transaction. But from October, the maximum \"interchange\" rate charged to shops will be 0.3pc of the purchase price, down from 0.7pc on average today. \nCapital One (Dusseldorf: 8CA.DU - news ) has already scrapped the perks on its cards and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) is cutting its own in November. Santander will replace its £24 annual fee with a £3 a month charge, it is understood. \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:29:49.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
