Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Like the prisoners emerging from the darkness in Beethoven's opera Fidelio , members of Malcolm Turnbull's government have been wandering around Parliament House this week, blinking in the bright light, not quite believing the transformation that has taken place in their circumstances\nIt's not just been the radical reforming of the frontbench, or the end of three-word slogans,or even that they now have an even chance of winning the next election. Ministers and backbenchers alike are suddenly relieved of the burden of a range of ideological and political constraints that had become so much part of the furniture that they were almost unnoticed.\nThere is the chance to look afresh at issues: not that they are getting any easier, mind you. There is just the chance to reappraise where the government stands anew, and take into account the relentless rolling-on of the political game.\nThere is also all the optimistic rhetoric. The Prime Minister told us all on the night of September 14 that \"change is our friend if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it\".\nSenator Birmingham replaced Christopher Pyne. Andrew Meares \"There has never been a more exciting time to be alive than today and there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian\", Malcolm Turnbull said. \"We will ensure that all Australians understand that their government recognises the opportunities of the future and is putting in place the policies and the plans to enable them to take advantage of it\".\nBut as the poll-bounce, and the lift in consumer confidence, settle down, ministers' minds have to turn to the more brutal task of refashioning policy and trying – somehow – to meet the huge community expectations that accompanied the change in leadership.\nNowhere is this going to be more true than in the areas of innovation and education.\nFor surely, if the government is, as Turnbull says, going to put in place \"the policies and the plans to enable [Australians] to take advantage\" of the opportunities of the future, this is where it will have to be.\n In the firestorm The two ministers in the centre of the firestorm are Christopher Pyne – now responsible for industry and innovation – and his fellow South Australian Senator Simon Birmingham. And a firestorm it certainly is, particularly for Birmingham who replaces Pyne in the education portfolio. The problem is that it's not just a question of tweaking education policy to lift it up to reflect Turnbull's optimistic rhetoric but cleaning up a policy debacle that sent exactly the opposite message.\nYou will remember that the disastrous 2014 budget announced both the deregulation of university fees and a 20 per cent in university funding. The combination of these two policies was the source of the claims it was imposing $100,000 university degrees. This has hung around the Coalition's neck like a particularly dead albatross ever since. Beyond the devastating damage done at the retail political level – as parents across the country contemplated the prospect of a university education slipping out of their children's hands – the linking of spending cuts and deregulation has damaged the cause of freeing up universities to set their own fees\nThe funding cuts have already been 'booked' into the budget as a multi billion dollar saving. But the Senate has steadfastly refused to contemplate agreeing to them.The question mark over the saving felt permanently lost in the political ether, almost forgotten, except by universities facing an increasingly close encounter with funding uncertainty, while everyone focused on leadership uncertainty.\nIf asked, the government would insist it was persisting. or at worst, might try to find some other way of persuading the Senate crossbench to change its mind on the changes.\n$20b budget hit But the leadership uncertainty has now been resolved, the Senate hasn't moved, and there is a quiet but resigned acknowledgement within the government that at some point really, really soon that it is going to have take a budget hit of as much as $20 billion as it admits defeat on the savings.\nLabor marked Christopher Pyne and Simon Birmingham's arrival in their new jobs by releasing new policies on higher education and innovation. (There are advantages for an opposition in thinking there might be an early election: it tends to speed up the policy process).\nUntil now, the opposition has been thinking that it \"owned\" the \"future\" policy space. And education generally has always been one of its favoured battlegrounds\nThis week Bill Shorten and education spokesman Kim Carr announced the government was putting a \"floor\" under university funding.\nShorten told the ABC's Q&A \"we've proposed to basically take away the 20 per cent cuts that the Libs are doing and restore it to as it was\". The opposition says it would fund this \"with some of the money we would raise from multinational taxation and superannuation loopholes\".\nThere were more Labor announcements: an increase in the number of students completing studies; more money to boost teacher quality; and start-up money to support university students trying to develop ideas into businesses.\nThe way the normal political narrative used to work, this would just have been dismissed as another example of Labor offering unfunded promises. But for once the Coalition has perhaps even bigger funding problems.\nVocational training transfer mooted There is lots more for Birmingham to do to set us up for all our opportunities. Birmingham has come from the junior portfolio of vocational training and that's good. That sector has long needed an informed advocate, not a minister who sees it as a problematic add-on to university policy.\nBirmingham is already driving a discussion about transferring responsibility for vocational training to Canberra. This would offer the potential to create some consistency in policy. But some states remain suspicious it would inevitably just mean a funding cut. Policies to make provision of vocational training contestable between state-run TAFEs and private sector providers has already proved a well-intentioned disaster in both quality and cost terms with shonks aplenty offering Corn Flakes packet-equivalent training and certification. The government has been left footing a $4 billion bad debt bill for loans imposed on students who never had any hope of completing their qualifications.\nIf we are going to be \"agile\", as the Prime Minister is suggesting, and double our education exports, we will have to be agile pretty quickly. New Zealand has recently put its polytechnics on an equal funding footing to universities. In China, 600 of the country's 200 universities are to become polytechnics to counter skill shortages and a problem of high unemployment among university graduates.\nThis is the sort of agility we have to compete with. There is just not a lot of money to do it with", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-09-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:13:55.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
