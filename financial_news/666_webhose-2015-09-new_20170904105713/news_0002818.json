James Alcock by Matthew Smith There's the fearless and the brave – and then there's AMP Capital – diving headlong into the frothy waters of China's investment markets.\nAside from visionary pied pipers like Kerr Neilson, the highly successful founder of listed funds management business, Platinum International, there's handful maverick investors leading an exploration of direct opportunities in China's still evolving public share market.\nAnd then there's AMP Capital CEO Stephen Dunne.\nIn two weeks Dunne will be in overalls and knee-high gum boots tending to a vegie patch at his hobby cum commercial farm near Goulburn, four hours drive south-west of Sydney.\nBut today, Dunne is explaining his 12-year journey leading the investment company, owned by Australia's largest and most recognised insurance brand, and the foundations he's laid in China\nAdam Tindall, AMP Capital Property chief investment officer, will be replacing Dunne as CEO in October following the May announcement of his retirement to spend time with his family and to pursue his other passions in agriculture and renewable energy.\nIf not for the headlines AMP Capital has been grabbing since activist hedge funds began targeting its China Growth fund, the ASX-listed China A shares investment vehicle, Dunne's inroads into China may have not become apparent for many years to come.\nThe listed China Growth fund was the first tangible foray into China under Dunne's leadership after successfully qualifying for Australia's first Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) licence in 2006.\n Volatile markets are now conspiring against the fund, leaving the investment firm seemingly powerless in its attempts to narrow the substantial discount its shares are trading at, short of winding up the fund all together.\nBut scratching the surface of AMP Capital's China strategy and it becomes clear its beleaguered China Growth fund is the tip of a much broader push into the region which will form much of Dunne's legacy.\nThe funds management company AMP Capital, which went into partnership with local insurance company China Life late in 2013, now manages RMB70 billion yuan ($15 billion), placing it among the largest half of the funds managers in the country.\nChina is barely past the infancy in the evolution of its professional investment industry with estimates suggesting more than 70 per cent China's individual savings are sitting in cash deposits with only 3 per cent in managed funds and less than 10 per cent now invested in direct shares.\nStill, the absolute size of China's managed funds market is $US2.5 trillion ($36.7 trillion), according to Asset Management Association of China figures. That's up from around $US100 billion ($142.7 billion) 10 years ago, the figures suggest.\nIn October last year the broader company followed the lead of AMP Capital investing $240 million to acquire 19.99 per cent in China Life Pension Company.\nThe Chinese pensions opportunity seems about to kick off following the China Securities Regulatory Commission announcement this year it will be regulating a compulsory-like contributions for its government workers which could amount to US$23 billion ($32.8 billion) annually and reach over US$150 billion ($214 billion) after five-years in an asset pool akin to Australia's personal superannuation saving pool.\nAs part of the relationship AMP will be leading a pilot program to turn life insurance agents into financial advisers with some 25,000 insurance agents employed by China Life in the country's Shandong Provence. While AMP is known in Australia for having the country's largest advice network outside of the banks its 4000 sales force is dwarfed by the more than 1 million agents employed by China Life.\nPartnership with China Life AMP's partnership with China Life makes it the Australian investment firm which has advanced the most in the frontier region.\n\"We can't really put numbers around the opportunity that exists for us in China,\" says Dunne, who started discussions in 2003 when he became CEO which ultimately led to the funds management company JV in January last year – the first such partnership between a foreign and Chinese investment firm.\nAfter being awarded a QFII quota to invest directly in the China A shares market in 2006 and appointing China Life as a sub advisor to the China Growth fund, Dunne spent the next seven-years working with China Life and discussing the prospects of forming a local funds management company.\n\"We could have partnered with a securities company or a regional bank but we took a strong view China Life was a good partner because we share a lot of similarities and we like their distribution reach,\" he says.\nThe AMP partnership with China Life runs both ways and AMP Capital has benefited from Chinese capital flowing into its property funds business which is compliant with Significant Investor Visa guidelines. China Life is also understood to have pumped capital into an infrastructure debt fund in which AMP Capital raised a total of $US750 million.\nDunne can retreat to his farm knowing that AMP is now woven into the fabric of China's burgeoning investment industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:11:39.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
