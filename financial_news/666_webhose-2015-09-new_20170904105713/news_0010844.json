Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires A pullback in earnings expectations and a struggling Australian economy have led Morgan Stanley to slash its target for the ASX over the next 12 months to just 5150.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200, having fallen 12 per cent from its April high when it nudged the 6000 mark, and suffering its worst month since the global financial crisis, reflected a significant turnaround in the economic outlook, Morgan Stanley strategists Chris Nicol and Daniel Blake said in a note.\n\"What started as a yield/RBA-inspired surge in Q1 has ended up in Q3 being a sober realisation of challenged growth and earnings outlook,\" he said.\nMr Nicol and Mr Blake downgraded their 12-month target for the ASX from 5650 to 5150. On Monday the benchmark index closed at 5207.\n\"This reflects both a more cautious view towards multiples and a more conservative expectation for the change in forward [earnings per share],\" they said.\nMorgan Stanley's base case for 12-month forward price earnings was 13.5-times, versus a previous 14.5-times, and earnings per share down to 6 per cent over 12 months, down from 9 per cent, and noted consensus estimates at 9.4 per cent were \"too optimistic\".\n\"EPS revisions have been negative in 20 of the past 24 months,\" they note. \"Valuations remain above cycle average at 14.7-times 12 month forward price/earnings despite a sustained absence of growth.\"\nThe revision comes as concerns over the ability of the industrial sector, specifically from East Coast states, to cushion the effect of the unwinding resources boom and the housing construction boom had past its peak, they said.\n Much pain absorbed The housing boom had absorbed much of the pain from the resources capex unwind. But the housing sector was expected to be reined in, particularly following commentary from RBA governor Glenn Stevens' comments earlier this year that Sydney's housing market had become \"crazy\".\n\"Policymakers are now putting the brakes on the housing market through macroprudential policy measures, and we expect they will prove successful in slowing price growth and construction activity,\" Mr Nicol and Mr Blake said.\nWhile the RBA was resistant to further easing, the duo forecast a 50-basis points cut from the already record low 2 per cent cash rate by mid-2016.\nBetaShares chief economist David Bassanese pointed to weak June-quarter capital expenditure data released last week as further restricting growth.\n\"Due to global instability, an arguably still high Australian dollar, and pockets of excess supply in the non-residential construction sector, our base case however remains that investment intentions will be not revised up significantly over the coming year,\" he said.\n\"This will continue to pose growth challenges for the economy and corporate profits, and suggests overall share price gains could be relatively subdued.\"\nHowever, Morgan Stanley said Australia's economy could hold up better than feared despite the short-term downside from concerns on China's slowing economy on resources demand and bank capital requirements, because of its developed-market-within-emerging-markets position and solid yield credentials.\nIn the worst case scenario, Morgan Stanley saw the ASX as low as 4200, representing a further 14 per cent fall. In that case the Australian economy would have fallen into a recession, under the weight of the resources downturn that had relied too much on the housing boom to prop it up.\n\"Here we would expect earnings growth to be minus 2 per cent and would assume the market multiple to de-rate to circa 11.9-times,\" they said.\nA lift back towards the 6000 mark would require fiscal stimulus through infrastructure spending and a boost in consumer confidence that was damaged by 2014's federal budget and has left Australia particularly vulnerable, they said.\nBut Mr Nicol and Mr Blake said for now, \"forget the bulls\" and focus on the bears and their base case.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-01T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:21:34.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
