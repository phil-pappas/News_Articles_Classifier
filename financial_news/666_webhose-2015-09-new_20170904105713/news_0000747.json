Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Young people should be able to use their superannuation to buy a home and that home should, down the track, be counted in the assets test for pension eligibility.\nEchoing an idea raised by Treasurer Joe Hockey , the Committee for Economic Development of Australia says the use of super to buy a first home is \"perfectly sensible\".\n\"In March 2015, the Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey canvassed the idea of using superannuation savings to buy housing assets and was roundly criticised,\" says a new CEDA report on retirement income policy.\n\"However, such a reallocation of assets can be perfectly sensible. In principle we are merely talking about a transfer from one sort of asset to another, both of which will be needed to support the retirement phase of the individual's life.\"\nCEDA has joined a range of think-tanks challenging the long-standing exemption of the family home from the pension assets test.\nAn estimated $700 billion is tied up in such residences. The groups argue that unlocking some of that equity could reduce the national pension bill while giving retirees a more comfortable lifestyle.\nAt last week's National Reform Summit, free-market and progressive think-tanks agreed the government should put reverse mortgages – which allow homeowners to borrow money using the equity in their house as security – at the centre of retirement income policy. The summit was co-sponsored by The Australian Financial Review , The Australian and KPMG.\nThe CEDA report is due to be released on Tuesday.\n \"Home ownership rates continue to decline among younger households aged 25 to 44 years, partly due to a fall in housing affordability that hits first home buyers the hardest,\" it says.\nThe report argues that home ownership should be viewed as a key retirement pillar, alongside super and the pension.\nScrap super concessions To smooth out the tax treatment of each pillar, superannuation concessions should be scrapped, the report says.\n\"To maintain parity with investment in the family home, the funds need not be taxed again, but both the family home and superannuation assets should be included in any means test,\" it says.\nThe report acknowledges that paying more tax on super contributions will leave people with less retirement savings, adding to the pension burden.\nIt also concedes that allowing people to tap into their super to buy a house could push already high property prices up further. But this could be offset by \"better housing policies\".\nBut National Seniors Australia warned: \"Older Australians are strongly opposed to including the family home in the pension assets test and have a mistrust of reverse mortgages.\"\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said first home buyers should not be allowed to use super to buy a property. \"I respectfully, but profoundly, disagree [with that idea],\" he will say at the launch of the CEDA report.\n\"Allowing access to superannuation savings for first home buyers would drive up prices at the same time as eating away at retirement incomes.\"\nNet wealth in family homes Centre for Independent Studies economist Simon Cowan said a 20 per cent jump in house prices in recent years meant the total value of pension equity was likely to have reached $700 billion, and could be as high as $750 billion.\nMore than three-quarters of pensioners own their home and for older age groups 75 per cent of all net wealth is held within the family home.\nMr Cowan said a government-based reverse mortgage scheme would allow the release of some of that value to boost pensioners' living standards while easing pressure on the pension.\nThe left-leaning The Australian Institute is also sold on the idea of reverse mortgages. It wants the existing Pension Loan Scheme expanded so that asset-rich retirees are forced to spend down some of the equity in their homes.\nOnly retirees whose wealth or income makes them ineligible for the full age pension can access the scheme, which pays the equivalent of the full age pension on a fortnightly basis.\nThe Australia Institute says take-up could be dramatically increased by extending eligibility to everybody of pension age.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-08-31T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:06:30.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
