Caitlin Cronenberg by John McDonald Cinematic highlight of the week was Mohsen Makhmalbaf's The President , which opened the Persian International Film Festival in Sydney. Despite its grand title and the massive turn-out on opening night, the Festival only lasts for four days, which makes it impossible to review. This is partly because it is still early days for this event, and partly due to the perennial difficulties of making movies in Iran.\nThe President , which was largely shot in Georgia, is a reminder of the exceptional quality of Iranian cinema. It tells the story of a dictator in a nameless eastern European country, on the run during a revolution. His companion is his small grandson, who acts as a satirical echo of the general's former pretensions. Makhmalbaf has given us a film of poignant details and slow-building tension that left audiences gasping. Let's hope it gets an Australian release.\nThe President is an allegory that deals with no place in particular, but is relevant to every country that has lived under tyranny. Anton Corbijn's Life is a bio-pic that examines a few weeks in the life of James Dean (1931-55) – a screen legend on the strength of three films and an early death. This \"true life\" story leaves one wondering about Dean's personality. If he was really as moody and withdrawn as Dane DeHaan's portrayal he was a most unlikely Hollywood superstar.\nOne long flirtation David Wenham in \"Force of Destiny\" with Hannah Fredericksen who plays his daughter. Supplied Dean was Peter Pan in a leather jacket – destined to never grow old. Thanks to his role as Jim Stark in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955), he became an iconic figure for generations of misunderstood teenagers. He was dangerously sexy, to both women and men, and seems to have been actively bisexual.\nNot much of this comes through in Life , which depicts Dean as a brooding introvert who says he wants to be famous, while forever fleeing from publicity engagements. He wants to do \"good acting\", but has no patience with the way the studio markets its stars. His conversation is one long flirtation. An attitude of self-conscious ennui combines the demeanour of a surly adolescent with the studied cool of a would-be intellectual.\nDehaan has a full set of mannerisms, although the real Dean had a much sharper, angular look. Instead of projecting \"intensity\", he acts as if he's permanently stoned.\nThe movie follows photographer Dennis Stock (Robert Pattinson), who is trying to shoot a feature on Dean for Life magazine. This proves difficult, as his subject seems incapable of focusing on any task or appointment. Dean lives in his own head, constantly wavering between playing a role and rejecting the artifice of his profession.\n Anton Corbijn knows a few things about photographing the stars, as this was his job for many years until he directed the movie Control (2007), about Ian Curtis of Joy Division. That debut was more assured than this impressionistic effort, scripted by Australian Luke Davies, a writer who favours delineation of character over narrative. It is a beautifully shot movie, but seems to roll past in slow motion.\nThe James Dean myth Part of the problem lies with Pattinson, an actor with an emotional range that makes David Bowie look versatile. I've watched this former teen idol in half a dozen films over the past few years, and am still awaiting a convincing performance.\nDeHaan is much better as Dean because he has created a complete persona. Whether it's accurate or not is of less import. Ben Kingsley verges on caricature as larger-than-life studio boss, Jack Warner; while Joel Edgerton plays it straight as legendary photo editor, John Morris.\nPattinson's Stock is a lonely man, estranged from his wife and child. He is looking for a subject that will help establish his reputation, and his instincts tell him Dean provides that opportunity. Their relationship has a cat and mouse aspect as Dean leads Stock through the bars of Bohemian New York, but gives him little to photograph.\nOn the verge of giving up the project he travels with Dean to the family farm in Indiana. This allows him to discover Jimmy the farm boy, which makes for a neat contrast with Jimmy the sullen young star. It's the element of authenticity he needs, although it's difficult to say whether Stock discovered or fabricated this desirable image.\nHe has spied something extraordinary behind Dean's meandering habits and speech. The success of this film depends on whether the viewer is able to glimpse those same qualities. Dean's mythologisation had hardly begun, but already there was no clear line between reality and fantasy, art and life.\nOrdeal by death Paul Cox's Force of Destiny is another film that straddles the twilight zone between life and art, but this is because the story is so closely based on the director's own battles that it becomes an oblique autobiography.\nIn 2009 Cox was diagnosed with liver cancer and given only a short time to live. Towards the end of that year he received a liver transplant, and has since turned his experiences into a book, a documentary, and now a feature film. Force of Destiny is a fictionalised account of Cox's ordeal, in which David Wenham plays Robert, a successful mid-career sculptor struck down by the same illness.\nThe upside of the story is that while recovering from surgery, Cox met Rosie Raka, who had also undergone a liver transplant. The two survivors are now partners in life.\nThis romantic theme finds its way into Force of Destiny , but the woman who provides Robert's salvation is not another cancer patient, but a young Indian marine biologist named Maya, played by rising Bollywood actress, Shahana Goswarmi.\nMaya's occupation allows Cox to play with various metaphors, while the Indian element takes him into cosmic territory. \"Maya\" means life force, and Cox gives us a blast of Indian exoticism as an antidote for the morbid fears and fancies of the cancer patient. The story flips, in rather confusing fashion, between Australia and India. We can hardly believe that Robert has gone off visiting Indian temples when he is on stand-by for a liver transplant. Is this a dream sequence? A premonition of the future?\nIn his typical manner Cox intersperses a narrative presented in a plain, no-frill style, with bursts of surreal Super-8 footage intended to represent scattered thoughts and memories rushing through Robert's mind. As we go deeper into the story, the Indian content becomes more intrusive, and frankly silly, with sitar music and dancing.\nThe grim realism of Robert's struggle with cancer sits awkwardly with the B-movie portrayal of the Indian characters. This display of patchiness, ambition and indulgence is very typical of Cox's style. He is one of Australia's most talented filmmakers, but has never made a movie that doesn't veer off into some creative cul-de-sac. It may be that he over-intellectualises his scenarios, or wants to be seen as an artist, not simply a story-teller.\nPaul Cox approach has problems Even the title of this film strikes a false note. It makes one think of a Douglas Sirk melodrama instead of a naturalistic examination of one man's battle with cancer, punctuated by jarring, arty interludes. Sirk wanted to sweep the viewer along, but Cox takes a more Brechtian approach, asking us to periodically pause and reflect.\nThe strength of this movie lies with the realistic portrayal of a man dealt a devastating blow by fate, who goes through all the emotional states one might expect. Robert is disbelieving, angry, despairing, and finally hopeful. After tip-toeing along the edge of the abyss, Cox has found a new passion for life. This makes Force of Destiny a surprisingly positive film, even if there is a lot of angst to be negotiated along the way.\nThe film centres around the performance of David Wenham in the lead role, who has to convey many conflcting feelings while trying to maintain his composure. It's a difficult task and he's only partly successful, often falling back on the \"stunned mullet\" expression. Although Robert is a sculptor he might just as easily be a bricklayer or an accountant, as his creative vocation has little connection with his illness. We spend the film surrounded by artworks (by Trefor Prest), but they act as a backdrop, not an organic part of the story.\nRobert has the support of his ex-wife, Hannah (Jacqueline McKenzie) and his daughter, Poppy (Hannah Fredericksen), who fuss and care for him, but it is his developing relationship with Maya that gives him a reason to live. He rails against the injustice of being handed a death sentence when he has just met his soul-mate. Maya's role, as a font of ancient Indian wisdom, is to make him aware that the world is no more than a veil of illusion, and that one must transcend its cares to achieve true spiritual awareness.\nPerhaps only a cancer survivor could judge the accuracy of Cox's portrait of a man stricken by the disease. It feels convincing, even allowing for the subcontinental subplot, which teeters on the brink of self-parody.\nForce of Destiny is such a personal film it gives one the awkward feeling of reviewing the director's life rather than his handiwork. This is inevitable when dealing with a story so closely connected with real life experiences. While Cox would not deny the centrality of those experiences, neither would he want viewers to treat the film as a true confession or a plea for sympathy. For a director who has often been accused of making depressing movies, this is his victory over death.\nJohn McDonald also writes on visual art for The Sydney Morning Herald .\n﻿\nLife\nDirected by Anton Corbijn\nWritten by Luke Davies\nStarring Robert Pattinson, Dane DeHaan, Ben Kingsley, Joel Edgerton.
