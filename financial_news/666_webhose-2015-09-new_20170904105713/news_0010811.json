When this continues over a prolonged period, the national debt rises. Today, with over $18.367 trillion in debt, one might assume our elected officials would do everything in their power to curb spending. Rather than reduce the deficit, however, it is increasing. In this article, we’ll look at the federal government’s annual budget shortfall/surplus since 1900 and explain when Washington went astray, and why . Surplus-Deficit 101 The federal government operates on a fiscal year basis which ends September 30th each year (prior to 1977 it ended June 30th). When its fiscal year ends, total spending and total revenue are vetted. The result is a deficit or a surplus. At times, deficits are to be expected, such as during a war or an economic downturn. During the first 74 years of the 1900s the federal government’s fiscal budget hovered around zero. After that, deficits became the norm and the national debt began to rise. The Federal Budget: 1901 to 2014 To gain a thorough perspective we’ll refer to the following chart (CHART A). It contains the federal government’s fiscal year budget results from 1901 to 2014. The vertical-grey shaded areas indicate recessions. As the chart demonstrates, recessions were very common during the early part of the century.When analyzing the deficit, it’s prudent to compare it to the size of the economy (i.e. GDP). This is because a $100 million deficit in 1900 is far worse than a $100 million deficit today. Here are a few past deficits as a percentage of GDP at that time.• In 1919, during World War I, the deficit was 17.0% of GDP.• In 1943, during World War II, the deficit was 26.9% of GDP. This was also at the end of the Great Depression which began in 1929.• In 1953, during the Korean War, the deficit was 1.67% of GDP. As the chart above demonstrates, prior to 1974, deficits emerged during a war and vanished soon after it ended. During this period the federal government also tended to exhibit greater fiscal judgement. After 1974, however, deficits became common as Congressional spending rose faster than revenue.For example, during the entire period (1900 to 2015) the federal budget had a deficit 71% of the time. From 1900 through 1970, deficits occurred 59% of the time. Between 1971 and 2014 there was a deficit 91% of the time! In short, after 1970, the only time the government had a budget surplus was from 1998 to 2001.What caused the drastic rise in the deficits after 1974? The actual story is quite involved. Here’s the shortened version. In July 1971, President Nixon ended the right to convert U.S. currency to gold and caused what became known as the “Nixon Shock.” Without a gold standard, there was nothing to back the dollar, and the door was opened for increased Congressional spending. Today’s Deficits and the Future In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the federal deficits were much greater than at any other time in history. Glancing back at CHART A, when the Great Recession ended in 2009, the budget deficit had reached an all-time high of more than $1.4 trillion. This was due to a decrease in government revenue (i.e. tax receipts) and an increase in federal spending. As I write this, federal government spending is once again increasing faster than revenue, causing the deficit to rise. What can we expect in the future?In July 2014, I attended the 6th Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While there, I spoke with two district Federal Reserve Presidents. According to these experts, the deficit should improve until 2020. Then, entitlement spending is expected to rise, placing increased stress on the budget, causing the deficit to rise. As long as we have a deficit the national debt will also rise.With the national debt at an all-time high and a Congress that refuses to tighten the belt, I expect the debt will continue higher until the next crisis emerges. It seems the only time Washington acts in a fiscally-prudent manner is when they are facing a crisis and have no other choice. Therefore, keep an eye on your wallet because Washington will be looking for new and innovative ways to increase its revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T04:10:43.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
