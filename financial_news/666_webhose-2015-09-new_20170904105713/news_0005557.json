CML Annual buy-to-let lending is still off its 2007 peak \nThe trade body said that upcoming tax changes introduced by the Chancellor in this year's Budget could make property to rent a less attractive. \nAlmost a quarter of all buy-to-let loans are for properties in London, which is almost twice the share the capital has for home buyer mortgages. \nIn second place the South East sees 15 per cent of landlord loans, only slightly less than its equivalent for owner-occupied lending.
