Alex Ellinghausen It was agreed she would visit Abbott before question time to tell him he had lost support of the backbench and the majority of the cabinet.\nBishop visited Abbott at noon and \"it was a short meeting\", a source said.\n\"He wasn't happy, to say the least,\" the source said\nWhen question time finished at 3.10pm, Turnbull jumped up and grabbed Abbott's attention. He followed the Prime Minister back to his office and, during a 20-minute meeting, Turnbull told Abbott that unless he stood aside he would challenge.\n After that meeting, the news broke. Labor leader Bill Shorten was sitting at Aussies Cafe having a coffee.\n\"There you go,\" he said, pointing to the television against the wall announcing that Turnbull had called it on.\nOutline his reasons Turnbull addressed the media at 4pm to outline his reasons for moving.\nAbbott called in his inner circle of Kevin Andrews, Mathias Cormann and Eric Abetz to decide what to do.\nSources said it was not until Bishop was brought on board that it was decided to move. Scott Morrison had been passive. Unlike the attempted spill in February, he was not a contender this time for a leadership position.\nMorrison, who would replace Abbott as the leading figure in the Right if Abbott falls, was able to stay loyal to the Prime Minister.\nMorrison, who controls up to 10 votes, was counselled against seeking the leadership himself. He was reportedly offered the Treasury by Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull in an effort to win his support.\nHe will vote for Abbott but not run as his deputy. This is seen as a sign Morrison will serve under Turnbull as Treasurer.\nBishop will stay on as Deputy Leader and Foreign Minister.\nThe coup gathered a head of steam in Parliament last week as MPs gathered and came to the conclusion Abbott would not be able to reverse the party's fortunes.\nForge ahead with spill It was decided pretty much to forge ahead with a spill, regardless of the outcome in Canning. That they decided to move before Canning reinforces that.\nThe deadline for change had been set back in late January after the Prince Philip debacle but before the spill attempt in early February.\nIt was designed more in hope than belief that Abbott could turn things around. More significantly, the plotters wanted to minimise the \"Gillard factor\" â€“ the severe backlash that hit Labor following its sudden dumping of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.\nThe plotters figured that if Abbott had been unable to redeem himself in another six to eight months, the voters would understand the decision, even part-own it.\nIf Abbott falls, he would have fallen two and a half months short of being Liberal leaders for six years.\nHe is the fourth-longest-serving leader after Robert Menzies, John Howard and Malcolm Fraser.\nHe would have served just two years as Prime Minister, almost a year less than Kevin Rudd and a year shorter than Julia Gillard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:10:22.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
