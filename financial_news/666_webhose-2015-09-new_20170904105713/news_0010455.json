(NYSE: WMT) has cut the hours of many employees. In February, Wal-Mart announced plans to increase wages for its entry-level employees. Wal-Mart Stores said it is increasing wages for 40 percent of its workforce company-wide, which is nearly half a million people, after the retailer reported the first increase in shopper traffic in more than two years. The cost of that wage increase has been estimated at more than $1 billion, and it seems as though the retailer is offsetting that cost with cuts to employee hours. The reductions have began weeks ago, during the busy back-to-school shopping period. \"Managing hours is a routine part of running a sustainable operation,\" Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement to CNBC . \"And in select number of stores, it requires keeping those hours to what was originally budgeted.\" Wal-Mart is the No. 10 largest employer in Memphis, with more than 5,300 employees in the area. The retail giant said all of its domestic workers will earn at least $9/hour by April 2015. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. \nGet Memphis Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:37:45.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
