The new levy, announced in the summer Budget , will apply to institutions with profits above £25m per year. \n“This is aimed at policymakers to get them to try, when they come to a new policy decision, to think of banks and building societies as different, rather than lumping them all together, and then coming up with a solution and tweaking it for building societies after,” said Andrew Gall, an economist at the Building Societies Association. \nThe report notes that even though building societies do not have the same profit motive as banks because they have no shareholders, their cost-to-income ratios are broadly the same as banks - indicating their operations are just as efficient. \nMutuals also provide better value to customers than banks because they offer more interest to savers and lower costs to borrowers, the BSA argues. \n“This is to emphasise that building societies have a different purpose to banks, which has effects on how they are run, the risks they take, and their outlook - and therefore has effects on competition in the market and on stability,\" Mr Gall said. \nNationwide’s chief executive Graham Beale wrote in the Telegraph this week that building societies are fundamentally different to banks because they are limited largely to mortgage lending and are owned by their members rather than shareholders. \nIn addition, Mr Beale said that mutuals had kept lending going in the financial crisis when banks were facing a major squeeze, helping households and keeping the housing market afloat. \nAs a result, he argued, they should be treated differently to banks, and not pay the 8pc corporation tax supplement proposed by George Osborne. \nLabour politicians had tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill this week to create the option to exempt smaller lenders from the tax, but it was rejected by MPs. \nAndy Caton from the Yorkshire Building Society said the campaign would not cease just because of that vote. \n“A detailed review of the impact of the new surcharge would be a very welcome move,\" he said. \n“Any truly impartial assessment would conclude that the proposal would have unintended negative consequences on diversity and competition within the sector, and ultimately hurt consumers.” \nChallenger (Hamburg: 4SE.HM - news ) banks - smaller players who hope to take on big high street names such as Lloyds and HSBC - are also opposed to the tax. Representatives from the challenger sector are meeting Treasury officials this week to lobby against the charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:19:15.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
