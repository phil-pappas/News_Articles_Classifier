A separate private survey on manufacturing was equally downbeat.\nInvestors largely ignored fresh stimulus measures unveiled by the government, including further relaxation in property investment rules, and policies to support mergers and acquisitions and share buy-backs by listed companies.\nDu Changchun, analysts at Northeast Securities in Shanghai, said that many investors, worried about the economy, choose to stand on the sidelines.\nStimulus policies \"are more likely to help the economy instead of the stock market, and it takes some time for these measures to take effect.\n\"Investors have little willingness to get into the market.\"\nMost sectors fell but an index tracking banking shares erased early losses and was up 1.2 percent by midday, as the previous days' correction attracted bargain hunting.\nAlso bucking the trend are oil giants PetroChina and Sinopec, both up over 3 percent after a recent surge in global oil prices.\nSmall caps posted heavy losses. Shenzhen's growth board ChiNext and the CSI500 index of small companies both tumbled over 3 percent.\nBright Dairy & Food Co slumped 5.2 percent, adding to Monday's 4.8 percent fall, after the company reported weak earnings, and was downgraded by Credit Suisse.\nIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 0.5 percent, to 21,569.14 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 1.3 percent, to 9,620.06.\nHong Kong retail sales fell for the fifth straight month in July, as a slowdown in tourist arrivals further battered sales of big-ticket items such as jewellery and watches, while a plunge in the stock market hurt consumer sentiment.\nMost major sectors fell in the city.
