It competes with larger, established rivals such as EMC Corp and NetApp Inc.\nThe company's IPO comes even as some fast-growing technology companies are shunning public listings, preferring to raise money in the private market at high valuations.\nThe technology sector accounted for just 11 percent of IPOs so far this year, the lowest since 2008, according to Renaissance Capital.\nReuters reported in April that Pure storage was preparing for an IPO.\nPure Storage's revenue more than quadrupled to $174.4 million for the year ended Jan. 31. However, net loss increased to $183.2 million from $78.6 million.\nThe company's customers include Lamar Advertising Co , Shutterfly Inc, Intuit Inc and Skullcandy Inc.\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith are among those underwriting the IPO.\nPure Storage plans to list its Class A common stock under the symbol \"PSTG\" on the New York Stock Exchange.
