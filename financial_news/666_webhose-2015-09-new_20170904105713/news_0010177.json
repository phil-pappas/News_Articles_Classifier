According to Bloomberg , which cited people familiar with the matter, authorities are looking into the cause of the sharp swings seen in the Chinese stock market recently. \nLi's husband said in a telephone interview that she is in a meeting with \"relevant industry authorities\" and he doesn't know who they are, Bloomberg reported. He said he spoke to her on the phone and expects her back home soon but does not know when. \nAtif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said the lack of detail on this story is weighing on Man (Swiss: MAN.SW - news ) , but some of the downside is also due to general weakness in the market. \n\"The AHL fund has performed well through the recent market volatility and given the strong price action in the last three months we have seen some natural profit taking and reallocation of capital into other names,\" he said. \nAt 0950, Man Group shares were down 6.5% at 150.60p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:17:32.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
