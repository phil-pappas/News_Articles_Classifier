In 2000, tech entrepreneurs John Long and Helena Mitchell took his Czech-built, Streamline Moderne automobile on a circumnavigation of North America, starting in Toronto. “As one does,” he said with a laugh.\nUpon returning home, Ms. Mitchell noted that next time she would like to have a travel trailer. Apparently, you don’t say these things to Mr. Long without consequences. Three months later, he announced he had found the perfect travel trailer to pull behind a Tatra.\nAnd he did: A 1935 Bowlus Road Chief, #149, built in San Fernando, Calif., by the company and family of William Hawley Bowlus. The designer of record for Charles Lindbergh’s “Spirit of St. Louis,” Mr. Bowlus sold about 80 trailers of his own design—rivet-skinned and mirror-bright, sleek with American optimism—before the Depression took its toll. Though later eclipsed in reputation by Airstream, Bowlus was the first aluminum-skinned travel-trailer company. About half of those made survive today.\nENLARGE PAST PRESENT | The Road Chief camper has a long legacy behind it. Photo: Bowlus Road Chief The couple’s journey to their current, unlikely status—as recreational-vehicle makers in Oxnard, Calif.—encompasses a 10-year restoration project of #149; their daughter Geneva’s 2012 graduation from the Wharton School (she’s half-owner of the new company, also called Bowlus); and Mr. Long’s wild string of good luck, such as locating Mr. Bowlus’s nephew, once a 16-year-old shop hand, still alive and full of stories. Bob Bowlus had in his possession detailed logbooks kept by Mr. Bowlus’s father, C.W., head of production. With these resources at hand, Mr. Long was able to write the definitive history of Bowlus and its trailers.\nAfter transcendent study of the original, Long-Mitchell have begun series production of a new, ultramodern Road Chief, which I am prepared to declare the best travel trailer in the world, by a carefree mile. I am also obliged to report that, at a $110,000 MSRP, these hand-built, best-of-everything works of art are insanely underpriced. If you want one better get one.\nI almost feel like I should recuse myself, because part of my delight stems from my contempt for the baseline shoddiness of the RV industry in general. The Road Chief is as far from a big white box of depreciation as possible.\n“We built it for multigenerational use,” said Mr. Long.\nI met Long-Mitchell and their two trailers—the original and the new model—at Albatross Ridge vineyards in Carmel Valley, Monterey County, Calif., now owned by Mr. Bowlus’s grandson Brad Bowlus (the family is not involved with the trailer company, but they are fans). Messrs. Lindbergh and Bowlus flew sailplanes from these wind-driven ridges. In full sun, the two Road Chiefs virtually disappeared, in a panoptic camouflage of the mirrored landscape.\nThe trailer’s lightweight rigidity is owed to the more than 5,000 hand-bucked rivets holding the load-bearing skin, the monocoque, to the tubular subframe. The 24-foot, two-wheel trailer weighs 2,300 pounds—roughly 3,300 pounds lighter than a 25-foot Airstream—with a center of gravity about 2 feet lower than the same Airstream. The new Road Chief can be easily moved by hand to make hitching easy.\nDan Neil at the Frankfurt Auto Show Rolls-Royce Dawn Makes World Debut Audi Debuts its All-Electric SUV Concept Car The Mercedes Concept Car That Morphs on the Move Porsche Set to Electrify the Future These dry facts hardly take away from the moment you see the Road Chief from behind, the perfectly converging lines of rivets and the pair of brass-screened windows, looking like the eye holes of a medieval helmet.\nNote that no accessories impose themselves on the fuselage to create additional drag while towing. The 8,000-BTU air-conditioning unit, propane fuel tank, absorbent glass-mat batteries and various antennae are packed within the metal envelope. Bikes, kayaks and other long items can be transported inside the trailer using integrated cargo racks to suspend them in the aisle.\nENLARGE ULTRA MODERN | A look inside the Road Chief camper. Photo: Bowlus Road Chief Inside, all the built-in cabinetry—galley cupboards, stateroom and head—is riveted aluminum with stainless-steel tops. In the galley are a glass-top cooktop, microwave and 3.1-cubic-foot DC-powered fridge. The cabin is paneled with hand-finished maple veneer plywood. An aesthetic of elegant essentialism prevails, a design mood right out of live-aboard sailing yachts, or perhaps the gondolas of trans-Atlantic dirigibles that never were.\nA doer himself, Mr. Long has made lots of provision for productivity on the road, designing in a 3G-LTE amplifier for wireless, an integrated device-charging station, and optional solar panels to keep the juices flowing in the outback.\nAnd they lived happily ever after.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH735_RUMBLE_P_20150914170941.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH735_RUMBLE_M_20150914170941.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH734_RUMBLE_P_20150914170103.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH734_RUMBLE_M_20150914170103.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:49:25.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
