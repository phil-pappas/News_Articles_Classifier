Photo: FDC\nSurging stockpiles of zinc, the metal used to galvanize steel, are signaling ample supplies and pushed prices lower for a fourth straight session.\nInventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange jumped 7.9 per cent in two days, the biggest such gain in almost four weeks. The hoard reached 617,325 metric tons on Tuesday, the highest since February. Stockpiles have increased by 45 per cent since touching a five-year low on August 10. The gains come amid concerns that demand is slowing in China, the world's biggest metals consumer.\n\"Lower anticipated demand from Chinese economic weakness has reduced pressure for material in the near term,\" Tai Wong, the director of commodity products trading at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said in a telephone interview. \"And when you see a big stock build like that in the short term, it has a fairly strong negative correlation to prices.\"\nZinc for delivery in three months fell 0.8 per cent to close at $US1738 a ton at 5.50pm on the LME, after reaching $US1698, the lowest since August 27. Four days of losses is the longest streak since August 3.\nAdvertisement Also on the LME, aluminum and tin fell, while copper, nickel and lead rose. Copper futures for December delivery climbed 0.9 per cent to $US2.4265 on the Comex in New York. The Bloomberg Industrial Metals Subindex has tumbled 18 per cent this year on oversupply concerns.\nMetals producers have been punished because of declining prices. The Bloomberg World Mining Index fell as much as 2.2 per cent on Tuesday as shares of Glencore sank to a record low. The company has erased the gains it made earlier this month on a $US10 billion debt-reduction plan designed to reassure investors amid mounting concern over the commodity trader and miner's borrowing load.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:32:03.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
