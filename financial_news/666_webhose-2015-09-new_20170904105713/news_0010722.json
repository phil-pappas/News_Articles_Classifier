Photo: Louie Douvis\nRio Tinto is sticking to its claim that Chinese steel production will reach 1 billion tonnes and forecast strong demand for iron ore and steel from other emerging markets over the next 15 years.\nEven at the significantly lower prices on offer, iron ore remains Rio's biggest money spinner.\nThe company has used a market update on Thursday to declare it still believes in the China growth story and sees an \"inflection point\" looming for demand from other nations.\nThe 1 billion tonne target for Chinese steel production was one of the founding principles behind the past decade of rapid growth in Australia's iron ore industry.\nAdvertisement However, companies like BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group have recently given up on it.\nBHP revealed last week it had lowered its expectations of Chinese steel production.\nIt expects it to peak between 935 million tonnes and 985 million tonnes in a forecast that implies steel production in the middle kingdom is set to continue growing, but not as high as previously thought.\nFortescue believes Chinese steel production is close to peaking.\nThe China Iron and Steel Association believed the sector peaked in 2014.\nRio insisted on Thursday that Chinese steel production would reach \"around\" 1 billion tonnes by 2030.\nIt said the demand prospects for 2016 were looking better than the \"stagnation\" witnessed thus far in 2015.\nIn a more surprising statement, Rio also predicted non-Chinese steel demand would grow by 65 per cent over the next 15 years.\nThe prediction was based on expected growth in nations like Vietnam, India, Indonesia and other emerging economies.\n\"What we [are] seeing is economies in emerging Asia now beginning to reach a point of inflection that requires greater steel use. They will require more infrastructure; more of the fundamental capital that is required in the development process,\" Rio's head of economics and markets, Vivek Tulpuleâ€‹, said.\n\"It shouldn't really surprise us to see an acceleration in steel use in this period of time as economies become more capital intensive as they build the stock that is required to grow.\"\nMr Tulpule said gross domestic product growth over the next 15 years should be about 6.5 per cent per year in India and about 5 per cent per year in south-east Asian nations, and steel demand in those nations should be slightly stronger than GDP.\nIn the final stages of its expansion towards 360 million tonnes of iron ore output per year, Rio has completed rail and port extensions and only has to grow mine output to reach its growth target.\nThe miner shipped 302.6 million tonnes in 2014. It expects to export 340 million tonnes in 2015.\nIts growth target is 360 million tonnes per year, and to reach that level, it needs to fully develop the Silvergrass iron ore mine in the Pilbara.\nThe Silvergrass development will go before the Rio board for approval in 2016.\nRio's iron ore boss, Andrew Harding, said recent deferrals of the mine development had delivered significant cost savings.\nRio has not said when it expects to reach 360 million tonnes per year.\nHowever, it has said it expects to reach 350 million tonnes by 2017 and the 360 million tonne target is expected to be hit soon after that mark.\nIn 2011, Rio said it had options to grow iron ore production to 433 million tonnes.\nHowever, that target has been put on the backburner since iron ore prices have weakened.\nMr Harding declined to be drawn on growth targets beyond 360 million tonnes.\n\"At the moment, I am totally focused on getting us to the 360 million tonnes target. It is going to take us several more years to actually do that and that is the work I am focusing on,\" he said.\nRio's iron ore business uses driverless trucks and the company is installing driverless trains to run between the mines and Port Hedland.\nThe driverless trains are expected to be fully installed by mid-2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:48:59.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
