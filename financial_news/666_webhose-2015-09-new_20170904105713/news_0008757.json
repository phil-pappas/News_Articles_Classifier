Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Karen Maley Investors enjoyed some respite last week from the anxiety that has hung over markets in the past few months, but some analysts warn that it's only a matter of time before the lack of liquidity in global markets triggers a fresh round of turbulence.\nAnalysts warn that there is a lack of liquidity in global markets despite the aggressive bond-buying programs that have been launched by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\nThe problem is that emerging markets are battling massive capital outflows as risk-averse foreign investors withdraw their funds. In many cases, this has forced central banks to intervene in markets to stop their currencies from falling too sharply.\nTo do this, emerging markets have had to sell down their foreign reserves, which are typically held in high-quality assets such as US or European bonds. These bond sales tend to push down bond prices, causing long-term interest rates to rise (bond yields rise as prices fall).\nThe fear is that these sales of US and European bonds by central banks in emerging markets – which some analysts are calling \"quantitative tightening\" – could swamp the effects of the bond-buying programs that are being run by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Together these two central banks are buying about $US130 billion ($181 billion) of bonds each month.\nIndeed, some believe that the lack of liquidity was a big reason for the turmoil in global financial markets in August.\nIntervened heavily China's foreign exchange reserves plunged by almost $US94 billion in August as Beijing intervened heavily to halt a slide in the yuan. At the same time, central banks in other emerging markets spent an estimated $70 billion in the month trying to defend their currencies.\n Together, this $US160 billion or so in bond sales in Europe and the United States eclipsed the bond purchases by the ECB and the Bank of Japan, and was probably a factor in pushing up global bond yields, and pushing down the price of risky assets such as shares.\nThe big question for investors is whether emerging-market central banks will be forced to continue to intervene as heavily to prop up their currencies.\nIf China and other emerging markets wind down their intervention and stop selling US and European bonds as heavily, the drain on global liquidity will ease.\nUnfortunately, emerging markets are still suffering from heavy capital outflows, leaving central banks in these countries with little choice but to continue running down their foreign reserves to defend their currencies.\nDeprived of the plentiful supply of liquidity that they've enjoyed since the financial crisis (central banks have injected about $US10 trillion in funds through bond-buying programs in the past five years alone), global markets are likely to struggle to retain their lofty levels, particularly if US and European bond yields start to climb higher.\nApart from the problems arising from emerging-market bond sales, there's a more general problem with liquidity levels in the bond markets around the world.\nSomething curious happening As Guy Debelle, the Reserve Bank of Australia's assistant governor (financial markets), noted in a speech in Sydney this week, something curious is happening in bond markets. On one hand it's very easy for investors to offload small parcels of bonds for very close to the prevailing market price. But, he says, investors' ability to sell large parcels of bonds is \"worse than it's been for quite some time\".\nDebelle argues that this is because the market has changed in response to technological and regulatory changes, as well as the shift in the behavioural patterns of big institutions.\nThe major technological change is the increased prevalence of electronic trading in global bond markets. In the Australian bond market, electronic trading accounts for about one-third of the trade in Australian government bonds. In the United States, it accounts for more than a half.\nElectronic trading has also encouraged the emergence of high-frequency trading firms, which are providing liquidity for small trades, but which are often unable to trade in large amounts because of balance sheet constraints.\nAs a result, Debelle argues there has been a shift in market share \"from those who provide immediate and continuous liquidity and have the ability to warehouse risk to those who do the same, but don't have the capacity to warehouse risk\".\nAt the same time, regulatory changes have increased the cost to banks of providing liquidity in the bond market. As a result, some players have withdrawn from the market, while others have scaled back their activity. Even for those banks that have remained active in the market, higher costs mean their bond desks hold less stock than they once did.\nReduced capacity But not only are the banks providing less liquidity, they also have a reduced capacity to warehouse risk. In the past, banks were among the first to step into the market and buy bonds when they saw prices had fallen too far. But Debelle says \"as a result of regulatory changes, as well as their own risk tolerances, they are less willing and able to do this today\".\nThe problem is that fund managers are often constrained by their mandates from jumping into markets and buying assets such as bonds when their prices have dropped sharply.\nIf neither banks nor fund managers are willing or able to buy bonds when their prices have dropped too far, Debelle warns that \"prices will move by larger amounts and remain away from equilibrium values for longer. Volatility will be higher.\"\nAs volatility spikes, he says, \"overshooting will be more likely and that can have longlasting and more deleterious consequences.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:52:05.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
