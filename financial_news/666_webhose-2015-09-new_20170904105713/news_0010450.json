It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will then rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028. \nAn intention to increase the age to 68 in 2046 has also been suggested although the Government has said this figure will be reviewed. \"The writing's on the wall,\" Mr McLean added. \"It will rise to 68 far sooner on that based on the current projections for life expectancy.\" \nThe \"third of life\" notion was first suggested in the 2013 Autumn Statement along with an intention to review the age every five years. The first of these reviews will be in 2017. \nMr McClean said a full-scale review of the state pension was needed, if the intention was to keep increasing the pension age indefinitely. He suggested there could be a minimum pension age of 66 but with early access resulting in lower payments. \nTom McPhail, head of pensions research at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the figures were a warning of the need to acrue enough savings to cover ever-longer retirements. \nMaking an investment pot last has also become a more pressing issue after the rules were changed to offer more pension freedoms in April. Many more people are expected to live on the income of their savings, perhaps drawing some capital, rather than commit to buying an annuity, where a saver hands over a lump sum in exchange for regular income until they die. \nMr McPhail said: \"It is vital to ensure you have made financial preparations to meet your income needs well into your third, or even your fourth decade of retirement. For many people, an annuity will continue to be the logical retirement income choice for at least part of their pension fund.” \n“If you are using drawdown to pay a retirement income then you don’t want your 90th birthday to come as an unwelcome surprise; it is essential to make sure that your income withdrawals and investment strategy remain sustainable over the long term.” \n- Put a question to the expert: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:45:15.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
