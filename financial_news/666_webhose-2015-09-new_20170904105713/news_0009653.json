Three further banks including MM Warburg are acting in further roles, one of the people said. \nHapag-Lloyd and the banks declined to comment. \nLast month, Hapag-Lloyd decided to prepare for an official announcement of the IPO as early as September, but China's market woes have prompted it to reconsider the timing of the deal, the people said. \n\"The Hapag-Lloyd story needs a strong market, as its business depends on global growth and trade flows,\" one of the people said. \nInvestor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) assumptions on the development of the China market crisis and potential effects on the real economy and trade activity are being taken into account when picking a date for the flotation, the person said. \n\"No final decision has been taken, the intention to float may still be published later this month,\" the person said. \nBetween 20 and 40 European listings are scheduled in the next few months, and bankers involved in such deals are hopeful that markets roiled by China's limp growth prospects can be sufficiently soothed.
