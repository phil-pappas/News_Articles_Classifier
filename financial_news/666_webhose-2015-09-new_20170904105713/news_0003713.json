With this new move, users of AGCO’s guidance systems will have greater choice as to which receivers they employ with their farm equipment to process the positioning information sent from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). This new offering represents a significant update for VarioGuide, available on AGCO’s Fendt ® machines, and for Auto-Guide TM for all other AGCO brands including Challenger ® , Massey Ferguson ® and Valtra ® . As part of Fuse ® , AGCO’s open approach to precision agriculture focused on optimizing the farm, these new guidance offerings bring customers more guidance and correction signal choices than any other manufacturer. With the new Auto-Guide and VarioGuide equipped AGCO machines, customers can choose the accuracy level, the correction source and now also the GNSS receiver—Trimble ® or NovAtel ® —that best meet their requirements. “Growers need solutions focused on reducing farm waste and improving yields,” said Matt Rushing, vice president, Global Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) Product Line at AGCO. “Aligning with our Fuse promise, this new technology is about openness and facilitation, not limitation. To do this, we’re changing the way we deploy our technology to let customers choose what is best for them,” said Mr. Rushing. “With the support of new partners like Trimble and NovAtel, our customers now have more freedom and flexibility than ever before, and AGCO adds to its ever expanding list of Fuse partners.” These new technologies will become available globally on many AGCO machines starting in the third and fourth quarters this year on select tractors and combines in North America, and self-propelled sprayers and tractors in Western Europe with additional machines to follow in the future.
