It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a victory for the Derby-based engineer, as Airbus’s current Beluga fleet use engines made by American rival GE. \nBertrand George, an Airbus vice-president, said: “We look forward to the Trent 700 powering this important development in our air transport strategy. The engine has an excellent record on the A330 and is ideally suited to our requirements for this aircraft.” \nSimon Carlisle, Rolls-Royce executive vice-president, added: “We welcome this decision to select an engine that is the clear market leader on the A330 and offers outstanding performance in terms of fuel burn, reliability, emissions and noise.” \nThe design for Airbus’s new Beluga transporters will be based on the company’s A330 jet, which is larger than the older A300 model from which the earlier Belugas were developed. \nThe five new Beluga XL jets will be able to carry almost a third more cargo than the aircraft currently in service. \nThey are needed by Airbus to cope with rising demand. The company is increasing production of its latest A350XWB aircraft and has a record order book approaching 7,000 jets . \nAirbus’s roots as a pan-European aircraft manufacturer means it has facilities located around the continent making major sections of aeroplanes. These are then brought together at final assembly plants in Toulouse, Hamburg and Tiajian in China. A new plant is currently being constructed in Mobile, Alabama. \nBelugas are a regular sight at Airbus’s plant in Broughton, North Wales, where the wings for all of the company’s airliners are manufactured. Airbus recently invested £21m in a new loading dock at the site so Belugas can take on board wings under cover . \nPreviously, operations could only be carried out on relatively calm days because when the Belugas’ giant cargo doors were opened they acted as giant sails, making it operations dangerous if gusts touched 30 knots. \nThe Trent 700 is Rolls-Royce’s most popular engine, with more than 1,500 in service. It has won 60pc of new orders in its class over the past three years and also powers 90pc of all A330 freighter aircraft. \nHowever, the Trent 700 has recently been a source of trouble for the company . In July the FTSE 100-listed business issued a profit warning, largely because sales of the engine are set to decline faster than the engineering group had forecast. \nAirbus is running down production of its A330 aircraft, which are powered by Rolls Trent 700 engines, ahead of the introduction of the new A330neo model with more efficient Rolls' Trent 7000 engines. \nAccordingly, airlines are reluctant to buy the older jet with a new model waiting in the wings, so Airbus is scaling back production. \nBut while Rolls had been forecasting a fall in the number of old-model A330s built and sold, the rate of decline has been greater than expected and means the market for its 700 engines and their servicing deals is also shrinking faster than forecast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:02:33.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
