That contract is estimated to be worth $15 million to $30 million, and has resulted in 30 blue chip advertising clients in the GroupM portfolio using premium YouTube ads this year. The agreement expires early next year and Google is giving little away on whether it will strike a similar exclusive contract in 2016 with GroupM or a rival buying group.\nMs Carnegie ensured traditional TV broadcasters felt some pressure in front of marketers and agency buyers on Friday.\n\"The amount of time Australians spend on YouTube is growing at a rate that we haven't seen for years,\" she said. \"In fact it is growing by over 60 per cent year on year. Mobile growth has been so strong that the watch time on YouTube on mobile devices alone reaches more Australians than subscription TV in total.\"\nClicks v watch time They are robust viewing figures but when asked by The Australian Financial Review , Google refused to break down the viewing time on YouTube that its 60 per cent Australian growth claim is based on. It again leaves the market relying on audience viewing figures published by the TV broadcaster-controlled OzTAM, which is under increasing pressure from advertisers to deliver more multi-screen and cross-platform audience measurement.\nThe booming tech media platforms such as Google and Facebook are less co-operative and open. When asked for details on watch time in Australia for YouTube, Google's official line was a global statement: \"Everyday people watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube and generate billions of views.\"\nOzTAM CEO Doug Peiffer said last week at the ASTRA TV conference that online audience and streaming numbers sounded big but when the amount of viewing time was compared to broadcast content viewing, OzTAM's best estimate was that it was 5 to 10 per cent of broadcast.\nBut Ms Carnegiewas upbeat about YouTube's prospects on Friday.\n\"Even though our reach and scale is impressive one thing you can't see in those numbers is the influence that YouTube is having on popular culture,\" she said. \"A recent survey by Variety magazine showed that YouTube stars are now more popular than mainstream celebrities amongst US teenagers. There are now eight YouTube creators in the top 10, beating A-listers is like Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars.\"\nGoogle's industry leader, Bart Jenniches, would not detail 2016 revenue or advertising market share targets for YouTube other than a rise in available premium inventory on YouTube was linked with \"watch time\". \"Growth next year is partial to the growth of watch time and our content creators are a huge portion of that 60 per cent growth in watch time,\" Mr Jenniches said.\n\"Negotiations are ongoing. There are discussions with a variety of partners. I can't comment where the deals are at for next year but we do have quite a bit of interest. GroupM is going great with the exposure to 30-plus advertisers which have gone through Google Preferred. We have seen some great results. There are some brand lift survey results coming out I am very pleased with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:07:45.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
