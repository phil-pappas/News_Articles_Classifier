Human Rights Council criticised the government's use of cluster bombs, barrel bombs and ballistic missiles in a resolution rejected by Syria as selective and biased. \n\"Our study shows that civilians become the main target of weapons and bear a disproportionate share of the burden of bombings,\" said the authors of the Louvain report. \n\"If we are looking for root causes of the migrant and refugee crises in Europe today, this is surely a major contributor.\" \nMore than 4 million Syrians have fled the country because of the fighting, the vast majority to neighbouring Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. \n(Reporting By Joseph D'Urso, editing by Tim Pearce.; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) , that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
