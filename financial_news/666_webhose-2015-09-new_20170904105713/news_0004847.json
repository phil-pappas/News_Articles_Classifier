Above all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group.\" \nVW has set aside an initial £4.7bn to cover the fallout and \"win back the trust\" of customers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:38:42.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
