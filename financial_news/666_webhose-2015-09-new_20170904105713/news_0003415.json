On Monday, the share mostly shrugged off Volkswagen’s woes, as Ford’s stock gained 0.3% and GM shares tacked on 0.4%.\nA potential investigation into Volkswagen’s diesel technology could trigger “a wider and broader investigation in the industry, likely creating uncertainty for car makers and translating into potentially more stringent CO2 emission controls in the auto industry,” analyst Jose Asumendi at J.P. Morgan Cazenove wrote in a note to clients.\nFord, GM shares take a beating Volkswagen’s stock VOW3, -19.82% plunged 20% in Germany , the biggest one-day percentage decline in its public history, on the heels of a 19% tumble on Monday.\nDon’t miss: Opinion: Volkswagen scandal may put car maker’s survival on the line .\nAmong Volkswagen’s U.S.-based suppliers, BorgWarner Inc.’s stock BWA, -7.60% slid 8.2%, putting it on track to close at the lowest level since May 2, 2013. Tenneco Inc. shares TEN, -6.30% dropped 7.1%, and headed toward the lowest close since June 24, 2013.\nBorgWarner, Tenneco suffer collateral damage from Volkswagen’s emissions scandal “We see BorgWarner (BWA) and Tenneco (TEN) having the most exposure given their specific involvement with VW’s diesel engine production and emissions control technology,” said analyst Douglas Karson at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “At the moment, it is unclear if BWA or TEN played a direct role in the VW situation, but their exposure to the diesel engine systems is worth noting.”\nAmong other Volkswagen suppliers in the U.S., according to FactSet, shares of Perceptron Inc. PRCP, -6.63% shed 5.5%, Gentex Corp. GNTX, -2.76% gave up 3%, Delphi Automotive DLPH, -3.61% lost 4.2% and Harman International Industries HAR, -3.83% slid 4.2%.\nJ.P. Morgan’s Asumendi said he could see a case of suppliers benefiting from Volkswagen’s emissions scandal, as they supply the “badly needed products to make car makers reduce CO2 emissions and improving its pricing power.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T01:23:37.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
