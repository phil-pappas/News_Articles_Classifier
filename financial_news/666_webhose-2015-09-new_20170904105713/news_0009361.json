Interest-bearing assets like Treasurys have diminished the appeal of gold, which doesn’t bear any interest, while anticipation of a near-term rate increase has dulled expectations for gold.\nA rate increase would be a boon for the dollar but make dollar-denominated commodities like gold more expensive to buyers in other currencies.\n“The global decline of commodities and steady appreciation of the [U.S. dollar] continues to add pressure on this precious metal. If data from the United States this week is robust, then more pressure may be experienced for gold which may trigger a selloff to the next relevant support at $1,110 [an ounce],” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM in a Tuesday note.\nOn Friday, the contract shaved off $3.10 after the monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report offered a mixed picture of the health of the country’s labor market. The report showed just 173,000 jobs were added to the economy in August, but unemployment, at 5.1%, hit its lowest level since 2008 .\n“The major catalyst for a potential heavy selloff in gold continues revolve around whether the Federal Reserve begins to raise US interest rates this year,” Otunuga said.\nDemand from Asian buyers has helped support gold somewhat with recent data showing that China bought 16 tons of the yellow metal in August, after purchasing 19 tons in July.\nIn other metals, December silver SIZ5, +0.63% rose 19 cents, or 1.3%, to trade at $14.74 an ounce. High-grade December copper HGZ5, +4.46% was up 9 cents, or 3.7%, at $2.398.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.fxstreet.com/search/contributors/authors/author.aspx?id=2bd26e33-1087-4d3a-bf2d-76c51aa47bed"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:31:49.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
