The Nasdaq, off 6.9 percent for August, and the S&P 500, down 6.3 percent, both posted their worst months since May 2012.\nMSCI's all-country stock index lost 0.7 percent and was down 7 percent for the month, also the worst monthly drop since May 2012.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index closed down 0.2 percent and registered a monthly loss of 9 percent - its worst monthly performance since August 2011.\nThe dollar eased against the safe-haven yen and the low-yielding euro as investors sold equities and pared bets against currencies popularly used to fund risky carry trades.\nBut Fischer's comments limited the dollar's losses. The dollar shed 0.4 percent to 121.19 yen, while the euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.1236.\nOIL JUMPS\nU.S. crude oil prices have risen more than $10 a barrel in three days, erasing the month's declines.\nU.S. crude jumped $3.98, or 8.8 percent, to settle at $49.20 a barrel, taking three-day gains to 27.5 percent, the most over three days since August 1990. In dollar terms, it was the biggest three-day gain since February 2011.\nBrent October crude climbed 8.2 percent to settle at $54.15 a barrel.\nIn the U.S. bond market, 30-year Treasuries prices fell more than a full point in late trading, pushing the yield to a one-month high of 2.964 percent.\nGold steadied, with spot gold up 0.04 percent at $1,134 an ounce.
