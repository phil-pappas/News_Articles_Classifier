All the connections were disconnected and 10 suspects were arrested, but 340 people left their houses after they saw police conducting the operation,\" said Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Colonel Leonard Hlathi, on Thursday. \nHlathi added that approximately 80 tonnes of cables were confiscated during the raid. \nHe urged community members to stop making illegal connections. \"We call on the community to stop connecting electricity illegally as it poses danger to people's lives and adversely affects the economy,\" he said. \nEskom spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe, warned that illegal connections can often lead to electrocution and power outages. \n\"Where they are detected, we remove them because they do not only pose a revenue loss risk to Eskom, but they are also a safety hazard to the community living in that area. It also causes overloading of the network, which results in unplanned outages, which affects the smooth operating of the robots as well as life sustaining equipment at hospitals,\" Phasiwe said. \nThe suspects will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court on Friday to face various charges including malicious damage to property. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:39:16.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
