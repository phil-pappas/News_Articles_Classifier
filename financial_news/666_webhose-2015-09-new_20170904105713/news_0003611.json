The Elfenworks Foundation will present a total of $75,000 to these three social entrepreneurs who are writing new stories of hope and harnessing the power of technology to create change: Rose Broome, Co-founder and CEO, HandUp ; Eric Dawson, Co-founder and President, Peace First ; and Ted Gonder, Co-founder and CEO, Moneythink . This year features a special guest Master of Ceremonies, acclaimed actor Elijah Kelley. He is known for his work in The Butler, Red Tails, and Hairspray and will be starring in NBC's production of The Wiz Live!\nIn reflecting on the powerful example of the 2015 In Harmony with Hope honorees, Elfenworks founder and CEO, Dr. Lauren Speeth, reminds us, “In big and small ways, each of us can take scary elements of dissonance and despair and weave new stories, stories that are in harmony with hope. Like the inspiring visionaries we’re honoring this year, each of us can change the story.” Through sharing the honorees’ narratives of change, Elfenworks sends a message that each of us can make a valuable impact on today’s society.\nFor the fifth year in a row, Wells Fargo has committed to supporting the awards program with a generous $10,000 contribution. Beyond the financial award that is given to honorees, the event also provides an opportunity for an exciting exchange of ideas when past and current honorees meet and discuss a shared vision for a better America.\nThe In Harmony with Hope Award was created to accelerate and celebrate the success of social entrepreneurs who are working to bring compassionate vision into action. The list of alumni honorees includes visionaries like Rosalynn Carter and Dr. Paul Farmer. Over the past nine years, Elfenworks, through the In Harmony with Hope Award, has awarded $675,000 to 27 social entrepreneurs who are working to create sustainable change in America.\nEach changemaker expressed his/her gratitude for the In Harmony with Hope Award:\n“HandUp leverages technology and the power of human connection to help those struggling with homelessness to move out of poverty,” said Rose Broome, Co-founder and CEO of HandUp. “These human connections re-ignite hope in people who are often at the lowest points of their lives. The In Harmony with Hope Award exposes the transformational role technology can play in connecting our communities and filling resource gaps through the power of the crowd.”\nTed Gonder, Co-founder and CEO of Moneythink, stated: \"Moneythink believes in the power of human potential. Our volunteers work tirelessly to ensure low-income high school students graduate with the skills they need to navigate the financial challenges of adulthood. The In Harmony with Hope Award reflects our volunteers’ dedication, passion, and commitment to ensuring that all youth are able to achieve their full potential and we are honored to accept the award on their behalf.”\nEric Dawson, Co-founder and President of Peace First added: “I am tremendously honored to accept the In Harmony with Hope Award. For more than 20 years, Peace First has aimed to inspire a generation of youth peacemakers and instill a sense of courage, compassion, and collaboration in young people across the country. This award recognizes what we have achieved so far and the peacemaking movement that we continue to grow. We’re thrilled Elfenworks finds our work timely and essential.”\nTo RSVP to the 2015 In Harmony with Hope awards ceremony, visit http://www.IHH2015.eventbrite.com or call 650-347-9700 for information.\nAbout Elfenworks “In Harmony with Hope”: Elfenworks works for hope in America by fostering creative and technology solutions that advance change.
