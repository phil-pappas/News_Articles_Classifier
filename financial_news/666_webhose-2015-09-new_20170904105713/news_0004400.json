U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, however, was slightly lower again, shedding 2 cents to $45.92 a barrel and continuing Tuesday's slide. \nThe diverging Brent/WTI moves of the past days have pulled the Brent premium away from January lows, and is now back over $3.50 per barrel. \n\"WTI prices lagged as the end of the U.S. summer driving season signals lower demand,\" ANZ said on Wednesday. \nOverall, the bank said that \"commodity price volatility remains high with markets trying to establish a new base against the headwind of weaker seasonal demand.\" \nOn the supply side, recent speculation that some producers were willing to cooperate in cutting output in support of prices was dealt a blow by Russia and Mexico this week, who both said they would not cut. \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is producing close to record volumes to squeeze out competition, especially from U.S. shale producers, which have so far weathered the price plunges to keep pumping oil. \n(Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T06:33:06.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
