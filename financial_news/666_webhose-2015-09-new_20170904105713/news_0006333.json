NYT Driving the franchise train is Iger. He has broadened the company's already-strong suite of intellectual property impressively since taking the top job in 2005, buying Marvel in 2009 (one of the best buys in the industry in recent years in our view) and Lucasfilm (think Darth Vader & Co) in 2012. The Star Wars franchise is set to kick off in a big way this year with Episode VII: The Force Awakens coming to cinemas in December. Disney recently unveiled a massive campaign to promote merchandise linked to the Star Wars franchise.\nThe potential problem child is ESPN, which forms the core of the Media Networks segment (Cable Networks and Broadcasting) that has historically contributed over 50 per cent of operating income. Disney has pared back its percentage subscriber growth estimate for ESPN for the full year from high single digits to mid single digits.\nBut concern on Wall Street that the move by consumers away from cable television could kill this business looks to have been well overstated. Revenues and operating income at the Media Networks unit were up 9 per cent and 2 per cent respectively for the year to date. Approximately 96 per cent of all sports programming is watched live, according to comments from Iger. This is an extremely valuable statistic in today's rapidly changing advertising market and gives ESPN far more scope than most other content businesses to charge a premium for advertising.\nWalt Disney is currently trading at about 18 times September FY2016 earnings, and a modest premium to the broader market. We do not believe that this adequately reflects the consistent ability of Disney to leverage its top-notch content library now and in the future. The Force is indeed strong in this one!\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:59:14.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
