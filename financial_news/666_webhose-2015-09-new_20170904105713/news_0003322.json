Without long-term financing, households face great hurdles to raising income over their lives —for example by investing in housing or education—and may not benefit from higher long-term returns on their savings.' \nIt indicated while commercial banks remain the primary source of financing for firms and households around the world, capital markets have grown rapidly, especially in emerging market economies like China and India. \nFirms in developing countries saw a 15-fold increase in the amounts raised in equity, bond, and syndicated loan markets between 1991 and 2013. \nAlthough the majority of this finance originated in high-income countries, there are notable exceptions: more than 70 per cent of India's total syndicated loan market originates domestically. \n'Long-term finance facilitates investment in infrastructure, durable goods, and people's education and skills, and, as such, is the bedrock of sustained growth. Finance, however, needs good institutions and effective contract enforcement,' said Kaushik Basu, World Bank Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. 'Fortunately, a lot is happening to give us hope. Equity and bond markets, for instance, have grown from less than half the financial system in the 1980s to 53 per cent in China and 65 per cent in India, in 2005-10.\n'A new distribution system for government securities using mobile phones has broadened the financial access of retail investors in Kenya. By bringing a wealth of information and analysis to the table, this year's report greatly enhances our understanding of this critical sector.' \nLong term housing finance is arguably the most important ingredient towards home ownership, yet the disparity across countries is stark: an average of 21 per cent of individuals in high-income countries have an outstanding home loan, compared to a mere 2.4 per cent in lower-middle and low-income countries. India is a typical case, with only 2.3 percent of individuals having a home loan. \nFirms in developing countries also face substantial disparities. Loan durations to firms in low-income countries average 23.3 months, less than half of the average for firms in high-income countries at 58.7 months. Firms' loans in Sierra Leone and Liberia have particularly low durations, with averages of eight and 4.4 months. \n'The temptation to seek quick fixes is strong, but only a wholesale effort to reform the institutions that underpin the financial system will solve this problem,' said World Bank Director of Research Asli Demirguc-Kunt. \n'This report lays out a path that countries can follow to make available the kind of long-term finance that will support sustainable, equitable growth.' \nThe report highlights examples, as well as innovative approaches, that some countries have taken to win access to long-term financing: including too little credit information makes it difficult for lenders to assess risk reliably and pushes them towards shorter lending maturities. \nBulgaria and Nicaragua sharply increased average loan maturities after private credit bureaus were established. \nLimited protection of investor rights leads lenders to prefer short-term contracts to discipline borrowers by threat of termination. \nIndia introduced debt recovery tribunals to speed up debt recovery cases, and as a result, firms made significant movements away from short-term debt toward longer-term instruments. \nAnother approach is the weak corporate governance, which leads to a weak contractual environment. \nA study of more than 7,000 firms in 22 countries found that firms with strong corporate governance tend to use less short-term debt. \nGNA Other Stories Follow Us Undoubtedly war is an act of destruction at large & cannot be put on a certain allowance.
