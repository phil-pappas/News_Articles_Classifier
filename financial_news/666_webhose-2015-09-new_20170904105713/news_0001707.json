A federal appeals court affirmed Schreier's ruling in August, allowing attorneys to proceed with their plan to seek legal fees from the state. \nNewville said he felt the case was resolved for him following Schreier's ruling in January and the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in June that legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. \n\"This is just sort of background. What this case was really about was people's rights and treating people equally,\" he said. \nThe settlement provides about $182,000 to Madia Law, the Minneapolis firm for which Newville works, and about $59,000 to the National Center for Lesbian Rights, a national gay rights group who provided additional legal counsel in the case. \nUnder federal law, attorneys in federal civil rights cases can petition a court to award them legal fees if a court finds in their favor. \n\"The state has an obligation to defend the constitutionality of its laws, and this is a part of that process,\" said Tony Venhuizen, chief of staff for Gov. Dennis Daugaard .
