Photo: Supplied\nIn one of the biggest clearance sales of the year, property giant Charter Hall is aiming to raise as much as $700 million from a swag of office and industrial and business parks.\nAgents have been appointed to sell the properties as part of Charter Hall's ongoing process of refreshing its funds with new assets.\nCharter Hall has been on an acquisition path across its suite of managed funds in the past year, with about $250 million alone in industrial properties.\nOverall, its funds under management now sit at $14.5 billion across the office, retail, industrial/logistics, pubs and automotive sectors.\nAdvertisement Charter Hall joint managing director David Harrison said at the full year result in August that the group would continue to refine these fund portfolios through the pre-leasing of land banks, recycling non-core assets and acquisitions.\n\"We continue to improve the quality of these portfolios through a disciplined approach to asset selection, a preference for off-market transactions and an emphasis on quality tenants, long leases and prime estates and single tenant assets,\" Mr Harrison said.\nCharter Hall declined to comment directly on the latest portfolio sales.\nThe five office properties on the market are valued at a combined $265 million, are owned by the $2.2 billion Charter Hall Office Fund and will be sold through CBRE.\nThey include 9 Wentworth Street, known as Wentworth Plaza, in Parramatta, 266 King Street, Newcastle, as well as towers in Perth and Brisbane which will be sold with Savills and Colliers as co-agents respectively.\nCBRE's director for international investments Michael Andrews said demand was strong for assets that have long leases and government tenants.\n\"We anticipate good interest for these properties from overseas and domestic investors, due to the long weighted average lease and down the track they could have alternative uses,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\"The sale process is flexible between selling them as one portfolio or as individual properties.\"\nThe industrial portfolio is valued at about $435 million and will be sold through JLL and Colliers International.\nCharter Hall manages $2.5 billion of industrial assets through a range of Direct Industrial Funds and as part of the growth in its industrial platform has bought about $700 million in industrial assets since July 1 this year.\nThe Charter Hall industrial fund manager Paul Ford said recently the focus is on owning and managing a geographically diverse and high quality portfolio of industrial and logistics properties leased to high calibre tenants on long term leases.\nIncluded in the current sale will be assets across the country such as the distribution warehouse at Chullora in Sydney's south west.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:52:35.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
