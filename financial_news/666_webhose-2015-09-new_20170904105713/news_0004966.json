They are probably triggered by nervousness among those who are taking position (ahead of the Fed's policy announcement),\" Chotaro Morita, chief fixed income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said in report.\nIndeed, money market futures contracts for September <FF:> have hardly budged, still pricing in about a 30 percent chance of a rate increase this week.\nU.S. economic data published on Tuesday did little to either back, or douse, expectations of an imminent rate increase.\nU.S. retail sales for August was slightly below market expectations but, combined with upward revision for July, the figures painted a fairly healthy pace of consumer spending growth over the past two months.\nOn the other hand, manufacturing remained soft, smarting from the headwinds of a strong dollar, slack economies oversees and lower oil prices.\nIn the currency market, the dollar index extended its rebound from Monday's three-week low of 95.125 to stand at 95.587. But it is essentially staying in its well-worn range in the last few weeks.\nThe euro traded at $1.1273 while the dollar fetched 120.46 yen.\nIn contrast, emerging market currencies remained under pressure on worries about higher U.S. borrowing costs and slower growth in China, trading near multi-year lows against the dollar.\nOil prices held firm for now after 3 percent gains made on Tuesday driven by rallying stocks, higher gasoline prices and on a report showing strong stockpile draw.\nIn early Asian trade, U.S. crude futures rose 0.8 percent to $44.95 per barrel while Brent futures rose 0.3 percent to $47.91.
