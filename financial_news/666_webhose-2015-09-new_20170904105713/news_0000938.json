It did not seem to me that they were just tutored. They were able to express the feelings of the words,” Prime Minister said in his address.\n“In Ireland this can be done, but had it happened in India then questions would have been raised on secularism,” he added.\nDuring his visit, he sought Ireland’s support for reforms in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and also brought up the issue of India’s membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) during his discussions with his Irish counterpart.\nPrime Minister Modi later left for New York for the second leg of his two-nation tour.\n 24, 2015 1:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:49:35.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
