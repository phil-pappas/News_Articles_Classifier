By Shilpy Sinha & MC Govardhana Rangan , ET Bureau | 2 Sep, 2015, 04.19AM IST ET SPECIAL: Love visual aspect of news? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! For Shikha Sharma , 2009-10 were the best of times, and the worst of times. That year, she was chosen to occupy the corner office of a bank that was her rival for more than a decade, trumping competition. And a year later, it was a deal conceived and delivered to make her adopted bank the one to reckon with in capital markets, which drew criticism from shareholders and industry, and some amount of regulatory glare as well. Four years later in a transformed economic and market scenario, the gamble Sharma took to buy Enam Securities seems to be paying off. Axis Capital, which did not figure even among the top 10 in the equities market ranking before the buy, topped the table for the previous fiscal and is on course to be among the top this year. Some top names such as drug research firm Syngene and logistics firm Navkar that raised equity funds relied on Axis Capital, and some like Coffee Day Enterprise and RBL Bank, which have planned a listing, have hired Axis. \"Enam has brought in the capability of equity broking business and the know-how of the IPO markets,\" says Saday Sinha, a banking analyst at Kotak Securities. \"From a bank's perspective, it is getting larger share of the clients' wallet.\" But the road to the top has been bumpy for an outsider at Axis as she was seen as attempting to build a financial conglomerate similar to that of her alma mater ICICI Bank , India's first financial supermarket built on the Citigroup model. She did justice to her learning under KV Kamath, the man who transformed Indian banking she dreamt big and played a highstakes game by buying the home grown, vegetarian Enam, which did not transact in tobacco, alcohol and leather-related businesses. \"The question was, 'Did you over pay?' The value of the transaction was very small, about 2% dilution,'' says Sharma. \"Since it was the first of its kind, it got all the attention.'' In 2010, Sharma agreed to buy Enam Securities for Rs 2,067 crore in an all-stock deal. It was an audacious move for a banker where stock markets and mergers and acquisitions were anathema to the regulator even before the Lehman Brothers collapse led to unravelling. That reflected in the proposal lying in cold storage at the regulator and it took 17 months for clearance after valuation was scaled down to Rs 1,396 crore, from Rs 2,070 crore. Soon after, the market went into a funk and the equity business dried up, leading to more criticism of the transaction. It looked like doomsday for equities. Equity fund raising fell to Rs 29,381 crore in fiscal 2014, from Rs 46,073 crore a year ago, data from Prime Database shows. There was speculation that investment banking was after all a people's business and people would leave in hordes, as those who grew up in the family business environment of Enam run by Vallabh Bhanshali and Nemish Shah, would find it uncomfortable in an institutional set-up. But almost all the 275 who came from Enam are still at Axis. \"Why has nobody left? People leave only when there is a change in the culture and DNA of the organisation,\" says Dharmesh Mehta, managing director at Axis Capital. \"That has not changed a bit. We still have the same entrepreneur work style and environment which motivates everyone to take ownership and perform, hence there has been no need to look elsewhere,\" he said. The fear of an exodus may have been overblown, but has Axis derived the value of its acquisition? It may be a long time in terms of pure numbers, but the integration and cross-selling is beginning to pay, say Axis officials. Axis, which has been a bond power house for more than a decade, hardly had any presence in equities. But the proposition to raise equity funds for promoters is bringing in more business such as acquisition funding , managing the escrow account and even the trustee business which can't be quantified in numbers under Axis Capital. \"You get his (promoter's) mind share, he shares his priority, strategy,'' says Srinivasan Varadarajan, executive director at Axis. \"Then it becomes an important tool to bundle other banking products together. If you do a good transaction in equities with a company, you can rest assured that you get all the other franchises.\" Some of the businesses Axis Bank did not have before Enam, and where it is leveraging the financial supermarket structure include multiplex operator PVR, publisher Amar Ujala, Coffee Day Enterprises and Lavasa. Axis Capital on its own had its revenue jump to Rs 288.7 crore in fiscal 2015, a minuscule portion of its Rs 43,844 crore total income. Net profit soared to Rs 107.9 crore, an insignificant part of Rs 7,358 crore for the bank. But just looking at the numbers may be deceptive given the additional benefits it brings. \"Even if you cut a Rs 5,000-crore cheque as loans, the promoter may say there were five banks and you were just part of it,\" says Varadarajan. \"But if you actually do a Rs 500-crore equity transaction, with a good price, executed well, after which the stock does well, he is very happy. It means more than the Rs 5,000 crore.'' While there may be benefits in the form of cross-selling, could Axis have built a business instead of paying such a high price? Sharma, who was part of a team that built a startup called ICICI Securities in the 1990s in joint venture with JP Morgan , maintains it is not possible. \"It takes 10 years or even more to build a business like that,\" she says. \"I have seen in my previous roles what it takes and how long it takes to build an ECM franchise.'' HDFC Bank , the most valuable Indian bank run by Aditya Puri since its inception , is a study in contrast. The bank, which set out to build an investment banking business in equities, does not figure anywhere in the top of a league table. ICICI Securities was ranked fourth last fiscal, data from Prime Database shows. Axis Bank may be on top of the charts and made strides when it comes to the equity capital market and acquisitions. But in a people's business such as this, the exit of key staff could bring it down. \"When I made the transition to Axis there was all this concern over people,'' Sharma told ET in an interview in 2010. \"But ultimately if you treat people with respect, if you value what they bring to the table and they see growth opportunities and a stronger platform, I think they will see a reason to stay. You can try and bind people with legal contracts or financial incentives. But the best bind is if they see value in working there and growth and challenges in the role.\" That may be true. But the real test of Sharma's theory would be when the economic engine revs up, and the equity markets enter a multiyear bull market.
