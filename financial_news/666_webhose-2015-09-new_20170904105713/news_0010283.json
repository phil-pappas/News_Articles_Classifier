This more than offset slightly weaker gains in civil engineering. \nThe Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 57.3 in August, from 57.1 in July. This was well above the 50 level that divides growth from contraction, but slightly under economists' estimates of 57.5. \nThe construction sector has enjoyed uninterrupted growth since May 2013, representing the longest period of sustained expansion for seven-and-a-half years, according to Markit. \nThis has also led to a hiring boom as August marked the 27th consecutive month of jobs growth in the industry, with staff levels rising at a \"robust rate\". \n\"There is an increasingly positive feeling in the sector as firms continue to get a clearer handle on inflationary pressures, a tight labour market and growing demand. That sentiment is reflected in today’s data,\" said Stefan Friedhoff, managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \nOptimism about future growth also remained high. Markit's survey showed 53pc of businesses expected activity to rise over the next 12 months, compared with just 5pc forecasting a reduction. \n\"The fundamentals in the industry are sound and this is fuelling a bullishness about potential output for the remainder of the year,\" said Mr Friedhoff. \nA separate survey of the manufacturing sector on Tuesday showed activity slowed in August, as steady domestic demand was more than offset by weaker export growth . \nThe Markit survey has painted a more bullish picture this year than official figures, which showed construction rose by just 0.2pc in the second quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:17:42.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
