The transaction is expected to close effective October 1, 2015. \nThe business to be acquired includes two terminals that support Valero's Corpus Christi East and West refineries. The assets consist of 134 tanks with 10.1 million barrels of storage capacity for crude oil, intermediates, and refined petroleum products.\nThe Partnership expects to finance the acquisition with $395 million in borrowings under a subordinated loan agreement with Valero, as well as the issuance of additional common units and general partner units to Valero subsidiaries, valued collectively at approximately $70 million. The newly issued units will be allocated in a proportion allowing the general partner to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. \nUpon closing, the Partnership plans to enter into a 10-year terminaling agreement with a subsidiary of Valero. The business to be acquired is expected to contribute approximately $50 million of EBITDA in its first full year of operation. \n\"With transactions totaling $1.14 billion, we've exceeded our $1 billion target for acquisitions in 2015,\" said Joe Gorder, Chief Executive Officer of VLP's general partner. \"We're on course to deliver year-over-year distribution growth in excess of 25 percent.\" \nThe terms of the transaction were approved, subject to the execution of definitive documentation, by the board of directors of the general partner, following the approval and recommendation of the board's conflicts committee. The conflicts committee is composed of independent directors and was advised by Evercore Group L.L.C., its financial advisor, and Akin Gump Straus Hauer & Feld LLP, its legal counsel. \nAbout Valero Energy Partners LP \nValero Energy Partners LP is a fee-based master limited partnership formed by Valero Energy Corporation to own, operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined products pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets.

These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"will\" or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership's control and are difficult to predict. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in the Partnership's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, available on the Partnership's website at www.valeroenergypartners.com . These risks could cause the Partnership's actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information \nWe define EBITDA as net income before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation expense. EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that is not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA is net income. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\n\nVALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP \nRECONCILIATION OF FORECASTED NET INCOME UNDER GAAP TO EBITDA \n(Unaudited, in Thousands) \n\n\n\nFull Year Beginning\nOctober 1, 2015 \nCorpus Christi\nTerminal Services\nBusiness \nForecasted net income \n$ 29,400 \nAdd: Forecasted depreciation expense \n6,400 \nAdd: Forecasted interest expense \n13,700 \nAdd: Forecasted income tax expense \n100 \nForecasted EBITDA \n$ 49,600 \n\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131202/DA25769LOGO \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valero-energy-partners-lp-announces-acquisition-of-corpus-christi-terminal-services-business-for-465-million-300148099.html \nBasic Materials Industry Valero Energy the Partnership", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:07:57.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
