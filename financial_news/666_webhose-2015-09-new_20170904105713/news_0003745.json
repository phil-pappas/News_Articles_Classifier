That’s the typical premium to secure an address in a “preferred catchment area” – and one in four parents of school-age children have coughed up, according to a recent survey of 4,750 adults by Santander .\nLast week the charity New Schools Network said that parents often take “extreme measures” to get their children into a good school.\n“One in 10 families still do not get their first choice of school,” says Nick Timothy, director of the charity. “Some do not get any of their top three choices, and last year more than 52,500 children were forced into schools their parents did not want them to attend.”\nThe Observer spoke to four sets of parents across the country to find out what motivates so many families to move house to secure a school place – and how much it really costs them.\nCardiff Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘To move less than two miles up the road is going to cost us anywhere from an additional £60,000 to £150,000,’ says Chris Baldwin.\nThe Baldwin family – Chris, 44, his wife and their two sons Zach, 10, and Noah, seven – live in Pontprennau, Cardiff. Their closest state school is one of the highest ranked secondary schools in Wales, but they live 0.25 miles outside the catchment area.\n“Our only other option is a rougher school – it’s had some bad press for kids filming fights on mobiles and bullying,” Baldwin says. “Zach was premature and wears thick glasses and a hearing aid. I don’t want anyone picking on him. I know what it’s like because I went to a very bad school where anyone intelligent was ostracised and bullied. I don’t want my sons to be academically disadvantaged the way I was. I want them to have the best education possible.”\nThe family recently paid off their mortgage and renovated their house. “We’re moving purely to be in the catchment area. Our house has been valued at £300,000 – to move less than two miles up the road is going to cost us anywhere from an additional £60,000 to £150,000, which means another 25-year mortgage. But if we can buy wisely, it could be a good investment.”\nWhen he told friends and family what he was doing, “nobody batted an eyelid. I don’t really care what other people think. I’m doing it for what I think are the right reasons”.\nBristol Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Southwell family, who say their move from London to Bristol was ‘worth every penny’.\nPatrick Southwell, 34, and his wife Rhiannon, 36, have two sons: Macsen, five, and Dylan, three. In August 2013, the couple spent more than £50,000 moving from Queen’s Park, in north-west London, to Bishopston in Bristol, so their children could attend an “outstanding” primary school.\n“The main reason we moved was because our nearby schools weren’t great – all the Ofsted results were ‘satisfactory’ or ‘good’,” Patrick says. “Plus, any child who ends up in an urban London state school faces challenges. For example, because there is very high population density, the schools are large but there is less space to play.”\nHe was equally concerned that local deprivation was affecting attainment levels, and other parents might opt for private education. “You are left with the state schools picking up the more challenging pupils who don’t come from as privileged backgrounds. The class then becomes highly segregated.”\nHe couldn’t afford private school fees, and on principle wanted his children to attend a state school.\nTo afford to live in their new home Southwell changed jobs, spent £23,000 on estate agency fees, stamp duty and other moving costs, and increased his mortgage by £33,000.\n“It was worth every penny. We’ve got our dream house, which is already worth £117,000 more than we paid for it, and have never been happier. Many of our neighbours previously lived in London, and I would urge anyone thinking of moving to do it. By putting our children’s education first, we have landed on our feet.”\nHertfordshire Facebook Twitter Pinterest Claire and Richard are buying a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, which is a 40-second walk from an ‘outstanding’ school.\nClaire, 34, and her husband Richard, 35, who have withheld their surnames, have two sons: Jake, three, and Aiden, one. In December 2014, the couple sold their flat in Mill Hill, Barnet, for £310,000, and are about to exchange on a £450,000 three-bed semi in their dream school catchment area of Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n“We’ve been living with my parents in Edgware while looking for a house to buy. We knew Bushey was very desirable because of the schools, so we wanted to make sure we were chain-free and have been saving hard. We were hoping that would put us in a stronger position, but it’s crazy how quickly house prices have shot up in the past few months. The house we are buying is a 40-second walk from an ‘outstanding’ school and we’re paying about 15%-20% more for it than similar properties nearby.”\nClaire had researched the catchment area before looking at the house, using Rightmove’s new “ school checker ” tool. “I’m compromising on the house – it’s not a house I’m in love with – because I’ve got to give my children the best possible chance in life, and that means a school that will nurture their creative and academic abilities. Also, we are Jewish and I wanted a school where there was a mix of Jewish kids and other faiths. Some state schools in Bushey have up to 40% Jewish kids.”\nThe couple increased their mortgage term from 20 to 35 years in order to borrow an extra £110,000, and will pay around £15,000 in stamp duty and fees. “Yes, we will work for longer and we will definitely be stretched financially. But we’ll have a better quality of life. This is about our children’s future.”\nFalkirk Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gayle and Alan Paris borrowed an extra £80,000, then spread their mortgage over 30 years, to move to a village with a suitable school for their daughter Abby. Photograph: Picturesque, by Mr & Mrs. M\nIn December 2013, the Paris family – Gayle and her husband Alan, both 41, and their daughter Abby, six, who has cerebral palsy – moved from Falkirk to a nearby village.\n“The reason we moved was because the schools in our catchment area weren’t accessible enough,” Gayle says. “Abby’s disability is purely physical – she uses a wheelchair and a walking frame – and although our local schools had ramps and lifts, she would have been chaperoned everywhere. One had 14 doors between the entrance and her classroom. The other would have taken her 10 minutes to get to and from the playground – for a 15-minute playbreak. We wanted her to take part in school the same as her peers. Instead, she would have been singled out, unnecessarily dependent on adults and isolated from her friends.”\nThe family found a newly built school in nearby Maddiston, where Abby could walk around by herself and wouldn’t need an adult with her all the time. “It was rated a ‘very good’ school but that was irrelevant to me. We could always plug any gap in her education, but not a lack of independence or friendships with her peers.”\nHowever, the council said that since Abby was not living in the catchment area she was “unlikely” to get in. “I had sleepless nights trying to work out how we could afford to move there. In the end, my husband got a better-paid job and we borrowed an extra £80,000, then spread our mortgage over 30 years.”\nWas it worth it? “Absolutely. Abby walks to the playground by herself and has 90 minutes of playtime every week, just like her friends. Her confidence has improved dramatically. But after we moved, our occupational therapist said Abby probably would have got in anyway.”", "external_links":
