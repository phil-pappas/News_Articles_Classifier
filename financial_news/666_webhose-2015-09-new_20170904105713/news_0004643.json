But some board members, including Kiuchi, share doubts held by private analysts on whether the ambitious target can be met so soon and with monetary stimulus alone.\nKiuchi has been the lone board member to advocate tapering the BOJ's massive asset purchases on concern the cost of the programme, such as drying up bond market liquidity, was already exceeding the benefits.
