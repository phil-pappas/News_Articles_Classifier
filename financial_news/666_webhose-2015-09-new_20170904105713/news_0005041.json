The yields generated on those leasehold sales were about 5.1 per cent.\nIn May, JLL director in charge, Parramatta, John Macreecompleted the sale and leaseback of 10 Woolworths petrol sites for a combined $15.3 million. The newly built petrol stations in NSW and Queensland were sold with long-term ground leases to Woolworths Petrol.\n\"The interest in these assets clearly demonstrates the underlying demand for well-positioned investment opportunities with a steady income stream,\" Mr Bui said.\n\"We have sold several service stations this year and we've experienced strong demand from a range of investors who see such assets as strong, long-term investment opportunities as a result of good capital growth and steady returns.\"\nMr Bui said the Colliers International spring auction attracted record crowds as buyers and spectators overflowed from the auction rooms.\nMatthew Meynell, head of investment sales, Australia, at Colliers International, said the attendance at the quarterly auction in Sydney was a clear indication of the continuing strength of the commercial property market.\n\"The fluctuating equities markets and weakening Australian dollar are continuing to drive Australian investors to the property market, both residential and commercial,\" Mr Meynell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:22:17.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
