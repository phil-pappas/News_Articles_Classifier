Some $42 billion in August benefit payments were made in July because Aug. 1 was a Saturday. \nThrough the first 11 months of this budget year, the deficit is running 10 percent below last year. The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting that this year's deficit will drop to $426 billion, down 11.8 percent from last year's deficit, as a stronger economy brings in more tax revenue. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:08:59.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
