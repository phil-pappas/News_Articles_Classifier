Often, though, it is not. \nThe subtle ways in which individual investors become drawn into crowd behaviour is a much studied phenomenon, covered brilliantly, for example, in the book Devil Take the Hindmost: a History of Financial Speculation by Edward Chancellor. \nWhether investors chat in 18th-century coffee houses or on 21st-century internet forums, the forces at work are the same: participants become gripped by a collective spirit which sucks in arguments supporting their position, while resisting all evidence to the contrary. \n“The intellectual inferiority of the crowd is a sign that people are filtering and manipulating information to make it accord with their existing beliefs.” \nThat’s a description of the euphoric phase when a bubble is inflating, but something similar happens when panic takes hold and investors flee, giving rise to the sentiment encapsulated in the book’s title. \nIt’s a disturbing observation, casting doubt over everything we read and hear from what are invariably presented as authoritative sources. \nBut it does underline the importance of keeping an eye on what other investors the “crowd” are doing with their money. \nThis is why we try to question regularly in our coverage some of the big investment fashions of the day. Several weeks ago we reported on the astonishing sums of money flowing into biotech funds : these focused portfolios are currently the most popular choices for savers’ Isa and pension investments. We’d suggest their recent performance isn’t sustainable. There are also questions about how effectively the portfolio managers can deploy such large inflows. \n• Telegraph Investor: Latest market data \nWe also try to pin our investment coverage to a range of empirical measures of value, so that there are some facts to cling to in what otherwise can seem a sea of vague recommendations and sentiment. \nSo where do you find out what other investors are up to? \nSeveral big brokers publish lists of shares most viewed, bought or sold on their websites. More revealing, at least one of the major brokers, Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) Stockbrokers, also publishes on its website lists of funds that have been most popular in the previous few months. \nTotal (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) fund sale information, by sector, is collated by the Investment Association. Among its latest data, for instance, is the fact that private investors continue to pour money into commercial property funds which buy offices, shops and warehouses to let. \nThis newish and peripheral sector has become so popular that over the past year the sums invested were almost half the total sums invested in funds which bought shares. Unsurprisingly, the flows of savers’ cash come after periods of very strong returns. \nIn early 2014 we wrote here that there was still upside in these funds. Our predicted returns of around 10pc during that year came to pass, and then some. \nAs a result, the sector today has lost much of its shine yet continues to attract vast sums. Back in early 2014 we highlighted one of the sector’s best-known portfolios, the SWIP Property Trust (now Aberdeen Property Trust), then £2.6bn in size and yielding 3.5pc. \nToday it has swollen to £3.6bn, and its yield has shrunk to 2pc. Not, I’d argue, the moment to follow a crowd. \n• Sign up for our weekly email of investing news and ideas by entering your email at telegraph.co.uk/invest-newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:14:53.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
