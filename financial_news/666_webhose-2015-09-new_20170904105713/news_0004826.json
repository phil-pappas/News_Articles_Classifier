The cut brought down repo rate to 6.75 per cent, the lowest in four-and-half-years.\nAt the press conference called to announce the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy, he was asked if he was being Santa Claus in giving more than expected or should his statement be read as hawkish.\n“I don’t know what you want to call me… Santa Claus… you want to call me hawk, I don’t know. I don’t go by this. My name is Raghuram Rajan and I do what I do,” he said.\nAsked why RBI cut interest rate by 0.50 per cent, RBI Governor said: “We want to make sure that word sustainable and growth go together. Both are are important. And that’s why we used what room we had. But I don’t think we were excessively aggressive. We were not throwing out Diwali bonus.”\nRajan said the best protection against financial market turmoil and surviving turmoil is good policy.\n 29, 2015 1:34 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:19:15.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
