People didn't have iPhones.\"\nAdvertisement Hot political issue Rising income inequality has become a heated political topic in the US. Hedge fund managers are the target of Democrats and Republicans seeking the 2016 presidential nomination, and some Republicans in Congress have expressed openness to the idea of raising the tax rate on carried interest. Regulators have also passed new rules making it easier for shareholders to see the gap between what companies pay their leaders and the rest of their workforce.\nDimon -- whose net worth was estimated at about $US1.1 billion early this year -- and his criticism of regulators and adversaries has made him a lightning rod for those decrying income inequality and the existence of too-big-to-fail banks. But he seems unfazed by the noise.\n\"It is true that income inequality has kind of gotten worse,\" Dimon said, noting that he does want things to get better for low- and middle-class households.\nStill, \"you can take the compensation of every CEO in America and make it zero and it wouldn't put a dent into it. What really matters is growth.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:37:33.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
