If you see an ‘Enable Facebook dislike button’ or ‘Install the Facebook Dislike button’ on your homepage, do not install it! With Facebook getting ready to launch the actual Facebook Dislike button, Scambook warns the public to watch out for cyber criminals looking to infect your computer and steal your personal information. \nAccording to Scambook and the victims who have been recently scammed, users of Facebook are asked to enable the Dislike button; but when the user does this, they are actually exposing their computer to problem JavaScript and other threats. Unfortunately, if you click on this link then all your personal information and contacts could become infected. If you use Facebook regularly be sure to warn your friends and family about this scam. Be sure to share this article and be on the lookout. \nAlthough this scheme has been around for a while, another variation of this scam recently reported on Scambook is the \"download dislike button now\" option. When users click on this option, the victim will get an email or message saying 'Now you too can download the Dislike button yourself'. Unfortunately, if you fall for this trick, cyber criminals will be able to infect your computer with malicious malware which puts you at risk for identity theft . \nWhile Facebook is working to add this option to your profile, it is going to be automatic, so you will not need to install it or download it. According to the recent Facebook Dislike button announcement the actual plan won't unfold until it has been tested thoroughly. For more information on this scam visit Scambook \nUltimately, in order to stay safe from identity theft, you need to be careful of every link you click. You should also be wary of who sends you emails because if you don't know the sender then you are at risk for identity theft. If you are victim of identity theft or just want to learn more and you live in Santa Ana or elsewhere, for free help and resources, visit the Identity Theft Resource Center or call 1-888-400-5530.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T03:16:16.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
