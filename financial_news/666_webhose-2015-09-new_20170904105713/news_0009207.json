My reasonably priced accountant is quite expensive now. The first return and audit was about $3000, which seems a bit steep. Do you agree?\nAnswer: Price is what you pay; value is what you get. The problem is that, despite the fact trustees are responsible for the compliance, operation and administration of an SMSF (with the help of their accountant), most do not have a firm understanding of what is required and why. Without a good understanding of the Australian Taxation Office requirements, it is impossible to judge adequately the value received. The service consequently becomes a commodity and your only way of valuing and comparing the different services offered by SMSF administration companies and accountants is by price.\nAt an SMSF trustee presentation I did two weeks ago, I asked the audience of about 100 people who had actually read their trust deed. Only about 10 per cent raised their hands, which surprised me at an event designed for more educated trustees.\nSo let me give you anecdotal evidence of some basic holes in accounting and administration services that my firm sees every week when taking over a new account.\nIf your tax returns are late, you have a lazy accountant. If your trust deed hasn't been updated in the past five years, you might have an issue. It should make reference to the types of pensions available, including transition to retirement.\nDoes your accountant keep track of your contributions or pension payments each year before the end of the financial year to give you time to rectify mistakes? Are your binding death nominations up to date? They need to be done every three years, unless you have a perpetual one, and you will have a perpetual binding death nomination only if you have updated your trust deed recently.\nYour accountant should also outsource the audit as best practice, rather than using an internal one.\n Finally, and importantly, you should have a written investment strategy that clearly makes reference to the use of insurance for trustees. You don't have to have insurance but it must include a statement about the use of insurance and choice or need to have or not to have it. The investment strategy should be specific and relevant to the risk profile of members.\nIn truth I rarely, if ever, see this from other accountants.\nSo, if you are getting all that plus tax returns, minutes and accurate member statements, you're on the money at about $3000. If you're not, then shop around for someone who is thorough, professional and does more than 50 SMSF returns, so you know they are a specialist.\nMy firm charges about $2750 plus $385 for the audit and a little less for financial planning clients, so we are about the same level as your accountant. It's best to chat to your accountant to assess what he does before you start to shop around.\nThe average accountant does five SMSF returns and they often do them poorly and expensively.\nQuestion: Can you please specify the advantages of both shares and property within a self-managed super fund.\nAnswer: That's a great question and an age-old debate. Let me be clear, shares and property both make good investments. The annual Russell Investment Report says they both perform at about 8 per cent to 9 per cent annually over the long term, so there's no performance argument – it's a moot point. However, both have different attributes that can be exploited to maximise the gains – for example, the use of leverage through borrowing money.\nProperty prices can be negotiated, undercapitalised properties can be renovated for profit and property prices appear less volatile because they are less liquid. It takes months to market, sell and settle a property purchase in Australia.\nShares are liquid, dynamic and volatile, and some investors simply gamble their way into the sharemarket with small amounts of money and lose interest when the gamble doesn't pay off. A portfolio of 15 to 25 stocks of good-quality top 20 or top 50 shares paying tax-effective dividends can be used to fund retirement, with some income returns four times higher than term deposit rates. Compared with after-cost returns on property rentals, shares can provide far better income, as long as that income is sustainable and, ideally, increasing.\nThe trick lies in finding the right portfolio allocation.\nProperty rental returns are typically low because of land tax, strata fees for units, agents' fees, utilities and rates, maintenance and tenancy vacancies. Landlords often hold on to good tenants who are reliable rather than regularly reviewing their rentals upwards, and these generous souls trade income for reliability. You should aim for both, especially in times of record low vacancy rates.\nI often suggest property is a good wealth-creation tool, while shares and cash create a reliable retirement income. The lack of solid cash flow from property is often an issue for retirees but the ability to borrow – to buy good properties in good areas – is a great attraction.\nI like both investments and, if you can afford it, buy both and diversify extensively.\nIf you're unsure, sit down with a financial adviser who is not associated with the banks or a large financial institution in an attempt to get unbiased advice. Make sure you update your investment strategy regularly and make it specific and relevant to the members of the SMSF, as suggested in the first question.\nSam Henderson is a financial planner and chief executive of Henderson Maxwell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:06:08.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
