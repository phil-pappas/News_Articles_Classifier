It is believed to be worth about $5 billion.\nGroups such as the Australian Council of Social Service have called for an overhaul of trust law as part of the government's tax review.\nDealing with loopholes They say tax loopholes exploited by the rich should be dealt with before an increase in the goods and services tax, which would hurt poor families the most.\nDale Boccabella, an associate professor of tax law at the University of NSW, estimates lost revenue associated with the use of family trusts easily exceeds $1 billion a year.\nHe argues the tax treatment of discretionary trusts departs from that of other entities and other taxpayers.\nFor example, income generated by a family trust can be apportioned to members of the trust who fall into lower income brackets, thus minimising tax payable. While such activity is not illegal, it does not pass the \"smell test\", Associate Professor Boccabella writes in an article for The Conversation .\nFor breaches of the law, the Australian Taxation Office has a special \"trusts taskforce\".\nAs at January 31, 2015, which are the latest figures available, the taskforce had 21 audits and 397 reviews.\n\"Seven cases involving serious exploitation of trusts have been escalated for possible law enforcement action and two taxpayers are currently before the courts on serious criminal charges in relation to Trust Taskforce related matters,\" the ATO website says.\nCapital gains ACOSS has recommended that from July next year, tax-preferred income of private discretionary trusts should be taxed as capital gains in the hands of beneficiaries.\nThere should also be tighter rules to prevent tax avoidance on income, including capital gains, that is not distributed to beneficiaries each year. This would save $1 billion in 2016-17, ACOSS says.\nIn its wide-ranging submission to the government's tax review, KPMG says if death was to be considered a realisation event for assets held by an individual, there would have to be some exceptions.\nThese should include where an asset is the family home, farm or small business.\nA new type of small business structure is proposed to replicate some of the positive features of the trust model for succession planning.\n\"It is important to recognise that this proposal is not the instigation of a death duty,\" the submission says.\n\"It is merely a partial withdrawal of a rollover currently embedded within our system with the denial of the CGT discount to discretionary trusts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:00:30.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
