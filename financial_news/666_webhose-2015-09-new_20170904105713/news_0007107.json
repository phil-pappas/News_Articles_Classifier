Investment-grade corporate bond issuance rose last week after having dropped in the previous week. The number of issuers rose to 26 from 12 in the previous week.\n\nLast week, Treasury yields rose nearly across the yield curve. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds, which tend to follow cues from Treasuries, also rose for the week ending September 25.\nA rise in yield leads to a fall in returns of mutual funds such as the MFS Total Return Bond A (MRBFX).\nMajor issuers UBS Group Funding (Jersey) Ltd (UBS), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), Sysco Corporation (SYY), Citigroup (C), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Svenska Handelsbanken AB were among the biggest issuers of investment-grade bonds in the week ending September 25.\nIssuance by quality and maturity Fixed-rate issues made up 90.6% of the total issuance for the week. Floating-rate issues worth $3.05 billion were raised last week.\nIn terms of credit rating, A rated issuers were the most prolific. They made up 43.9%, or $14.2 billion, of total issuance. They were followed by BBB rated issuers, which formed 37.7% of the week’s issuance. AAA rated papers, which had not seen any issuance for the previous two weeks, constituted 7.0% of the total issuance.\nIn terms of maturity, the largest chunk of issuance, making up 51.2% of all issues, was in the ten-year maturity category. It followed by the five-year maturity category, which commanded 27.4% of the total issuance. The three- and seven-year maturity categories did not see any issuance.\nLong-term maturity categories such as 30-year, >30-year, and perpetuals, made up 6.8%, 3.1%, and 3.9%, respectively, of the total issuance last week. However, these categories had not seen any issuance in the previous week.\nIn the next part of the series, we’ll highlight details of the major deals—including pricing, credit rating, and yields.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Investment-Grade Bond Yields Rise after Fed Comment on Rate Hike Part 2 - Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Yields Rise as September Ends Part 4 - UBS Group Funding Issues $4.3 Billion Worth of High-Grade Bonds Bonds corporate bonds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:09:41.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
