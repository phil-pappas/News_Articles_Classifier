The currency has dropped more than 2 U.S. cents since the last meeting\n“We think the hurdle for rate cuts is still a high one,” Alex Joiner, chief economist for Australia at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said before the release. On the currency, “the RBA has softened its language in this space,” no longer referring to further depreciation as likely or necessary, he said.\nAustralia has so far had little success in stimulating industries with rate cuts as a decade-long mining investment boom unwinds. Businesses plan to cut investment by 23 percent this fiscal year as firms decide they can meet demand from heavily indebted households with existing capacity.\nOne area where cheap borrowing costs have worked is the property market: prices in Sydney have soared and Stevens has described parts of the market as “crazy.”\nTraders are pricing in a 50-50 chance of another rate cut by November as Australia, the developed world’s most China-dependent economy, struggles to cope with slumping prices for key resource exports.\nChina devalued its currency Aug. 11, and a day later reported industrial production, investment and retail data that trailed analysts’ estimates. After China’s stock market recorded the steepest falls since 1996, policy makers Aug. 25 cut benchmark lending and saving rates for the fifth time since November 2014 and lowered banks’ required reserve ratio by half a percentage point.\nYet Australia’s labor market has remained relatively resilient, aided by weaker wages growth, with unemployment at 6.3 percent in July as more people entered the workforce.\nSimilar to the U.S., debate is intensifying Down Under on whether potential growth is lower than earlier thought, which would help explain the stabilizing labor market. A reduced speed limit from the RBA would ease pressure to cut rates. Economists predicted Australia’s economy expanded 2.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier ahead of data due out Wednesday.\n“Growth rates have mostly started with a ‘2’ for a while now – despite the lowest interest rates in our lifetimes,” Stevens said in remarks last week. “It may be about changing demographics. It may be that potential growth is a bit lower than we used to think -- though I don’t think we can know whether that is so at present.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:51:13.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
