The Aussie's reaction seems a bit excessive but maybe it is already trying to price in a gloomy day for emerging markets,\" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.\nOther major currencies were little changed, with the dollar losing a bit of steam as rally in global equity prices faded late on Wednesday.\nThe dollar index stood at 95.918 , little changed from late U.S. levels on Wednesday.\nUncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates at its policy meeting on Sept 16-17 and concerns about China are likely to keep many investors on their toes.\nData on Wednesday showed U.S. job openings surged to a record high in July and employers appeared to have trouble filling openings, the latest signal of an increasingly tight labour market that could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates.\nYet, many market players suspect recent volatility in financial markets is likely to keep the Fed from raising rates next month.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar stood at 120.29 yen, having stepped back from one-week high of 121.20 yen hit on Wednesday. The euro fetched $1.12250.\nIn Asian trade, investors will have another look at the state of Chinese economy on Thursday when China will publish its inflation data (0130 GMT).\nThe Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet on Thursday, with just one member expected to vote in favour of an immediate hike.\nBut the accompanying minutes will be watched for clues on future rises, as mixed UK economic data and concerns over global market volatilities have reduced expectations of an early rate hike.\nSterling traded at $1.5354, off Tuesday's one week high of $1.5413.\n(Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:17:30.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
