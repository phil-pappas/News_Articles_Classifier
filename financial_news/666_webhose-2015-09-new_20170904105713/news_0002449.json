Alex Ellinghausen / Fairfax Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Employers have warned of job losses, higher compliance costs and potentially increased prices for consumers resulting from new minimum pay rates proposed for truck drivers.\nThe Australian Industry Group said on Wednesday that implementing the first major ruling by the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal would threaten the viability of owner-drivers and transport operators.\nThe tribunal's draft order proposes payments recommended in a KPMG report, which employers claim are substantially higher than current market rates.\nWorkplace lawyers said the decision would impact all retailers and those in the supply chain as retailers will have to manage compliance of their supply chain partners to ensure minimum payments to drivers are met.\n\"A retailer will also have to conduct its own audit of compliance and it will have a positive obligation to report non-compliance,\" said Andrew Farr, a partner with law firm Lander and Rogers.\nExtra compliance costs a burden\n\"A retailer may even have obligations to audit the drivers themselves. The additional compliance costs will be substantial\".\nAi Group chief executive Innes Willox said the order \"would impose a very onerous and unwarranted regulatory burden on transport operators and their clients which would cost jobs and threaten the viability of transport operators\".\n Mr Willox said if the order \"increases costs to businesses there would be a potential flow on to consumers\".\n\"Ai Group is still assessing the impact of the draft minimum rates, but from feedback received from industry so far it appears that the rates are well above market rates,\" he said.\n\"If made it the current terms, it appears that the order will threaten the livelihoods of many owner drivers and the viability of transport operators that use them.\n\"It will also impose substantial cost increases on businesses which use road transport with flow on effects for the broader community. Ultimately, these cost increases will damage the competitiveness of Australian industry.\"\nUnion in favour of order\nBut the Transport Workers Union said the order would ease pressure on drivers by putting in place contract and auditing obligations on those at the top of supply chains.\nThe union's national secretary, Tony Sheldon, said on Wednesday that the proposed rates were comparable with those paid to drivers directly engaged by Linfox and Toll. He said there would be further consultation about the rates and the union was prepared to consider phasing them in.\nHe said 29 per cent of drivers currently received wages below the award rate once their vehicle and running costs were taken into account. He said the proposed changes would help address driver fatigue and encourage operators to compress the supply chain.\nMr Farr said the draft order was still subject to change before it became a binding law. Further submissions are due by September 23.\n\"Apart from the significant compliance obligations imposed on retailers, the major concern with the draft payments order is the significant increase to minimum payments for distribution and long distance operations,\" he said.\n\"The end-to-end impact on retailers will depend on many variables. However, the prevailing view is that the rates in the draft payments order will add significantly to supply chain costs.\"\nThe Abbott Government is considering the future of the tribunal and has not ruled out scrapping it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-09T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:16:03.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
