WSJ Logistics Reports Erica E. Phillips writes the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach both surpassed important benchmarks in August , a pivotal month for peak-season shipping. The 19.1% gain in imports helped Long Beach set a record for overall container volume and a 6.3% boost in imports at Los Angeles gave the country’s biggest port its best August since 2006. That suggests belief by retailers in consumer spending growth heading into the fall—as well as faith in the ports since the labor strife of the past year. Still, U.S. consumer confidence slipped in September and if retail trade doesn’t match the movement of goods at the ports the flow of containers into California will slow down very, very sharply. \nChina’s economy is looking weaker by the month. New reports issued over the weekend show tepid factory production and investment in August, a sign that the country’s growth targets are slipping and that pressure is growing on Beijing to take more action to stimulate activity. The WSJ’s Mark Magnier reports that industrial production grew a weaker-than-expected 6.1% and fixed-asset investment in nonrural areas expanded 10.9% in the first eight months of the year , below expectations. Those are the first significant numbers from China since the Tianjin explosion in early August and the currency and other actions Beijing launched to get the economy on track. China is already taking some larger structural actions: the government released a plan Sunday to allow private investment in some of its bloated state-run companies . That may draw some interest from the logistics world, where operators have sought to tap into the country’s big economic prospects but have found state operations holding all the cards and most of the shipments. \nAirbus Group SE is redrawing the landscape for aircraft manufacturing . The WSJ’s Robert Wall reports the European company will inaugurate its first jetliner production facility in the U.S. on Monday , a move aimed at lowering production costs and, more important, bringing Airbus greater market share. The site in Mobile, Ala., will employ about 1,000 workers and bring with it an important, high-value industrial supply chain that will include significant movement of parts by ocean and air. The supply chain for jets increasingly flows through the U.S. South, since the Airbus decision follows Boeing’s move to move some aircraft manufacturing in South Carolina. The site will get only a fraction of the overall Airbus output for narrowbody aircraft, but that class of the aircraft is highly in demand. If Airbus gains the sales it wants from U.S. airlines the factory could get much busier in a hurry. E-COMMERCE ENLARGE The Port of Los Angeles, Calif.

Toys R Us launched the first discount of the season last week, slicing its threshold for free shipping from a $49 minimum purchase down to $19 , according to Reuters. The move is likely to trigger a new wave of discounting on shipping across the retail industry. The toy company’s minimum is below the free-shipping thresholds at Target Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., WMT 0.83 % and far from fees such as the $99 Amazon Prime membership that bring free delivery. Even eBay Inc. recognizes the role shipping plays in online commerce these days. The marketplace is testing addition of a shipping club to its marketplace , starting in Germany. Storefront retailers tell CNBC t he free shipping offers drive consumers to spend more online . But they can cut into margins, and they’re a mixed-bag for the postal and parcel carriers that handle the goods. The residential deliveries are costly to handle, and private carriers are showing more interest in passing those costs along than in joining a free-shipping frenzy. \nCar manufacturing and Silicon Valley are converging , triggering big changes in auto making supply chains. The WSJ’s William Boston reports the drive toward technology is tilting the auto parts supply chain toward Germany, where car-component makers see rich prospects in the burgeoning wired-car industry . Equipment giants such as Bosch GmbH and ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which are expanding into mega-suppliers, have started working closely with the U.S. tech giants such as Google Inc. Germany’s car makers are embracing the upheaval, and their local suppliers are keenly aware that digital vehicle-control technology is remaking the automotive industry. Technology is triggering new business combinations such as ZF’s acquisition of U.S. auto parts maker TRW Automotive that will change how components get to factories as the manufacturers overhaul the technology under the hood.
