( MainStreet ) – You can have your game-day 30 packs, German beer holidays and pumpkin-pie-spiced ales , but you're missing the best beer of the season if it isn't made with hops straight from the field. \nThe hop harvest is upon us, which means it's also fresh/wet hop beer season . As hop farmers take topcutting machines to their bines, load them into trucks and get ready to take them to barn-sized kilns for drying, some of their partners in U.S. brewing are stepping in to take some of the heat off. On harvest day, some brewers will take freshly cut bines, pluck off their hop cones, throw them into boiling wort and use them to make some of the most unique beer of the season. \nBy taking those hops while they're fresh -- some brewers argue that “fresh” means the freshest dried hops of the season, but brewing pioneer Bert Grant and his Yakima Brewing Company thought otherwise more than 20 years ago -- brewers can tweak a beer's aroma, reduce its bitterness and let the citrus, pine and spice flavors of a hop run free. A result is an overall more flavorful beer without the harsh hop bitterness. \nIt's why, August and early September, beer lovers in Idaho, Washington and Oregon get out their ladders and snips; cut down wires and twine strung to poles, barns and garages; and began harvesting big green piles of hops for their own batches or as donations to breweries. Situated outside Portland, Ore., TheStreet 's beer reporting bureau planted a few hop rhizomes – basically, hop roots – of our own three years ago and watched our fledgling Cascade and Willamette hop vines slowly strengthen. With a first-year yield of scarcely a cup of mixed hops, our first crop landed on the back porch of Lucky Laborador Brewing Company in Portland – where pickup truck beds filled with surplus hop vines were transferred to tables of beer-fed volunteers for picking, sorting and weighing before going into its multi-hop mish-mash called The Mutt. Last year, a windstorm took down our bines and left them to wither. This year, our first strong season yielded enough fresh hops for a pale ale.
