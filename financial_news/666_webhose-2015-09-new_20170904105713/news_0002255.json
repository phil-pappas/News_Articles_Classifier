Plan providers all charge several layers of fees. They levy expenses for mutual funds plus advisory fees.Of course, these fees eat into your retirement kitty and reduce your future income.According to a new study by Personal Capital , some providers are more costly than others.The robo-adviser company looked at top financial services companies (mostly broker-advisers) and their total charges for retirement accounts.Examining expenses on accounts from the top money managers in the business, they found that some of the biggest names in the business were also the most expensive.The costliest providers were Merrill Lynch, Ameriprise, Ameritrade, [entity display=\"Wells Fargo\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"wells-fargo\" ticker=\"WFC\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4683\"]Wells Fargo[/entity] and [entity display=\"Morgan Stanley\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"morgan-stanley\" ticker=\"MS\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2944\"]Morgan Stanley[/entity].Over 30 years, what these companies would charge you on retirement accounts ranges from nearly $1 million (Merrill) to $502,000 (USAA, the lowest-cost company surveyed).These total expenses, which include fund and advisory fees, apply to average account balances of $500,000.The range of advisory fees charged varies widely: From 1.53% for Ameritrade to 0.82% for USAA. Of course, you have to add to that 0.99% (Ameriprise) to 0.49% (Ameritrade).To get the total annual expenses -- the most important number -- you add the advisory and fund expenses. That's the one that counts. What You Can Do * Go Direct. You don't need a middleman to set up a retirement account for you.They will charge you for the service of setting up and maintaining an account -- plus mutual fund expenses.So go directly to mutual fund companies, who will only charge you for fund management expenses. * Go with the lowest-cost providers. By going direct, you save that middleman fee.But there are a handful of companies that you should consider first.The mutual fund/ETF companies that consistently have the lowest costs include: [entity display=\"BlackRock\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"blackrock\" ticker=\"BLK\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/637\"]BlackRock[/entity] (iShares), Schwab, SPDRs ([entity display=\"State Street\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"state-street\" ticker=\"STT\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4069\"]State Street[/entity]), TIAA-CREF and Vanguard.Companies that are also competitive on cost include Fidelity and T. Rowe Price.Keep in mind that with most of the older mutual fund companies, they will also provide hands-on advice and may not charge you depending on how much money you have on deposit. * Go with a low-cost adviser. There's nothing wrong with an adviser -- as long as they set you up in a low-cost portfolio.Ideally, this person would help you pick the right funds for your age, occupation and risk tolerance.They would also likely choose funds from the first fund groups mentioned above.If they were even more investor friendly, they would charge you a flat fee, although most of them will charge you an annual fee based on a percentage of assets under management.I would look for advisers who charge less than the standard 1% per year. * Go with a Robo. These online money managers set up your portfolio, manage it and reduce costs.They cost far less than standard advisers -- because nearly everything is automated -- but more than going direct with a mutual fund company.This growing group includes Betterment , FutureAdvisor and Wealthfront. Note: Schwab and Vanguard also offer robo services.Which service you select depends upon the degree of service you need.If you're just starting out, I would recommend the robos. You go online to sign up and nearly everything is automated.What you'll get from the robos is a low-cost portfolio that can be automatically rebalanced. There's very little that you have to do.For more service, I would go with the older mutual fund companies like Fidelity or Vanguard. They can provide professional advice on the phone.I own funds from both companies (in addition to iShares and SPDRs) and have phoned in for advice on many occasions.What your decision comes down to is cost plus the benefit of advice.If you need more comprehensive advice, by all means consult a fee-only planner who can not only set up a portfolio but create a financial plan that takes into account tax, estate and retirement goals.While this professional may charge you a flat or hourly rate, they won't make any money on commissions or middleman fees.When it comes to retirement planning, cutting out the middleman will almost always boost your nest egg.", "external_links": ["https://intelligent.schwab.com/public/intelligent/home.html?src=NSG&sv1=yUCgolI3_dc&sv2=73321643540&keyword=%2Bschwab%20intelligent%20portfolios&device=c&adposition=1t1&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&placement=", "https://www.futureadvisor.com/content/search/brand?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Alpha%20-%20Brand&utm_content=futureadvisor%20-%20exact&utm_term=futureadvisor&gclid=Cj0KEQjw4NmvBRCRp_yu2bzal4YBEiQAWfjpJjLhHrBhSCHULqmL_kqVUIZgc0jq8tESYbcWC4KdelEaAjkj8P8HAQ", "https://www.napfa.org/", "https://investor.vanguard.com/financial-advisor/financial-advice?wt.srch=1", "https://www.wealthfront.com/", "https://www.betterment.com/"], "published": "2015-09-21T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:18:36.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
