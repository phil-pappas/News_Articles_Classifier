Officials said they demanded the ban as their religion prescribes non-violence to all living beings.\nThe ban in Mumbai will be imposed on four non-consecutive days from Thursday, said Kaleem Pathan, deputy general manager of the city’s Deonar abattoir. It covers the slaughter of buffaloes, goats and hogs, but excludes fish and poultry.\nIt is not unusual for authorities to impose meat-free days and ban alcohol on India’s national days, but the latest strictures angered many who said religious groups should not impose their preferences on an entire city.\n“The Jains are entitled to their own beliefs and can peacefully follow what they believe in,” said Mumbai resident Lavanya Chhabra, who runs a firm making air fresheners for cars.\n“But they should not be in any way involved in imposing a ban that affects others.”\nMohammed Ali Qureshi, president of industry body the Bombay Suburban Beef Dealers’ Association, said, “Jains do not eat onions and garlic as well, so tomorrow is the government going to ban those items also?”\nThe community forms just 2 percent of the population in the western state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, Qureshi said, adding, “This is clearly not the right thing to do.”\nIndia is home to 300 million cattle and is the world’s largest beef exporter and fifth-biggest consumer.\nSince Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s Hindu nationalist party came to power last year, the rhetoric on the protection of cows, which Hindus consider holy, has increased.\nCritics say tougher anti-beef laws discriminate against Muslims, Christians and lower-caste Hindus who rely on the cheap meat for protein. Butchers and cattle traders, many of them Muslim, say the push threatens thousands of jobs.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 8:26 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:51:16.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
