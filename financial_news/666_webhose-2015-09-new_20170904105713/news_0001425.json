Domestic availability of the commodity is on the lower side and traders report higher imports from Sri Lanka. India is the largest consumer of pepper in the world and the second largest producer after Vietnam.\n“The domestic production for the next season would be lower with monsoon showers erratic in the producing region. Domestic availability continues to remain tight and imports are seen higher than last year,” Jojan Malayil, a leading exporter from Kochi told FE.\nMalayil feels the market would remain firm as the next crop from India and Vietnam would reach only by January 2016. “Vietnam has officially sold more than one lakh tonne till August and taking into account the unofficial trade with China, they will have only pepper to cover till the next arrival. The global demand is now met by Brazil, Sri Lanka and Indonesia,” he said.\nIndian exporters and processors are covering from Sri Lanka and more than 7,000 tonne has been imported so far under the FTA and other concessions, Kishore Shamji, one of the senior exporters and member of the India Pepper and Spice Trade Association (IPSTA).The depreciation of Indian Rupee in the recent days is likely to slow down imports, he added.\nHe estimates the demand-supply situation in India is tight and the market would remain steady unless the stock in the custody of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) comes to the market rapidly. FSSAI had seized nearly 6,800 tonne in December 2012 to investigate charges of adulteration and reports say that some of the samples have cleared the tests and are now in the market.Indian pepper is trading at $10,800 per tonne, compared to Vietnam’s $10,200 and Indonesia’s $10,250. Brazil is selling forward to the US and European markets as Sri Lanka caters to India.\nPepper crop could be on the shorter side for the next crop season as the abundant summer showers do not augur well for the vines, which need a good dry season and timely monsoon, Anand MV, a farmer from Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad said. Dry spell after the flowering could also lead to flowers dropping from the spikes leading to lesser yield, he added.\nPepper exports from India in last fiscal stood at 21,450 tonnes valued at Rs 120.84 crore as against 21,250 tonnes valued at Rs 94 crore in FY 14.\n 10, 2015 12:07 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:08:48.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
