That placed it just outside the top 10 biggest mines in Chile, which produces about one-third of the world's copper.\nEl Abra's workforce comprised about 1,600 employees and 1,400 contractors.\nAny labor action would be a fresh headache for state-run Codelco, which owns the remaining 49 percent stake in El Abra. Codelco has just resolved a three-week dispute with contractor workers across its operations, which cost some 17,000 tonnes in lost output.
