Local equities closed on a weak note, taking cues from global markets which dented the rupee movement.”\nThe trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 65.70 to 66.70.\nIn forward market, the premium for dollar inched up on mild paying pressure from corporates.\nThe benchmark six-month premium payable in February inched up to 213.75-214.25 paise from 212.5-214.5 paise previously and far-forward August 2016 contracts moved up to 433-434 paise from 429.5-431.5 paise previously.\nThe RBI fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 66.1638 and for the euro at 74.6063.\nThe rupee moved up further against the pound sterling to close at 101.08 from 101.66 yesterday and recovered against the euro to 74.52 from 74.58 previously.\nIt also recovered against the Japanese currency to finish at 55.12 per 100 yen from 55.18 yesterday.\n 02, 2015 10:37 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:02:20.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
