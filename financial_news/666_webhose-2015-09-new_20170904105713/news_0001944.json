Monetary tightening in the U.S. would push up Treasury yields, exacerbating outflows from developing nations. Taiwan and South Korea are both struggling with a slump in exports amid a slowdown in China, their biggest market.\n“A delayed hike gives Asian central banks more room to support liquidity,” especially Taiwan and Korea, said Frances Cheung, head of Asia ex-Japan rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “Even if it’s not an explicit rate cut, they can at least maintain loose liquidity.”\nThe yield on Taiwan’s sovereign bonds due 2020 fell six basis points, the most for benchmark five-year notes in almost a year, to 0.82 percent as of 12:16 p.m. local time, according to Taipei Exchange prices. The three-year yield in Korea dropped five basis points, the biggest decline since May, to 1.64 percent, Korea Exchange prices show.\nTraders now see a 44 percent chance the Fed will raise rates by December, while 18 percent expect a move to come in October.\nIn Taiwan, where rate reviews are held quarterly, four of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg in August predicted a cut on Sept. 24, while four said the move would come in December. The rest saw no change. Seven of 23 economists expect the Bank of Korea, which has monthly policy meetings, to lower its key rate by 25 basis points from a record-low 1.5 percent by year-end, while the remainder forecast it will stay on hold.\nDifferent Windows The window for Taiwan to ease is this month, and that for Korea is October or November, Mark Walton, a Hong Kong-based economist at BNP Paribas SA, said before the Fed decision.\nThe Bank of Korea said that while it sees a gradual improvement in the economy, there are still uncertainties including China’s slowdown and instabilities in emerging markets, according to its policy statement this month.\n“If the timing for Fed tightening policy is pushed back, any burden the Bank of Korea would have when they lower interest rates, including foreign-investor outflows, eases,” said Yoon Yeo Sam, a Seoul-based fixed-income analyst at Daewoo Securities Co. “Government bond yields will head downwards amid bets for BOK easing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:14:17.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
