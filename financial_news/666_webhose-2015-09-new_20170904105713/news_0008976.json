Stefan Posties Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Monday marks two years since the Abbott government came to power. If it loses power in another year when the election is due, it could depart without leaving as much as a footprint.\nA handful of free trade agreements, middling at best in terms of an enduring policy legacy, will be about it.\nOtherwise, debt and deficit will be higher than the levels the government inherited, there would not have been a single meaningful change to industrial relations law and, unless it gets a hurry-on, there would have been no reforms of the tax system.\nWith one year to go, the government is still tip-toeing around the concept of economic reform and, in most cases, running from it.\nTony Abbott seems frightened of making any reforms that might upset anybody. Alex Ellinghausen Most of the blame for this torpor still rests with the 2014 budget. The political damage it caused with its farrago of broken promises robbed the government of what political capital it had. Apart from a few brief spurts, it has failed to gain any traction since.\nGrand plans to hit the 2016 election armed with a reform agenda driven by white papers into tax and federation, and Productivity Commission reviews into industrial relations, remain little more than words.\nThe government is pushing a GST increase to fund tax cuts. But it has lost the support of South Australia which, understandably, only agreed to a GST increase to fill the public hospital funding gap exacerbated by the 2014 decision to pull more than $50 billion in Commonwealth funding.\nSA Premier Jay Weatherill says he'll be buggered if he'll be part of increasing the GST to allow Canberra to retreat further on health spending so it can fund pre-election tax cuts. That wasn't the deal.\n Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Small Business Minister Bruce Billson during a visit to Celestino Cafe in Fyshwick Alex Ellinghausen The week just gone demonstrated that the capacity or appetite for doing anything adventurous, let alone risky, is non-existent.\nOn Tuesday, the cabinet dispatched plans for the bank deposit tax first flagged by Labor upon the recommendation of the Council of Financial Regulators. It was to have been collected from the big four at the cost of about $100 million each a year, put into a fund that would be used to offset debt, and drawn upon in the event of a bank collapse.\nSilencing Billson There was also the decision to not allow Small Business Minister Bruce Billson to put his case to cabinet for changes to the Competition Act to curb the misuse of market power by big business. Billson's submission was the culmination of more than a year's work and the sharp end of the Harper review, which the government commissioned with so much fanfare upon being elected.\nThe cabinet actions were driven by myriad reasons.\nBillson was opposed by the most senior members of cabinet – mostly the lawyers – who argued that the introduction of an effects test and a toughening of the \"take advantage\" provisions would create a lawyers' picnic in which companies would be forced to second-guess, in advance, the consequences of commercial decisions.\nThe bank tax was opposed by a large swath of the backbench, even after Hockey agreed to apply it just to the big four on the assumption they would absorb the cost, rather than pass it on to customers and give the smaller banks a competitive advantage.\nThe same transparent populism that saw Tony Abbott cut any prospect of superannuation tax reform off at the knees in April, just because Labor had promised to do something if elected, was another reason. It's all about painting Labor as the party of high taxes and the Coalition as that of low taxes.\nBut the common denominator also influencing both cabinet actions was pressure from business lobby groups.\nThe Customer Owned Banking Association ran ads for months against the proposed bank tax. The Australian Bankers' Association opposed it and, as Hockey admitted on Tuesday, the chief executives of the big four argued against it when he consulted them. Quelle surprise!\nBehind the scenes, the Business Council of Australia had threatened a public campaign had Billson's competition reforms been adopted. Only a few weeks before, Abbott had been inclined towards supporting Billson, even taking on BCA president Catherine Livingstone at a closed dinner in June.\nLivingstone had urged Abbott to proceed with \"sensible reform\", which she defined as not including an effects test. Abbott, in response, thanked Livingstone but said \"we will proceed with reforms as we see fit, even if it means changes to competition law\".\nClearly, he retreated. Billson's submission to cabinet sought to explain how he had appeased the BCA's concerns, whilst being able to generate economic activity by stimulating the small and medium business sectors. He was not allowed to make his case,\nThe episodes demonstrate again how lobby group pressure has grown in effectiveness in Canberra over recent years.\nWhen many of these same groups gathered in Sydney last week for the National Reform Summit, sponsored by The Australian Financial Review and The Australian , they espoused lofty sentiment about the need for all concerned to put aside self-interest for the national interests.\nWhile it was worthwhile exercise in net terms, no-one agreed to anything that was against their self-interest.\nThere was much discussion in the room about the reasons for Australia's reform drought – the 24/7 media cycle and the university politicians that now run the show being chief among them.\nNo-one dared mention cashed-up lobby groups. In the room was the Minerals Council of Australia, which established the benchmark in 2010 when it spent $22 million to bring down a prime minster who, albeit clumsily and without consultation, proposed a tax on mining profits that would have funded company tax cuts and other reforms for those in the economic slow lane.\nSuch campaigns are now de rigueur . The poker machine industry tore apart Julia Gillard over her plans to try to curb problem gambling. So much so that the Coalition announced its policy – a watering down of Labor's plans – on the website of Clubs Australia.\nAbbott has benefited significantly in the past from third-party support, but he should have realised by now that third parties will always argue for their interest, not his. That's what they are paid to do.\nIf the government keeps waiting for a consensus, from business, lobby groups, the states, or the opposition, it will continue to drift and do nothing.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:07:03.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
