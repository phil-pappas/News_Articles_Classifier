We are currently facing problems of power supply in the country. I must commend that this project is coming at an opportune moment. \n\"We believe the project advantages outweigh the disadvantages. We are excited as I have said earlier that it will address the problems the power generation sector is currently facing,\" Paramount Chief Chikulamayembe explained. \nHowever the Paramount Chief appealed to government authorities that they should handle the issue of compensating people who will be displaced properly to facilitate the smooth implementation of the project. \n\"My fear is on compensation. Please ensure that all those who will be displaced and lose property should be compensated. It will have to be done properly and timely,\" he added. \nHis sentiments were echoed by Sub Traditional Authority Njikula whose area will be the epicenter of the project and holds majority of 300 hundred households who will lose land and houses upon implementation of the project. \n\"We are giving the project a blessing to go ahead. We have been in darkness for long time. But I have also to stress on the issue of compensation. You will need to handle that issue well to avoid problems that might arise later. \nMind you the issues of rights and freedoms are everywhere these days. Some people are bound to argue that I will not move because you have not compensated me,\" he observed. \nThe Fufu Hydro power project design proposes construction of a 140 metre high dam on Rukuru River which will create a large reservoir in the valley upstream. The river flow will be diverted through an underground tunnel to a powerhouse on the Lake shore, north of Mlowe. \nWater will also be redirected from a small dam on the North Rumphi River and transmitted through a tunnel connected to the South Rukuru River reservoir via the Jalawe River and power will be transmitted through a transmission line to a sub-station at Bwengu in Mzimba. \nAccording to team leader of MultConsult /NORPLAN, Jorn Stave, should project be implemented using proposed design, it will automatically have both social and environmental impact in the area surrounding the site. \n\"The most critical issue is that it [the proposed dam] will inundate the land upstream from the dam. We know that there are people living and cultivating their gardens there. \n\"So that will have social impact that will have to be addressed. Those people will need to be compensated properly,\" he observed. \nHe also observed South Rukuru and North Rumphi water flow will be reduced because of the water that will be redirected to the dam and there would not be enough water for irrigation during dry season. \n\"So we have to find ways to make sure that some water is available in the river to sustain livelihoods and also to sustain the environment. \n\"We know this project will require international financing. It is important that we highlight all environmental issues that we do the study properly,\" he said. \nHe further disclosed that if the flow of the rivers is reduced, some areas will dry up and survival of some fish species like Mpasa could be under threat. \n\"You know Mpasa the fish is now internationally recognized as an endangered species. That is critical in terms of bio-diversity and environment because Mpasa is using the river to migrate for spawning\" Stave explained.
