Getty Images Japan's Nikkei share average soared on Wednesday after comments by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sparked hopes of more policy steps to support growth and as long-term investors hunted for bargain after the market hit a seven-month low.\nThe Nikkei 225 jumped 7.7 per cent to 18,770.51 at the close in Tokyo, its biggest gain since October 2008, to reverse losses on Tuesday that wiped out the gauge's 2015 advance.\nMr Abe, who just won a mandate to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for another three years on Tuesday, told a meeting of investors that he would seek to lower corporate tax and sounded optimistic on reaching a trans-Pacific trade deal.\nMarket players said Mr Abe's comments gave an added boost to Japanese stocks as they rebounded from overselling on Tuesday, helped by overnight gains on Wall Street.\n\"Abe's speech sparked speculation that he won't be sitting idly to let the economy flop. Investors thought there will be a rebooting of Abenomics,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nMr Abe's fiscal policy has yet to translate into gains in real wages for Japanese workers, and market participants said easing the corporate tax burden is a step toward giving companies more profits to put into employees' pockets.\n\"There is also a sense of relief at seeing Abe turn his attention back to the economy after putting so much of his focus toward a controversial security bill,\" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.\n\"The markets need him to keep an eye on the economy, and he's starting to do that because of the elections ahead.\"\n Long-term investors also saw the Nikkei's dip to a seven-month low on Tuesday as a good opportunity for bargain-hunting as the Nikkei was trading around 14 times forecast earnings.\nThe country's public pension funds, which have been stepping up stock investment under Abe, are likely to be among them.\n\"Long-term investors such as public pension funds seem to be buying stocks today,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nIf the gains hold, the Nikkei is on track to post the biggest daily gain since March 16, 2011.\nTraders said that the Japanese market tends to be volatile as it is the most liquid market open during Asian trade. If the Chinese market falls, investors would trade on Japanese shares to hedge against the fall in China, they added.\nThe broader Topix index surged 6.4 per cent to 1507.37, the most since March 2011.\nJapanese shares suffered the world's second-steepest drop through Tuesday since China's shock yuan devaluation last month, with Shanghai's equity gauge the only one that fared worse.\n\"The selloff in Japanese equities has been excessive amid concerns over China's economic slowdown,\" said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management.\n\"Today's rally can be sustained once the market's perception of the Chinese economy improves.\"\nAll of the Topix's 33 industry groups rose, with brokers and insurers leading the advance. The yen traded at 120.49 per US dollar, weakening for a third day. The yen touched a seven-month high versus the greenback on August 24, the same week that foreigners fled Japanese equities at the fastest pace in at least a decade.\n\"We had fallen so much so quickly that today we're seeing a reversal of that,\" said Tetsuo Seshimo, a portfolio manager at Saison Asset Management in Tokyo. \"For now, it's all up to what happens in China,\" adding that he thinks the Shanghai Composite may not fall further.\nwith Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:07:48.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
