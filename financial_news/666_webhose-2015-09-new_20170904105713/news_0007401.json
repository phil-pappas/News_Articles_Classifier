In mere months, they’ve already garnered a fanatical clientele base that voted MOOYAH as the top burger in the greater Madison area.\n“The response from the community since our opening has been overwhelming,” said Bergeson. “We’ve been thrilled at our Guests’ enthusiasm for the brand and their love of the product. Winning this contest proves we are doing something special in the burger category and sets us up for success and expansion here in the greater Madison community.”\nIt was youngest son Lucas’s idea to open a restaurant as a family, and the trio loved MOOYAH’s simple, customizable menu. The Bergeson’s also liked the idea of bringing the brand to an untapped market, giving them boundless opportunities for expansion. They opened in April at 6309 McKee Road.\nAt MOOYAH, Guests have the advantage of choosing from a variety of bun options, such as baked in-house artisan white or multigrain wheat buns and handcrafted lettuce buns to accompany a never-frozen 100 percent American beef patty, all-natural Jennie-O turkey patty or mouthwatering black bean veggie patty. Each gourmet burger can be customized with five cheese options, applewood smoked bacon and sliced avocado, along with nine free veggie toppings and 11 free sauces.\nMOOYAH French fries come together in a six-step process that takes a total of 24 hours to completely prepare. A delightful combination of constant attention and a little magic help transform U.S. #1 Idaho potatoes into perfect, crisp-on-the-outside and fluffy-on-the-inside fries. Guests also have the choice of savory sweet potato fries. Never one to forget dessert, MOOYAH offers real ice cream shakes, allowing Guests to choose from 10 flavors ranging from vanilla to Hershey’s chocolate to Reese’s to strawberry banana and more.\nIn 2015, MOOYAH is on pace to open 30 new locations and reach the milestone of 100 locations before the close of the year. The booming better burger brand is set to enter several new states in 2015, with the brand making its debut in Indiana, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, and Florida this year. Additionally, the brand will increase its established presence in states including California, Texas, Illinois, Louisiana, and New Jersey. The brand continues to spread the unique MOOYAH experience beyond domestic borders, with its first restaurant in Qatar set to open this year, marking the seventh country MOOYAH has entered outside the U.S.\nFor more information on the growing brand, connect with MOOYAH on Facebook at the MOOYAH Burgers & Fries Fan page or follow MOOYAH on Twitter @MOOYAHBurger.\nFor franchising opportunities, please visit http://www.mooyahfranchise.com/ .\nABOUT MOOYAH BURGERS, FRIES & SHAKES\nMOOYAH Burgers, Fries & Shakes is a fast-casual, “better burger” concept offering mouthwatering made-to-order burgers, French fries hand cut from Idaho potatoes, and real ice cream shakes.
