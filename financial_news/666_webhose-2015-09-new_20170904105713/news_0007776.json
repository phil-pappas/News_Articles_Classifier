But he added monetary policy would not restore economic growth over the long term.\nMore than eight years after the onset of the financial crisis, the economies of the United States and Britain are growing at a healthier pace, in contrast to those of Japan and in many euro zone countries.\nBut the risk of a sharp slowdown in China and other emerging economies has prevented the Fed from starting to raise interest rates and is being watched closely by the Bank of England.\nInvestors mostly think that the Fed's delay will be short-lived and that it could begin raising rates before the end of the year, followed a few months later by Britain's central bank.\nBut the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, who has long been gloomy about the chances of a sustainable recovery, said the world might in fact be sinking into a new phase of the financial crisis - this time caused by emerging markets.\nIn a speech on Friday that summed up the dilemma for many central banks, he said policymakers had a lot less room for manoeuvre than in the past.\nHaldane pointed out that the Bank of England's next move might be to cut its rates below their record low 0.5 percent rather than proceed with a hike as widely expected. But even when interest rates do start to rise, he warned they could be pulled back again to near zero by future problems.\n\"If global real interest rates are persistently lower, central banks may then need to think imaginatively about how to deal on a more durable basis with the technological constraint imposed by the zero lower bound on interest rates,\" he said.\n\"That may require a rethink, a fairly fundamental one, of a number of current central bank practices.\"\nRADICAL IDEAS\nHaldane said possible solutions included giving central banks higher inflation targets or making their emergency bond-buying programmes a permanent part of their armoury, although both options had their downsides.\nHe raised a third and even more radical possibility: governments issuing electronic rather than paper money, making it feasible for central banks to apply negative interest rates and break the current floor of borrowing costs at zero.\nOne of the Fed's policymakers even called for the U.S. central bank to set a negative interest rate at Thursday's meeting. But for now, most investors are betting on a less dramatic path for the world's central banks.\nAnna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, one of the world's biggest fund managers, said the Fed and the BoE remain on course to carry out a few interest rate hikes while the BoJ and the ECB carried on buying bonds.\nShe hopes the combination of technological advances, more spending by governments on infrastructure and reforms to boost competitiveness will also eventually help move the world economy out of its low-growth, low-inflation rut.
