Or do we watch Chinese data, for instance, much more closely than we do U.S. data? Or is it financial variables like domestic and international stocks that will determine liftoff? This confusion could create some volatility—and that is generally not good for the performance of asset markets and profitability.\nIndeed, that uncertainty might be swaying markets in the near term. Stocks fell Thursday and Friday and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.46% was struggling Monday to hold on to a bounce. Barrow doesn’t subscribe to the notion that the Fed is scared stiff of international developments or that pleas by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank against a rate increase were sufficient to stay the central bank’s hand.\n‘Red herring’ “We call it a ‘red herring’ because the real reason for delay was that the market was not properly priced for liftoff. Only around half of analysts expected a hike and the fed funds futures market put a probability of just 30% on Fed action,” Barrow said.\nIf the Fed has any responsibility to the rest of the world, Barrow continued, it is to tighten policy in a way that has “minimal spillovers,” he said. Catching the market by surprise would have potentially caused large spillovers.\nThe important point is that investors shouldn’t get wrong-footed into thinking that the Fed’s responsibility to the rest of the world entails maintaining monetary policy that is inappropriately loose just because “the likes of the IMF or World Bank start moaning,” he said. Barrow argued that the high value of the dollar and low reading of inflation expectations factored into the market for inflation-protected Treasurys, or TIPS, back up the notion that policy isn’t overly loose.\nPolicy could become inappropriately loose, however, if unemployment continues to drop and wages continue to rise, said Barrow, who said he still suspects the Fed will be able to deliver a rate increase come its December meeting.\nParty like it is 1998? Meanwhile, Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, drew a parallel with 1998, when global financial weakness—and a much more concrete emerging-market crisis— threatened to dent U.S. growth .\nIn a note, O’Sullivan recalled that was the same year that then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that it wasn’t credible to expect the U.S. to “remain an oasis of prosperity ” unaffected by “greatly increased stress” around the world. I\n“However, the United States did remain a relative oasis,” O’Sullivan said.\nAnd while it is true that the Fed did ease interest rates in 1998 by 75 basis points to 4.75%, policy was still more restrictive than it is now with rates near zero, and that the turmoil in financial markets and the fall in export volumes were also much more dramatic, he wrote. Indeed, Greenspan’s remarks came just two weeks after a Russian default .\nSo if Barrow and O’Sullivan are correct, the Fed will continue to take its cues largely from the U.S. labor market and should be able to pull off a rate increase without adding to global turmoil.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.pragcap.com/the-russian-default-what-happened/", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980904.htm"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:18:48.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
