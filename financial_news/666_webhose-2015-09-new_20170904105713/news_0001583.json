(OTC PINK: RVUE) , a premier advertising technology platform for digital place-based media, today announced that David Esser has been named rVue's Chief Technology Officer. Mr. Esser had been serving in an interim capacity from July this year. \nIn addition, the Company announced that Steve Schildwachter had resigned as Chief Marketing Officer to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Schildwachter will remain as an advisor to the Company. \nMark Pacchini, rVue's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"David and his InstantSys Team have ramped up quickly and blended well with the veteran rVue IT team, providing us with access to several key technology specialists. An experienced startup operator accustomed to accomplishing a great deal with lean budgets, David has made a significant impact on the platform in a short period of time. He was also instrumental in adding two full-time IT people to the team, and has contributed much more than just technology knowledge to rVue, serving as a great strategy and marketing partner to me. Naming David as our full-time CTO is the natural evolution of our productive relationship.\" \n\"Our marketing function is evolving, as we shift resources to sales and media efforts and place an emphasis on partnerships with sales rep groups,\" continued Mr. Pacchini. \"We expect to expand those partnerships in the coming months, benefitting from the increased shift away from online advertising due to issues related to fraud, bot generation, new ad blocking software, and the like. These issues continue to drive attention to the digital location video category. I am pleased that Steve Schildwachter has agreed to advise rVue going forward. We thank him for his many contributions to our organization and wish him well in his future endeavors.\" \nAbout rVue rVue Holdings, Inc. is an advertising technology company providing the digital distribution platform for the Digital Place-Based Advertising industry.
