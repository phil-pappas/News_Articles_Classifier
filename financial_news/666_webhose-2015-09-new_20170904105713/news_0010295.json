The bank will only accept payment/deposits upon production of a clearance card by each stand holders... \" \nA clearance card issued by council is proof that the stand in question is within a co-operative that is recognised by the local authority. \nThis means that the UDCorp arrangement would also help home-seekers to tell genuine housing co-operatives from bogus ones. \nChideme added that the other advantage of the UDCorp arrangement was that it gave a fall-back position in the event of any problems as the home-seeker would be able to approach the city council, the bank as well the Ministry of Local Government for redress. \nDesperate home seekers lose millions of dollars every year to bogus housing co-operatives and criminals that operate as land barons.
