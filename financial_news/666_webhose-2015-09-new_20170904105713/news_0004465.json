It's true that your income is not revealed on your credit report. But that doesn't mean there's no correlation whatsoever with your credit score. Whether we're talking about hard facts, anecdotes or conventional wisdom, there is definitely some overlap between your income and what your credit score is likely to look like. \nHigher Incomes and Money Management \n\"There's a loose correlation,\" says John Heath, managing attorney of LexingtonLaw. \"People with higher incomes generally know how to manage their money. People with higher education also tend to have jobs where you get paid more.\" As a result, such higher-income individuals may be inherently more trustworthy when it comes to credit and manage their money more responsibly so as to achieve a higher credit score. Of course, Heath is quick to emphasize that the correlation between a high income and high credit score is loose and not a direct causation-- in that credit bureaus are not directly integrating one's income into their risk scoring models to determine a FICO score. \"People with higher incomes may have also had access to educational opportunities that people of lower incomes have not,\" he says. Not only does that make them more qualified for some higher-paying jobs, it also increases the chances that they know how credit actually works. And in turn they know how to use the credit system to their best advantage.
