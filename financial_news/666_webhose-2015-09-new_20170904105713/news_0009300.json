(Blockbusters such as Billy Elliot have popularised the dance form among boys, too, but their numbers are nowhere near the same.)\nAs adults, those of us who learnt ballet as a child look back at that time with wistful nostalgia, wondering “What if?” Because of the beauty and gracefulness of the art form, because of the romantic and dramatic plots in the ballets themselves, and because of the emotions evoked during a performance, ballet is regarded with sentimentality and fondness.\nBut, as with every niche, it cannot rely on nostalgia alone to survive and thrive. Audience engagement, relevant messaging and finding new revenue streams to ensure financial stability are vital to the sustainability of ballet. It’s an interesting challenge for a performance art that is so deeply steeped in tradition, and brings with it vocal critics should any pirouette be twirled askew.\nAustralia is home to three professional ballet companies: the Australian Ballet; the West Australian Ballet; and the Queensland Ballet.\nThe Queensland Ballet is probably experiencing one of the most noticeable periods of change in any arts company in the country. It is an ideal case study of how an organisation can embrace inevitable change and take calculated risks.\nAmid much fanfare, in 2012, the Queensland Ballet announced Li Cunxin as its fifth artistic director. Li became a global celebrity after publishing his memoir, Mao’s Last Dancer , in 2003, which was later made into an internationally acclaimed movie. His story of how, at age 10, he was chosen by Madame Mao’s cultural advisers to attend the Beijing Dance Academy, then defected to the US and finally moved to Australia, touched millions worldwide. He travelled as a motivational speaker and reinvented himself as a successful stockbroker in Melbourne.\nWithout a doubt, his appointment was a huge coup for the Queensland Ballet. The company’s previous, fourth, director Francois Klaus was in the position for 15 years, and his departure was handled rather messily.\nIn July this year, the company’s long-term chief executive, Anna Marsden, a hugely experienced arts administrator, was swiftly replaced by acting executive director Dilshani Weerasinghe, an experienced arts fundraiser who apparently better shares Li’s vision. But administrative challenges aside, Queensland Ballet’s most recent achievement was its first international tour – a week of performances of La Sylphide at the London Coliseum in the West End, which took place last month.\n Because of the huge financial risks associated with such a tour - not to mention the logistics of transporting sets, costumes, a 60-strong team of dancers and administrative support staff - the completion of this feat within his first three years as artistic director was a bold, confident statement that Li is taking the company to new heights.\n“We are a company with global ambitions,” Li explains over breakfast after the company’s opening night performance in London. “So global reputation building is key. Where could you be possibly better placed than London if you wanted to thrust your company onto the international arena?”\nHe recalls treading those London boards as a ballet dancer 32 years ago. “I first danced in London with the Houston Ballet,” he says. “I remember how petrified I was. I was beside myself with nervousness, so I could imagine what my dancers went through last night.\n“But looking back, what a moment that was for me – really. At the time I didn’t realise. But looking back, that was such an important building block in my career, as a dancer, in my development.\n“So that’s what I wanted to give my dancers, too; that’s one of the most important reasons we did the tour. Artist development is so crucial for them. I can guarantee you all of them will look back one day and say, ‘Wow, that was special.’”\nThe tour was primarily bankrolled by sponsor QGC, which is part of London-based BG Group, as well as by private sponsors and funding from the state and federal governments. Notable Australian philanthropists Simon and Catriona Mordant helped support the tour also, and attended performances in London. Both are long-time friends of Li, his wife and their three children, and Catriona is on the board of the Queensland Ballet.\nShe says the London tour was an unmissable opportunity for the company. “We got invited [by QGC]. It seemed like a great idea at the time, and it snowballed from there,” Catriona tells Luxury . “Yes, there are risks involved, but we have to be positive and it’s a great opportunity for the dancers to perform internationally.”\nSponsorship surprise The company’s financial situation – “We’d like to look a lot healthier; it’s been a tough couple of years,” according to Catriona – has been made significantly better through a new, somewhat unexpected, lead sponsor - Suncorp Group.\nPatrick Snowball, Suncorp’s outgoing managing director and group CEO, says the alignment was as much of a surprise to him as it was to onlookers.\n“Ballet is not my gig, so I was able to approach this, to the surprise of my people, in a very objective fashion,” Snowball explains.\n“I mean, as I left school, my schoolmaster said, ‘There goes Patrick Snowball, the last of the great philistines’,” he laughs. “But then I met Li and I found him completely inspirational as an individual.”\nThe two first met at a corporate working lunch sponsored by Virgin Australia. But, “at the time, I couldn’t see the link between what he did and what I did”, Snowball says.\nThe two met again at another corporate reception, and it was Li’s passion for spreading ballet into the vast Queensland community that piqued Snowball’s interest. The alignment of values looked clearer and the lead sponsorship agreement was created.\n“The purpose of our sponsorship is very different to a traditional sponsorship,” Snowball says.\n“It comes back to the importance Suncorp attaches to our community position, and our responsibilities there. We didn’t want to see lots of black tie events in Brisbane – we wanted to see regional, community development of ballet.\n“So the sponsorship is based on a common view of community contribution and the need for meeting community aspirations.”\nSuncorp was also looking to balance out its significant existing sports sponsorships, but even Snowball could not have predicted the success of this unexpected arts link-up.\n“[In July this year] we invited 1000 Suncorp customers to a performance or a dress rehearsal of Peter Pan , and the tickets were snapped up in hours,” he says. “We could have filled [the Queensland Performing Arts Centre] over and over; I would’ve loved to have done more.\n“So next year, the Queensland Ballet will be touring eight cities of Queensland and we will be the lead sponsors of that too. We’re looking to increase our sponsorship over the next two years.\"\nAll these activations, of course, bring with them those tantalising new audiences that every arts company craves.\nLady Deborah MacMillan, the wife of the late legendary choreographer Sir Kenneth MacMillan, whose production of Romeo & Juliet the Queensland Ballet performed in Brisbane late last year to packed houses and standout reviews, says if audiences were to drop, Li would be the driving force to bring them back.\n“If the ballet audiences are turning off, I think he’s like a breath of fresh air,” she tells Luxury in London.\n“He’s got ideas steeped in the heritage of ballet, and because of his standing he is able to lure top dancers from overseas to perform with the company.”\nAs a living, breathing art form ballet will always find its audience, MacMillan says, adding that while it’s important to stay contemporary and relevant, history should never be neglected or forgotten.\n“There will always be an audience for heritage work,” she says. “It’s very important, if you’re going to be supporting an art form which has a great deal of tradition, to show the audience where things have come from.\n“If you devise good programs, if you market it well, you can explain where it all came from – out of this incredible heritage.\n“At the moment, the art form is very, very popular. Ballet in Europe, at least, seems to be booming.”\nQueensland Ballet, too, is reporting good growth. Development income grew 1270 per cent between 2010 and 2014 (audited figures for cash and in-kind) and cash income alone grew 1314 per cent between 2010 and 2014 (audited figures for cash).\nWhen Li first took on the role, he analysed subscriber numbers as being dangerously low. “It was only 1700, compared with Queensland Theatre who had over 7000; they were the leader,” he says. “We were the distant poor cousin of the arts sector.”\nAnd this year? “We have over 7300 subscribers. It’s phenomenal. We have surpassed the [Queensland] Theatre; we have become the leader now.”\nEven Li admits that as the initial rush of success came out of his high profile there was a sense of euphoria, high expectation and curiosity. So now the hard work must continue, so as to maintain the momentum.\n“I am not ashamed or afraid to state our ambition,” he says. “We made ballet interesting again. We made ballet sexy again.\n“The images we create – we spend a lot of money on our fabulous photographers. Our marketing team looks at the brand, the image. It has to be dynamic; it can’t be boring.\n“But then we combine that imagery with what we actually deliver on stage. We have to deliver. If you don’t, then you lose the audience forever – then you’re in trouble.”\nThe writer travelled to London as a guest of the Queensland Ballet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:09:31.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
