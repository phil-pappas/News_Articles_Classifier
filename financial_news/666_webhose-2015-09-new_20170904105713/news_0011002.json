The euro dipped to $1.1210, adding to an overnight loss of 0.8 percent. \nThe ebb and flow in global risk appetite, heavily influenced by Chinese economic data and its volatile stock markets, has recently influenced the greenback's day-to-day direction. \nGlobal stock indexes rose on Wednesday, helped by reports of brokerage measures in China to invigorate the country's battered markets. \nStock market gains have tended to slow unwinding of carry trades, which have benefited the safe-haven yen and low-yielding euro over recent weeks. \nChina's slowing economy and worries about global growth had prompted investors to reduce bets in the yen and the euro, both of which have been popular for funding trades involving the sale of low-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding, but riskier, assets. \nWith the Chinese markets closed for a national holiday, the focus will be on the European Central Bank policy meeting later in the session and on what its officials make of recent turmoil in financial markets. \n\"We expect a dovish message in the press conference and believe further easing is likely before year end. Such a message should support sentiment, which so far has been a drag on risky assets,\" wrote strategists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . \nThe dollar index nudged higher to touch a three-day high of 96.022. \nCrude oil prices rebounded amid the general improvement in confidence, but that proved no tonic for the Canadian dollar, which struggled on caution ahead of key July goods trade data due later in the session. \nThe indicator is being closely watched to gauge the impact of cheap oil - a key Canadian export - on exports and how much of a positive impact the weaker Canadian dollar could have had on the struggling economy. \nThe Canadian dollar stood little changed at C$1.3268 on the greenback after losing about 0.9 percent overnight. \nFellow commodity currency the Australian dollar fared better. The Aussie edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7046, putting a bit of distance between a 6-1/2-year low of $0.6982 plumbed on Wednesday following weak domestic GDP data.
