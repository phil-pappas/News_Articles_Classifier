Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) revised its price down 5p to 175p after warning that Tullow, which they believe has reached “a tipping point”, should raise fresh equity. \nBrian Gallagher, of Investec, said: “We see recapitalisation followed by an asset sale in East Africa as the only way to correct Tullow’s flagging investment case.” \nThe broker argued that Tullow needed to refocus its narrative back to exploration “as fast as it can”, as it reckons the investment case will remain impaired until its debt falls. \n“A capital injection would be the first step in this process,” Mr Gallagher added, as it would reduce near-term balance sheet risk, which has plagued the company in recent months. \nSeparately, HSBC cut its target price from 514p to 310p, owing the move to their lowered oil price assumptions , which have put Tullow’s finances under significant pressure. While the bank highlighted concerns around Tullow’s liquidity situation, analysts believe it is “manageable”. \nEarlier this year, comments by management suggested the mid-cap oil company could technically breach some of its financial covenants next year, but such concerns have since been allayed after agreements were reached with lenders. \nAs Brent crude hit $46.76 per barrel on Thursday, Tullow closed at 192.4p, down 15.3p, or 7.4pc. \nMeanwhile, BP fell 7.2p to 335.3p, Royal Dutch Shell B shares were off by 26.5p at £16.23 and Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) inched 5.6p lower to 84.7p. \nOn the broader market, Britain’s benchmark index snapped its three-day winning streak as worries over China resurfaced . Inflation data from the Far Eastern country signalled that deflation continues to be a significant risk for the world’s second largest economy, as producer prices tumbled for the 42nd consecutive month. \nMike McCudden, of Interactive Investor, said “more evidence of a weakening Asia may dissuade the Federal Reserve from being too hasty with a rate hike”. \nThe FTSE 100 , which finished 73.2 points, or 1.2pc, lower at 6,155.81, was also dragged down by the release of the latest Bank of England minutes . These suggested policymakers were little concerned about the impact the recent global market turmoil is having on Britain, making an interest rate rise more likely. \nMiners’ spell of dominance at the top of Britain’s benchmark index was shortlived, after they were hit hard by the latest set of weak Chinese data. \nInternational mining giant BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , which was also impacted by trading ex-dividend, shed 67p, or 5.9pc, to £10.60. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) lost 7.8pc to close at 132.9p, while a day after announcing the sale of its Rustenburg mine, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) slipped 3.5pc to 717p. Eugene King, of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , said “the rationale of the [Anglo] sale is that the assets are older and more manual in nature, so exiting them would simplify the platinum business”. \nMeanwhile, UK-listed banks were left with “nowhere to hide” as Exane BNP Paribas targeted lenders. The bank said share performance had been lacklustre this year, with the sector down 7pc. Analysts believe the banks face “further operational headwinds”, among them the impact of higher interest rates, which Exane said will not help banks much. \nJonathan Pierce, of Exane BNP Paribas, warned “the margin outlook appears increasingly bleak regardless of higher rates”. \nSlashing the target prices of banking stocks, Asia-exposed Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) and HSBC fell 4.1pc and 2.6pc respectively. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) slipped 1.5pc to 258.6p, and Lloyds fell 0.7pc to 76.3p. \nIn the US, the bright lights of Las Vegas proved to be the ideal backdrop for a positive update on the shape of the equipment rentals industry, catapulting Ashtead towards the top of the FTSE. \nComments made by larger US rival United Rentals (NYSE: URI - news ) during an investor presentation on Wednesday lifted shares in Ashtead 27.5p, or 2.8pc, higher to £10.18 on Thursday. \nHaving talked down activity at an industry conference just three months ago, United Rentals offered investors an upbeat outlook. The company said the energy sector stabilised in July, despite recent falls in oil prices. It also noted that the group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation had come in slightly ahead of forecasts last month. \nJustin Jordan, of Jefferies, described the update as “reassuring”, as it provided a “positive read-across to Ashtead”. \nElsewhere, it was Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) that became the darling of the FTSE 100, extending its gains from Wednesday, when it posted a 44.8pc jump in full-year pre-tax profit to £565.5m. However, Robin Hardy, of Shore Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , continued to see Barratt as “more risky than its immediate peers”. The shares leapt 21p to 659p. \nWm Morrison slumped 5p, or 2.8pc, to 170.9p after half-year profits fell 50pc and the grocer said its turnaround plan would take time. \nClive Black, of Shore Capital, said the supermarket, which has been embroiled in a price war with rivals, has much to do. “The backdrop is very difficult and there is no quick fix,” he added. \nFinally, shares in Aim-listed Blinkx (Other OTC: BLNKF - news ) fell 2pc to 24p after the hedge fund Toscafund, founded by Martin Hughes, upped its stake to 22pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:30:59.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
