Citi has already paid more than $2bn in penalties to regulators around the world over misconduct in currency trading. \nOther former Citi staff members are due to appear as witnesses for Mr Stimpson on Monday, raising the prospect of further potentially embarrassing testimony about how the bank operated. \nAlthough Mr Stimpson, who is representing himself, was not one of the more high-profile dismissals, his is the first of several scheduled tribunals into the matter, making it potentially a test case. He began testifying on his own behalf at the east London Employment tribunal on Thursday. \nCitigroup said in a statement that the allegations made by Mr Stimpson about other bank employees were “baseless.” In a statement, the bank said he was “making these allegations to deflect attention from his own misconduct.” \nThe bank said in court that Mr Stimpson was fired for gross misconduct after appearing to share client information with traders at other banks on at least 12 occasions. \nBut Mr Stimpson said that kind of behaviour was business as usual. \nHe said in his witness statement that the bank shared information about central bank activity in the currencies market with another client on a weekly basis. Another common practice was to “cut and paste details of Citibank’s order book” on to Bloomberg chats at the request of customers, he claimed. \nMr Stimpson also alleged that Citi made millions of dollars by jumping into a currencies trade ahead of a client for whom the bank was arranging a merger transaction in 2010 — a practice known as front running which is in contravention of the bank’s code of conduct. \nHe alleged in his witness statement that his senior manager at the time, Jeff Feig and Anil Prasad, had decided this deal was “too large” for the usual trading desk to handle, and took control of the trade themselves, “netting $35m out of the deal”. On another occasion, Mr Prasad also asked the bank’s trading desk to find out whether one if its customers had done a trade with another bank — a process that would necessitate talking about clients with other traders, Mr Stimpson said in his witness statement. \n“If you see your senior management do something it implies to you that’s OK,” he said in reply to questions about the sharing of information by traders about central banks. \nThe tribunal continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:45:30.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
