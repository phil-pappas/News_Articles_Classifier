If the Fed does vote to raise rates, it will be the first increase since 2006 and could spark Treasury selling, particularly in the short-term maturities, which would drive yields higher, strategists said. Treasury yields rise when prices fall and vice versa.\nOn Monday, yields moved lower for a second straight trading session, with the 10-year yield posting its largest two-day yield decline since Sept. 4, reflecting declining expectations that the Fed might vote to raise interest rates on Thursday.\nThe market has priced a less than 25% probability of a rate-hike in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool , which tracks Fed-funds futures prices.\nData that showed Sunday that China’s factory output and fixed-asset investment were both weaker than expected in August, also drove investors to U.S. Treasurys, pushing Treasury prices higher and yields lower.\nThe Fed has come to a fork in the road and could decide to head in either direction, which practically means that Treasury investors should brace for a spike in volatility this week, analysts said.\n“The logic on both sides of this argument is compelling and the potential for volatility from Thursday’s decision is significant enough to make it one of the most anticipated Fed meetings in recent memory,” Ian Lyngen, senior rates strategist at CRT Capital Group, said in a note.\n“In the event of a hike we expect the accompanying statement will be especially dovish as the Fed emphasizes the ‘one-and-done’ nature of the move,” Lyngen added.\nAside from the Fed meeting, the data calendar will be busy, featuring the closely watched consumer-price index report, expected on Wednesday.\nFed policy makers have taken a so-called data-driven approach to lifting rates, focusing on evidence of strong employment and signs that inflation is rising toward its 2% annual target.\nIn this context, “reaction to Wednesday’s CPI report could be volatile should we get an upside surprise ahead of the Fed,” Chris Bury, head of U.S. rates sales & trading at Jefferies, said in a note. The volatility risk is even higher as “due to gasoline price distortions in the Midwest there’s a wider dispersion to this month’s [CPI] estimates.”\nOn balance, the yield on the 10-year benchmark Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.16% inched 0.2 basis point lower to 2.181%, according to Tradeweb data. Meanwhile, the yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.03% inched higher by 0.2 basis point to 0.729% and the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.34% moved 0.4 basis point higher to 2.933%. 2.948%\nMeanwhile in Europe, government bond yields also inched lower, as investors bought bonds, which are considered safe investments, while stock prices fell . The yield on the benchmark 10-year German bond TMBMKDE-10Y, +0.44% known as the bund, fell by 1.4 basis point to 0.640%.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T04:38:31.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
