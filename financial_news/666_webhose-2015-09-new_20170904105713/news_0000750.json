Photo: Ross Swanborough\nCash Converters chief Peter Cumins has welcomed the potential exit of rivals from the controversial payday lending sector, saying he is proud of his business, which has done nothing illegal.\nAlong with Money3, which looks set to exit the sector, the $214 million Cash Converters is one of the payday lenders implicated in a damning report from the corporate watchdog in March that found multiple breaches of responsible lending obligations.\nThe sector has also been plagued by a Four Corners report, which included an interview with an anonymous borrower who said he got a loan from Cash Converters to buy drugs. But Mr Cumins said the company continues to act within the law.\n\"We wrote over 800,000 loans in the 2015 financial year and we had 34 complaints only with our external dispute resolution company,\" he said. \"That demonstrates that our customers don't have a problem with the product and the company.\"\nAdvertisement Mr Cumins claimed all loans are technically payday loans because repayments are \"aligned to their income\".\n\"We are a licensed credit provider, providing products under the small amount credit contract legislation. Why should we change our business model when we are operating within the rules and regulations that the Act provides?\"\nWestpac backs out On August 5 Westpac told Cash Converters it was pulling its decade-long relationship, which included acting as its transaction bank and loan securitisation vehicle, with about $59 million drawn on its existing facility. The company has until March, when the existing facility expires, to find a new lender and transaction bank.\nWestpac also ceased support for other \"small amount credit contracts\" and \"short-term credit contracts\", as payday loans are defined in legislation, including Cash Converters' main listed competitor Money3.\nMr Cumins believes Westpac has caved into bad publicity. \"It was a surprise to us. We had a very long and successful relationship with Westpac,\" he said. \"I think this decision seemed to have come about after some negative publicity, which I personally believe is unwarranted.\"\nMoney3 acting chief executive Scott Baldwin also believes Westpac's decision is a reaction to public perception rather than reality, claiming only a small proportion of the loans its Westpac facility is supporting are \"small-amount, short-term\" loans. He said the Westpac facility was primarily securitising car loans. Nonetheless, on August 10 the company said it was moving away from SACCs.\nMr Cumins said his advisers are looking for a new funder and a new transaction bank. \"We are hoping to resolve both of those issues well before November.\" He said Cash Converters already has a relationship with FIIG Securities and tapping fixed income investors via FIIG is one of the possible sources.\nHe said it could use \"third-party suppliers\" for transactions if a bank would not support them.\n$60m bond FIIG arranged a $60 million, five-year bond for Cash Converters in September 2013 at a rate of 7.95 per cent. Investors who loaned to Cash Converters are self managed super funds.\nOn Friday, Cash Converters announced a 13 per cent rise in revenue to $374.9 million in 2014-15, while underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 12.2 per cent to $62.7 million. But its statutory results plummeted more than 81 per cent to EBITDA of $9.3 million due to $23 million settlement of a class action and the early termination of a contract which cost it $29 million.\nIt made a net loss of $21.4 million, down 188 per cent from a profit in 2014 of $24 million.\nMr Cumins said Money3's exit would benefit his business.\n\"Money3 have said we're pulling out of the small amount credit contract space. We're not. If [all our competitors] do a Money3, that from our point of view is not a bad thing.\"\nThis was in part due to a $7.6 million impairment booked against its UK business, which lost $9 million due to new laws there that cap fees lenders can charge borrowers. He said it expects better results in 2016 in the UK due to costs cuts and the closure of numerous competitors since the new laws came in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:06:50.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
