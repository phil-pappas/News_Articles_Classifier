Democratic contender Hillary Clinton is also visiting and due to make an appearance in San Juan on Friday.\nWhile Puerto Rico's residents will not be eligible to cast presidential votes in November 2016, they have a voice in the primaries and, as the island's economy has suffered, an increasing number have moved to U.S. states, where they can vote. Nearly 1 million Puerto Ricans live in battleground-state Florida.\n\"I believe the Puerto Rico government has the ability to solve its own issues,\" Rubio, a Cuban-American, said in Spanish. \"What you need is new political leadership that has the courage and willingness to do the right and needed reforms.\"\nPuerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that the U.S. territory could not afford to pay its debts, totaling $72 billion. At the same time, he called for the commonwealth to be allowed to restructure its debts under the U.S. bankruptcy code.\nBills proposing that Puerto Rican municipalities be allowed to reorganize debts under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code have been introduced in the House and Senate but the idea has not gathered enough Republican support to advance.\nIn an opinion piece published earlier on Friday, Rubio said giving Puerto Rico access to U.S. bankruptcy laws would not solve the U.S. territory's problems and \"should only be a measure of last resort.\"\n\"I'm not saying that if at the end of the day (if Chapter 9) is the only option, we shouldn't evaluate it,\" said Rubio. \"But I don't think it would solve the fundamental problems that the island faces.\"\nRubio's position on Chapter 9 puts him at odds with Clinton, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican, and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, who have expressed support for allowing the island to gain access to the process.\nRubio took an opportunity to sideswipe Clinton, saying her plan for the island must have been \"on her server and it was wiped clean,\" a seeming reference to an email controversy that is plaguing her presidential bid.\nRubio also said Puerto Rico should have a federally sponsored vote on the island over the issue of statehood and that if a majority voted yes, Congress and the next president should admit them as a state.\n\"I believe Marco Rubio has given a clear explanation of how Puerto Rico should act to improve its relationship with the U.S.,\" said Jorge del Rio, a Puerto Rican who attended the event. \"He is clear on how we should solve our problem, and how Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans should decide through a yes or no status.\"\nClinton, who won the most Democratic delegates in Puerto Rico during her failed 2008 presidential bid, is to discuss the \"unequal treatment\" of the territory by U.S. healthcare policies, according to her campaign.\n(Reporting by a contributor in Puerto Rico; additional reporting by Amanda Becker and Megan Davies; writing by Megan Davies; Editing by Richard Chang , Toni Reinhold )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T00:48:04.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
