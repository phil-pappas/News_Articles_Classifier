The concept of what is right and wrong will take us very far,\" Mr. Kachikwu stressed. \nMr. Kachikwu said the corporation would urgently embark on a transparency operation to regain its lost credibility. The GMD noted that the transparency operation would start with an audit of the corporation's finances, which was last audited in 2010â€Ž. \nHe said the corporation's finance would not only be audited and brought up to date, but would also be made available to the general public. \nThe NNPC GMD said the transparency operation would also involve posting of the corporation's activities on its website regularly. \nHe added that along with the regular data, there would also be a weekly broadcast of issues concerning the corporation on its website from now henceforth. \nAccording to him, though, there are huge challenges in driving the corporation forward but they would be surmounted with good planning and efficiency. \nThe NNPC GMD said the challenge of cleaning NNPC would be a bumpy, exciting ride, which would eventually yield positive results. \nCommenting on the state of the nation's refineries, he said they were currently working at 30 percent capacity, which was unprofitable. \nMr. Kachikwu noted that for the refineries to be profitable, they needed to attain a minimum of 60 percent operation capacity. \n\"Personally, I would have chosen to sell the refineries, but President Buhari has instructed that they should be fixed. \n\"After they are fixed, if they still operate below 60 per cent, then we will know what to do. \n\"The 90-day ultimatum for the refineries to be fixed will end in December and Port Harcourt Refinery looks like the only one that will meet the deadline, but we will wait and see what happens at the end of the 90 days,\" he said. \nNAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T11:33:50.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
