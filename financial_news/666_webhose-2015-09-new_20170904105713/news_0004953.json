Combined with Worldpay’s global reach and capability this creates significant opportunities to continue to grow our business,\" he said. \nThis month, Sir Mike Rake, the City grandee, took over as Worldpay's chairman from John Allan, the new chairman of Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) . \nThe looming change of ownership - whether through a sale or flotation - comes roughly five years after Worldpay was sold by the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) (RBS) in a deal worth approximately £2bn.‎ \nThe payments group has grown at a spectacular rate since then, with Mr Jansen, a former executive with the catering group Sodexo and MyTravel, the tour operator, spearheading the company's growth. \nSpecialising in the provision of secure payment services, its major corporate customers include Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) and Sony (Hanover: SON1.HA - news ) . \nComparable listed companies such as Wirecard (Xetra: 747206 - news ) , which has also shown interest in acquiring Worldpay, and Brazil’s Cielo (Sao Paolo: CIEL3.SA - news ) usually trade at valuations worth between 14 and 20 times their annual profits. \nWith Worldpay expected to record around £400m of pre-tax profit in 2015, a similar valuation range would attribute a price tag of between £5.6bn and £8bn to the company. \nIn the UK, Worldpay combines the former Streamline business with Cardsave, YESpay and Zinc, handling well over half of all card transactions. \nThe company sees further growth opportunities in the ongoing push to open up payment systems, with a new regulator recently assuming oversight of the industry in the UK. \nIngenico could not be reached for comment while Worldpay declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T14:59:28.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
