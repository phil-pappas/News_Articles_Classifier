Here’s what happened:When the commodity fell below $39 each barrel for the first time in more than six years early last week, the markets predicted a further slide. All the short sellers waited for the right moment to book profits. And then, from out of the blue, crude climbed more than 27% in the last three sessions, marking the largest winning streak in the last 25 years.The sudden spike points to some momentum in the commodity. So investors can try out a short-term play using a momentum strategy to add substantial returns to their portfolio. As a caveat, this is a purely speculative strategy and strictly not meant for the risk-averse players. After all, life is all about taking chances. Isn’t it? Momentum Looks Real The market got habituated to trickling crude prices for more than one year. When crude dipped below the $40-per-barrel mark last week, the commodity had witnessed an over 60% fall from mid 2014 when oil was trading above $100 each barrel that time. This was owing to plentiful supply of the commodity following the shale revolution, as U.S. shale producers went on a production spree by using fracking and horizontal drilling techniques. Moreover, the slowdown in the Chinese economy was also responsible for the crude freefall as the country is the second-largest consumer of the commodity in the world.In spite of the prolonged fall, WTI crude seems to have clung to its new-found momentum. The commodity surged more than 8% yesterday to close at $49.20 a barrel, the highest mark in the last six weeks. Following yesterday’s gain, crude surged more than 27% in the last three sessions.Let’s find the reasons for this sudden outperformance by the commodity when most of the analysts were expecting its price to go further down. To some extent we can say that the news of less oil pumped out in the U.S – as per Energy Information Administration (EIA) – along with the speculation that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) might consider an output cut helped crude to gain this momentum. Less Production in the U.S.: In June, total pumped out crude in the U.S. was 9.3 million barrels of oil per day, which is roughly 100,000 barrels a day lower than what was estimated previously. On top that, June output was less than the prior month’s production.Lower utilization of rigs for drilling activities amid an unfavorable business scenario led to lower production. This is evident from Baker Hughes’ report which indicated that since last October, the total number of drilling rigs in the U.S. is down 58%. OPEC’s Expected Production Cut: A recent OPEC statement indicated that the organization is ready to call a meeting wherein the oil producing countries can hear each other out. This might be an indication that OPEC is considering a production cut amid plentiful supply of the commodity. Going Deep into the Analysis Of course news of lower U.S. production and OPEC’s expected production cut spread positive vibes. But what added momentum to crude is the story of short covering. By definition, short covering indicates the purchase of commodities which have already been sold short. This is usually done when prices witness an upward movement. Here, the short sellers were expecting crude price to fall and were eagerly waiting for the right moment to make profits. But all of a sudden oil started rising. Hence, to arrest losses the short sellers were forced to book profits by buying the commodity. As more short sellers booked profits, oil price surged more than 27% in the last three sessions.However, we need to mention that although crude price surged, the commodity’s price is still low. Crude closed at $49.20 per barrel yesterday, which is now more than 50% below the mid-2014 level. Refiners are still able to purchase crude at low costs to create refined petroleum products like gasoline, used as fuel for internal-combustion engines. Moreover, the news of oil price rise is good for oil drillers as their expected rig demand is positively correlated with crude prices. To say it in another way, the higher the price of oil, the more will exploration and production activities take place. Not only will step-up in activities bode well for the industry, these will automatically translate into greater rig demand. Energy investors stand to gain from both. 4 Momentum Picks The basic fundamental driving a momentum trader is an investing strategy that seeks to capitalize on market volatility.
