In government, it plans a sweeping review of the Investment Canada Act legislation and would clarify what type of benefit Canada expects. \n\"You can't just make up the rules as you go along,\" Nash said in an interview. \nTakeover rules under an NDP government would reflect reciprocity - that Canadians must be allowed to invest in the country of any foreign company that buys a Canadian firm - Nash said. \nCanada has sometimes allowed takeovers after receiving assurances about jobs. Such promises typically stay between Ottawa and the company. \nThis was the case when U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Steel Corp bought Canada's Stelco in 2007. But it failed to meet those commitments after the financial crisis, and later put the unit into bankruptcy protection. \nThe NDP would make commitments more transparent, possibly involving local governments, Nash said.
