It is not just the U.S. central bank..., it is wearing the mantle of the global central bank, and markets are struggling with that.\" \nInvestors should get a good explanation this week as to exactly why the Fed didn't raise rates with its chair Janet Yellen among a host of other officials due to speak. \nOn top of that there will be closely watched economic data from both China and Europe which should give a clear picture where the global economy is heading. \nDOLLAR HOVERS \nChina was the sole Asian market to defy the region's downtrend on Monday, with the Shanghai Composite index up 1.9 percent and the CSI300 rising 1.75 percent. \nChinese Vice Finance Minister Shi Yaobin said the recent market volatility in the country was a short-term issue and that it could maintain a healthy economic growth rate going forward. \nA Reuters poll shows economists expect this week's 'flash' September China factory PMI reading to edge up to 47.5 from 47.3 in August. That would keep it near 6/1-2-year lows, however, and mark the seventh straight monthly contraction in activity. \nIn the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which fell after last Thursday's Fed decision, rose 0.3 percent to 95.365, although the U.S. currency was slipping fractionally against the yen and euro in European trading. \nThe broader rise was helped as U.S. government bond yields began to tick back up again, having fallen post the Fed meeting. \nIn Europe, German Bund yields were dragged up in the U.S. slipstream as France's rating downgrade by Moody's on Friday added to the pressure on its bonds. \nIn contrast, Portuguese bond yields fell after Standard & Poor's lifted its rating, while periphery markets in general got a boost from Syriza's election win in Greece that reassured investors the country's bailout will go ahead.. \n\"We will continue negotiations in the coming period, with the debt issue being the first and most important battle,\" a senior Syriza source told Reuters. \"We will ask all political forces to support our efforts.\" \n(Additional reporting By Nichola Saminather in Singapore; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:28:18.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
