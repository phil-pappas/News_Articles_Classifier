Answer top 7 questions here Katy Perry got groped by fan in Rio Google on Tuesday celebrated NASA’s confirmation about the presence of liquid water on planet Mars with a doodle.\n“We felt compelled to honor such an exciting discovery with a Doodle, and staring at satellite images of Mars for inspiration made us really, really thirsty,” says Google after NASA’s declaration of having found evidence of liquid water on the red planet.\nOn Monday, scientists analyzing data from a NASA spacecraft said that briny water flows during the summer months on Mars, raising the possibility that the planet long thought to be arid could support life today.\nAlthough the source and the chemistry of the water is unknown, the discovery will change scientists’ thinking about whether the planet that is most like Earth in the solar system hosts microbial life beneath its radiation-blasted crust.\n“It suggests that it would be possible for life to be on Mars today,” John Grunsfeld, NASA’s associate administrator for science, told reporters, discussing the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n“Mars is not the dry, arid planet that we thought of in the past. Under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars,” said Jim Green, the agency’s director of planetary science.\nBut NASA will not be rushing out to search the newly discovered saltwater residue for life just yet.\n(With inputs from Agencies)\n 29, 2015 9:13 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:21:06.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
