After all, retirees largely live on their retirement assets, and to see the U.S. stock market lose almost 10% of its value has to be disconcerting for Americans in their post-career years. \"Volatility can be emotional and come with real challenges for retirees,\" notes John Sweeney, executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies at Fidelity. \"The key is to prepare your income strategy, and, if necessary, revisit your withdrawal plan and/or adapt your spending.\" Noting that stock market volatility is historically a normal component to investing, investment professionals say the best move for retirees anxious about their retirement savings is to be forward thinking and have a strong retirement plan in place that can withstand negative market performance. Having a little patience goes a long way, too. \"Uncertainty is a defining characteristic in the stock market; just because it's down one day does not mean it'll be the same way the next day or even minute,\" says Liz Miller, president of New York City-based Summit Place Financial Advisors. Miller says that investing in the stock market is a long-term strategy to grow your savings and fund long-term goals. \"There is risk in any market investment, and you can always lose money,\" she says. \"However, overall market gyrations are not usually the reason investors lose money in the long-term. If you stick to a thoughtful disciplined investment strategy throughout turbulent times, your investments can still reach all your goals if you have a long enough time on the horizon.\" To help get you through periods of market volatility, Miller advises reviewing your market history, focusing on long-term investment fundamentals and taking advantage of potential opportunities to buy good stocks at a relatively low price. \"Do nothing and let your investments ride out, and even purchase more of a company you've been interested in while the price is low,\" Miller says. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:08:27.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
