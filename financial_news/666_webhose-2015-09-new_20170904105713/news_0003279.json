Bloomberg by James Eyers Investment managers will be able to sell funds directly to the world's biggest savers – the Japanese – and may face more competition from Japan's financial institutions seeking to expand in the region, after Japan agreed to join the Asia Region Funds Passport, which will liberalise trade in investment funds from next year.\nThe surprise decision by Japan to sign up to the APEC-led initiative reflects recent efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to mobilise capital by encouraging Japanese investors to chase yield abroad in order to improve returns after more than 20 years of deflation, which has stunted economic growth.\nJapanese households hold around $US14 trillion ($19.8 trillion) in financial assets, half of which is held in cash and deposits. Senior fund managers say the agreement will lead to alliances between Australian and Japanese institutions to create distribution networks for products, similar to the one Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group struck with AMP Capital in 2011 that has led its bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of AMP products to Japanese households.\nThe statement of understanding on the Asia Region Funds Passport was signed on Friday afternoon at the APEC finance ministers' meeting in Cebu, the Philippines, between Australia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand. Singapore is considering whether to join the regime, and is part of a similar scheme that has been established by ASEAN.\nBoth the passport and the ASEAN scheme are a response to the dominance of European Union-domiciled funds in Asia, which has allowed fund managers in Europe to profit from managing Asian pools of capital.\nThe passport could exceed $600 billion of funds under administration by 2030 – around 11 per cent of the Asian mutual funds market, according to a report last month by AT Kearney, assuming it captured just 2 per cent to 4 per cent of funds managed by EU funds.\nAPEC said in June that when the passport is operating, it could save Asian investors an annual $US20 billion in fund management fees, provide higher investment returns and create 170,000 jobs in APEC economies within five years.\nThe signing of Japan and Korea follows a trip by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to Tokyo and Seoul in June, which was arranged by the Financial Services Council (FSC) and Austrade.\n Public-private collaboration Perpetual chief executive Geoff Lloyd, who was on the delegation, said getting Japan and Korea over the line on the passport \"is a great example of industry working with government on something beyond politics which will help economic growth of our country over time\".\n\"In a low-return, low-interest rate, high-volatility environment, this is another step forward for financial services to become an exporter of skills and products which can help drive economic growth after the mining boom. The Japanese market is thirsty for yield,\" he said.\nJust 4 per cent of funds under management in Australia are sourced from offshore, compared to 65 per cent in Hong Kong and 80 per cent in Singapore. If Australia increased its offshore funds under management to Hong Kong's levels, GDP would increase by $4.2 billion by 2029 and 10,000 new jobs would be created, according to the FSC.\n\"Japan's involvement alongside Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and New Zealand will super-charge the Asia Region Funds Passport and ensure it is off to a strong start,\" Mr Frydenberg told Fairfax Media. \"The passport comes on the back of significant free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea and will help create thousands of jobs in Australia.\"\nThe government's decision to pause superannuation contributions at 9.5 per cent and delay the increase to 12 per cent for seven years has prompted fund managers to accelerate their thinking on tapping pools of capital among the burgeoning middle class in Asia as a source of growth.\nMacquarie Capital, AMP Capital, First State Investments and IFM Investors have a presence in the Japanese market, targeting both institutions and retail investors, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and ANZ Banking Group have offices in Tokyo.\n'Competition welcome' Sam Hallinan​, the managing director of Nikko Asset Management in Australia, said he expected more Australian firms to partner with Japanese institutions. \"Success now will only come about from Australian firms committing to the region, building up market insights and distribution sales resources. As always, you can only ever expect to win if you provide the right products to the right client segments at the right price. And you can't do this with confidence unless you are there on the ground,\" he said.\nWith the Australian dollar falling against the Japanese yen, Japan's financial institutions – which are undergoing a structural revolution alongside the reforms of Mr Abe, known as Abenomics – may also be attracted to the Australian market. Korean institutions are also expected to explore opportunities in Australia.\nBT Investment Management chief executive, Emilio Gonzalez, said any competition was welcome. \"We can't encourage others to open their markets and not open ours,\" he said. \"We have very strong businesses and should be confident to accept competition and open markets – at the end of the day, it will provide better choice for customers, competition on fees and greater flow of capital. Through history, these are the dynamics that have allowed industry to grow.\"\nMr Lloyd agreed. \"The passport is a two-way street that allows local, home-grown manufacturers to step up and export and provides international providers with a better path to Australian clients, who are winners along with the economy,\" he said.\nMr Gonzales and Mr Lloyd both recognise there is work still to be done to bed down the details of the scheme, and recognise the Japanese market presents strategic difficulties, including the low asset allocation into equities.\nOther APEC countries are expected to join the passport; it is understood developments are being closely watched by the United States and Canada.\nThe passport members are currently working on harmonising aspects of the region's tax regimes to ensure the passport is competitive against the EU's investment structures, known as UCITS. A memorandum of co-operation is expected to be signed by participating securities regulators by the end of the year, with the passport due to be up and running sometime in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:07:06.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
