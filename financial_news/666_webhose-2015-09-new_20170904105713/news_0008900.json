That equates at an enterprise value of about A$2.5 billion, including debt of A$197 million, or about 17 times Veda's Ebitda of A$144.5 million for the year ended June.\n\"The proposal is financially compelling, and creates considerable value for the shareholders of Veda,\" Equifax said. \"There is no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be agreed or as to the terms which such a transaction, if any, might occur.\"\nA deal would be Equifax's largest acquisition, topping its $1 billion deal for CSC Credit Services in 2012. It would also give Equifax a dominant position in a growing market where it has no significant operations. Financial data checking is expanding in Australia, driven in part by new legislation to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nMust Read: 5 Big Stocks to Trade for Big Gains\nThe bid comes at an opportune time. The value of the Australian dollar has tumbled 20% against the greenback in the past year as demand for Australian resources, particularly from China, has declined, while Veda's share price has fallen 18% since the start of August.\nSydney-based Veda tracks the credit information of about 20 million people and 5.7 million companies, principally in Australia and New Zealand. The company's fiscal 2015 Ebitda of A$144.5 million was up 12% year-on-year. Revenue also rose 12% year-on-year to A$338.8 million.\nVeda said that it was evaluating the bid and noted that the offer was subject to a number of conditions including \"due diligence and regulatory approval.\" The offer will need the approval of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board.\nVeda made its debut on the Australian market in December when private equity backers Pacific Equity Partners and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity floated it at A$1.25 per share, or A$1.05 billion.\nA takeover by the larger Equifax could provide a spur to consolidation in Australia's financial data analytics sector. Veda CEO Nerida Caesar had touted the company's scope for external growth at the time of its IPO, claiming that there were plenty of acquisition opportunities.\nVeda shares closed Friday at A$2.62, up A$0.625, or 31%, on their Thursday close. Equifax shares closed Thursday at $98.36, equating to a market capitalization of $11.73 billion.\n:", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13293443/1/equifax-eyes-expansion-into-australia-new-zealand-with-16b-veda-bid.html&title=Equifax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13293443/1/equifax-eyes-expansion-into-australia-new-zealand-with-16b-veda-bid.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13293443/1/equifax-eyes-expansion-into-australia-new-zealand-with-16b-veda-bid.html&text=Equifax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13293443/1/equifax-eyes-expansion-into-australia-new-zealand-with-16b-veda-bid.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13293443/1/equifax-eyes-expansion-into-australia-new-zealand-with-16b-veda-bid.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:52:25.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
