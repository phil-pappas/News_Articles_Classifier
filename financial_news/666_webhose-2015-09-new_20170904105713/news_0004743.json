More \nThe City University school believes those investment risks — such as having more equities in a portfolio compared to bonds — have to be considered when assessing whether companies can meet final salary pension promises. \nIt has called on regulators to look at accounting standards for defined benefit schemes. \nCompanies generally use AA rated long-term corporate bonds yields to value pension liabilities. But Cass said using this single yardstick is misleading. It wants liabilities and investments to be calculated simultaneously. \n“Our approach brings significant advantages to all pension plan stakeholders compared with current practice,” said David Blake, director of the pensions institute at Cass. “Staff taking out pensions will have a clearer picture of the true value of their pension promise,” he said. \nShareholders, said Mr Blake, would also be able to value companies more accurately. \nTo illustrate, Cass examined the position of General Motors , the US car manufacturer, in December 2002. GM’s share price had dropped by half over the previous three years, and its pension plan was in distress after a period of falling stock markets and interest rates. \nCass concluded GM employees should have been told to expect a 15 to 20 per cent drop in pension payouts as the true position of the pension fund was far weaker than reported.
