Once this process is complete, Oaktree will exchange its debt claim for a majority stake in a reorganised Quiksilver. \nWhile the move still requires final approval, on an interim basis Quiksilver, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for its US subsidiaries on Wednesday (9 September), will get immediate access to $115m. \n“We are grateful that the court was able to consider these motions promptly, and the relief granted ensures we will be able to continue to operate in ordinary course and deliver on our commitment to providing customers the same great experience with our brands and products they have come to expect,” said Quiksilver CEO Pierre Agnes. \n“We look forward to implementing our restructuring plan in the US to strengthen the business and we will emerge a stronger business, better positioned to grow and prosper into the future.” \nThe retailer’s European and Asia-Pacific businesses and operations are not part of the filing. A majority of the company’s European bondholders also agreed that the US filing would not affect their debt obligations. \nQuiksilver also emphasised it will continue to conduct business and serve its wholesale and retail customers during the restructuring process, and that its full line of Quiksilver, Roxy and DC products will remain available in its stores and online. \nThe company unveiled a multi-year plan in early 2013 to try and return to profit by focusing on its three core brands, globalising key functions and reducing costs - but has continued to report losses and falling sales. \nIn March, Quiksilver replaced its CEO Andy Mooney with Pierre Agnes; Greg Healy was promoted to president, and Bob McKnight appointed chairman. And in June, it said second-quarter net loss narrowed to US$37.6m from $53.1m, while sales dropped 16.1% to $333m, and gross margin fell to 47.1% from 48.9%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:13:18.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
