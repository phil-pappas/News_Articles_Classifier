PUBLISHED: 13:44, Mon, Sep 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:17, Mon, Sep 21, 2015 GETTY A firm in Suffolk was tricked into downloading software that allowed criminals to access their cash \nBusiness owners are being warned about the phone banking scams and the methods used to net cash, which have so far largely targeted the elderly and vulnerable to hand over their life savings. \nPretending to call from the firm's bank, the conman persuaded the business there was a virus on its internet banking and cash should be transferred into a separate holding account. \nA member of staff at the firm in Suffolk was then told to download remote access software that gave the criminal the ability to transfer money in and out of accounts. \nThe criminals had been able to disguise their own phone number to show the number of the bank's fraud team, which was on their website. \nWhen the cash disappeared, the business phoned the police. \nSuffolk Police said the firm has been \"understandably distressed\". \nSuffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore said: \"I'm absolutely flabbergasted about the audacity of these criminals. \n\"I can fully understand how this crime took place and the damage to this company is potentially huge and it stands as a salient reminder that businesses too are victims of crime.\" \nHe added that the crime is \"perhaps the biggest threat society faced\". \nIt comes after Financial Fraud Action revealed in June the telephone banking scams in the UK had conned £23.6million out of victims last year. \nFraudsters are using increasingly sophisticated means to try to pose as customer banks. \nEarlier this month Express.co.uk revealed how criminals are now posing as banks' support desk on Twitter in an effort to dupe people out of personal information that can be used todefraud them. \nBanks or police will never ask you to transfer or handover sums of money or reveal details of bank accounts, PINs or personal information. \nA statement from Suffolk Police advised: \"If you receive contact from an unknown caller stop and think for a moment. \n\"Be suspicious particularly if they are telling you something is wrong or that you need to send or handover money. \n\"Don’t be afraid to hang up on unknown callers.\" \nAnyone who has concerns regarding this type of incident should contact the police or Action Fraud through the National Fraud Reporting centre on 0300 123 2040.
