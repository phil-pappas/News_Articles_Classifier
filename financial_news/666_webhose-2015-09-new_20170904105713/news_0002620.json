The plan now goes to the New Hampshire House. \nThe bill passed after brief debate during which members of both parties praised the body for coming together on the deal. Democratic and Republican leaders say the deal is positive for the people of New Hampshire and is the product of a hard-fought compromise. \nThe bill is likely to face some opposition in the House. \n1:30 p.m. \nNew Hampshire lawmakers are preparing to vote on a compromise budget deal and a host of other bills vetoed by Gov. Maggie Hassan. \nThe deal begins in the Senate and will then move onto the House, where a number of Republicans are trying to thwart its passage. If it passes both chambers, Hassan will then ask Democrats to join Republicans in overriding her budget veto so the spending plan can take effect. \nThe deal comes three months after Hassan vetoed the Legislature's $11.3 billion spending plan, largely over business tax cuts. The tax cuts are included in the final deal, but are contingent in part upon state revenues hitting a certain target. The deal also includes a pay raise for state employees that lawmakers removed from Hassan's initial budget proposal. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T21:13:49.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
