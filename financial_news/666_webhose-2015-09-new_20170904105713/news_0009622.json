Mr. Boakye believes the certification scheme will enhance competition and afford artisans the opportunity to bid for contracts.\n“Once they have certificates to show that they’ve gone through proper training and they are well skilled, it will even make it easier for them to get contracts,” he noted. \nMr. Boakye also says there is an opportunity for youth, especially JHS and SHS levers, to be gainfully employment in the wood sector. \nHe observed that “most of the people in the carpentry are growing old; we have ageing workforce [because] it is not something that is attractive to the youth but it is a very good work”. In addition to the training, the FCTC (formerly the Wood Industries Training Centre) is also committing to support the apprentices in accessing wood for their start-ups.\nMeanwhile, the Woodworkers Association of Ghana is hoping the Forestry Commission will grant the group a land concession to venture into tree plantation. \nPresident of the Association, Reynolds Debrah, is hopeful afforestation project will keep woodworkers in business. \nStory by Kofi Adu Domfeh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T09:32:51.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
