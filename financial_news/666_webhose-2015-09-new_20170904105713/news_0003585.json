Share on twitter by Perry Williams Oil Search will reject a demand by suitor Woodside Petroleum to hold exclusive talks as part of its $11.6 billion takeover offer paving the way for oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation to emerge as a rival bidder.\nWoodside's approach featured a set of conditions including a satisfactory due diligence process and a request that Oil Search grant its energy rival an agreed period of exclusivity.\nHowever, sources close to the talks told Fairfax Media it would be foolish for the Oil Search board to agree to the condition given it could discourage the emergence of a takeover battle.\nExxonMobil – the operator and largest shareholder in Oil Search's Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project – is thought to have held an informal meeting with Oil Search chief executive Peter Botten​ in PNG on Tuesday where the deal was discussed.\n\"It is a matter for the board to consider but they are highly unlikely to give exclusivity given the belief in the market the all-share bid undervalues the company,\" said a source close to negotiations. \"You would also expect Exxon to be taking a very close look at the proposal, both from the perspective of whether Woodside would make a good partner in PNG LNG but also whether it considers a counter offer.\"\nWoodside wrote to the company on Friday with an offer of one Woodside share for four Oil Search shares, implying an offer price of $7.65 a share or a 13 per cent premium.\nHowever, Oil Search's board, which is expected to meet by the end of this week, is tipped to push for a much higher offer closer to a 25 per cent to 30 per cent premium.\nTie-up The role of Exxon in any potential tie-up between the two companies is expected to be discussed at a meeting scheduled for this Sunday in Sydney between Woodside chief executive Peter Coleman and Mr Botten.\nMr Coleman knows Exxon better than most in the industry. He worked for the world's largest energy company for more than 25 years, which included a two-year stint from 2010 as vice president of Exxon's PNG development company.\nBut he may find his former employer a more hostile prospect when he visits PNG next week to make his pitch for the deal.\nMr Coleman is also expected to meet PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill​ during his visit given the government holds a coveted 10 per cent stake in Oil Search and is not previously thought to have been open to the idea of selling.\nThe PNG government paid $8.20 a share for its stake and is expected to be reluctant to accept Woodside's $7.65 a share offer.\nThe Woodside boss is also likely to hold informal talks with Exxon.\nMacquarie argues that Exxon, as operator of PNG LNG, is unlikely to make any due diligence process easy for Woodside given sensitivities around early work it is performing on the P'nyang and Elk-Antelope gas fields.\n\"Appraisal programs to underpin resource positions are either in train or yet to commence, making any due diligence surrounding growth assets challenging at this early stage,\" Macquarie said in a research note. \"Therefore we see this due diligence as a key risk to a transaction proceeding.\"\nExxonMobil's board, including chief executive Rex Tillerson​, visited PNG in late June and is understood to have held talks with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill about the expansion of PNG LNG.\nUpward revisions Analysts point out the Texas-based company holds $US4.4 billion of cash and a market valuation of $310 billion compared with Woodside's $25 billion value.\n\"We expect upward revisions to this Woodside offer and counter bids possibly from ExxonMobil who would be the most likely competitor,\" Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge said.\nDeutsche Bank analyst John Hirjee also argues Exxon's US dollar funding sources place it at a competitive advantage over Woodside's Australian dollar dominated shares given the Australian dollar has declined by 25 per cent over the last 12 months.\nAn ExxonMobil spokeswoman said on Wednesday it does not comment on commercial matters.\nMr Coleman said it is eager to engage with Oil Search on its proposal which it said will deliver \"significant benefits\" to all shareholders.\n\"Our proposal will create the regional oil and gas champion for Papua New Guinea and Australia with a global portfolio of world-class assets and development opportunities,\" Mr Coleman said. \"Oil Search shareholders would represent 32 per cent of the combined entity.\"\nOil Search shares fell 0.63 per cent or 5¢ to $7.85 on Wednesday while Woodside lifted 0.81 per cent or 24¢ to $29.90.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/woodside-opens-merger-talks-with-oil-search-20150908-gjhddi.html", "https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-09-09T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:05:19.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
