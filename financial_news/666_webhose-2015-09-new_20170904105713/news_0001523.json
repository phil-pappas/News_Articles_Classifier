And if the stock extends losses, management should simply take it private, Citigroup said in a report.\n“The markets response is overdone,” Citigroup said. “In the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly.”\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Glencore in Freefall as Analysts See Tougher Restructuring \nGlencore sank to a record in Hong Kong on Tuesday following the 29 percent plunge in London amid concern that the company’s debt load may be excessive as commodity prices sink.

And should a downgrade happen, Glencore’s counter parties probably wouldn’t stop trading with the company, it said.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Saudi Arabia Withdrew Billions From Markets, Estimates Show \nThe Hong Kong-traded shares in the Zug, Switzerland-based trader dived as much as 30 percent to HK$8.61 on Tuesday, and were at HK$8.91 at 2 p.m. local time.
