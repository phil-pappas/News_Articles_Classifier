Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images \nThe S&P 500 fell in three sessions during the past week and edged 0.15% lower. For the first time in five weeks, the index saw no volatile moves. The S&P 500 has seen 25 lower finishes in the past 43 sessions. \nThe Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Thursday. Stocks initially rebounded on this news, but turned lower and most of the major US indexes finished the session at a loss. Friday continued lower and dropped more steeply, as the S&P 500 and many other indexes erased early week gains in the fall. Although many continue to contend a rate hike was not needed, the lack of a hike probably left many investors with real doubts that the economy is in as good of shape as they believed. Many companies also continue to give reason to believe things are slowing more than many believe. \nAlthough the seasonally adjusted employment numbers appear mostly good at the current time, they always do in the top of an employment cycle. Yet there continues to be increases in the things that tend to tip this cycle lower. \nOn Tuesday Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) announced they would reduce their workforce by 30,000, or about 10% of its total workforce. This is in addition to the 55,000 job losses scheduled from 2012 to October of this year. Although CEO Meg Whitman noted the job cuts were the last in a recent interview on “ Squawk on the Street ”, that is not entirely true. HP also plans to displace 18% of its remaining workforce as it grows its low cost labor markets overseas to 60% from 42% through 2018. This will result in about 54,000 more layoffs in the higher priced labor markets. Those higher priced labor markets are mostly in the US. \nAnnouncements of occasional large workforce reductions are not uncommon even in bullish market cycles, but the numbers announcing plans of these reductions have been growing very fast in the past couple quarters. Many, like Hewlett-Packard, have made large increases to the numbers of already planned job cuts. Many also plan to shift portions of their remaining production into low cost labor markets. There were over 100 companies in the S&P 500 and S&P 400 that announced plans of large workforce reductions in the past two quarters, many plan to shed 10% or more of their work forces. Not all of these jobs reductions are in the US, but many are. This is not just a few tens of thousands of jobs here and there, it adds up to millions. \nSome of the companies that planned layoffs have begun or continued these layoffs, as can be seen in the large job reductions in Mining and Manufacturing during August. Many companies tend to make the bulk of their planned workforce reductions in the September to January time frame. Due to this likely timing; when these layoffs finally start denting the employment numbers, they may be misdiagnosed as normal seasonal reductions as many seasonal companies also reduce work forces during this same time frame. \nThe current run higher in the employment cycle appears somewhat long compared to most run ups. Although some reference data taken from the employment tables appears to hold fairly time constant, employment cycles do not appear to have consistent time frames. The employment cycle could trend higher for many years, or it could slip lower after only a short rebound. Although longer than many, the duration of this run up does not prove meaningful in determining if a downturn could be forthcoming. However; the employment data does appear to supply signals that are useful in analysis of possible topping areas though. One of these analysis are included below. \nThe following data analysis was taken from the Not Seasonally Adjusted Total Non-Farm Series ID: CEU 1 available from the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Using an Excel download of the full data series; a table on month over month changes was made. From that table year over year changes were calculated for January and the sum of the September through December time frames of each year. When the yearly change for the September through December time period decreases greater than 144,000 from the previous year and the following yearly change in January also decreased greater than 25,000 from the previous year, a signal is generated that is quite interesting. \nThis signal has been seen 22 times since this data series began in 1939. Comparing these 22 occurrences to recession data show that there are 15 of these 22 occurrences that saw either the September through December decline, the January decline or both during the year(s) of a recession. Not all were seen before the recession started, only four were seen prior to the recession starting but four more were seen during the months the recession began and still gave early warning. Four of the 22 signals saw the January decline in the year preceding the recession. Although the recession started up to a year or more later, this condition gave a warning that conditions could worsen, and therefore are considered a correct indication. It has only fallen outside those two conditions three times and they are considered false signals. One or more of those 19 true signals are seen during or leading into all of the 12 recessions seen during this data series. This indicator was seen before the recession began in a total of eight instances and in the beginning months in four instances. \nThe three false signals occurred relatively early in rebounds from a previous recession, but recessions had reoccurred during these short time frames in the past. Additional conditions were developed from the data that are more complex that eliminate the three false signals, but they also eliminated some of the true signals. Even so, these false signal elimination tests still left true signals in all 12 recessions. \nLast year’s September through December employment numbers were very good, in fact they were the sixth best total of all time. This high total is good news for the year it occurred, but can be a bad omen in the following year. Four of the five that finished higher preceded a recessionary signal in the following year. Two of these recessionary signals were false. Based on these five past occurrences there appears to be a 40% chance of a correct recessionary signal being seen in this instance. \nHowever other conditions appear to increase the chances that a true signal could be seen this time. There are a very large number of companies with planned layoffs and many companies are using other cost savings techniques that tend to increase unemployment levels. Past employment trends make it seem likely many of these layoffs could be seen during the time frame required for a correct indication, making it seem fairly likely a drop from last year’s very high employment levels could be seen. Further, the analysis of the June through August data makes it seem very likely a recessionary signal could be seen this year. Although not all data is available for the current year, the data that is, passes the false signal elimination tests. These data evaluations make it seem possible the chances of a correct recessionary signal in this instance are probably currently closer to 75%. \nEven if there is a correct signal it could be some time before the recession actually starts. At the same time, it could already have started or could start before the end of the year. If a recession has started, we would not know it had for many months. Recessions are normally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. There is a large lag between the end of a quarter and the final GDP numbers. Some may recall that the 1980 recession was already in a recovery before it was officially determined there had been a recession. \nSome contend that because the leading indicators are showing strength, that this is proof that there is nothing to worry about. Studies of the leading indicators show they do not have a very good track record of showing the initial stock price downturns before they begin. The data generally does not begin to show a move lower until well after stocks have turned lower. This even includes the employment numbers, which appear to give clear indications of probable recessions. \nFor instance on March 3, 2000 the Conference Board’s press release of the January 2000 leading indicator stated, “The leading index increased 0.3 percent, the coincident index increased 0.4 percent, and the lagging index decreased 0.2 percent in January. Taken together, the three composite indexes and their components show a strong economy:” The S&P 500 began to decline from its then all-time highest close of 1527.46 three weeks later on March 24, 2000. \nThey released March’s numbers on May 2, 2000 stating, “The leading index increased 0.1 percent, the coincident index increased 0.4 percent, and the lagging index held steady in March. Taken together, the three composite indexes and their components show a strong economy:” That was over a month after the downturn began, but the “strong economy” statement was not replaced until “a sustained expansion” was used in June’s release and it was replaced by a “moderate pace” in August. After the index had taken a leg down in October the report released on Dec 4, 2000 stated, “The leading index decreased by 0.2 percent, the coincident index decreased by 0.1 percent, and the lagging index held steady in October. Taken together, the three composite indexes and their components suggest that the pace of economic activity is slowing down to a more moderate pace.” Finally the first wording of a possible economic downturn is seen in November’s release on Dec 27, 2000 with, “The leading index decreased by 0.2 percent, the coincident index increased by 0.1 percent, and the lagging index increased by 0.3 percent in November. Taken together, the three composite indexes and their components show an increasing risk of a downturn in economic activity ahead.” \nThis first noting of a possible downturn given by the leading indicators was over nine months after stocks topped and the S&P 500 finished the Dec 27, 2000 session at 1328.92, or about 13% lower than the March high. Stocks later turned much lower from there, so in a sense these indicators did show the bulk of the coming downturn. This example is not uncommon, the leading indicators do not lead; they react. Stock prices downturns nearly always precede an economic downturn. \nSo why did stocks turn lower much earlier? Companies had been giving warnings of potential problems in their earnings reports well before the leading indicators actually saw the results of these problems. Companies appear to be giving those same types of warnings today. Hewlett-Packard announcement Tuesday was just one of hundreds of indications that things could turn worse, before getting better again. \nThe Conference Board provides a composite of several economic indicators. They weight these numbers to how they feel provides the best economic picture as a whole. Not all agree with their weighting scheme. The leading indicators are worth looking at both separately and as a composite, as they do provide good information on how the economy did a month before. These indicators can give hints as to how earnings might have done in the preceding quarter. If there are good reasons to believe the economy can continue in the direction these numbers are going, then investing accordingly makes sense. Judging the likely direction in stocks solely on these month old numbers is probably not a very good idea though. \nJust as volatility indicators seemed to point to a possible increase in volatility conditions, the World market indexes saw volatility fall to a slower pace in the past week. Asia’s indexes showed the most volatility during the first four days of the week with several sessions having seven or more volatile moves, but became mostly quiet on Friday with only one volatile move higher. Europe had mostly small numbers of volatility during the first four days, but saw increased volatile activity with eight volatile moves lower on Friday. The Americas saw its quietest week in the past five, totaling only seven volatile moves for the week, but saw three of those moves during volatile drops lower on Friday. The six US indexes finished the week without a volatile move, breaking a four week string with at least one volatile move on each index. \nChina’s Shanghai Composite continued to see volatile sessions during the past week. It finished Monday with a 2.67% loss, Tuesday dropped 3.52%, Wednesday rebounded 4.89%, and Thursday slid 2.10% lower, before finishing Friday quietly with a 0.38% gain. The drops early in the week neared previous support before it rebounded Wednesday and turned lower again on Thursday. Friday finished with a small gain, but it seems possible another retest of support could be seen. It seems likely this support could eventually be broken. \nThe major index charts show the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 , NASDAQ , Russell 2000 and New York Stock Exchange all broke from developing wedge patterns in the past week. These indexes pushed higher through resistances on Thursday, but most turned lower to finish the session at a loss. All continued to fall Friday and all broke the lower trend line of the wedge pattern in this retreat. Although a resistance break was seen in this rebound, it appears most of the indexes turned lower from a higher resistance. \nThe indexes all reached fully overbought conditions prior to the late week retreats. A continued drop from these levels seems likely. Although there was no volatility seen in these indexes during the previous week, peaks and lulls are seen during volatile periods. It seems possible the past week’s lull could just be the calm before the next incoming storm. \nIndicators \nThe featured and supporting indicators discussed below are not always correct, but they have been many times. Being so they are worth reading about and taking note of. \nThe 100 L, (-)/(+) 90 D, -/(+) 90 D, +2% H, -2% H, -/(+)9 Day and 90 E indicators are currently active. A new 9 Day indicator became active on Tuesday; a projection of how it could perform during its presence is included below. Due to the extra time needed for this analysis and research on earlier pieces of this article, the weekly updates for the S&P 500 data were skipped. The data was downloaded and time permitting, will be included in next week’s article. See a more detailed description of most of the indicators developed through research and featured in these articles here . \nThe S&P 500 broke the developing wedge pattern as it moved above resistance in the lower half of the 100 L at 2000. The break higher was turned back within the resistance in the upper half of the 100 L at 2000. That retreat broke the lower trend of this wedge pattern. It seems possible this reverse in direction could continue lower since the index is falling from fully overbought conditions. \nAll gaps lower that were left open in the previous week were filled but the drop on July 22. Although all of these gaps lower are likely to be filled at some point, current conditions make it seem possible some of these gaps could remain open for some time. Gaps higher seen on Aug 26 and Sept 8 remain open. A gap higher was left open on Tuesday as was a gap lower on Friday. \nMonday opened with a gap higher at the session high before falling to a low of 1943.27 that found support within the 1940 to 1955 MRL and rebounding to finish within this resistance at 1953.03. Tuesday opened with a gap higher and moved within resistance in the lower half of the 100 L at 1983.19 before falling to a finish within this resistance. Wednesday started slightly lower and fell to a low still within resistance in the lower half of the 100 L, before pushing to a high of 1997.26 and a finish of 1995.31, both still within this resistance. Thursday started with a gap slightly higher and pushed to a high of 2020.86 and within resistance in the upper half of the 100 L, before slipping to a finish of 1990.20 and back in the lower half of the 100 L. Friday gapped slightly lower at the open and continued to fall to a low of 1953.45 finding support within the 1940 to 1955 MRL, but rebounded to a finish above this support at 1958.08. \nThursday turned lower from an initial move higher into the upper half of the 100 L after the Fed decided against a rate hike. Friday continued lower and for the second week in a row, its finish was outside support levels. \nThe (-)/(+) 90 D indicator that became active on May 22, 2015 appears to have bearish potential. It has performed as follows to this point in the standard format: highest close / lowest close / last close. \n+0.99% / -11.38% / -7.09% \nA 90 E became active during conditions that seemed primed for volatility, but instead the S&P 500 saw the first week in the past five without a volatile move. Volatile phases have peaks and lulls, so the absence of volatility during the past week is not uncommon, just a surprise. The potential for volatility remains at extreme levels, so it still very likely volatile conditions could be seen. It does seem somewhat funny that investors in Europe appeared more concerned over the lack of a US rate hike than US investors were. \nThe -/(+) 90 D indicator that became active on July 21, 2015 also appears to have bearish potential. It has performed as follows to this point in the standard format: highest close / lowest close / last close. \n0.00% / -11.87% / -7.60% \nNote: The highest close only considers closes higher than the starting point; if there are none higher it is reported as zero percent. \nThe -2% H and +2% H indicators did not provide a correct indication in the past week. Asia continued to show relatively high levels of volatility early in the week, while Europe and America saw increases on Friday. Despite the relative calm seen in the markets, volatility indicators held within extreme levels. Chances of additional volatile conditions also remained at very high levels. \nThe average daily volume increased 14.23% from the previous week. Volume was highest during Friday’s retreat and lowest during Monday’s small setback. Average volume levels pushed back into normally bearish levels. The five day volume variance shot 84.68% higher to finish the week at 99.99%. The large sudden increase in the five day volume variance level shows an increasing chance of volatile conditions and is generally a bearish indication. \nA new 9 Day indicator became active on Tuesday. This indicator appears to becoming active during a period that is potentially very bearish. There are many reasons to believe this indicator could perform bearishly during its active period, although not all these reasons will be discussed, some include: \nA 90 E indicator is currently active. Although it appears to have started quietly, this indicator has been present during many past instances of bearish activity. As can be seen during many of its past occurrences covered in these articles, bearish conditions that were not seen just prior to its appearance are quite common during this indicator’s presence. \nIt appears likely the index has entered into a volatile phase. If this phase continues to develop as it appears to be, it could last many months and provide many volatile sessions during its presence. Past occurrences of volatile phases had led to large retreats in index prices. Although outside time frames normally associated with the 90 E indicator, the apparent volatility phase started only four weeks before this indicator’s activation. There have been several past occurrences of these two indicators sharing active periods that have resulted in large market drops with many volatile sessions. \nThe current 90 E indicator will expire in 25 trading days. Nine days after it expires, another 90 E will become active due to the expiration period of the -/(+) 90 D indicator that became active on July 21, 2015. It seems likely the volatile phase could still be active when this 90 E becomes active. It therefore seems possible an active volatile phase and active 90 E indicator could share active periods for an extended period. This seems potentially bearish. \nDiscussions that began in March 2014 centered on research that began in 2008 that pointed to a possible top in the index being seen from 2000 to 2100; that range was later extended to 2000 to 2140 during follow up research a couple years later. This research made it seem likely a large market drop could be seen within this range that could possibly reached crash potentials. At that time there did not appear to be a catalyst for this drop to occur. \nIn June 2014 a commodity super cycle collapse appeared to begin. This collapse reduced earnings potentials in many companies. As the index first reached 2000 in September 2014, fears over these earnings drops caused the index to slip in the largest retreat since 2012. The index rebounded very bullishly from this drop, but the climb began to slow as it neared the upper boundary of this range at 2140 and then round lower. As the index neared this level, more and more reasons for a larger drop began to surface. Earnings stagnated or fell in many companies, resulting in downturns in these stock prices. Many companies began using cost savings to preserve earnings, which caused earnings problems in others. \nSome continued to report very good earnings. Due to very low yields for cash accounts, investors felt compelled to remain fully invested. As a result of poor yields and fewer reporting good earnings, investors flocked into the fewer and fewer stocks giving these good reports. As a result, the few stocks left giving good reports have become highly overpriced. Many that had fallen in price had runs as investors bet on rebounds that did not develop. As a result many have not fallen to levels that make them valuable to likely future earnings. These conditions are not limited to the US; stocks worldwide have seen the same stock price movements. \nMany long term charts of S&P 500 constituents are showing downturns that look similar to those seen during large market retreats of the past. Others are beginning to show signs that they could be beginning these downturns form very steep runs higher. These chart formations are common during tip over patterns that were also discussed in earlier articles. If this pattern completes, all stocks are likely to fall lower, even those that are still giving good earnings reports. The result of this tip over in stock prices completing is probably not the correction we have seen so far, but a deeper drop that possible reaches crash potentials. \nAs those discussions that began in March 2014 pointed out as likely, the index has fallen to the lower trend line after breaking and running above the upper trend line within the two year time frame that was discussed later. This break to and rebound off the lower trend line does not necessarily mean the drop has completed though. Many of the past rebounds off the lower trend line have been retested later. Market conditions make it seem likely a retest could be seen in this instance. Not all of these retests have rebounded from support at these lows, some have broken lower. Current market conditions make it seem possible a retest of this support could fail in this retest, resulting in a deeper drop than has been seen to this point. \nAlthough some economic indicators leave the impression of good results, many of these impressions are given only because they rebounded from dismal levels. Many fell well short of the averages seen earlier, or were still depressed in comparison to earlier monthly or quarterly results. Others that have remained relatively constant are showing signs of falter. They also appear to be heading into conditions that could result in reductions. Many economic indicators are giving potentially bearish signals or are nearing conditions that have resulted in bearish signals in the past. \nThe failure of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in their last meeting also shows economic weakness. Some news accounts quoted board members of talking about possible rate cuts. This isn’t a very good sign of economic strength, and they have no room for a meaningful cut. Had slow incremental increases begun in 2010, like they should have, they would have a rate high enough to make a meaningful cut on, but we probably would not be seeing the problems we have now either. Data seems to indicate low rates worldwide are a very big part of the current problem, not the solution. \nThe stock market is within a time period that is generally bearish. Many large stock market retreats have occurred during the months of September and October. It appears some of the reasons for these larger retreats in the past, exist today. \nIt seems possible earnings growth in the third quarter could continue to be lower than that needed to maintain current stock prices. It does not appear likely at this point fourth quarter earnings will be much better. Although investors have shown patients with earnings shortfalls, eventually earnings will matter. \nGiven the points discussed above and others that were pondered, the projection for the 9 Day indicator that became active on Sept 15, 2015 is as follows: \nStocks appear to have many forces working against higher prices. Overall earnings have not been good enough to move large numbers of the index constituent’s stock prices higher. Most that are giving good reports are already priced far forward of likely earnings, so even if they have a good report, upside seems mostly limited. The S&P 500 index price has moved little higher in the past twelve months. Aside from the last two large retreats, the index has spent nearly a year within about a six percent range. Polls continue to show most investors think stocks are overpriced. At some point in a downturn, these investors could become sellers and this could increase downside potential. Lack of overall earnings growth, lack of upward price movement in the past year and lack of Fed action have to be weighing on investors’ minds. There are increasing indications that a recession could be forth coming. These began with increases in bearish cost saving activities in companies’ earnings reports. The effects of these cost savings maneuvers are spreading, and appear to have reached a point that they could become an economic problem. Several economic indicators are beginning to show these effects and are giving bearish signals. Most economic indicators that have been hailed as doing very well are mediocre at best, while several others have shown signs of contraction. Some of the sectors that were doing well will be entering a seasonal slowdown in the coming months. This could amplify the weakness seen elsewhere. Economic problems outside the US also appear to be growing concerns. The Fed did not raise rates and they cannot cut rates. Many stock charts appear to show the tip over pattern could complete. If it does many stocks are likely to fall much deeper than they already have. Past drops to and rebounds off the lower trend lines have been retest many times. Current conditions make it seem likely the lower trend line could be retest in this instance; it also seems possible the support at this trend line could fail. There are many bearish indicators present, during a time frame that has been very bearish in the past. For these reasons it seems possible this 9 Day indicator could begin bearishly. Although it seems very possible the index could fall to crash potentials, it also seems possible the retreat could find support at the lower support line. A drop to the lower support line is likely to provide a retreat in excess of 10% from the current price level so this indicator is given a minus sign as it first prefix signal. The November through December time period is often bullish, although not always so. It has provided temporary rebounds, even during market crashes in the past. Although there is no certainty that a rebound during this time period would occur, the chances seem fairly high it could occur. It seems fairly likely this rebound could come in a fall to the lower support line. It also seems possible this support could be retested in a subsequent drop, so it does not seem likely this rebound would regain the drop to that point, and probably less than 10%. The indicator is therefore given a second prefix of a plus rating encased in parenthesis indicating the potential for this rebound. At this point it seems likely economic conditions could continue to deteriorate. If this should occur a further drop seems likely. If this further retreat were to materialize, research suggests the index is likely to rebound somewhere near the tops seen in 2000 and 2007, although the index might not reach this depth during this indicators active period. A third prefix is not used; this indication is seen in the first prefix. As a result the full rating given to this indicator is -/(+)9 Day. \nThe -/(+)9 Day indicator that became active on Sept 15, 2015 appears to have bearish potential. It has performed as follows to this point in the standard format: highest close / lowest close / last close. \n0.87% / -1.01% / -1.01% \nCurrent Cautions \nTwo new indicators became active during the past week, the -/(+)9 Day and 90 E. Both of these indicators appear to have bearish potential. Increases in active indicators are also generally bearish. \nThe index saw no volatile moves in the past week, breaking a four week string with volatile moves. It still seems possible a volatile phase has begun and could last for much longer. Volatility indicators remained near extremes. A potentially bearish 90 E became active. Volatile periods have peaks and lulls; it seems possible the past week was a lull in this phase. \nThe indexes and many stocks broke developing wedge patterns in the past week. The majority broke resistance higher, but then turned lower in a fall through the wedges lower trend line. The indexes and most stocks were in overbought conditions. It therefore seems possible this retreat could continue. \nDrops to the lower trend line are often retested. Many things appear to be happening that have led to larger retreats in the past, making it seem possible that a larger retreat could happen if this retest occurs. \nCurrent chart formations along with past timelines, softening economic conditions, increases in volatile conditions, worldwide stock overvaluations and continued lackluster earnings make it seem possible the S&P 500 could see a large retreat before the end of the year. \nThe next likely resistance level above the 100 L at 2100 could be seen at the 2140 to 2160 MRL. Earlier highs on the S&P 500 could have seen the effects of this resistance level, but the index is still within the influence range of the 100 L since it has not yet reached this resistance level. Therefore this resistance is not yet considered active. This resistance appears to have the potential to cause a significant pullback. \nPlease note there is no established resistance in the MRL levels before the index has reached these levels. Several instances have proven to hold resistance once reached; however MRL levels that the index has not yet reached are only the most likely levels that resistance will be seen based on research. Back tests of the data used to project these resistance levels work well, but they are not always exact, and these resistances could react sooner or later than expected, it is also possible the resistance will not be seen at all. \nData provided for the S&P 500 was derived from the historical daily data tables, similar data can be found at Google Finance .
