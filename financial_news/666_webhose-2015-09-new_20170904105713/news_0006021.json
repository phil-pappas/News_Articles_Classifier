Initiatives include the introduction of inflight Wi-Fi and upgrading terminals at its hub airports in the United States to improve the customer experience for international passengers. The airline has also upgraded the Delta App for smartphones to allow passengers to book, check in, update seats, download boarding passes, and review SkyMiles balances. \nPetra Asamoah, Delta Air Lines sales manager in Ghana said: “We are delighted to win this award a fourth time since launching operations to Ghana nine years ago. It is a wonderful endorsement of the products and services we offer to our Ghanaian customers.” \nMs Asamoah dedicated the award to Delta’s local passengers, adding: \"Delta remains committed to Ghana and hope his award and service upgrades encourage more people to fly Delta to the United States.\" \nCIMG also cited dedicated customer insights, profiling, effective customer service, enhancement of support staff, and upgrading of their customer experiences as reasons for awarding Delta “Airline of the Year”. \nThe Atlanta-based airline employs 80,000 people and operates a fleet of more than 700 aircraft with over 15,000 daily flights in conjunction with their worldwide partners. \nDelta was the first U.S. carrier to start nonstop service from Ghana to the United States in 2006, and currently operates a four weekly service from Accra to New York-JFK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:53:56.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
