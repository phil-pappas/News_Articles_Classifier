The Treasurer has a revenue problem because income tax bases are under pressure, and because he has a spending problem that could take a good deal longer to solve than he thinks.\nIt's natural to blame the government's budget problems on bad behaviour. But the loss of corporate tax revenue to multinational tax planners is a symptom of something bigger and more permanent: the rise of emerging market economies that can offer multinational companies efficient production environments with cheap wages and low taxes.\nSimilarly, while the tax breaks that have made a \"Swiss cheese\" of the personal income tax base might be a monument to the greed of well-to-do taxpayers, they also are evidence of the unsustainability of the income tax schedule. The latter is becoming more important as skilled labour and their savings become more internationally mobile.\nMeanwhile, politicians in the United States are being confronted with studies showing that tax does matter for multinational companies. The expanding gap between the US and foreign corporate tax rates is estimated to have cost the US 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2013 and this annual cost is expected to rise to 1.5 per cent in the long run.\nEconomists and business are calling for a cut in the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to the OECD average of 25 per cent.\nAustralia's advocates of tax reform, many of whom crowded into the tax reform summit sponsored by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG in Sydney, are simply trying to keep up with the game.\nThe Senate's rejection of the Abbott government's 2014 budget measures also seems symptomatic of something deeper than the political opportunism of the opposition and the crossbenchers.\n There are two issues here. The first is that, after years of squeezing \"efficiency dividends\" from their departments, governments are reaching the point where substantial savings require cuts in government services in the big, politically-sensitive portfolios like health, education, social welfare and defence.\nThis is something for which the public is unprepared.\nWhen the Senate rejected the Abbott government's reforms of Medicare and the universities there is little doubt that it was accurately reflecting public opinion.\nSecondly, public demand for high quality government services is rising. That's partly because of demographic change, but it is also because the demand for quality public infrastructure and services such as education and health care rises with incomes.\nReal per capita disposable income has risen dramatically over the past two and a half decades as a result of economic reform and the resources boom. It is quite likely that the demand for government services is still catching up with the change.\nMoreover, reforming something as complex as education or health is very difficult. The expert critiques of Christopher Pyne's university reform showed how easy it is to get the detail of a good proposal wrong.\nPyne had the right idea, but his reform was not fully developed, and the public was unprepared for the policy change and unconvinced of the need for it.\nFundamental reform of the big policy areas like health and education is going to be almost as difficult as tax reform, and it will require the same careful, consultative process: public inquiries and long debates.\nWe have the necessary tools. The Productivity Commission already has conducted inquiries into aspects of health care, and for years has repeatedly urged governments to commission a comprehensive review of the sector.\nThe commission should be given the task of working through all the major spending portfolios, just as it predecessor, the Industry Assistance Commission, worked its way through the protected manufacturing sector.\nIts public inquiries are trusted by the public, and can familiarise voters with both the challenges and the options, including those offering consumers more choice and better quality.\nMore choice and better quality are what the Harper competition policy review was on about when it proposed that governments apply competition principles-based thinking to areas such as health and other human services, roads and urban planning.\nThis public inquiry process offers a more reliable way forward than Pyne's more traditional strategy of trying to squeeze structural reform into the budget process.\nBut it is relatively slow, and in the current fragile global environment, the government would be well advised to get some fiscal reform runs on the board.\nFortunately, Australia's public debt is low by international standards and there is no great pressure from global financial markets for us to wrench the budget back into balance.\nBut, in a period of increased anxiety about the outlook for China, Australia's slow pace of fiscal reform could become an issue.\nA settled plan for serious pro-growth tax reform undoubtedly would be reassuring for international investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:08:21.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
