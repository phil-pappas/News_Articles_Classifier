Stefan Postles by James Thomson BHP Billiton shareholders reeling from a big fall in the value of their shares in the past year can still take some solace from the fact the company's chief executive is one of the cheaper blue chip bosses.\nAndrew Mackenzie's actual remuneration – that is, before share-based payments are included – fell from $US7.988 million ($11.36 million) to $US4.582 million during the year, a drop of 42 per cent.\nBHP Billiton shares, which were savaged in a global sell-off of commodity-linked shares, have fallen by about 25 per cent over the last 12 months.\nMr Mackenzie's base salary was steady at $US1.7 million, but his short term incentive payments dropped significantly, from $US3.14 million to $US2.31 million.\nFatalities impacted pay In part, this was due to the board's decision that a component of Mr Mackenzie's bonus should be cut because the company was responsible for five fatalities during the year. According the BHP's remuneration report, the board took the decision, backed by Mr Mackenzie, that only zero fatalities would be acceptable under the bonus system.\nWhen Mr Mackenzie's share-based payments (which must be reported under Australian disclosure regulations) are taken into account, his total salary for the year comes in at $US6.934 million, compared with $7.123 million in the pervious year.\nHowever, there is a good argument to make that this is a reasonably modest amount given the size of BHP and in comparison to other executive pay packets in Australia.\n When the Australian and British arms of BHP Billiton are combined, the total market capitalisation of the group is just over $240 billion or more than 34,000 times Mr Mackenzie's salary.\nWhat other CEOs earn By way of comparison, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce received a total salary of $11.84 million, a sharp increase on the year before due to the airline's impressive turnaround . Qantas market value of $8.1 billion is 675 times greater than Mr Joyce's total package.\nAt Wesfarmers, chief executive Richard Goyder received a total package of $9.86 million, up slightly on the previous year. Wesfarmers market capitalisation of $42.5 billion is 4250 times more than Goyder's remuneration.\nCommonwealth Bank's $121 billion market value is 15,000 times greater than the $7.97 million total package given to chief executive Ian Narev.\nWhile these ratios don't suggest these executives are overpaid, they do illustrate the relatively modest size of Mr Mackenzie's salary given he is running one of the world's biggest miners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:07:54.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
