Joe Armao Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The military man with the sharp uniform and the medals, and the tough message on border control, were gone. Scott Morrison's first major press conference as Treasurer on Wednesday saw him accompanied by a fiscal warrior instead: Finance Minister Mathias Cormann. Instead of not commenting on \"on-water\" matters, Morrison had a busy collection of messages to deliver: Australia's opportunities are extraordinary. The challenges are great but Australians are up to it. The government is going to back them and their ability.\nSo far, so good. It was all of a piece with the optimistic tone that Malcolm Turnbull has set for a reconstructed government since he became Prime Minister just under two weeks ago. But now we are starting to see ministers emerge to try to put meat on the bones of that new tone.\nNo one is going to be watched more closely than Turnbull's new Treasurer. Scott Morrison is going to need all the tough guy persona of his life as immigration minister and the smoother, more persuasive style he was pursuing at social services minister, in his new job.\nHis first defining pronouncement as Treasurer wasn't really up there in the political eloquence stakes. It wasn't his turn of phrase about Australia's exciting future that attracted the attention as much as one which had all the defining directness of one of the old weekly border force situation reports. \"We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem,\" he declared.\nThe new Treasurer is right to point to the fact spending as a percentage of GDP is \"over 26 per cent, which is where it was at the height of the GFC\".\n\"This is not something that we believe is sustainable and there are plenty of people out there who want to raise taxes and have a new idea for a tax every single day of the week,\" Morrison said.\nBoth a problem But the reality is Morrison has both a spending problem and a revenue problem.\n As former treasury secretary Ken Henry observed on Tuesday night, in 2002, when the budget was in balance, both spending and revenue were equivalent to 25 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\"Today spending is 26 per cent of gross domestic product and revenue is 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product,\" Henry told the ABC . \"So a bit more than half of [the deterioration in the bottom line] is explained by a deterioration in revenue performance; by the tax system not delivering in the way that the tax system has delivered in the past.\"\nIn addition to a revenue problem, Morrison also has myriad tax reform problems. Australia's corporate tax rate is considerably higher than the OECD average and there is pressure to get it down. A large swag of average-wage earners are nudging up against higher tax brackets and will soon be feeling the cool breeze in their pockets of the government taking significantly more of their wages each week.\nThere are distortions in the tax system affecting savings and investment decisions. There is pressure to broaden the GST net or raise its rate, possibly to deal with the first of these two problems or possibly to provide more funds to the states to deal with burgeoning health and education costs.\nBut Morrison's first problem is reorientingâ€‹ the whole tax debate and plugging it back into voter land.\nWhen the tax white paper process was announced, it unleashed a new round of debate among the tax glitterati. But the erratic signals from the Abbott regime about tax have left that debate a little adrift this year.\n'Lots of documents' The experts are still debating the need to increase the GST, lower the company rate, do something about capital gains and negative gearing, superannuation tax concessions and the rest. But in a world where the then treasurer first opened up a broad-ranging discussion, only to see the prime minister close it down the next day, that experts' debate has somehow spun off into its own universe, as Morrison observed rather frankly this week.\n\"There's been lots of bright, shiny documents over the last five or so years and they're all very thick and they end up being, too often, doorstops,\" he told The Australian Financial Review this week .\n\"I don't want what I do on tax to be like that and I know that the only way that these things can be successful is if you engage people and their appetite for the things tax reforms will deliver.\n\"Tax reform is not an end in itself,\" he said. \"Tax reform is not some policy picnic. What it has to be about is: what is it going to deliver for the Australian people?\"\n\"So where tax reform contributes to those goals, where it helps people work, save, and invest, where it rewards an economy that is diversifying and adapting, where it's backing people's ability and where there is a clear end to put them and their family in a better-off position today than they were before, for the future, for the future, then they are good proposals. And that's why we should do it. But the tax reform agenda should not be driven through some elite process, it should be driven very firmly focused on the outcome we want to see for the Australian people, their families and the economy.\"\nHis comments reflected those of pollster Mark Textor who told this week's AFR Tax Reform Summit that the government's first job was to clarify an organising principle for the tax debate: \"join the dots\" so that people understand the relationship of tax to economic growth, fairness and efficiency.\nSo Morrison is running now to catch up with a tax debate that has been chugging along the tracks, powered by tax experts but without anyone at the political helm, while trying to work out how to entice the broader community to jump on board.\nMarkers established There are just a few markers he has put down so far: he wants to keep the overall tax take steady and let a growing economy provide the extra funding we need to run our services. \"We need to restructure the tax mix to ensure it grows the economy,\" he told the Financial Review this week.\n\"That's what will drive the revenue rather than lifting the overall [tax] burden.\"\nRecalibrating the tax debate will not just mean explaining what is at stake to voters, of course. It will mean redefining the political battle with Labor. The opposition's treasury spokesman Chris Bowen argues it is unrealistic to define the fiscal problem as only a spending issue, and Labor has signalled its opposition to a higher goods and services tax. It means reopening all the political cans of worms that were closed down by Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. And it will mean working out how to approach the needs and demands of the states, given that NSW Premier Mike Baird has led the charge in recent months for an increase in the GST to pay for more services.\nWhile Morrison seeks to reframe the political debate, the team back in the secretariat of the tax white paper will have to plough on with what they have been doing and pull out of the drawers for more work on all the areas that had previously been mothballed, such as superannuation, capital gains tax and negative gearing.\n\"Anything that helps people work save and invest, anything that helps the economy become more adaptive, and deal with the transition that's taking place and enables it to diversify, I'm interested in all of those ideas,\" Morrison says\nOne of the options that the tax reform secretariat has been spending quite a lot of time on is an idea that Morrison floated again this week, in an echo of comments he had made in February as social services minister.\nThis goes to the idea of unlocking the capital increasingly hoarded by an ageing population, usually in the form of their family home.\nThis would help grow those sectors of the economy that will contribute more to the economy as the resources boom moves to the slower production phase, Morrison argues\nThe Treasurer's particular focus was on trying to find a way of ensuring older people would not be penalised in a social security sense by downsizing from their family home to free up capital to live on and invest with.\nBut the tax team has been looking at other ways of trying to capture this money and recirculate it into the economy, encouraged by a whole industry that sees the scope for a mountain of new products, everything from income streams to products that allow the pre-purchase of private health insurance.\nThe one thing Morrison can be confident of in coming months is that he will have no shortage of helpful advice about how to proceed.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle", "http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4317759.htm"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:10:52.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
