Photo: David Mariuz\nThe chief executive of Australia's No.1 beer company Lion says the $14 billion mainstream beer market can be revitalised and falling consumption reversed, with one of the main weapons being some \"myth-busting\" about beer's main ingredients, as it capitalises on an anti-sugar wave.\nStuart Irvine said Lion, which makes beers including Tooheys, XXXX Gold and James Boag , will spend around $10 million over the summer in a concerted campaign to make it clear to the public that most beers are 99.9 per cent \"sugar-free\" and contain only four basic ingredients â€“ malt, yeast, water and hops.\nMr Irvine said there are perceptions that beer is weighed down with preservatives and sugar, but this isn't the case. He says the public campaign will be an important plank in reversing the declining consumption of mainstream beers in Australia at a time when the much-smaller craft beer segment is growing at 25 per cent. Official statistics show that mainstream beer consumption has fallen to its lowest point in 68 years.\nLion holds 48 per cent of the beer market in Australia.

Photo: Jim Rice\nLion is progressively putting nutrition information panels on bottles and cartons of beer with clear information about what the ingredients are, as part of the drive to position beer away from products loaded with preservatives and sugar. Most of its products will contain the nutrition panels by the end of calendar 2015.\nThere is a global backlash against sugar underway, with soft drink companies in particular being hit hard . Fund manager Platinum Capital in its annual report earlier this month closely examined shifting consumer attitudes towards sugar and the rising rates of diabetes and obesity, and the potential future impact of policy changes on the sugar industry and how it may impact on investing.\nLion, which is owned by Japan's Kirin Corporation, holds 48 per cent of the beer market in Australia, ahead of the SABMiller-owned Carlton & United Breweries which holds around 42 per cent and sells brands including Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.\nWoolworths and Coles are also keen to see the decline in the mainstream beer segment reversed.\nLion also runs a $200 million a year premium wine business, and a dairy and fruit juice division. Mr Irvine, who together with Lion chairman Sir Rod Eddington officially opened the company's new $14 million Petaluma winery at Woodside in the Adelaide Hills on Tuesday, says the two major liquor retailers in Woolworths and Coles are also keen to see the decline in the mainstream beer segment reversed.\n\"They're both interested in getting categories into growth,\" Mr Irvine told Fairfax Media.\nHe wouldn't go into specifics about whether having a broad spread of consumer goods across beer, wine, dairy and juice products gives Lion more clout in its negotiations with the two major chains, but said it's in everyone's interests to ensure that a particular product category is growing. Negotiations are always robust.\n\"There's always a commercial element to them,\" he said. Mr Irvine said Lion's best-performing beer brand is XXXX Gold.\nPremium wines' expansion Mr Irvine said the Petaluma and Croser fine-wine brands are both producing double-digit sales growth, and Lion wants to expand further in premium wines both through organic growth and acquisitions. \"We are always looking for things,\" he said.\nWhile the Lion wine business is relatively small compared its beer and dairy operations, Mr Irvine said there were strong growth opportunities in Asia. Lion's wine brands, which also include St Hallett, and Stonier, generate 95 per cent of total sales from the domestic market.\nMr Irvine said over time he would like to tilt that so that exports represented between 20 to 30 per cent of the wine business.\nSir Rod , who is also chairman of Infrastructure Australia, said a free trade agreement with China would add further impetus to wine sales from Australia into China, with premium brands highly sought after by Chinese consumers.\nSir Rod says the elevation of Malcolm Turnbull to Prime Minister should deliver some more optimism, with his strong business background a plus as the nation faces its economic challenges.\n\"He's a man with a background across a wide range of industries and I think he'll be a very good leader for Australia,\" Sir Rod said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/beer-shorts-catch-a-buzz-amid-nasty-hangover-for-brewery-stocks-20150828-gj9q3d", "http://www.afr.com/business/tooheys-xxxx-sales-drop-taps-into-lion-profit-20150805-gis44i", "http://www.afr.com/business/cocacola-amatil-admits-cutting-back-on-sugar-as-attitudes-change-on-health-and-investment-20150911-gjkof3"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:42:52.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
