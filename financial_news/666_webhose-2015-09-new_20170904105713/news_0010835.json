Written by: Robert McGarvey 09/02/15 - 12:14 PM EDT More Headlines Asking Your Boss For a Raise Can Be Dangerous If You Don't Navigate The Right Way NEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Your money question for the day: should you be banking, not at a bank, but at a credit union ? Question two: if you are a credit union member -- 101 million of Americans are , according to trade group Credit Union National Association (CUNA) -- should you be doing more of your banking at the credit union? That’s important because many members - nobody has a solid number but many guess it’s a lot - park a few bucks at a credit union, to feel good. But then they do all their real banking at, well, banks. It may be time to stop. Here are some numbers. At giant Chase , an incoming foreign wire will set you back $15, according to MyBankTracker. At Affinity Federal Credit Union in Basking Ridge N.J., it costs zero, zip, not a penny. At Chase, the NSF fee is $34. At State Employees Credit Union of North Carolina (SECU), the fee is zip if cleared up in two days. It rises to $12 afterwards. At Chase, the monthly checking account fee is $12, unless you have $1,500 or more in the account or have direct deposits or have $5,000 in other, linked accounts. At Digital Credit Union in Massachusetts, the cost of free checking is what the name says. There is no minimum balance. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T23:03:19.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
