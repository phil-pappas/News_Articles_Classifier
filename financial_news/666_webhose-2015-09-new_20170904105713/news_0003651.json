Over the past decade, nine companies have outperformed the gauge by at least 10 percentage points after news of their Nikkei 225 inclusion, and all except one fell on their first day in.\nThe pattern of gains and losses is driven in part by hedge funds and other traders, who buy the stock to offload it to index funds as the rebalance takes effect. Some passive money managers delay purchases until just before a company gets added because their primary goal is tracking their benchmark, rather than getting the cheapest price.\n“Rebalances are an easy target for speculators because they know there’s always a counterparty who must trade,” said Katsuhiko Okada, chief executive officer of Magne-Max Capital Management Co. and a professor at the business school of Kwansei Gakuin University near Osaka. “Passive fund managers don’t see this as getting saddled with losses because of the criteria they use. Their incentive is to stick as closely to the index as possible.”\nAs Japan’s pension savers and other investors switch to passive funds to save on costs, that creates an opportunity for traders to profit when indexes are altered. While not every new constituent goes up then down, enough do that researchers have tried to work out the hidden penalty to index-fund owners. By one estimate, it costs owners of funds tracking the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index some $4.3 billion a year.\nMoving Prices Defenders of the process say the expense is unavoidable: managers with so much stock to buy would move prices regardless of when additions were announced -- possibly more than they do now, when traders have time to accumulate shares. Still, it affects anyone buying index funds that are usually marketed for their low fees.\nDeNA and builder Haseko Corp. are going in to the Nikkei 225 in this week’s overhaul, while a real-estate company and a materials maker are getting the boot. DeNA added $241 million in value since the announcement, in a declining market and without making a single stock exchange filing, while Haseko was up 3.2 percent. DeNA spokesman Tomoyuki Akiyama said the company doesn’t comment on its share price.\nRelative Value The 30 companies added to the Nikkei 225 since 2005 beat the index by an average 6 percentage points between the announcement of their inclusion and the actual event, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which didn’t include stocks added after mergers. Those that rose the most -- from Fast Retailing Co. in 2005 to Pacific Metals Co. in 2008 -- plunged the next day. Federal Reserve researchers said in 2011 that being included in the S&P 500 has no long-term impact on the value of a company.\nBiggest Outperformance Among Nikkei 225 Inclusions\n“We’ve seen volatility in the past around the rebalance events and I expect it to happen again,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a senior analyst at Matsui Securities Co.\nNitto Denko Corp., a chemicals maker, surged 33 percent before its Nikkei 225 debut in 2013, adding $3.3 billion in value. Among the buyers was Areion Asset Management Co., a Hong Kong-based hedge fund. It arranged to sell 15.17 million shares to a securities firm at the closing price the day before the Nikkei 225 inclusion, according to Japan’s exchange operator.\nProfitable Trade By the close, that was a 114 billion yen ($951 million) commitment. Areion unleashed an onslaught of buy orders in the final seconds, and Nitto Denko soared 15 percent. An Areion fund made 10.5 billion yen, an official with the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission said last year, asking not to be named because of the commission’s policy. The regulator recommended the asset manager be fined 430.7 million yen for market manipulation. Two phone calls to the fund’s Hong Kong office seeking comment weren’t immediately returned.\nNitto Denko slumped 11 percent the following day. Within nine days, it had reversed all of the pre-inclusion rally, and dragged the Nikkei 225 down 0.5 percent.\nNitto Denko joins the Nikkei 225\n“It was a wonderful opportunity for those able to score a profit,” said Okada, who wrote a paper on index arbitrage in 2004. “For the average investor, they ended up with some unnecessary costs.”\nWhile the trading strategy isn’t new, Japan has a growing pool of passive money at stake, with assets in index exchange-traded funds swelling by 159 percent to 12.1 trillion yen in February from two years prior. That’s an opportunity for other traders, especially big banks, to provide liquidity when index funds need it most. The funds themselves face a dilemma: any investment decision that makes their returns differ from the underlying benchmark is, arguably, not what customers signed up for.\nHigh Correlation “Our goal first and foremost is to deliver what is laid out in the prospectus: a fund that has a high correlation to the Nikkei 225,” said Kazumasa Hironaka, a senior manager at Nomura Asset Management Co., which oversees the largest Nikkei 225 ETF in Japan. “We do not comment on how we handle the actual rebalance. We have our investors’ best interests in mind at all times.”\nManagers are more likely to act at the last minute on Nikkei 225 reshuffles because each member has a bigger weight in the gauge, so jumping early has a bigger impact on tracking error, according to Michiro Naito, an equity derivative and quantitative strategist at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The Topix index has 1,893 members.\n“The amount of money tied to the Nikkei is growing through exchange-traded funds, so this is a very hot topic,” Naito said. “The more money, the bigger the impact on rebalances.”", "external_links": ["http://www.fsa.go.jp/sesc/english/news/reco/20141205-1.htm\\", "http://www.jpx.co.jp/english/regulation/ensuring/preventing/about-unfair-trading/tvdivq0000000fi0-att/eg.pdf\\", "http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr484.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:42:02.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
