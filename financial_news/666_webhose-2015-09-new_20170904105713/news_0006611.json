The muscles start to tire, and form begins to deteriorate,” he says.\nHe suggests that people who find their posture slumping after long hours on their feet should try activating their glutes and tilting their pelvis forward. “Modifying our standing posture throughout the day is critical,” Dr. Chertok says.\nLearning to breathe properly, using the diaphragm for both inhalation and exhalation, can support posture. “Proper breathing technique, particularly a full exhale, will posteriorly tilt the pelvis and relieve some lower back pain and tightness,” Dr. Chertok says.\nA fisherman, he says, needs a pliable, powerful core and strong rotational muscles to “bring in” a big catch. The basic core exercises should revolve around the plank. A plank “effectively engages the core without putting any strain on the spine,” Dr. Chertok says. “The spine remains neutral while the muscles around the core, hips, and glutes do all the work.”\nWhether you fish or are just on your feet a lot, he suggests performing basic plank-based exercises such as side planks performed on the forearm, prone planks performed on hands or forearms, push ups, and half to full planks where you start on the hands and go down to the forearms, and repeat, all the while staying off your knees.\nWrite to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:52:22.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
