Rodelis bought the rights on Aug. 19 and in a statement said it was in the process of putting in place a patient-assistance program to provide the drug at no cost to the uninsured. They said the cost for a patient taking the pills twice a day for a year would be $260,000 a year.\nCycloserine is one of several drugs prescribed to treat cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the U.S. There were 95 cases in the U.S. in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hasler said the foundation had been selling enough Cycloserine for 40 to 60 patients to take each year.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/nonprofit-reacquires-rights-to-tuberculosis-drug-after-hefty-price-hike-1442879817"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:14:52.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
