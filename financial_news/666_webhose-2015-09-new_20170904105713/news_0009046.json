Shawn McConnell, Belvoir Federal’s Senior Programmer/Analyst, submitted an innovative solution that helps employees set reminders directly from Symitar so they can follow-up on accounts. This solution, which Belvoir Federal integrated with its core processor in December 2014, creates a one-stop-shop for employees to easily monitor tasks. With only a few clicks, a prefilled Outlook appointment can be generated in an employee’s calendar with relevant information pertaining to the task. For example, the appointment creator can be utilized for the 2x2x2 (2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months) follow-up method, account research, referrals, product status, or a custom appointment.\n“Winning this award is a great honor, especially since the program was voted on by my peers,” stated Shawn. “I wanted to create a programming solution that was cutting-edge and could make our processes more efficient. This solution is a great way to help staff with their time management and accountability.”\n“Shawn McConnell is a mixture of talent meeting technology. His ability to assess a situation, garner the appropriate facts, and create efficiencies with his custom programs has helped elevate Belvoir Federal’s ingenuity. Shawn’s skill set aided our credit union in becoming an industry trend setter as well as winning this prestigious award,” stated Patricia Kimmel, President/CEO of Belvoir Federal Credit Union.\nAbout Symitar\nSymitar, a division of Jack Henry & Associates, is the recognized leader in core data processing and ancillary technology solutions for U.S. credit unions.
