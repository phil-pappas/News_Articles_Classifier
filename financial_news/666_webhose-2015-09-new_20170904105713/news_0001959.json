This follows close on the heels of the Mercedes Benz S63 AMG Coupe, G63 AMG Crazy Color, S63 AMG Sedan and S500 Coupe, and now with its latest launch, the German automaker has added another AMG product in the line-up. Mercedes Benz will be bringing the C63 S AMG via the CBU route. While the C63 does hold an edge on paper against rivals, how it will fare in terms of sales is something that only the coming months will tell. Here are 6 points to ponder:\nThe Mercedes Benz C-Class release would be competing against some serious heavyweights like the 3 Series from another German automaker BMW, specifically its performance car the BMW M3. The other carmaker in the mix is Maserati with the recently launched Ghibli.\nThe new performance car will have the same engine as the AMG GT with a 4 litre V8 power plant churning out 503 HP at 5500 to 6250rpm whereas the torque will be 700Nm at 1750 to 4500rpm. The engine will work in collaboration with a 7 speed AMG Speedshift MCT transmission system which will allow the car to counter different road conditions and traffic intensity with ease. Mercedes-Benz C63 works with a hand built engine and it manages to accelerate from 0 to 100kmph in just 4 seconds, which is quite an impressive feat. On the other hand, the BMW M Series M3 Sedan has a 3 litre MPower Petrol engine under its belt with 6 cylinders having four valves each. BMW M3 does fall behind Mercedes-Benz C63 in terms of stats with the former carving away 431bhp power at 5500 to 7300rpm along with 550Nm torque at 1850 to 5500rpm.\nThe maximum speed that the vehicle can achieve is 250kmph which can be stretched up to 290kmph using the optional AMG Driver’s Package. These are phenomenal figures that would capture the imagination of any car enthusiast who loves speed.\nLike with most Mercedes-Benz models this season, the interiors of the Mercedes Benz C63 have an all black theme and receive the same treatment that we have seen as standard in AMGs in the past.\nFrom the outside, Mercedes-Benz C63 has a much more edgy and sporty feel with loads of performance oriented additions to the car including a bumper and alloy wheels that are spunkier in addition to other elements of the overall kit.\nThe car will feature loads of carbon fibre, Alcantara leather and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. The sedan will also feature recently introduced MB Designo that allows customer personalize the colors of dashboard, seats and other stuff.\nCarDekho\n 14, 2015 3:20 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.cardekho.com/"], "published": "2015-09-14T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T08:41:09.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
