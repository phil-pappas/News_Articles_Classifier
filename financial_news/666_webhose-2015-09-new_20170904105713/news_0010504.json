Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Sydney still has suburbs where buyers can get a unit within cooee of the city for less than $450,000 and houses for under $850,000.\nThey may not be the first places you look, but starting with Belmore - the closest at 12km from the CBD - a handful of suburbs that includes Bexley, Mortdale, Auburn, Granville and Revesby offers pockets of opportunity.\nThey are clearly less convenient than the 4km-odd distance of Brisbane's value-laden up-and-coming areas. But most of Sydney's residential development is now coming in middle- and outer-ring suburbs and the mixed-use nature of many of these developments will underpin their value from rising commercial and business activity in the area, PRD Nationwide's latest Sydney Hotspots report shows.\n\"That's where people are going to have to look if they are to try and find property that they don't have to sell their kidney in the black market for,\" said PRD Nationwide national research manager Asti Mardiasmo.\nHousing affordability in the NSW capital is a longer-term economic and social risk. Sales data for transactions between January and May this year showed how few properties were available on a teacher's wage .\nBut while Sydney remained expensive, the hotspots offering relative affordability across Sydney's western rim were overlooked by many people, Dr Mardiasmo said.\n\"It's not that they're bad,\" she said. \"It's more that people don't know about them.\"\n'Auburn is strongly connected' Units in Belmore, in the city's inner south west, are selling at a median price of $445,000 and are rising just 4.1 per cent a year, little changed on their pace of growth six months ago. But several projects approved could start this financial year, boosting housing stock and economic activity. They include a $3-million mixed-use project at 773-777 Canterbury Road that will build two commercial sites and 18 units, and the Burwood Road Shop Top housing development that will put 19 new apartments above two planned commercial tenancies.\nUnits in Granville, on the outskirts of Parramatta, were falling 1.1 per cent in price six months ago, but have since stabilised and are now gaining at a 3.1 per cent annual clip. The median unit price is still at $415,000 and the area stands to benefit as Parramatta continues its expansion as a regional hub.\nWhen it comes to houses, Auburn, also near Parramatta, offers affordable accommodation - with a median price of $800,000 - that is rising at only a modest 2.8 per cent rate. It is well located and will get a boost from the pipeline of $517 million-worth of development this year.\n\"Central to Parramatta, Bankstown and Sydney CBDs, Auburn is strongly connected with strategic economic and transport nodes,\" the report says.\nHouses in Bexley in the inner south-west are pricier than the rest, with a median price of $962,500, but they are growing at a pedestrian 1.3 per cent.\n\"One of St George's more affordable suburbs, Bexley is yet to experience the full upswing witnessed in the current market cycle - a compelling opportunity,\" the report says.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-09T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:17:59.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
