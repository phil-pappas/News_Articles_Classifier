As if it's inspired by Microsoft's Surface tablet (which doubtless it is, at least in part), Apple has also announced a stylus for the iPad Pro, which it's calling the Pencil. The Pencil, which Apple says will have a battery life of a few hours, appears to be aimed mostly at creative users, though Microsoft did show it working with new versions of its Office apps designed for the iPad Pro.\nIt has a built-in pressure sensor that draws thinner or thicker lines on the screen depending on how hard the user presses, and a built-in angle sensor, that can be used to modify the mode of the pencil, or its brush size, depending on how the pencil is held.\nThough the iPad Pro doesn't appear to have a Wacom-style digitiser built into the screen, Apple says the Pencil will be accurate enough to address a single pixel on the screen. That's quite a bit more accurate than drawing on the screen with your finger.\nThe iPad Pro will arrive in November. Australian pricing has yet to be announced, but in the US it starts at $US799 and goes all the way to $US1079 for a version that has 4G mobile data. The Pencil is $US99 and the keyboard is $US169.\n The Pencil. Like a stylus, only with a new name.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:07:46.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
