They are taking a more conservative approach,” said an insider at one challenger bank. \n“The big banks have done a fantastic job on the CMA. We are not holding our breath for anything to come out of it.” \nThe attack on the CMA’s probe comes after the challenger banks met the Treasury last week to ask officials to exempt them from a new 8pc tax on banks. Treasury officials agreed to consider tweaking the tax in future, either to raise the threshold at which it comes into force, or to reduce the rate. \nNine challengers met the CMA earlier this year, as the authorities recognised that the small banks’ voices could be drowned out by the bigger players with more to lose from the inquiry. \nThe minutes of the round-table event show challengers are worried about the current state of the market. “Unless there was a major rethink, Lloyds would continue to dominate the current account and mortgage market ,and RBS the SME and corporate banking market,” the minutes said. \nPaul Lynam, the chief of Secure Trust Bank , said the authorities could make a series of regulatory changes “overnight” to open up the market to more competition. \nHe said the government should follow the US’ approach and only apply the tough Basel III capital rules to the biggest banks, rather than adding to small banks’ costs, as the small banks do not represent a risk to the wider financial system if they fail. \nMr Lynam also said banks with a balance sheet of less than £10bn should not be subject to the full rules, again because the regulations are designed for banks whose failure could wreck the economy, rather than modestly-sized lenders. \n“By definition the smaller firms do not pose systemic risks therefore there is no logic in requiring them to slavishly adhere to regulations to prevent systemic risks arising,” he said. \nThe CMA denied that its investigation lacks rigour. The provisional report is expected to come out next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:02:23.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
