[O/R] \nU.S. crude was down about 0.2 percent in Asian trading at $45.82 a barrel, after rallying 4 percent on U.S. Energy Information Administration data that showed strong demand for gasoline. \nBrent, which gained 2.8 percent in the previous session, was slightly lower at $48.87. \nSpot gold inched up from U.S. levels to $1,112.20 an ounce, but was still on track to drop nearly 1 percent for the week. \n(Additional reporting by Ayai Tomisawa in Tokyo; Editing by Shri Navaratnam & Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T06:51:52.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
