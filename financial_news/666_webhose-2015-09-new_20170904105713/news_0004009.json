ADVERTISEMENT “Sales activity was down in many parts of the country last month — especially in the South and West — as the persistent summer theme of tight inventory levels likely deterred some buyers,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR chief economist.\n“The good news for the housing market is that price appreciation the last two months has started to moderate from the unhealthier rate of growth seen earlier this year,” he added. \nSteady jobs growth has boosted the housing market, which had been slow to recover from the economic downturn. But the sector gradually hit its stride this year, contributing to rising builder confidence. SPONSORED CONTENT \nMeaningful tax reform starts with tax simplification.
