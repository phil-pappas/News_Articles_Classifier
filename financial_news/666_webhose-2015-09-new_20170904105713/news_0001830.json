It had a cashflow deficit of 11 billion dirhams. \nAs Morocco's only refinery, its closure would make the country entirely reliant on imports. At just under 300,000 barrels per day, Morocco's petroleum consumption is Africa's fifth largest, according to data from the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Energy Information Administration. \nThe closure could also impact Moroccan banks exposed to Samir's debt, experts say. \nSaudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi, owner of Corral Holdings, which controls 67.26 pct of Samir, has been negotiating with the Moroccan government to find a compromise to end the company's crisis.
