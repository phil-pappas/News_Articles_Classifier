He is currently being held at HM Prison Wandsworth. \n“It’s not a surprise that Mr Hayes is appealing the sentence given its surprising length,” Stephen Pollard, a London-based lawyer at WilmerHale, told Bloomberg . \n“The Court of Appeal may embrace the opportunity to clarify sentencing parameters for these kinds of cases because there are fewer.” \nHayes was found guilty last month of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud, after a week of deliberations at the end of a two-month trial. \nThe Serious Fraud Office argued that the former derivatives broker at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) was at the centre of a network of traders at 10 firms that conspired to manipulate the Libor benchmark between 2006 and 2010. \nMr Justice Cooke told London's Southwark Crown Court that the sentence was intended to send a message to the rest of the banking world. \n\"You played a leading role in the manipulation of Libor. You exerted pressure on others, essentially trained those junior to you in the activity, made corrupt payments to brokers for their assistance,\" said the judge. \n\"The conduct involved here is to be marked out as dishonest and wrong, and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly. The reputation of Libor is important to the City, as a financial sector, and the banking institutions of this City. Probity and honesty is essential, as is trust.\" \n\"The Libor activity, in which you played a leading role, put all that in jeopardy,\" he said. \nSince the Libor scandal was uncovered, more than half a dozen banks have paid billions of pounds in fines and several have fired their chief executives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:52:24.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
