The $550 she earned each week from her main gigs as a deli clerk and Lyft driver disappeared as fast as it came in –sometimes faster—on rent, gas, bills, dining out, a debt collection agency, and child support for her 12-year-old daughter, who lives primarily with her father and stepmother in a better school district.[tweet_Quote: display=\"She was spending too much effort nickel-and-diming herself to death, so she shifted her mindset. #Millennial #money\"]It finally came to a head when she realized that she was spending way too much time and effort nickel-and-diming herself to death.[/tweet_Quote: ] “I was SO tired of feeling out of control of my finances. I am in my 30s, watching my friends back home get married and have babies and second babies and purchasing homes, and I am still renting, working odd jobs, and auditioning as much as possible. I regularly feel my line of work, where I am, doesn't have job security, so I wanted to make sure I had financial security so I didn't go completely crazy.”[caption id=\"attachment_651\" align=\"\" width=\"1896\"] Nikki Pierce made a serious mind-shift about money, and it's working for her.[/caption]Pierce knew she needed to make some changes, and one sunny Saturday morning, sat down and took a hard look at how she was earning, spending, saving and wasting money. [tweet_Quote: display=\"6 ways this #Millennial was being counter-productive about money, and what she did about it. #personalfinance\"]Here’s where she realized she was being counter-productive, and what she did about it:[/tweet_Quote: ]\nShe was over-shopping for groceries: “I took note of what I was throwing away, and made a conscious effort when going to the grocery store to make a ‘do not buy’ list. I saved a lot of money that way, as I was buying things I thought I needed, but was really just tossing.” She was shocked to see that she was wasting about $30 on extra fruits, salads, and vegetables every time she went to the store. t She was spending too much going out: Pierce mitigated her “on the go” situation by being better prepared. “I made simple things to eat, and took them with me, and kept my home stocked with beer and wine so I wouldn't be tempted to spend triple the amount at a bar.” She stopped socializing over dinner and drinks, and saw her friends in other venues where she wouldn’t need to spend so much. t Cash was flowing too freely: “I was spending a lot of time worrying about cheaper gas, and would keep cash on me in order to pay 10 cents less, but when I had cash, I would spend it more readily, and be less likely to know where it was going,” she said. “I made an effort to immediately deposit the cash I made into the bank, so I wasn't tempted to spend it.” t She wasn’t saving: She worked out a deal that instead of sending monthly cash to her daughter’s father, who is in a dual-income household, she’d instead funnel the money into a savings account for her daughter to pay directly for things as needed, such as dance lessons. t She was missing opportunities: She made a conscious effort to pick up more shifts at work, and if she didn’t have an audition the next day, she’d ask people working if they needed the day off, just in case, and let it be known if they needed shift coverage, she was their woman. She got into a work-study program for her improv class, saving about $400 every two months on tuition. t She wasn’t maximizing her earning power: She looked for holes in her schedule and started driving Lyft a morning or two each week. She also turned on her app on her way home from work, so she could make more during rush hour. When she was driving across town after an audition, she’d make a few bucks by picking up a fare on her way home. “I also am a really great nanny, and finally put my name in the hat of an online group for actors who are also sitters. I was connected with a dad, who uses me for six to nine hours a week now, which is flexible, as he's an actor as well.” How she shifted her mindset [tweet_Quote: display=\".@nikkinikkip did an about-face, adopting a #prosperity mindset. #personalfinance #money\"]Pierce did an about-face, adopting a prosperity mindset.[/tweet_Quote: ] “I rerouted my thinking to focus on earned income rather than pinching pennies,” she said. “I had a few really rough months, as three of my good friends were getting married over the course of three months. All were out of town. I was constantly wondering, ‘why am I so broke?’ but seeing that 60% of my funds were going to travel really made me feel more stable. I was able to see it was a temporary bind, and not going to be the case forever, which made me feel a lot better.”She also employed some helpful tools and rules, including Mint to track her money flow. She set up automatic payments for her debts and student loans.Pierce’s income includes tips and it varies from week to week. “I keep track of the money each shift, then add it up at the end of the week to make sure I am making enough to cover bills. If I make a lot extra, I will usually put some in savings, and treat myself to something nice as well,” she said. Building her future For the first time in 10 years, Pierce has a credit card, paying off the full balance immediately and keeping her purchases on it minimal. She was told by her bank that within six months, if she did well, “I could probably be approved for a new card, which would enable me to get cash back rewards on purchases like groceries and gas.”In the few months she made the switch, she’s bumped up her earnings by about $400 a month. Any acting money she makes goes directly into savings.And finally, she’s got her eyes on another prize: Her own wedding next spring. “I am using all my babysitting money as savings for that.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nikkinikkip", "https://www.mint.com/"], "published": "2015-09-11T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:22:39.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
