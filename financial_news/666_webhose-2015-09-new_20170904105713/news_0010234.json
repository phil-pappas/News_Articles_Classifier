The airline was set up to perform flights from London Heathrow, Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, feeding Virgin Atlantic's long-haul network.\nHowever, Virgin Atlantic decided to axe the carrier just seven months later, in October 2014, due to weak demand .\n“The final Edinburgh and Aberdeen Little Red flights were on Saturday, Sept. 26,” a Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman told ATW . These were the final services still being operated by the carrier.\nVirgin Atlantic secured nine of Little Red’s 12 London Heathrow slot pairs as part of a European Commission remedy package, when British Airways (BA) acquired bmi.\n“They [the slots] will now be returned to BA and will remain available for airlines wishing to start operations or add frequency on the remedy routes,” the spokeswoman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:24:42.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
