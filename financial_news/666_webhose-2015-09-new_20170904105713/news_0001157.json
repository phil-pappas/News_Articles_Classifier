The suspension was seen as a diplomatic victory for the Obama administration, coming shortly after visits to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. \nIn July, China's legislature adopted a sweeping national security law that said all key network infrastructure and information systems must be \"secure and controllable\". \n(Reporting by Kazunori Takada and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Paul Tait and Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:26:39.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
