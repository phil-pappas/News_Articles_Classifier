It’s Friday and I don’t know about you but I’m ready for a long weekend. Before we get the party started I want to tell you about a few REITs that are yielding at least 7%.To bring some luck to your weekend I selected seven of my best REITs that pay 7% or higher – [tweet_Quote: display=\"I’ll call this is the “lucky 7 list”\"]I’ll call this the “lucky 7 list”[/tweet_Quote: ] .I’m not going to suggest these REITs simply because they are high yielding though, that would be foolish, especially since I preach regularly to avoid the “sucker yields”.Instead, I have hand-picked the “lucky 7” REITs based on my thorough examination of these securities and I have BUY recommendations on all of these names in my Forbes Real Estate Investor newsletter.\nForbes Real Estate Investor Earn safe, reliable income with the help of veteran real estate expert Brad Thomas in Forbes' newest advisory Forbes Real Estate Investor . In no logical order I’ll start with STAG Industrial (STAG).The Boston-based REIT has a market cap of around $1.2 billion and the company pays an attractive dividend yield of 7.6%. Mr. Market has beaten up STAG most of this year and that of course is why the shares are cheap today (with a price of $18.07 and a P/FFO multiple of 12.4x).The next pick is Whitestone REIT (WSR). This shopping center REIT is not risk-free as the company owns and operates shopping centers in Texas and Arizona. Much of the risk here has to do with the company’s small size ($321 million market cap) concentration of properties in Houston and also because of the company’s history of not increasing its dividend. Keep in mind that WSR has become safer as a result of its accretive investments and this year the company should be able to cover its dividend. Shares are trading at $11.89 with a dividend yield of 9.6%. New Senior (SNR) was spun out of the Fortress family and the externally-managed REIT invests in Senior Housing properties across the US. Two of the bigger risks associated with SNR are high leverage and tenant concentration. While these risks are elevated, Mr. Market has mis-priced shares (now trading at $11.37) and the 9.1% dividend yield is seemingly more attractive. With a market cap of around $980 million, most if the shares are owned by hedge funds so beware of above average trading volatility. Ladder Commercial (LADR) is an interesting REIT pick. I am covering this security in greater detail in my upcoming Forbes Real Estate Investor newsletter. What makes LADR an attractive pick is the fact that this REIT invests in 5 different products, all providing integrated components that generate sound risk adjusted returns. Most of LADR’s revenue is derived from mortgage-based products and what makes this REIT special is its very modest payout ratio (of around 55%). The small cap ($1.5 billion) company is now paying a 7.2% yield with shares trading at $15.27.Another commercial mortgage REIT, Starwood Property Trust (STWD), is also on my “luck 7 list” with a dividend yield of 8.9%. What makes STWD attractive is its close association with big brother, Starwood Capital Group, a privately held asset manager founded in 1991 by Barry Sternlicht. STWD is able to leverage from SCG’s global network and 24 years of knowledge and relationships. STWD shares are trading at $21.69 that boast an attractive yield of 8.9%. Medical Properties Trust (MPW) invests in hospitals in the US and Germany. Although smaller than many of the peers (MPW’s market cap is ~2.386 billion) the company has been able to generate robust earnings and dividend growth. MPW is a notch below investment grade (S&P BB+) and for those willing to pursue a slightly riskier healthcare REIT MPW’s 7.7% dividend yield could be a good fit.Finally, W.P. Glimcher (WPG) rounds out the “luck 7 list”. This REIT owns a combination of malls and shopping centers and many of the mall properties are anchored by troubled department store chains, Sears and JC Penney. To mitigate these risks, WPG has put together a tactical investment strategy to redevelop its centers ($265 million of approved projects in the pipeline). In addition, most of the anchor leases are below market so there is upside.Also WPG expects to mitigate risks by migrating the balance sheet over the next several years through future EBITDA growth and opportunistic asset sales. WPG has also previously mentioned the willingness to issue common equity, but current pricing is far from levels that make sense today. Shares are trading at $11.86 with a dividend yield of 8.4%.This concludes my “lucky 7 list” and now go have some fun!The author owns shares in STAG, WSR, LADR, MPW, and WPG.\nAdded Disclaimer : The author's direct family member is General Counsel of Blue Harbor (owned by Fortress).\nSources: SNL Financial.\nBrad Thomas is the Editor of the Forbes Real Estate Investor and writes for Forbes.com and Seeking Alpha.
