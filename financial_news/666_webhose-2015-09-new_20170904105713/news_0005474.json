Consumer prices reached 4.74 percent in the twelve months to August.\nPolicymakers on the bank's board have held borrowing costs at 4.5 percent for the last 12 months. However, analysts have said the board ought to raise the rate to counteract inflation.\nBut Vallejo said consumer price increases, spurred by a 51 percent depreciation in the peso currency and higher food prices due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, cannot be offset by rate rises.\n\"When people get nervous and believe that all prices are going to go up, that creates a contagion and they start to ask for better wages, people stock up before prices rise and it becomes an inflation spiral that has no relation to reality,\" Vallejo said.\n\"That can do a lot of damage to the economy. If that happens you don't act using rates,\" he added.\nA peso-to-dollar exchange rate of 2,600 or 2,800 pesos to the dollar would be reasonable, the policymaker added. The currency was 2,984.9 to the dollar on Monday.
