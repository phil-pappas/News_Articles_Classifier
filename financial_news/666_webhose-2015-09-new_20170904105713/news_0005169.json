More Joy Global slips 14% on lowered outlook \nKaty Huberty, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said consumer intentions to purchase a Fitbit device had climbed 2 percentage points in its most recent survey, which aligned with retailer checks that indicated demand for the company’s wearable gear has held steady ahead of the key holiday sales season. \nMs Huberty added that current “Fitbit users who plan to purchase Apple Watch fell one-third since May to 20 per cent in July. We continue to believe overlap between the product portfolios are minimal at this point.” \nThe upgrade accompanied recent research that showed Apple’s market share of the wearable device market increasing to roughly one-third, taking business away from Jawbone, Motorola, Microsoft and Nike , which moved to stop developing its FuelBand fitness-tracking bracelet last year. \nApple shares climbed 2 per cent to $111.64. \nGeneral Motors shares rose 3 per cent to $29.71 after Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne said over the weekend that a tie-up with GM remained a “high priority”. \nWhile the Detroit-based automaker has spurred Fiat’s advances , Mr Marchionne said a merger would “be the best possible strategic alternative for us and for them”, according to a Reuters report. \nFiat Chrysler shares trading in New York advanced 7 per cent to $14.49. \nGeneral Electric advanced 3 per cent to $24.70 after the company won EU approval for its deal to purchase Alstom’s energy business on the condition that the merged group will divest significant turbine operations. \nTeco Energy shares jumped 24 per cent to $26.06 after the Florida-based utilities company agreed to be acquired by Canadian energy group Emera for $10.4bn in an all-cash deal. \nTeco shareholders will receive $27.55 a share in cash — a 48 per cent premium to Teco’s closing stock price on July 15, the last trading day before reports regarding its strategic review hit the wires. The deal includes the assumption of $3.9bn in debt. \nEmera shares trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell 5 per cent to $42. \nMedia group Meredith Corporation climbed 10 per cent to $50.37 after it agreed to a $3.1bn buyout from Media General , the US television station owner. \nThe combined company, which will be named Meredith Media General , will operate 88 stations in 54 markets, making it the country’s third-largest local TV operator. Media General shares slipped less than 1 per cent to $11.08. \nOverall, US equity markets followed European markets higher after the long holiday weekend and a bruising trading session on Friday. \nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent to 1,951.70 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6 per cent to 16,366.08. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 4,769.85.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:43:04.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
