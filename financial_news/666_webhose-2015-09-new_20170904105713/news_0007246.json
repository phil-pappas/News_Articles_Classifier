Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl Australia, South Korea and Malaysia are jointly working on a plan to deal with the rise of violent extremism in the region which is due to be released at the East Asian Summit in November.\nForeign minister Julie Bishop revealed the cooperation on Friday after the first formal talks between Australian and Korean defence and foreign ministers in Australia where a series of new cooperation measures between the two countries on defence, police and disaster management were agreed.\nThe two countries - which are each large trading partners of China - also said they had a common interest in seeing the development of a code of conduct for dealing with tensions between China and several Southeast Asian countries on territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In a notable comment Korean foreign minister Yun Byung-se said his country wanted to do more to engage with other countries in the region on challenging issues including \"the China matter.\"\nBoth Ms Bishop and Mr Yun talked up growing cooperation between the two countries via a new middle-power group which also includes Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey which Mr Yun said had removed the tyranny of distance between the countries.\nMr Yun said was considering ways for Korea to contribute more to the refugee crisis being caused by violent extremism in the Middle East but he did not comment on whether his country would join any military action in the region.\nMs Bishop played down the possibility that Australia's decision to allow its air force to conduct bombing missions against the Islamic State forces in Syria would lead to any further action to move against Syrian leader Bashar Al-Asaad.\nShe said that while Australia had been involved in discussions about a transition from the Al-Asaad regime since 2011 and that would continue, Australia was not stepping up its military operations in the region to achieve regime change in Syria.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-09-11T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:53:35.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
