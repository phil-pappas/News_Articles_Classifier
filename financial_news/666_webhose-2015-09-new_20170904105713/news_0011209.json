It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) must weigh the offer against a competing proposal submitted by Sportingbet owner GVC, which is gate-crashing a deal already agreed between Bwin and 888. \nThe latest twist in the takeover saga marks a success for Bwin’s board, which has effectively engineered a bidding war between 888 and GVC . \nAlthough Bwin recommended an £898.3m cash-and-paper offer from 888 in mid-July, rival suitor GVC refused to concede defeat and made a takeover proposal worth about £1bn last month. \nBwin’s board and shareholders had some concerns with GVC’s bid, but the company kept the takeover battle alive by working with the latter gambling group to iron out those problems. Once the worries were overcome, Bwin last Thursday incited another round of bids from both suitors by inviting GVC to make a formal offer on its “best terms”. \nBwin, which has been up for sale since last November, said it would now consult with its “key shareholders” over coming days to decide which of the two proposals is in investors’ “best interests”. \nThe terms of 888’s revised approach were not disclosed, although Bwin said that it came with “a number of pre-conditions”. GVC is understood to have made its latest bid on Friday evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T11:07:31.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
