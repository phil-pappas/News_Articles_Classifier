AAP Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Inside the Qantas Club Lounge at Brisbane Airport, Dave Hanna is speaking confidentially about ''Spermgate'', the emerging scandal that weeks later will see him quit as national and Queensland president of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.\nHanna is alone in a private meeting room with Leo Skourdoumbis, the senior CFMEU official appointed by the union to investigate the bizarre but true claims that Hanna procured thousands of dollars from bosses to finance the IVF treatment of a union organiser's wife.\nUnaware they are under surveillance by Australian Federal Police officers attached to the trade union royal commission, their 90-minute conversation on July 16 this year is expletive-laden, indiscreet and, seemingly, incriminating.\nAs an investigator, Skourdoumbis is unorthodox, giving Hanna the \"heads up\" his report would be narrow and not recommend charges be laid by the union.\nHanna says he might be willing to resign provided the union line him up with a new job. Skourdoumbis reassures him the union's national officials, including national secretary, Michael O'Connor, want him \"looked after in whatever way possible\".\n\"The other thing you've got in your favour – for some reason they all think you're gonna f---ing launch you own counter stuff, right?\" Skourdoumbis says.\nThe union hierarchy were right. Hanna unloads on Michael Ravbar, the Queensland CFMEU secretary who laid the complaint against him, alleging Ravbar organised for seven tonnes of documents to be removed from the union on April Fool's Day last year, the same day the commission issued notices to the union to produce documents.\nHanna claims the documents were loaded on to a horse float and that Ravbar told him to take them to Hanna's 10-acre property and burn them.\n 'Too much to burn' \"It was just too much to f---ing burn, the f---ing fire brigade would have turned up. So I put it in the old hay shed, right? And organised a tip truck to come get it, loaded it up, got a training co-ordinator, followed it out to the tip, watched it get tipped over the edge. Gone.\"\nHanna tells Skourdoumbis the dumped documents were \"all CFMEU paperwork relevant to the subpoena\". He says he later fronted O'Connor at a Melbourne coffee shop and produced a copy of the tip truck receipt with Ravbar's name on it.\n\"I said, 'if I'm gonna go so is Michael and I'll f---ing burn the c---'.\"\nHis allegations, unsurprisingly, interested the listening AFP officers. Section 39 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act carries a maximum prison term of five years for the destruction of documents.\nAn investigation was launched, CFMEU employees were questioned by police and the findings formed the basis of four days of commission hearings in Brisbane this week.\nBut under cross-examination from counsel assisting the commission, Sarah McNaughton, witness after witness provided evidence that painted a less sinister picture of what occurred inside the CFMEU offices on April 1 last year.\nIt was correct, staff said, that Ravbar had required them to work after hours. The CFMEU had amalgamated with the Builders Labourers Federation, and BLF employees were moving in, bringing a mountain of largely archival material with them.\nRavbar had delayed the annual office clean up to coincide with the move. Boxes were everywhere, and Ravbar, known as an exacting manager, wanted order restored\nFiles were sorted and documents were shredded. Two primary school children, presumably bored waiting for their mother to finish work, were allowed to help with the shredding. \"They were old enough not to stick their fingers in [the shredder],\" one employee told the hearing.\nA horse float was backed up in front of the building. In full view of peak hour traffic, dozens of boxes were loaded into the horse float and a box trailer. Given it was largely BLF mess, Ravbar made it Hanna's job to dump the load. He said later that he assumed it would be taken to a tip as had occurred with previous annual clean ups.\nInstead, the horse float and trailer drove to Hanna's house. Later that week, two staff members returned to the property, throwing the boxes into a fire pit, in an attempt to burn them. One worker telephoned Hanna and told them it would take \"weeks\" to burn the material. Hanna decided to hire a truck, using a backhoe to load the boxes. He put soil on top of the truck to stop papers falling out. The truck was taken to a tip and the load, weighing in at 6.86 tonnes, was dumped.\nSuspicious activity What made all this activity the more suspicious was that the after-hours clean out occurred on the same day that the CFMEU received the commission subpoenas. Records showed O'Connor emailed officials, including Ravbar and Queensland staff, notifying them of the notice to produce documents on that afternoon of the document disposal. Ravbar said he did not see the O'Connor email, which was marked \"urgent\", until the next day.\nOver the course of this week, Hanna was proving to be a somewhat unreliable witness.\nOn Monday, he admitted to the commission he was never invoiced for $100,000 in work done by tradesmen on his house. Insisting he was not \"overly concerned\" about not being billed for plumbing, electrical, carpentry and other work done in 2013, he said while he thought he would eventually receive the invoices, he never did.\nAsked why a project manager was being so \"magnanimous\" in overseeing the building of his house, Hanna said: \"I guess the same reason why some lawyers do work – pro bono work, you know, it's – people do things for – you know, they do favours for people. They do – they help out, out of the kindness of their hearts.\"\nLater, on Monday, Hanna was questioned about the document destruction but, unaware he had been under surveillance, he told the commission that the documents were largely archival material brought from the BLF.\nHe denied showing the truck receipt to O'Connor, claiming he had \"no idea\" if the documents dumped in the tip were relevant to the commission subpoena.\nAfter the commission was played excerpts of his airport conversation with Skourdoumbis, Hanna claimed a number of his airport lounge claims were \"embellished\" as he wanted revenge on Ravbar for making the complaint about Spermgate.\n(Hanna quit in August after the Skourdoumbis probe into Spermgate found he obtained $3000 in funds from two subcontractors to contribute to the cost of IVF treatment undergone by the partner of organiser, Mick Myles. Ravbar told the commission he viewed Hanna's conduct as \"corrupt\".)\nBut on Tuesday, presumably after legal advice, Hanna changed tack, insisting he showed O'Connor the truck receipt, and that Ravbar organised the document removal because the union was about to receive the commission notice to produce documents.\nIn one of his most damaging claims, later denied by Ravbar, Hanna alleged Ravbar had banners put over the office security cameras to ensure the removal of the documents could not be recorded. However, employees told the commission that they covered the cameras under instruction from Hanna.\nHanna admitted that after Ravbar made the complaint about the IVF payments, he drove out to the excavation company where he had hired the tip truck and obtained a copy of the receipt.\nUnfortunately for him, the receipt was made out in his name. He said he deleted his name, and added Ravbar's name, photocopying the document at home before bringing it to Melbourne to show O'Connor. CFMEU bookkeeper Cherie Shaw told the hearing that Hanna had originally told her to \"get rid\" of the receipt recording the $770 payment for the tip truck hire.\nNothing secret Ravbar later told the commission that he found out the security cameras had been covered two weeks after the removal of the documents. He said he would have uncovered them if he had known, because there was nothing secret about the document disposal.\nHe said he did not know that Hanna had taken the horse float of documents to his property to burn them. He said he thought they were being sent to a local tip.\nBy the time Hanna was cross-examined again on Thursday, his version was crumbling. Questioned by counsel for the CFMEU, John Agius, Hanna admitted he never looked at the documents and did not know if they were relevant to the commission subpoena.\nHanna agreed that he made claims to Skourdoumbis about Ravbar because he wanted to damage him and get the word out to the CFMEU leadership that he \"had the goods\" on Ravbar. He said he wanted the CFMEU's national executive to know that if he was going down, he would take Ravbar with him.\nThe commission will deliver its findings as part of its final report due at the end of the year. Based on the evidence, it appears that Hanna has attempted to exploit the fact that the office clean out occurred on the same day as the issuing of the commission subpoena to pay back Ravbar and give him leverage as the union considered action over the IVF payments.\nSome elements of this bizarre affair do not make sense. Why would Hanna cover up the security cameras? Why would he tell an employee to get rid of the $770 receipt? And it is an extraordinary coincidence that the destruction occurred on the same day the commission issued the notices.\nAfter days of hearings, it was evident that Ravbar was more credible than Hanna in the witness box. No evidence was produced that the destroyed documents, many of which were retained electronically, would expose untoward conduct by the CFMEU. Meanwhile, Hanna will likely face criminal charges over the free renovations to his house.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:07:18.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
