The Captain has abandoned the ship and gone missing leaving the burden of steering the party on old shoulders like always,” the editorial in RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya said, in an evident jibe at Rahul Gandhi.\n“While some say his absence is indicative of his pre-poll fatigue, Congress apologists describe his trip as another occasion for some sort of an unknown global meet.\n“Whatever be the reason, the fact is that the country’s oldest party, contesting merely 41 seats, and bearing the burden of a historic embarrassment, is not even in the Bihar election race and is only on the fringes,” it said.\nThe editorial also attacked the so-called grand alliance of RJD, JD(U) and Congress, contending the secular and socialist parties in the fray are afraid on account of their internal challenges and the presence of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on the election scene.\n“Secular, socialist parties are afraid. Irrespective of who loses Bihar polls, secularism will be ultimately harmed.\nCommunal leader (Owaisi) will cut into not the radical communal votes but the liberal secular vote. These so called secular parties are trying to tell the masses that secular votes will be cut. No wonder they share this common fear in Bihar,” the editorial said.\nWithout naming Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal , it also took a dig at him, saying he too had abandoned the Bihar election scene to put its own house in order in Delhi and to address the controversy created by a former cabinet colleague. “At least AAP has a valid reason to be absent from Bihar,” it said.\nAbout Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh’s recent twitter post showing RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Owaisi as two sides of the same face, another article in Panchjanya said, “Digvijay Singh is commenting on a match where he is neither a player nor an umpire. In the game of Bihar elections, the Congress is camped outside the stadium.”\n 27, 2015 7:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T00:25:24.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
