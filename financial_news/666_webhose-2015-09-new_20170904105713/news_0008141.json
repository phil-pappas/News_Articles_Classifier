It has been punished this year amid a rout in emerging market currencies.\nPolicymakers from the finance ministry and central bank said in a statement that they were watching global markets to see if they needed to adjust the program, which sells up to $400 million a day and was set to expire on Sept. 30.\nA Reuters poll forecast Mexico would hold the program steady without changes.\nSince starting dollar auctions in December, Mexico's reserves have fallen by about 5 percent to around $183 billion as the country sold more than $15 billion.
