PUBLISHED: 13:53, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:08, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 GETTY Tesco has cut clubcard points for credit card customers \nFrom December 1 the supermarket will offer its credit card customers just one point for every £8 spent outside of stores, double the current £4 limit.Shoppers will still be able to earn 1 point for every £4 spent at Tesco. However, some of its 2.8million customers have been left angry about the changes and threatened to close cards. One Twitter user wrote: \"Tesco REDUCING the amount of Clubcard points you can collect with #Tescocreditcard!! #disappointed\" \nAnother said: \"Farewell @Tesco - after your outrageous changes to clubcard points, no value in me using your credit card anymore..\"The supermarket is the latest provider to scale back perks and rewards off the back of the rule change from Brussels.Over the summer, Capital One axed cashback for all new customers and existing card holders have seen offers reduced or removed.Shortly after, taxpayer-owned RBS and NatWest closed its YourPoints scheme that gave customers points to spend with retailer partners. The latest changes by Tesco could spark a flurry of providers to follow suit and reduce rewards, according to experts. Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.co.uk said: \"We have already seen providers withdrawing or reducing their rewards well before the EU changes come into place and with a big brand like Tesco changing their rewards, it’s highly likely other card issuers will be assessing whether they can sustain their own deals.\"This would be a perfect time for shoppers to check their current deal and think about whether they are still giving them the best value. \"It’s especially important to assess whether they have a good credit card deal in the run up to December, as it is not only the EU deadline on interchange fee caps, but also the time of year where people use the plastic to cover Christmas. \n\"If customers are getting little to no reward, they may be better off switching to a competitive cashback card to get a little back for each time they spend.” Related articles Start saving £28 a week NOW to have enough cash for Christmas \nAmong the best credit card cashback and reward schemes still on the market are Santander's 123 credit card, which pays up to three per cent on spending on petrol and national rail travel and, American Express's Platinum Cashback Everyday credit card that pays five per cent on spending up to £2,500 for the first three months and 1.25 per cent thereafter.A Tesco Bank spokesperson said: “As a result of changes in the credit card industry taking affect this year, the amount that card companies earn from businesses who accept credit cards is reducing. \"At Tesco Bank, we use that income to fund the Clubcard benefits we give back to our customers, and as a result, we’ve had to make some changes to the amount of points our customers earn.\"Customers will continue to receive the same amount of Clubcard points when they use their credit card in Tesco. Furthermore, they will still earn Clubcard points almost every time they use their card. However, because of the impact of the new regulation, the amount of points customers receive when they use their card out of Tesco is reducing to 1 point for every £8 spent.“While we are disappointed that the industry changes have resulted in the need to reduce the Clubcard earn rate on our cards when they are used outside of Tesco, we have worked hard to ensure that our credit cards continue to offer great value for customers. \"We are committed to offering the most rewarding cards we can.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:47:27.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
