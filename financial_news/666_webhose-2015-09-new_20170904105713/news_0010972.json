Victoria Cleland, the Bank's chief cashier, said that De La Rue (Other OTC: DELRF - news ) , which is in charge of the contract, will start printing the new notes this month. \nThe £10 polymer note featuring author Jane Austen is expected to enter circulation in 2017. \nThe £20 note is Britain's most common tender, with around 1.9 billion in circulation at the end of February, compared with 737 million £10 notes, according to Bank data. Ms Cleland said the switch to plastic would help to reduce fraud and ensure banknotes were more durable. \n\"Experience from central banks that have issued polymer banknotes has been positive. Canada, for example, has seen a real reduction in counterfeit levels since launching its polymer series a few years ago. Polymer is also cleaner and more durable, leading to better quality notes in circulation,\" she said in a speech in Bristol. \nThe Bank is yet to decide whether it will print £50 polymer notes. \nEarlier this year, Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, asked the public this year to nominate the face of the next £20 note . The historical figure, who should \"celebrate Britain’s achievements in the visual arts\", will be unveiled next spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:56:06.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
