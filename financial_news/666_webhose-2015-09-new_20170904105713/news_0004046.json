Last year the department had set up a system of monitoring and handling the litigation at the field level to prevent delays in responding to the directions of the courts after the scathing observation of the Principal Bench of CESTAT.\nInstructing its officials to issue show-cause notices after thorough examination and on the grounds which are cogent, sustainable, and backed by legal provisions and pronouncements, the CBEC has also told its officials to pass quality adjudicating orders which can stand legal scrutiny of appellate authority.\nUrging the officials to pass adjudication orders within the specified time, the CBEC said that the field officials should follow judicial discipline while deciding pending show case notices and appeals.\n“Instructions issued with regard to the threshold limit for filing appeals before various fora must be applied scrupulously. The system of monitoring and handling the litigation at the field level to prevent delays should be strengthened,” the Board said.\nHard talk\nExpressing dismay, over a case where the showcause notice was not adjudicated for as long as 17 years, the Board pointed out that not passing these orders within the time limit has also earned the wrath of various courts and appellate authorities, while weakening the department’s case.\nUrging officials to pass adjudication orders within the specified time, the CBEC said that the field officials should follow judicial discipline while deciding pending show case notices and appeals\n 20, 2015 8:13 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:39:45.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
