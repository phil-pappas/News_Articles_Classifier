But the currency has since struggled, as jitters over Greece and then China have reduced expectations that the Fed will move at its September meeting next week.\n\"Market sentiment remains extremely fragile, predominantly because of concerns about a China slowdown and emerging markets, and then next week we've got the Fed,\" said Rabobank senior currency strategist Jane Foley in London.\n\"So the market is trying to come to terms with that and work out whether or not its positions are in the right place.\"\nOn Tuesday the euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1182 . Sterling was half a percent up at $1.5345, as traders bought back the currency after a steep sell-off.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was up 0.7 percent at 120.23 , as numbers showed Japan's economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter but capital expenditure fell more than originally forecast.\nJapan's Nikkei stock index fell 2.4 percent, dragged lower as Shanghai stocks dropped in the wake of the disappointing Chinese data.\n\"In terms of dollar/yen, it has been led back and forth by equities - particularly the impact of Chinese shares on Japanese stocks,\" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.\n\"The correlation might last a few weeks, depending on what Chinese authorities further do to shore up stocks, macroeconomic data, and performance by U.S. equities. We are not at a full blown financial crisis, so that is preventing many participants from going long outright on the yen,\" he said.
