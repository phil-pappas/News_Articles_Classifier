In other news: the U.S. trade deficit is the lowest in five months; U.S. second quarter productivity is strongest in 18 months; and, August job creation falls below expectations. \nAfter an initial drop in the U.S. markets on Monday and Tuesday, the markets rebounded Wednesday in anticipation of the jobs report on Friday . The current market expectation for a Fed rate hike in September is 50 percent; but the jobs report this Friday could change that. Financial-market turmoil over the last few weeks has dropped the initial high probability of a September rate hike to just even. If economic data remains stable over the next couple of weeks, the jobs report could be the deciding factor. The expectation is for 223,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, and an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent. Whenever the rate hike does occur, it is expected to be small. \nThe U.S. trade deficit declined in July to its lowest level in 5 months . The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed -7.4 percent to $41.9 billion (down from $45.2 billion in the previous month). Exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, despite a strong dollar; imports fell -1.10 percent to $230.4 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit dropped to $56.2 billion (from $59.0 billion in the prior month). The impact on GDP is a modest annual 3.7 percent. \nU.S. productivity rose to its strongest pace in 18 months . The Labor Department showed productivity rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate (far higher than the 1.3 percent rise last month). As a result, the government revised second quarter GDP to 3.7 percent annual pace (far higher than the 2.3 percent expected). However, the trend in productivity remains weak, rising only 0.7 percent from a year ago; the weak trend suggests the economic growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent economists are estimating. Hourly wage compensation increased 1.8 percent (unchanged from the prior month). \nU.S. private sector job growth falls short of expectations . According to the ADP employment report, which measures private payrolls, only 190,000 new jobs were created (far below the 223,000 expected); this could mean that the jobs report on Friday will rise less than expected. The report showed that job creation was concentrated in small businesses (50 employees or less), which increased 85,000 positions; medium-sized firms (50-499 employees) grew 66,000; and, large firms (500+ employees) added 40,000 positions. \nIf you're trading options, it is suggested trading Put and Call Credit spreads for the week at 2.5 standard deviations or greater. Expect the price of the SPX to fall within 1900 and 2004 (2 standard deviations) by this Friday. \nFor more information about options, see the 'Suggested Links' below.
