Local Chapters empowered professional women to explore not only their own backgrounds but also the many diverse cultures and collective heritage of all NAPW members. Energized by stories about family businesses, rich traditions and the perseverance and courage of ancestors, NAPW Chapter members were inspired to celebrate established legacies and create new ones for future generations. “ NAPW members have diverse backgrounds, beliefs, perspectives and lifestyles,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “During Family Heritage Month, Local Chapters held events where members shared all about their family legacies, memories, traditions and cultures. I’m a firm believer in the importance of knowing your past, so you can move forward to the future with confidence.”\nIn NAPW’s Western Region, professional women gathered at Local Chapter meetings to celebrate all things family. Members in San Diego, CA, and Salt Lake City, UT, did what many families do: bonded over food during Family Lunch & Learns. In Palo Alto, CA, members got a science lesson on DNA, while members in Long Beach, CA, gave thanks as a member of their NAPW ‘family,’ outgoing President Julia D. Whitley, stepped down. Members and guests in Phoenix, AZ, North Orange County, CA, and Kansas City Metro, KS, shared stories and family trees.\nAt Chapter events in NAPW’s Eastern Region, members gathered at networking events that also focused on family history. Members in DeKalkb-Gwinnett, GA, feasted on family dishes and dessert recipes that were compiled into a Chapter Heritage Cookbook. In Fairfax County, CT, members shared personal items and stories for an eclectic Family Heirloom Show & Tell event. Guest speakers inspired attendees in Palm Beach County, FL, and Waldorf, MD, with stories of family and how they influenced their success.\nMembers in NAPW’s Central Region, including Fort Worth, TX, Orland Park, IL and New Orleans, LA, found creative ways to celebrate Family Heritage Month, including hosting a genealogy expert and a family therapist who shared their expertise.\n“NAPW members are continually shaping their own rich heritage through Chapter events around the country, building a lineage of encounters, connections and professional development,” said Louise Newsome, NAPW National Director of Local Chapters and NYC Chapter President.\nFor additional information about NAPW and its Local Chapters, please visit http://www.napw.com .\nFollow NAPW on Facebook , Twitter , NAPW Foundation Twitter and NAPW Foundation Facebook\nAbout NAPW\nNAPW defines success as \"owning your own power.\" As the largest, most-recognized networking organization of professional women in the country, spanning virtually every industry and profession, the National Association of Professional Women (NAPW) is a powerfully vibrant networking community with more than 775,000 members and over 200 Local Chapters.
