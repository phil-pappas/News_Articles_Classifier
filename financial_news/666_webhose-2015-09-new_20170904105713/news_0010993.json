We are pleased to have found a partner who shares our commitment to providing high-quality care to South Central Wisconsin.\" \nThe joint venture will invest $100 million in WRMC and the community over the next 10 years. Investments will include significant advancements in technology, the expansion of clinical services and initiatives - such as WRMC's Wellness Initiative, and facility improvements. LifePoint has also committed to hiring all employees, subject to standard pre-employment screenings, and investing in their professional development. \nAs part of the joint venture, LifePoint will own 80 percent of the hospital, while WRMC and the community will retain a 20 percent ownership stake. Governance of the hospital will be shared equally through the creation of a board with equal representation from both WRMC and LifePoint. This board will help ensure a strong local voice in the operation and strategic direction of WRMC. \n\"We are delighted to welcome WRMC to the LifePoint family,\" said LifePoint Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William F. Carpenter III. \"The hospital has been an invaluable asset to this community for over a century, and we look forward to our future as we continue to grow and enhance the services WRMC provides. Together, we have a great opportunity to transform healthcare delivery and ensure the health and well-being of patients throughout this region.\" \nProceeds from the joint venture transaction will be used to pay off WRMC's existing financial obligations, and the remaining assets will be used to create a substantial charitable foundation focused on community health. The foundation, called the Greater Watertown Community Health Foundation, will be established as an independent, locally governed, non-profit organization benefitting the health and wellbeing of the region. \nAs part of LifePoint, WRMC will become a tax-paying organization, providing a new source of tax revenues that will benefit the community and help fund local projects, support local schools and keep roads safe. \nRichard Keddington will assume the role of WRMC Chief Executive Officer on September 14, replacing John Kosanovich, who will retire after serving as WRMC's CEO for 20 years.

Under Richard's leadership, WRMC will continue to be a trusted choice for healthcare for years to come.\" \nAn experienced hospital administrator, Keddington served for the past five years as CEO of Select Specialty Hospital, a two-campus, 63-bed hospital in Milwaukee, where he managed the hospital's daily operations and implemented an overarching strategic plan.
