Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Australia's coal industry is losing the public relations battle against environmental activists who are trying to shut down fossil fuels, says BHP Billiton's coal business president Mike Henry.\nDespite plummeting international prices and the rise of renewable energy such as wind and solar, Mr Henry said Australia's coal industry was not in terminal decline and the outlook for Australia's thermal and metallurgical coal was strong.\n\"While the overall share of market share of coal may decline, the outright cost competitiveness of coal, as well as the substantial, existing base of installed infrastructure, means we can expect to see demand support for decades to come,\" Mr Henry told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Brisbane on Friday.\n\"I am optimistic that the market will improve in the medium term. But poor returns, and little indication of better times on the immediate horizon, make coal a pretty challenging business at the present time.\"\nIn his first speech since taking over the role, Mr Henry warned the company's cost-cutting drive was not over and could continue further if the coal price continued to fall.\n'We see more opportunity today than when we did when we embarked on this a few years ago. Lots further to go – but as to the end point we don't yet know. There is the potential [for the market] to get worse before it gets better,\" he said.\n'Misinformation' Mr Henry said anti-fossil fuel activists were winning the public debate and the multibillion-dollar resources sector needed to do a better job to counter misinformation.\n \"It would be fair to say that as we stand here today, in the court of public opinion, the 'no-coal' camp has been more effective. Anti-coal activism has been building momentum over many years,\" he said.\n\"We can only hope to secure balanced support for the industry if we step up and help improve the quality of debate and the depth of understanding about what we do, why we do it – and how important it is.\"\nThe Minerals Council of Australia earlier this month launched a major advertising campaign spruiking the \"amazing\" benefits of coal.\nIt followed a concerted strategy by environmental groups to delay and block coal projects through the courts, including Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine project. The federal government has moved to limit legal challenges to those directly affected by a new mine.\nBut Mr Henry said the industry needed to do more to win over the public, starting with a more unified, balanced and credible view on climate change in the lead-up to global talks in Paris later this year. This would include the rapid uptake of low-emissions technology and the company continuing to reduce its own emissions which were down 15 per cent since 2007.\n\"We in the resources industry need to be even more unified in recognising the change that must occur and be an even more active part of the climate change solution,\" he said.\nHe said the coal sector needed to build a common ground between those who wanted to eradicate coal and those who did not believe in climate change.\nMr Henry also used his speech to call on both the Coalition and the Labor Party to push through workplace reforms or Australia would lose business to international competitors.\nHe said big coal companies, such as BHP Billiton, had been working hard to improve productivity and reduce costs since the end of the coal boom, but it was becoming harder to compete against countries such as Russia, Canada and China who could achieve costs savings of $10 to $20 a tonne less than Australia.\n\"The financial sustainability of the Australian coal industry is wholly dependent on our ability to materially improve and sustain levels of productivity to stay one step ahead of our global competition,\" he said.\n\"Governments have a clear stake in this. We need governments to redouble their efforts to reduce regulatory costs and provide long-term certainty by an industry that makes 20 to 30-year investments.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-18T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:08:46.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
