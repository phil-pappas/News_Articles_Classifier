This is to be phased in. \nBut, crucially, it applies only where the family home is bequeathed to children, grandchildren, stepchildren or adopted children. So a couple with no children effectively face a £140,000 bill (40pc death tax applied to £350,000) that couples with children would not have to pay. \n• Inheritance tax: why should childless couples (and their heirs) pay £140,000 more? \nWe first publicised the issue on August 8, prompted by a growing stream of letters and emails from readers dismayed by the exclusion. \nOne of our readers, among the many to complain to his MP, has now received a written response from David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said: \"The Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer have both highlighted that when you become a parent, the wish to pass something on is the most basic, human and natural instinct there is. \n\"Focusing the policy on children and grandchildren ensures parents know that they will be able to pass on the family home that they have worked hard for to the next generation without the worry of inheritance tax.\" \nMr Gauke added that \"around 80pc of estates with both a residence and an inheritance tax liability are expected to be in a position to benefit\". \nrichard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk \n= For more information about inheritance tax, download your free copy of the Telegraph Guide to Inheritance Tax or for professional financial advice call free on 0800 085 0266. =", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:48:34.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
