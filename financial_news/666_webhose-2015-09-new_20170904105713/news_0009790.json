Still, the outlook for the autumn residential real estate market seems robust, according to industry analysts. \"Recent stock market volatility and seasonal trends may give buyers better financial options and more time to make purchase decisions entering the fall,\" says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"August data remains positive with regard to overall housing health as both demand and supply continue to grow.\" In particular, Smoke points to an 8% rise in domestic median home prices on a year-to-year basis (to $233,000) and shorter \"time on the market\" for homes (down 6% on a year-to-year basis, Realtor.com reports ). Smoke says buyers and sellers are both trying to find that elusive sweet spot where supply and demand merge in a way where deals are fair to everyone. \"This year we [saw] inventory continue to grow in August, and while overall demand is strong, the trend in median days on market is suggesting that the market is finding more of a balance,\" says Smoke. \"This bodes well for would-be buyers who have been discouraged by the inability to find a home to buy this spring and summer.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:11:22.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
