AAP Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Former construction union official Dave Hanna has admitted inventing a series of damaging claims against his union rival, Michael Ravbar, during dramatic testimony at the trade union royal commission.\nUnder cross-examination from Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union lawyer John Agius, Mr Hanna admitted he never looked at any of the tonnes of documents that were controversially removed from the union's Queensland office in April last year.\nHe acknowledged that he could not justify an earlier statement to senior union official Leo Skourdoumbis, that the documents were paperwork that was subject to a subpoena issued by the commission.\nMr Hanna admitted that he changed the receipt from the tip truck used to dispose of the documents, adding Mr Ravbar's name in order to implicate him.\nMr Skourdoumbis had been investigating Mr Hanna over his procuring of thousands of dollars from employers to pay for the IVF treatment of a union organiser's wife. The investigation had been triggered in response to a complaint by Mr Ravbar.\nMr Hanna agreed on Thursday that he made claims to Mr Skourdoumbis about Mr Ravbar because he wanted to damage him and get the word out to union officials that he \"had the goods\" on Mr Ravbar .\nHe said he wanted the CFMEU's national executive to know that if he was going down, he would take Mr Ravbar with him.\nSecurity cameras But Mr Hanna insisted Mr Ravbar ordered the security cameras be covered, a claim denied by Mr Ravbar. Other witnesses told the commission they were told by Mr Hanna, not Mr Ravbar, to cover the cameras.\nMr Ravbar earlier told the commission that he found out the security cameras had been covered two weeks after the removal of the documents. He said he would have uncovered them if he had known, because there was nothing secret about the document disposal.\nHe said he did not know that Mr Hanna had taken the horse-float of documents to his property to burn them. He said he thought they were being sent to a local tip.\nHe said he regarded the IVF allegations as a \"corrupt act\". \"David Hanna using his position and procuring a benefit was a big deal,\" he said.\n\"It is that as a senior officer of the union, you should never do that and what took place was – and I didn't hesitate – was he needed to be charged [by the union] under that. I thought it was a corrupt act.\n\"What he did with covering the cameras – poor judgment, I would argue, but in respect of the IVF, that's totally different.\"\nThe commission heard that the Queensland office was emailed by the union's national secretary, Michael O'Connor, about the notice to produce documents on the same day as the document disposal.\nMr Ravbar said he did not see the notice until the following day. He said the documents that were destroyed were largely boxes that had come from the Builders Labourers Federation following its amalgamation with the CFMEU.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-24T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:07:24.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
