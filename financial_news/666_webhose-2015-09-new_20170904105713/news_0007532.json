It’s now a car that the young can aspire. Usually when you’re young, you can’t afford a sports car. But with this, we are trying to reach out to the young aspirants to be able to afford a sports car because in other countries the sports car is a huge segment by itself,” he said at the launch event.\nA product of AadiVenoo owned by Chhabria, the Avanti measures 4,550mm in length, 1,965mm in width, and 1,200mm in height.\nThe car has a Renault-sourced 2.0-litre turbo Euro 5 compliant petrol engine and a six-speed manual transmission.
