Losses forecast in the analysis include supply-chain interruptions and declines in corporations’ revenue, according to the report, which was based on research by Cambridge University.\n“Market crash puts the most GDP at risk globally -- representing nearly a quarter of all cities’ potential losses,” Lloyd’s said . “Man-made threats are becoming increasingly significant.”\nThe report didn’t quantify what constitutes market crashes, other than to say they feature “extreme correlated mass movement of share prices.”\nOil-price shocks or a cyber attack, which could each cost more than $90 billion, were the next-biggest threats in North America, according to the report.\nMarket crashes, cyber attacks, power failures and nuclear accidents account for almost a third of GDP at risk worldwide, Lloyd’s said. Floods were the fourth-largest risk in North America, representing $76.8 billion of possible damage, while a human pandemic could wipe out $56.5 billion of GDP.", "external_links": ["http://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/files/8771-City-Risk-Executive-summary-AW.pdf\\", "http://www.lloyds.com/cityriskindex/\\"], "published": "2015-09-03T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:12:34.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
