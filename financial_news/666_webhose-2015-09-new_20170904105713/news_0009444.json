UK GDP was unexpectedly revised lower to 2.4% year-on-year from the previous estimate of 2.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, it marked a considerable improvement from the 0.4% rate recorded in the previous three months. \n\"Given that the Bank of England has long questioned the official GDP data, producing their own back-casts in their Quarterly Inflation Report, today's revisions should not have a material impact on the thought process of the Monetary Policy Committee,\" said Cebr economist Sam Alderson. \n\"Instead, their focus will be on how the economy performs in the coming months. Given recent indicators, this is unlikely to be strong enough to encourage members to hike rates until the middle of 2016.\" The Eurozone's annual consumer price index fell 0.1% in September compared to a 0.1% increase in August, Eurostat's flash estimate revealed, missing analysts' expectations for zero growth. \n\"The return of inflation to negative territory in the euro-zone will heap additional pressure on the ECB to up the scale of its asset purchase programme,\" said Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics . \nThe Eurozone's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate held steady in September compared with August at 11%, but was down from 11.5% in August last year. The figure for August was revised up a touch from 10.9%. Analysts had been expecting a rate of 10.9% for September. \nGerman unemployment rose by 2,000 in September, compared to estimates for a 5,000 drop and following the previous month's 6,000 decline. The unemployment rate remained at 6.4% this month, as expected. \nGerman retail sales fell 0.4% month-on-month compared with a sharp 1.6% rise registered in July and falling short of analysts' expectations for a 0.2% gain, the Federal Statistics Office said. On a year-on-year basis, retail sales grew 2.5% but remained short of the 3.1% consensus forecast and comfortably below the 3.8% year-on-year increase registered in the previous month. \nStill to come, the US private payrolls report will be released at 1315 BST and the Chicago manufacturing purchasing mangers' index at 1445 BST. \nThe reports come as the Federal Reserve monitors economic data in determining the timing of the first interest rate increase in nine years. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen will speak after the close n St. Louis, potentially elaborating on her remarks that she expected the central bank will raise interest rates this year. \nIn company news, J Sainsbury (Other OTC: JSAIY - news ) was topping the FTSE 100 after saying it expected full-year underlying pre-tax profit to be moderately ahead of its £548 forecast as it reported a 0.3% increase in second quarter retail sales, excluding fuel. The news lifted shares in Morrison Supermarkets and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) . \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) also rallied after saying it has taken proactive steps to position the mining company to withstand current market conditions including weak commodity prices. The group's stocks plunged on Monday after Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) highlighted debt concerns and said there was little equity value for shareholders. \nAviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) was given a boost after Charles Stanley (LSE: CAY.L - news ) upgraded the stock to 'accumulate' from 'hold'. \nEntertainment One (Other OTC: ENTMF - news ) slumped on news it is looking to take a 70% stake in creator and producer Astley Baker Davies Limited, the company that produces the Peppa Pig show, for £140m. The company already holds joint ownership rights for Britain's favourite pig with ABD, and will fund the acquisition through a four-for-nine rights issue raising £193.6m - the extra cash is to pay off debt. N+1 Singer recommended a 'sell' rating on the shares, saying that the proposal looks like a \"rescue rights\" and and questions whether there is a hole in the balance sheet. \nMarket Movers techMARK 2,999.36 +1.36% FTSE 100 6,033.61 +2.10% FTSE 250 16,643.45 +1.22% FTSE 100 - Risers Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 260.00p +13.39% Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 88.60p +10.40% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 167.10p +7.05% Aviva (Amsterdam: AW8.AS - news ) (AV.) 452.40p +5.60% Tesco (TSCO) 180.70p +5.49% Prudential (Amsterdam: PD8.AS - news ) (PRU (HKSE: 2378-OL.HK - news ) ) 1,384.50p +4.06% Legal & General Group (LGEN) 238.80p +3.65% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 188.70p +3.62% Carnival (CCL) 3,429.00p +3.53% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 264.50p +3.52% FTSE 100 - Fallers Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 593.50p -0.50% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,223.00p -0.45% FTSE 250 - Risers Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 81.60p +12.24% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 488.80p +6.66% Victrex plc (LSE: VCT.L - news ) (VCT) 1,749.00p +5.23% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 67.10p +4.60% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 88.65p +4.23% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 172.90p +3.78% Wizz Air Holdings (WIZZ) 2,031.00p +3.62% Croda International (Other OTC: COIHF - news ) (CRDA) 2,745.00p +3.35% Provident Financial (Other OTC: FPLPF - news ) (PFG) 3,152.00p +3.07% esure Group (ESUR) 248.10p +2.95% FTSE 250 - Fallers Entertainment One Limited (ETO) 248.00p -8.82% Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) (ACA) 243.50p -1.70% Computacenter (Swiss: OXCCC.SW - news ) (CCC) 747.50p -0.93% BBA Aviation (LSE: BBA.L - news ) (BBA) 272.80p -0.80% Dechra Pharmaceuticals (LSE: DPH.L - news ) (DPH) 933.50p -0.74% QinetiQ Group (Other OTC: QNTQF - news ) (QQ.) 223.20p -0.71% Wetherspoon (J.D.)
