But while it brings the promise of freedom and adventures, it's important you don't rush in and wind up with a lemon, or a bad loan.\nHere are a few things to consider:\nAdvertisement Setting a budget \"The excitement of buying a car can get in the way of making good financial decisions,\" says Miles Larbey, a senior executive leader in financial literacy at ASIC. Before hitting the car yards, do some research and figure out what you can afford.\nAside from the car's price tag, factor in registration transfer fees and stamp duty, which vary from state to state. Then there are ongoing costs such as petrol, maintenance, roadside assistance, insurance and registration fees.\nNew or second-hand? Don't forget that shiny, brand new car is a depreciating asset that will lose value the minute you, and it, leave the car yard. Opting for a good quality second-hand car means you'll save cash for other expenses such as insurance.\nWhere to buy your wheels There are pros and cons to buying a car from a dealer, auction house or private seller, says Larbey.\nBut he says while you may nab a bargain at auction or get a cheap car privately, there's no warranty, and you'll need to rely heavily on your own judgement.\nIf you're buying second-hand, make sure you do an ownership check using the Personal Property Securities Register.\nAvoiding a lemon Spending a few hundred dollars on a professional inspection may save you later. Check how many kilometres are on the odometer, and that they match the car's service history.\nBuying outright v loans Paying for your car outright will always be cheaper than buying it on finance, says Larbey.\n\"If you do need to take out a loan make sure you shop around. Car yard finance is normally more expensive than getting a loan from a bank, building society, credit union, or other lending company.\"\nInsurance While compulsory third-party car insurance is mandatory for every motor vehicle registered in Australia, this will only cover injuries you may cause to other people in a car accident, says Larbey.\n\"It will not cover damage to property or vehicles. Would you be able to afford the repairs to a luxury sports car if you crash into one?\"\nFor more tips on buying your first car, visit ASIC's MoneySmart website.", "external_links": ["https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/", "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/money/borrowing/seven-tips-for-buying-your-first-home-20150825-gj74tb.html"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T08:23:31.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
