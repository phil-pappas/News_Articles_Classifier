Getting through the holidays debt-free is not always an easy task, given that past statistics show total household spending usually ranges from $800 to $1300, on average.\nWith that in mind, Consolidated Credit is launching a social media campaign - a 100 Days, 100 Ways to Save. Using the hashtag #100Days100Ways, savvy shoppers can find a new tip each day on Twitter or Facebook to help them save money and avoid debt during the holiday shopping season.\n“The holidays can be tough on the family’s finances,” says Gary Herman, President of Consolidated Credit. “Statistically, this is the most common time of year for people to take on significant amounts of credit card debt. When the holiday cash runs out, people tend to turn to plastic to cover them through the New Year. As a result, they find themselves in a financial bind by January.”\nThe #100Days100Ways campaign is part of Consolidated Credit’s ongoing initiative to help consumers prevent financial distress caused by holiday debt. The daily tips supplement the organization’s Holiday Survival Guide that helps consumer be strategic about holiday spending. The goal of these efforts is to help consumers prevent the dreaded holiday debt hangover.\n“A holiday debt hangover is that sinking feeling when you finally check your balances after ignoring them through the holidays and see how much you overspent,” Herman explains. “It’s the reason why January is the busiest month of the year for most credit counseling agencies like ours. Programs like #100Days100Ways are designed to help alleviate some of that pressure with advance planning.”\nConsolidated Credit is also giving shoppers two opportunities to win for retweeting the daily tips during the campaign. Each time a consumer retweets a #100Days100Ways tip, their name will be entered into a raffle for a $100 gift card. The first drawing will be on Black Friday (November 27) with a second drawing for another $100 gift card on December 30 just in time for the New Year. Participants can find more information and contest rules through Consolidated Credit’s website.\nAbout: Consolidated Credit is one of the nation’s largest credit counseling agencies.
