This is set to be followed by a 1.7pc expansion in 2016, from a previous calculation of 1.9pc. \nInflation is due to hit 1.7pc by 2017, but will be weighed down by a stronger euro exchange rate and falling oil prices. Consumer prices currently stand at just 0.2pc and could well lurch back into negative territory later this year, said the ECB. Prices are set to average just 0.1pc by the end of the year. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was an initial slide into deflation that compelled the ECB to launch its €60bn-a-month asset purchases six months ago, which will be conducted until a provisional September 2016 end date. \nBut Mr Draghi, who was speaking on his 68th birthday , said the governing council was now ready to bolster its QE scheme should inflation fail to move towards its mandated 2pc target rate. \n\"[Asset purchases] are intended to run until the end of September 2016, or beyond, if necessary, and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2pc,\" he said. \nThe commitment was enough to send the euro plummeting against the dollar by more than 1pc - falling to a two-week low of $1.11 against the dollar. An appreciating exchange rate had tightened financial conditions in the eurozone and hampered the bloc's exporters. \nStock markets across Europe also soared on the back of the prospect of more central bank stimulus. Germany's DAX rose by more than 3pc in late afternoon trading before finishing up 2.68pc. The Euro Stox 600 jumped 2.4pc, while Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 climbed 1.82pc to close at 6,194 points having endured a volatile past four weeks. \n= \"Verbal easing\" = \nIn a performance that was reminiscent of his landmark \"whatever it takes\" moment in July 2012, Mr Draghi soothed anxiety that the ECB would pull the plug on QE, while failing to make any firm pledges for more action. \n\"The sleight of hand in terms of a renewed dose of ‘all talk and no action’ was once again masterful,\" said Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. * The charts you need to see before the ECB could unleash more firepower on Europe * Global currency wars: what China's devaluation really means for the world The ECB also announced that it would expand the share of government and asset-backed bonds its was eligible to buy, from 25pc to 33pc, to ensure the full implementation of its €1 trillion bond-buying blitz. \nAlthough a largely technical adjustment, it was a \"statement of intent\" that the ECB was set on the path of further accommodation, said Ben May at Oxford Economics. \n\"It would not take much more bad news to prompt some governing council members to push for some form of expansion to the QE programme,\" said Mr May. \nDespite factoring in lower growth and weaker inflation, Mr Draghi said the ECB's outlook remained optimistic as the projections were calculated before the recent bout of stock market turmoil triggered by China's decision to revalue its currency peg with the dollar on August 11 . \n\"The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside, reflecting in particular the heightened uncertainties related to the external environment,\" said the Italian. \nHe added that no members of the 28-man governing council had called for an immediate increase to QE, and refrained from providing any concrete details on what further stimulus could look like. \n\"We are not there yet,\" said Mr Draghi. \n\"On his birthday, Mario Draghi did not receive, but actually gave a present to financial markets, stressing the ECB’s determination to do everything to support the eurozone economy,\" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING bank. \nAnalysts now expect the euro's policymakers to announce a ramping up of the ECB's monthly bond-buying from €60bn-a-month as early as its next meeting in mid-October. \nThe possibility of a premature tapering before a provisional September 2016 end-date has also all but vanished. \n= Central bank divergence = \nIn bolstering its \"unconventional\" monetary policy action, the ECB's easing stance will mark a departure from the US Federal Reserve, which is poised to fire the gun on its first interest rate rise in nine years later this month. \nA raft of strong economic data from the world's largest economy has been pointing towards a September lift-off, despite tumult in the equity markets. Investors will now be keeping a close eye on the latest jobs figures from the US, which are released today. Markets currently place a 32pc probability of an interest rate rise at the Fed's September 16-17 meeting. \n\"Such a loosening, combined with a gradual tightening of monetary policy in the US, should ensure that the euro weakens against the dollar over the coming quarters,\" said Mr May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:27:26.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
