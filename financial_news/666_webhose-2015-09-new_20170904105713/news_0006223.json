Here, social sector includes unorganised sector, informal sector, economically vulnerable or backward classes both in rural and urban areas. It is 0.5 per cent for the first year of operation.\nIn its guidelines on rural and social sector obligations, IRDAI has said that every insurer should mandatorily do business in these segments. For the rural sector, which means the places or areas classified as rural as per the Census, life insurers have to write atleast 7 per cent of total number of policies in rural areas in their first year of operation. This goes up to 20 per cent from their 10th year onwards.\nIn respect of a general insurers, 2 per cent of gross premium income should be in rural segment in first year, which goes up to 7 per cent from the ninth year onwards. In respect of standalone health insurers, it is 50 per cent of the obligations prescribed for non-life insurers.\nHere, the regulator said that micro insurance policies issued are eligible to be reckoned for the social sector obligations. Where a micro insurance policy is issued in a rural area, it can be reckoned for both rural and social sector obligations separately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:35:54.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
