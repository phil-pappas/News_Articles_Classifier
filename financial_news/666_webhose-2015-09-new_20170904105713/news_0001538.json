Only on the latter does Northern Ireland score less than the other countries. \nThe Minister said: \"I welcome that once again, Northern Ireland people have rated their personal wellbeing in terms of life satisfaction, happiness and that their life is worthwhile most highly out of all of the UK countries. \n“People in Fermanagh and Omagh have the highest levels of life satisfaction and happiness, and people in Mid-Ulster report the highest level of feeling that the things they do are worthwhile.” \nThe Office for National Statistics suggests that the improving economic outlook across the UK has contributed to a general improvement in these measures over recent years. \nArlene Foster added: “There’s no doubt that greater economic stability in Northern Ireland contributes to people’s outlook on life and overall wellbeing. Economic performance in Northern Ireland has been generally positive with encouraging signs that the private sector continues to drive growth. There have also been consistent and substantial improvements in labour market performance, with consumer activity also robust.” \nNorthern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency’s (NISRA) plans to release an update of the Well-being in Northern Ireland Report on 14 October, which will include the most recent figures available for the well-being measures. \nArlene Foster concluded: “I look forward to the NISRA Well-being in Northern Ireland Report which will help to inform government policy and ultimately improve the lives of people in Northern Ireland.” Note to Editors: The Office of National Statistic’s ‘Personal Well-being in the UK, 20145/15’ Report:can be found on the ONS website.
