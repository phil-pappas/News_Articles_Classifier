The league's average ticket price jumped 2.1% to nearly $86, according to Team Marketing Report. That's nearly triple the cost of the average Major League Baseball ticket (less than $30) and significantly more costly than an average National Basketball Association seat (little more than $50) or an in-house look at a National Hockey League game (just above $60). It's also a fairly low number once you've seen the average cost of the priciest tickets in the league, according to Team Marketing Report's Fan Cost Index . \nFor most fans, the face-value prices of even the lowest-priced tickets are largely a daydream after they sold out months ago. The folks at ticket pricing site TiqIq compiled data from the secondary ticket market and sites including eBay-owned StubHub and found average ticket prices far more extreme (and more likely) for fans seeking seats during the regular season: More Headlines \n3. New England Patriots: $292 \n4. Dallas Cowboys: $284 \n5. San Francisco 49ers: $265 \n6. Chicago Bears: $260 \n7. New York Giants: $250 \n8. Philadelphia Eagles: $223 \n9. Green Bay Packers: $222 \n9. Baltimore Ravens: $200 \nHowever, unsteady attendance since the recession has forced the NFL to shelve its television blackout rule -- allowing it to take games off the air in their home market when all non-premium seats aren't paid for -- and pass costs on to its television partners. New television deals with Fox, CBS and NBC kicked in last year and will pay the NFL and its teams $28 billion -- or roughly $1 billion a year -- for NFL broadcast rights through 2022 that include playoff games and rotating Super Bowl hosting duties. ESPN, meanwhile, pays $1.9 billion each year -- or more than double what any network pays for a season of Major League Baseball -- just to host Monday Night Football through that same span. \nLast year, the NFL also got DirecTV to pay $1.5 billion a year over the next eight years for the rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket multi-channel out-of-town games package. Though DirecTV executives initially refused to go above the $1 billion they were paying annually in their previous deal, losing NFL Sunday Ticket would have scuttled AT&T's $48.5 billion takeover of the company that included a no-penalty out clause if Sunday Ticket negotiations went south. Meanwhile, the league was also able to pry $275 million more out of CBS for partial rights to Thursday Night Football games in 2014. The NFL and CBS renewed the deal at a “slightly higher” rate for this season. \nThe overwhelming majority of you only watch NFL football this way. Last year, NFL regular-season games averaged 17.6 million per broadcast, second only to the 17.9 million average in 2010. Games on “free” TV -- CBS, Fox and NBC -- averaged 19.2 million viewers. The Top 20 television broadcasts last fall were all NFL games. Game 7 of last year's World Series (23.5 million viewers) was less watched than an early September matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos (25 million). The only non-sports event to join the NFL in the Top 25 was the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (22.6 million viewers), and nearly 10 million more viewers (32 million) tuned in to watch the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles later that day. \nAll this said, if you're willing to forego rivalry games for somewhat less-thrilling out-of-conference matchups against teams with middling to losing records, you might catch a break. Also, if you're willing to wait until your team clinches, is mathematically eliminated or is playing in weather too cold for anyone to notice the difference, there's a chance of catching a discount then as well. With that in mind, we took a look at Team Marketing Report's lineup of average ticket prices and found what are easily the costliest tickets in the land. This year, eight teams came in with average ticket prices over $100, up from four last year: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:26:15.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
