Photo: Bloomberg\nCash Converters has appointed former Bank of Queensland chief Stuart Grimshaw as interim executive chairman in a board shake-up as the company's long-serving chairman and Australian CEO retire.\nThe embattled pawnbroker and payday lender said chairman Reginald Webb would retire after a decade in the business at the end of financial year 2016.\nIan Day, the chief executive of Cash Converters' Australian business, retired on Thursday after 23 years at the Perth-based company. He has been succeeded by Mark Reid, former chief executive of Greenstone Financial Services. Prior to that, he was head of Bankwest retail banking.\nCash Converters has hired consultants CACE Partners to do a full review of the business over the next 16 weeks. The company will then devise a three-year strategic growth plan with CACE and inform the market of its plans by January.\nAdvertisement Mr Grimshaw has been on the board of Cash Converters since November 2014, when he became executive chairman at the Texas-based pawnbroker EZCorp​ after resigning as CEO of Bank of Queensland in October 2014 . EZCorp is Cash Converters' biggest shareholder, owning 27.9 per cent of the company. Mr Grimshaw is now EZCorp's CEO.\nCash Converters' share price has more than halved since February to 44¢ after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) achieved record fines against smaller rival payday lenders. This was followed by a Four Corners report that included accusations it loaned to people who used the money to buy drugs.\nAustralian business 'performing strongly' Cash Converters made a net loss of $21.4 million in 2015, down 188 per cent from a profit in 2014 of $24 million, in part due to a $7.6 million impairment charge on its British arm and a $23 million class action settlement.\nCash Converters' managing director Peter Cumins said Mr Webb was planning to retire by the end of this financial year, but given the problems in its offshore business and recent events, it was felt he should step aside early and allow Mr Grimshaw to lead the strategic review and search for a new chairman.\nHe said the appointment of Mr Reid signalled that Cash Converters was increasingly becoming a financial services company.\n\"Our Australian business is performing strongly, but what prompted it was to some extent the [poor] results from our UK business and [lease company] Carboodle,\" Mr Cumins told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"Really, the review process is about identifying where we're getting the best bang from our buck, and which areas of the business we should be allocating capital to. Let us address these issues without personal, emotive attachment to ensure that we're applying our funds correctly.\"\nHe said one option the company will consider is whether to move into medium-term loans above $2000, which come under different rules to the small amount, short-term loans commonly referred to as payday loans. The government is now reviewing rules governing the sector, and rival Money3 is already moving away from payday lending. But Mr Cumins stressed Cash Converters has no plans to do that.\nHe said Mr Grimshaw, despite being based in Austin, Texas, is often in Australia and will help the company find a new local chairman and non-executive director, which it wants to come from the east coast.\n\"Stuart has agreed to co-ordinate this restructure of the board and help our nomination committee find the appropriate people to add to the board and bring some fresh perspective to the company,\" Mr Cumins said.\nWestpac pulled back from lending to Cash Converters and competitor Money3 in early August.\nMr Cumins defended the business following its annual results on August 31, arguing it had done nothing illegal and would benefit from loss of competition.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/cash-converters-chief-hopes-for-payday-boost-after-competitors-depart-20150830-gjbcae", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/investment-banking/stuart-grimshaw-in-aussieled-takeover-of-ezcorp-20140814-j87tl"], "published": "2015-09-10T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:46:28.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
