Photo: Andrew Meares\nThere's nothing necessarily wrong with a pull-forward policy when a little stimulus kick is required, but they do tend to have the problem of leaving a hole behind them.\nThat's what seems to have happened with Joe Hockey's small business package. The Budget announcement of immediate tax write-off for capital items of less than $20,000 for businesses with turnover under $2 million was designed to encourage pre-June 30 spending. The Australian seasonally adjusted figures for June showed that it worked – retail sales soared that month by a greater-than-expected 0.6 per cent.\nBut that pull-forward of spending certainly left a hole behind it. This morning's release showed July seasonally-adjusted retail sales contracted by 0.1 per cent.\nThe ABS trend series attempts to smooth out the wilder swings. On that basis, it's like the small biz stimulus didn't happen. As the attached graph shows, the trend series had July retail sales growth of 0.2 per cent, but that was after nine months of steady 0.3 growth. What stimulus package?\nAdvertisement Not that there's anything wrong with that – it's not spectacular, but it is growth. Given real wages are flat, that's not too shabby. And it's in keeping with our more humble circumstances, as displayed in yesterday's national accounts.\nIf Joe Hockey wants to start worrying early about the next quarter's GDP growth though, that retail hole won't help the household consumption figures. It was consumer spending and a couple of war ships that kept the June quarter GDP positive at all.\nBut statistics also have a habit of bouncing around. Exports were a bit too good to be true a bit too bad to be true in the June quarter. The international trade figures also out this morning show exports of goods and services lifting a welcome two per cent from June to July while imports were close to steady. Our seasonally-adjusted trade deficit shrank 19 per cent to $2.46 billion.\nMaybe that weaker Australian dollar will ride to Joe's rescue in three months' time. It looks like small business tax breaks won't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:49:51.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
