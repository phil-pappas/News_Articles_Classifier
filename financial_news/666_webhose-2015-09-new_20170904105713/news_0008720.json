Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan A recession will occur in Australia, but it is not imminent, the Reserve Bank of Australia's head of financial stability Luci Ellis warns.\nConcern that Australia is headed for a recession comes after a lower than expected economic growth in the second quarter of 2015 and a high level of unemployment; a recession could also bring the heated property market to a halt.\n\"We haven't had a full-blown recession in 23 years. Ultimately it will happen,\" Ms Ellis said at the UNSW real estate symposium on Tuesday.\n\"But I won't put a score on the fact that it will happen imminently.\"\nThe outcomes of the Chinese economy will drive Australia's economy and is one to watch, Ms Ellis added.\nDwelling prices in the major capital cities have had double digit growths in the last 12 months. Sydney is up nearly 20 per cent and Melbourne about 12 per cent.\nThe rise in property prices especially housing has put pressure on housing affordability and \"gotten the attention of the regulators\" and particularly because the size of the property market is large, Ms Ellis said.\n\"The size of the housing market in Australia and its mortgage book is more than 20 per cent of household consumption,\" she said.\nRelated \"A large enough downturn in housing prices would harm output through its effect on household spending, even if it did not spark a financial crisis through loan losses.\"\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has already been clamping down on bank lending to property investments.\nBut Ms Ellis cautioned the market not to panic about a repeat of the 2007 US credit crisis in Australia.\n\"You can't translate the US risk profile to Australia,\" she said.\n\"Major losses on home mortgage portfolios are rare, and usually driven by high unemployment. That is to say, they are more often the consequence of a downturn than its cause.\"\n\"The US meltdown was an exception, enabled by gaps in the regulatory system, such that it could not prevent an extreme easing in lending standards.\"\nEarlier at the UNSW conference, Ms Ellis, who heads the central bank's financial stability department said there are strong links between strong upswings in credit and growth in property prices leading to \"subsequent bad events.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-09-08T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:32:44.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
