(Technically, they're distance sensors, measuring how far the glass has been depressed when you push on it. But the effect is the same.)\nIt essentially triples the number of ways you can tap on your iPhone. The regular tap will open an app the way it always has. A medium-hard press on the screen calls up a preview of the app - something Apple is calling a \"peek\" - and then continuing that press performs a \"pop\", which turns the preview into the full-screen version of the app.\nApple has already re-written a number of its apps to take advantage of the new touch function. You'll be able to call your favourite contacts without fully opening the phone app, just by calling up the preview of the phone and selecting the contact.\nAlready games developers are taking advantage of 3D Touch, too, using it for things like zooming in on targets (the peek press) and changing weapons (the pop press).\n 3D Touch lets you make calls without fully opening the iPhone's phone app That's not the only thing that will dramatically improve games play on the iPhone 6S. Apple says the new processor on the phone, dubbed the A9, is almost twice as fast as the processor on the iPhone 6 for graphics - 90 per cent faster - and 70 per cent faster for CPU-related tasks.\nThat will come in handy for multitasking, which has also been overhauled through the use of 3D Touch gestures. Now users will be able to force-press on the side of the screen to switch between apps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:10:51.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
