It could spur Mario Draghi to act.\nAfter the Federal Reserve chair held off from a U.S. interest-rate increase amid concerns that world growth will weaken, her counterpart at the European Central Bank may give clues on the need for further stimulus for the euro area. Draghi and other Governing Council members will make public appearances this week, while data releases will show whether the currency bloc is succumbing to, or shaking off, the gloom.\nLike the U.S., the euro area is stuck with stubbornly low inflation. Unlike Yellen, Draghi can’t yet rely on domestic demand to lift prices. Whether because the Fed’s delay leads to a stronger euro, or because of the drag of emerging markets, economists see it as increasingly likely that the ECB will be called on its pledge to boost its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.3 trillion) bond-buying program if needed.\nStructural Shift “The worry is that, previously, central banks assumed that global growth\nwould be materially stronger in 2016, but that doesn’t look likely now,”\nsaid Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro Bank NV in\nAmsterdam. “If the Fed had hiked rates, it would have given the ECB some\nbreathing space. Now the pressure is on them again.”\nThe ECB’s optimism that a home recovery coupled with stronger external demand would steer inflation back to the goal of just under 2 percent is now being replaced by concern that a structural shift has beset the world economy. Executive Board member Peter Praet, the institution’s chief economist, said in an interview published over the weekend that policy makers “won’t hesitate to act” if it they reach that conclusion.\nDraghi’s lieutenants have been reinforcing that message since the Fed’s rate decision last week. Benoit Coeure, the ECB’s markets chief, said in a speech in Paris on Friday that prospects for growth in the euro area have “clearly weakened,” and aren’t helped by a euro that’s now strengthening against the currencies of its main trading partners.\nPMI Surveys The single currency has gained 3.5 percent in trade-weighted terms since mid-July and more than 4 percent against the dollar. European bonds jumped after the Fed’s Sept. 17 decision to keep its benchmark rate at a record low.\nBoth Praet and Coeure speak in public on Monday, followed by Draghi’s appearance at a European Parliament hearing in Brussels on Wednesday. Hours before Draghi addresses lawmakers, purchasing managers’ surveys for September may tell investors whether Europe’s manufacturing and services industries are indeed succumbing to lower external demand, or whether domestic consumers are helping to prop them up.\nSteady Hand There are signs that the modest euro-area recovery needn’t wilt just because of financial-market turmoil and a Chinese slowdown. Consumer confidence is near the highest since the financial crisis and bank lending to companies and households is finally rising again. Latest figures for those measures will also be released this week.\nThose skeptical of the need for quantitative easing, such as Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, have called for a steady hand on the monetary-policy tiller, rather than a rush to deliver even more stimulus. Weidmann speaks on Wednesday in Guetersloh, Germany.\nGiven that QE is just six months old, the ECB will probably focus on rhetorical support at first, according to Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London. The easiest option is to reiterate that the initial end-date of September next year isn’t set in stone.\nYellen Speech “ECB commentary is pointing to a QE extension beyond September 2016 as\nthe most likely form of further easing,” Fuzesi wrote in a note to clients. “Given how far that is away, there is much scope for buying time with dovish rhetoric in the meantime, without a formal policy change.”\nMuch may depend on whether the Fed has taken a momentary breath or whether officials see the need to hold borrowing costs where they are until next year. Yellen speaks on Thursday in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she may elaborate on the central bank’s thinking. A more bullish Fed would be consistent with a strengthening dollar -- and the weakening euro that could make more easing by the ECB unnecessary.\nBefore then, Draghi will likely face questions in the European parliament over what his next moves will be. Should he take action, options include immediately increasing the size of asset purchases from the current 60 billion euros a month, or broadening the program beyond sovereign and agency debt, covered bonds, and asset-backed securities.\n“Everyone now seems to have an expectation that QE will continue for longer,” said Anatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale SA in London. “The next step is whether we dare to expect whether the ECB will in the short term do more.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T07:24:30.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
