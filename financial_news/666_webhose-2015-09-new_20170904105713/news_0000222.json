The website has changed massively in terms of its appearance and navigation structure. The new avatar of BikeWale scores over other portals in many ways. The new clutter-free approach makes the site simple to operate and enables users to jump to their preferred bike in one-step right from the home page. They can then view detailed features and tech specs, including accurate on-road prices. Further, users can actually book their bike online and choose to pay online instantly through their bank accounts, debit cards or credit cards. BikeWale also allows users to book online and pay offline via cheque without leaving the comfort of their home or office. This re-design is a result of months of user research and strategic planning. Utmost priority was also given to user feedback while drafting the new version of the portal. Speaking about the re-design, Banwari Lal Sharma, Vice President, Product said, “Research has proven that one only has a few seconds to get the user’s attention and to convey enough value to engage them. Keeping the same in mind, we completely focused on parameters such as a cleaner interface and user-friendly navigation while designing the new website.” Currently the portal is also providing offers such as a free helmet worth Rs. 1,000/- and free one-year roadside assistance to buyers in Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore who choose to book online.
