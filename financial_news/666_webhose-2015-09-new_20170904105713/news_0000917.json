Photo: Sam Mooy\nDear Scott,\nI don't want to make a habit of this, but I thought I should drop you another note after your media blitzkrieg this week. From the AFR to the Terror , from an all-in media conference (albeit truncated) to Leigh Sales, you were everywhere. Quite an Energiser Bunny performance.\nAs soon as you hit us with yet another three-word slogan, you created doubt in a space formerly occupied by good-will towards you and hope.\nBut maybe you shouldn't have.\nAs soon as you hit us with yet another three-word slogan, you created doubt in a space formerly occupied by good-will towards you and hope. And it didn't get any better from there as you rushed to offer your former supporters on the right wing assurance that your heart still belonged to Ayn Rand.\nAdvertisement Trouble is, most of us are over simplistic chants and philosophical wish lists made up of tax cuts, budget razor gangs and the unemployed working. As previously suggested, we'd prefer pragmatic integrity in our new treasurer .\n\"Work, save, invest\" sounds nicely evangelical for the Liberal faith – but it doesn't mean anything much more than \"buy low, sell high\" and \"be nice to your mother\".\nAnd then it got worse.\nYou reportedly like the idea of getting back to Peter Costello's days of regular tax cuts.\nYou think we have a spending problem and not a revenue problem. And you've hit upon the crowd pleaser of talking about improving housing affordability - as long the activity to achieve that is the responsibility of the states, not the federal government.\nWhen you're framing the next few budgets, that \"don't have a revenue problem\" line will come back to haunt you.\nAnd suggesting that we can get back to your mate Costello's good ol' days of constant tax cuts is actually a worry. That was a rare and passing resources boom that Costello and Wayne Swan frittered away on overly generous tax cuts instead of the government really working, saving and investing.\nThat terms of trade windfall isn't coming back any time soon. Fiscal policy in the lead-up to the global financial crisis was unsustainable and dangerous. Everyone seems to have forgotten the Reserve Bank was being forced to bash the economy over the head with rising interest rates to counteract the sugar hits.\nYes, it would be nice to experience such extreme good fortune again. It also would be nice to win Lotto – but it would be rather foolish to base one's budgeting on either such hope.\nScott, you really don't have to waste energy defending your predecessor's fumbling efforts. We don't care about him anymore. That was part of a previous government, as ancient history as knighthoods. Unless you're hoping for particularly fine hospitality when you do get around to visiting Washington, you can let all that go.\nWhat we're interested in is what you're really going to do in the year ahead – and we understand that it's too early for you to really know that. It's going to be hard juggling all the conflicting demands, so maybe it would be best to treat the next few weeks as being one big operational matter, back on the water, so to speak.\nEveryone wants to know and will badger you for answers, but why subject yourself to such opportunities to waffle before you actually have any.\nThere are partial ideas and plans – encouraging retirees to downsize and state and local governments to function better – but they aren't fully formed.\nThe first home buyer lobby, for example, isn't so thick as to think all that has to be done is to make life easier and cheaper for developers. That's important, but there's also a federal matter of the interaction of capital gains tax and negative gearing. (Did you by any chance see this week's episode of Utopia? Rob Sitch is well ahead of you.)\nScott, with the best will in the world, try being a small target for a while. It's tempting to glory in the big new job, to feed the chooks, but resist. If you don't have anything concrete to say, don't say it. You'll need all your political capital for the real fights ahead.\nThe instinct to skip the international meetings to concentrate on the local economy is a so-so call – more symbolic than meaningful, I suspect. They are opportunities to learn and network and influence. But as you've made that call, the inference is that you know you have much to learn and work on.\nSo head down until you have some real answers and policies instead of chants and motherhood statements. That's the way you'll rebuild your numbers, by doing it.\nYours,\nMichael", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:26:59.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
