U.S. military spending is generally authorized only one year at a time, unless specific targets are met, and that usually occurs when a weapons program has matured beyond where the F-35 is now.\nHarrigian said the issue was further complicated by political gridlock in Washington and the prospect that the U.S. Congress could fail to pass a budget for fiscal 2016, which some fear may result in a full-year continuing resolution.\nHarrigian said the Air Force, the largest U.S. buyer of F-35s, had nearly locked down its fiscal 2017 budget plans for the program, but gave no details. He said the service's budget planning was too far advanced when discussions began about a possible block purchase.\nThe U.S. military is preparing for a rapid ramp up in production of the $391 billion F-35 fighter jet program in coming years, with Lockheed slated to go from building 40 jets a year to 120 jets for the U.S. military and the 10 countries that have already placed orders: Britain, Norway, Denmark, Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Israel, Japan and South Korea.\nAir Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, last week said the steep ramp-up in production could stress suppliers and that the jet's automated logistics system still faces problems.\nHarrigian said the Air Force was continuing to look at the issue and possible \"hybrid\" solutions that would allow it to benefit from any cost savings.
