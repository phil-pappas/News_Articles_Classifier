I urge African governments to put aside more funds for tourism and to market these destinations better, as is done in places like Asia, Europe and other tourist destinations,' she stated. \nMs Simiyu also stressed the importance of investments in tourism infrastructure and facilities such as hotels and transport facilities as these would facilitate the growth of tourism. \nShe bemoaned the low levels of intra-Africa tourism; saying Africans have taken African destinations for granted, while tourists from western countries flocked into the continent. \nUsing the annual Wildebeest migration from the Serengeti to the Mara, which is sometimes referred to as the seventh wonder of the world as an example, she challenged Africans to visit tourist sites on the continent, including Kenya. \nShe debunked claims that the destinations were expensive, adding, 'Most people think the destination is expensive, it is not, and you can come at a season that you can afford. Also you can take advantage of early bird prices when you book early,' she said. \nPartnership with Kenya AirwaysKenya Airways as the national airline of Kenya plays a very significant role in tourism. The airline is the main transporter of tourists from various parts of the world into Kenya. \nMs. Simiyu said the Sarova Group, which is the second largest hotel chain in Kenya, partnered with KQ in order to bring tourists from other countries into Kenya. Kenya Airways also served as an ambassador of Kenya's tourists destinations in the various countries it operates, including Ghana while providing direct and affordable means for tourists to get into Kenya. \nSecurity in KenyaOn security in Kenya and its impact on tourism, Ms. Simiyu maintained that although there had been pockets of terrorist incidents in the country, Kenya was still very safe and peaceful as the incidents happened close to the border areas of the country. \nShe said the fact that the Sarova Mara Game Camp continued to receive international tourists at the full capacity (75 rooms, hosting about 150 people) proved that Kenya was safe for tourism. \nShe added that the camp, as well as all other hotels in the reserve had gates being manned by security personnel 24 hours each day. It was also surrounded by an electric fence which helped to keep out wild animals from the camp. \nContribution to Kenyan economyThe Sarova group of hotels and game lodges, she noted, contributed a lot to the economy of the country through payments of taxes and job creation. The Group paid almost 30 percent of its profits in taxes to government annually. It also employed over 1500 Kenyans with about 60 percent of the staff at the Sarova Mara being local Maasai people. \nThrough its Corporate Social Responsibility, the Lodge also offered training to some of the young Maasai who could then find employment elsewhere. It also supports the local school in the community by providing maintenance for the school building. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:32:52.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
