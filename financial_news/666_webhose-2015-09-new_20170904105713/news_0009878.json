Mrs Sadjady was suspicious at first and the man reassured her by explaining she would receive another call from Santander's fraud department. \nA second man then telephoned her and crucially the number that appeared on Mrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) Sadjady's phone matched the number printed on the back of her debit card. \nMrs Sadjady subsequently told the BBC's Moneybox on Radio 4 she had been suspicious up until that point. \n\"I wasn't sure, until they called my mobile from that phone number on the back of my card,\" she said. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) went on to transfer £12,000 from her Santander account to another account with the Halifax that the conmen had set up in her name and then cleared out. \nThe scam took one hour and 40 minutes worth of calls spread out over three hours. The calls were secretly recorded by Mrs Sadjady's son who has now handed the tapes to the police. \nAnd because Mrs Sadjady transferred the money voluntarily, the banks initially declined to reimburse her - as they are entitled to do. They relented after intervention from the BBC. \n\"These scams are so sophisticated that people genuinely end up believing it is the bank, even though they know, potentially, that it doesn't sound quite right,\" said Tony Black, a senior fraud prevention officer with Financial Fraud Action UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:12:48.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
