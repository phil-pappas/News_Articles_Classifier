The passage of the law is in fulfillment of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request to the legislature imploring the body for a six week extension for ordinary sessions. In August, President Sirleaf wrote the Legislature requesting them to stay for additional six weeks to pass some bills and ratify some agreements that are already in process. The passage will also give way for Liberia to receive US$250M from the United States government to boost the power sector. \nIn July this year, President Sirleaf submitted to the Legislature, for its consideration, a bill entitled: 2015 Electricity law of Liberia. The Plenary of the Senate, subsequently after the bill was sent to the Legislature, mandated its committees on Lands, Mines, Energy, Natural resources, Judiciary, Human Rights, Claims and Petition to conduct public hearing on the then drafted legislation and advised plenary for action. \nThe then act, according to the committee, contains essential ingredients on the Liberalization of the Electricity sector and is largely consistent with international best practices. Among many things, the Senate joint committee in its findings to plenary said the main crux of the bill from the President is to liberalize the electricity sector as a means of driving competition which could improve access, improve quality and lower costs. \nThe proposed act establishes the legal and regulatory framework for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity and for import and export. This will create an enabling environment for private sector investment in the energy sector of Liberia. Contrary to a plea from Grand Bassa Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence that the Regulatory Commission must not be under the umbrella of the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (Policy Maker) at anytime, even for a brief duration, the Senate agreed that the institutional arrangements, eventually, will consist of the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy playing a policy oversight role, while an independent regulatory or authority is established. \nAccording to her, incubating what should be an independent agency under the wings of the policymaker could affect the future orientation of the agency when it is removed from the Ministry. Senator Lawrence said: \"For effective functionality, the membership of the regulatory board or commission must be at least five members. However, to contain cost, the law could be passed such that the commission begins with three members and increased to five members within a specified number of years\". \nThe Senator furthered: \"The commissioners need to have staggered terms so all commissioners terms cannot expire at the same time to ensure continuation of institutional knowledge. The law therefore must make provision for staggered terms of commissioners\". Currently out of the country Senator Lawrence told her colleagues \"The Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) is a player in the game, representing the Government of Liberia and must not referee the game or be the regulator of the Sector. \n\"Because electricity is the key factor to a nation's growth and development, and also a factor for a weak private sector in Liberia, we must make decisions that will make the process reliable to attract investors as soon as possible if we want to see growth in the economy and a better living condition for our people.\" \nThe institutional arrangements, eventually, will consist of the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy playing a policy oversight role, an independent regulatory or authority to be established and the Liberia Electricity corporation (LEC) serving as a national grid company and the transmission system operator. The law contains provision for electricity regulation such as licensing and registration, self-supply by large consumers, Micro-utilities, theft of electricity, tariff setting, dispute resolution, power purchase agreements and international transactions. \nThe law will also ensure the establishment of an independent Liberia Electricity Regulatory commission which will consist of a chairperson and two other members to be appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate but many believe involving the government will make the commission no different for the LEC. \nFrom the effective date of the proposed law, LEC will be considered to be licensed provisionally to engage in the power generation business, power generation transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Energy consumption in Liberia is dominated by biomass with a share of more than 80% of the used primary energy sources. Most important is woody biomass being used for domestic cooking and heating. \nIn 2004, it was estimated that over 95% of the population depends on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating needs and palm oil for lighting. The most recent Census (2008 data, published in 2009) shows that 70% of the urban population use charcoal for cooking and 5% of the rural population; 91% of the rural population use firewood for cooking and 21% of the urban population. In Monrovia, the percentage of households using charcoal is even higher, 85%. \nModern energy services based on electricity and petroleum products are predominantly used for economic production and transportation. In the household sector, the use of modern energy services consists mainly of kerosene, electricity, and liquefied petroleum gas for lighting, cooking, and entertainment. These are used by higher income households in urban areas. \nHistorically electricity was mainly provided in the capital of Monrovia; around 35,000 customers--almost 13 percent of the population--were served by 1989. Total installed electricity capacity was 191 MW. The generation mix was composed of hydropower from the plant at Mt. Coffee--with a supply capacity of 63 MW during the wet season and 5 MW during the dry season (six months)--and 31 percent HFO and 21 percent diesel. The utility LEC also handled the electricity supply of rural areas outside Monrovia through 10 small isolated power systems with a total installed capacity of 13 MW. \nAccording to the data of the government, about 10% of urban residents and less than 2% of rural residents have electricity access largely from self-generation with gasoline or diesel generators using expensive imported fuel. The access rate to public electricity is roughly 1%. In March 2012 LEC served about 5,600 connections in Monrovia (around 2,500 residents from an estimated number of 210,000 households), In August 2012 already 11,000 customers are served by LEC.
