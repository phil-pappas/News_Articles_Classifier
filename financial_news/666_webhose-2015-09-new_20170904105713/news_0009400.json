Gulfport expects final approval of the borrowing base increase by the bank syndicate to be completed within the next 30 days. On June 30, 2015, Gulfport's revolving credit facility was undrawn with outstanding letters of credit totaling $92.7 million. Pro forma for the proposed increase to the Company's borrowing base, Gulfport would have approximately $607.3 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. \nCompletion of Paloma Acquisition \nOn August 31, 2015, Gulfport completed its previously announced acquisition of Paloma for a total purchase price of approximately $301.9 million, including certain closing adjustments. Paloma holds approximately 24,000 net nonproducing acres in the core of the dry gas window of the Utica Shale, located in Belmont and Jefferson Counties, Ohio. The acreage included in the acquisition overlaps with a number of Gulfport's currently planned units and is located in the vicinity of existing interstate pipelines with gathering and compression infrastructure already under development. Gulfport currently intends to move one rig to operate on this acreage beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gulfport funded the Paloma Acquisition with a portion of the net proceeds from its previously completed securities offerings. Â© 2015 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.
