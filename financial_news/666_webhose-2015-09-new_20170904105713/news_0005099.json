This mirrors the growing comfort global investors have with the India growth story and how select funds with a proven track record are able to drum up money despite a tough fundraising environment.\nStrong demand from investors, most of whom have participated in previous rounds, saw the fund reach its hard cap of $700 million, a company release said on Tuesday.\nAnother $30 million came from general partners, fund managers and staff along with group affiliates. This is the largest fundraise of 2015 till date.\n\n\"Investors who had backed Everstone previously committed the majority of the capital, either maintaining or increasing their commitment sizes. A select number of new marquee LPs (limited partners) also joined,\" the homegrown private equity firm said. Limited partners are investors in PE funds. More than 50 per cent of the capital came from North America and about 37 per cent from Europe. The investors are well-diversified and include significant public pension plans, insurance companies, endowments and select asset managers. \"With multiple offices and a large talented and experienced team, we intend to continue with our proven strategy of building exceptional businesses in India and a few other select and targeted geographies,\" said Sameer Sain, cofounder and co-managing partner of the Everstone Group .\nIt will look for more buyouts and controlled deals besides looking at writing larger cheques through this new fund for Indian as well as Southeast Asian markets.\nRising Control Investments \nIn 2006-07, 13 per cent of Indian PE investments by value were control investments rising to 29 per cent by 2013, according to a report by management consulting firm McKinsey. \"Control investments allow firms to support an ageing generation of entrepreneurs, ensure better capital discipline in portfolio companies across volatile cycles, and facilitate easier exits so that firms can renew maturing portfolio,\" said the February report by McKinsey director Vivek Pandit . This strategy drives Everstone Capital, which last week bought bakery business Modern Foods from Hindustan Unilever with a view to turning it around. It will look for more such deals, executives said. Earlier this year, India Value Fund Advisors raised $700 million toward their fifth fund â€” Indium V. The momentum is picking up for firms that are on the road to raise funds. Compared with the total of $800 million raised in 2014, the current year will see a significant bump going by the number of funds that are in the market to collect money, both by means of fundraising and invested capital. According to London-based research firm Preqin, 26 Indian private equity funds are currently seeking to raise a total $5.4 billion ( Rs 33,800 crore).\nInterest in India Has Revived \n\"LP interest in India fundraise has revived but is selective. It is very track record- and teamspecific,\" said Sanjeev Krishan, executive director and head (private equity practice) at PricewaterhouseCoopers India . \"Exit track record and ability to manage and get the best of the entrepreneurs backed in the past are the key differentiators for the LPs,\" he added. Investors who had previously shied away from the Indian market are more confident about the improving macro environment and the bottoming-out of the business cycle. Multiples and IDFC Capital are looking to raise $650 million and $500 million, respectively. Other major funds on the road include ICICI Venture's $500-million ( Rs 3,120 crore) fund and CX Partners' $400-million ( Rs 2,500 crore) second fund.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:05:27.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
