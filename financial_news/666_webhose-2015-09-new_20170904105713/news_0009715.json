( www.techsource.com ), an independent supplier of high performance embedded video, graphics and high end computing solutions, has unveiled the low power (7 Watt) Condor VC100xX H.264 high quality video capture and compression card. \nThis rugged and fully conduction-cooled card is the perfect addition to the Condor VC100 Series and simplifies the video compression task in challenging surveillance/C4ISR applications using the VPX Platform. \nThe XMC form factor module, featuring an H.264 video encoder with baseline, main and high profile support up to Level 4.1, supports up to 4 composite video inputs (NTSC/PAL/SECAM) or up to 2 SDI inputs (HD-SDI/SD-SDI), all of which are selectable through the provided API. Condor VC100xX also has 2 stereo or 4 mono audio inputs. \nThe Condor VC100xX card performs H.264 encoding in hardware to minimize CPU usage. Exceptionally high quality video data is captured and stored in files and made available to customer applications for processing, analysis or display on a local graphics card. The Condor VC100xX also supports transfer of the video stream via UDP or TCP/IP using RTP and RTSP protocols for remote display of captured data with low latency. \nSelwyn L. Henriques, president and CEO of Tech Source Inc., said: “This fully conduction cooled low power VC100xX card consumes just 7 Watts of power yet still delivers high profile H.264 stream quality video at a low bit-rate to support customers with rugged rear I/O surveillance applications.” \nTech Source offers a number of variants in its VC100 family including the VC102, which, in addition to video encoding, captures raw video and features dual Ethernet outputs. \nFor more information on the Condor VC100xX card or any other product from Tech Source, please visit www.techsource.com , email embeddedgraphics@techsource.com or call +1 (407) 262 7100. \nTech Source will demonstrate its Condor VC100xX – and other products – at DSEI, September 15-18 in London, UK at the ExCel Center on the Sarsen booth number S4-453. \nMedia photo:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:13:31.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
