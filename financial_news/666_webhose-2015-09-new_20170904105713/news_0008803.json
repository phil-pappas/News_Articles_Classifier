My wife just dropped in to the local branch with a couple of void cheques and told them how much to transfer over. Painless and fast. \nI do completely agree with your love of RESP’s in concept. Regular RESP contribtions by us, along with having our kids work through their high school summers with a forced school savings plan (they have to save a specified percent of their income for school, and then they have to pay for a 1/3 of their university costs) have meant that there’s not been that much out of pocket for us when they go to university. Granted, they live at home and commute to school which helps. I still like to complain about it but really, our use of RESP’s has meant that university hasn’t been unaffordable. Reply bigcajunman September 10, 2015, 8:40 PM \nIf you did your “withdrawal” without a “Proof of Enrollment” of some kind, you may have a rude surprise when your money is not given out (Bank must have record of your child’s enrollment or they get in trouble (is my understanding)). As I have said my biggest problem is that the TD Mutual Fund system is cumbersome at the best of times, ridiculously frustrating and unaccomodating at their worst. \nHelping your kids, by teaching them the value of money, and ensuring they have some “skin in the game” (i.e. they spend some of their own money on their education) is an excellent methodology as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:13:24.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
