There is a general risk-off tone,\" he said. \nInvestors and traders are also nervously waiting for key Chinese manufacturing data due on Wednesday at 1145 AEST. \nMr Ive said the Aussie dollar could lose more ground even if the data was positive. \n\"If the Chinese data comes out better than expected, the Aussie dollar can still come under pressure because it will increase expectations of a US rates hike in October,\" he said. \n\"If the data is weak, again the Aussie will fall as the global markets will continue its risk-off unwinding of trade.\" \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* 70.91 US cents, from 71.52 cents on Tuesday \n* 85.19 Japanese yen, from 86.06 yen \n* 63.76 euro cents, from 64.01 euro cents \n* 112.65 New Zealand cents, from 113.01 NZ cents \n* 46.13 British pence, from 46.15 pence \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T00:44:35.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
