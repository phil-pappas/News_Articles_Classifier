And there are now definite plans to record… (A new album) looks closer. Don’t know where, don’t know when yet … We had a little chat. We were just saying, ‘We gotta get in the studio right? Right?’ ‘That’s agreed. Okay, boys, that’s agreed.’ Where, when – (we) scratch our heads,” Richards said.\nThe “Trouble” musician added there are chances of them taking up the project before the year ends.\n“I would say off the top of my head after the South American tour in February. But you never know. We might try to get into the studio before Christmas. I think that’s sort of doubtful, with Christmas being Christmas, all that build up. But at the same time, it’s definitely in the works.”\nThe new album will be the band’s first since their 2005 album “A Bigger Bang”.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 9:07 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:24:07.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
