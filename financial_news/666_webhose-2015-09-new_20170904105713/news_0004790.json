In Germany, universities receive so much in government subsidies that most students—including international students—pay no tuition at all.\nWhile it may not qualify as an exodus, some of the most popular countries for college enrollments abroad have seen sharp upticks since 2011-12, when more than 46,500 U.S. students were enrolled in foreign academic-degree programs, according to the Institute of International Education. Britain, the No.1 country for U.S. students, saw an 8% annual increase in 2012-13. German universities, meanwhile, experienced a 33% increase between 2010 and 2013, according to the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Wealth Management Money and College: The Crucial Questions for Parents and Children Why Peer Pressure May Not Help You Save More for Retirement When Millennials Move Back Home Mistakes Charitable Startups Make “Suddenly the Old World is becoming a pretty interesting place,” says Allan Goodman, president and chief executive of the Institute of International Education. “Many degree programs have courses taught in English, many of them have very robust scholarships or are tuition-free, and the subjects are very relevant to the world in which we live.”\nScotland calling When Fritz Lodge of Basalt, Colo., was looking for undergraduate courses in international relations and Middle Eastern studies a few years ago, he applied to colleges in the U.S. and the U.K. He chose to attend the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where the 2014-15 undergraduate tuition fee for international students was £16,230 (about $25,300) for most subjects.\nENLARGE “It was on par with or better than the schools I was looking at in the States, and it was about half the price,” says Mr. Lodge. He also liked the fact that he was able to take a “gap year,” deferring his college entry to visit Israel and work on an archaeological dig.\nChris Payne, head of the U.S. office of King’s College London, says that he’s seen growing interest from U.S. students, and that cost is a key factor. “The U.K. is more affordable than comparable U.S. colleges,” he says. Ivy League and top research universities in the U.S. can cost $50,000 or $60,000, he notes. King’s College London cost £15,200 (about $23,740) for the 2014-15 academic year.\nCanada, the No. 2 destination for U.S. college students enrolling abroad, had more than 7,000 U.S. students in 2011-12, according to the Institute of International Education. Statistics Canada reports that average tuition for international undergrads in Canada last year was C$20,447 (about US$15,380).\n“Canada’s a great bargain in terms of the quality of education for the cost,” says Michele Hernández, president of college consulting firm Top Tier Admissions. “U.S. schools are crazy expensive and feel like they have to offer every facility, every amenity to attract new students,” says Dr. Hernández. “That’s what a lot of your tuition’s going to. At a lot of international schools, they don’t feel like they have to offer kids a spa or a gym.”\nThere are other benefits to studying abroad as well. “People in other countries approach issues very differently,” says Dr. Goodman, “and it’s really important if you’re going to work and live in an intercultural world to know that.”\nSome drawbacks Of course, there can be downsides, too. If you want to work in the U.S. after graduation, for example, a U.S. school may be better able to smooth the way for you with career advice and contacts; at an international school, such advice may be locally geared.\n“Some of the undergraduate U.S. schools have ties to Wall Street, for example, and can help you find your first job,” Dr. Hernández notes. “On the other hand, you could easily do your undergraduate degree abroad, and then go to business school in the U.S. and get your first job from there. So it depends on your career path.”\nDifferences in language and culture can also be a hindrance. In Germany, a good understanding of German is essential for many courses. But 1,712 courses are taught partly or completely in English and roughly 1,000 are English-only, says Nina Lemmens, director of Germany’s DAAD office in New York.\nStudents should expect some differences in the academic system and the teaching style, says Dr. Hernández. In Britain, for instance, degree programs tend to have a much stronger subject focus: Students declare their majors when applying, do most or all of their classes in that subject, and may face difficulties if they want to switch later.\nFor students not sure yet about a career but who still want to study abroad, she suggests applying to a U.S. school and taking advantage of study-abroad programs.\nAid availability Sometimes, a simple comparison of the “sticker prices” of universities in the U.S. and abroad can be misleading as well. “In the U.S., there are lots of financial-aid packages that can reduce the price quite considerably,” says Kings College London’s Mr. Payne. “In the U.K., our tuition is our tuition,” and students are likely to find less financial aid.\nU.S. federal student loans, however, are available for Americans to study overseas. Indeed, hundreds of overseas institutions participate in the U.S. student loan program, which is applied for by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\nMr. Blackman is a writer living in Crete.
