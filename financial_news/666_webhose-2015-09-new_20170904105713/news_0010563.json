That eased investor fears that Beijing may be intensifying a trading crackdown.\nThe news stabilized global markets and soothed concerns that slowing growth in China will hurt the global economy.\n\"We expect some more volatility going forward, but we see the recent selloff as a correction and not the start of a bear market,\" Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said.\n\"Possible actions by some central banks such as China doing more to stimulate its economy, the European Central Bank extending its bond-buying program and the Fed delaying an interest rate hike are likely to support the market.\"\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 207.18 points, or 1.29 percent, to 16,265.53, the S&P 500 gained 21.81 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,935.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.66 points, or 1.48 percent, to 4,704.77.\nThe U.S. market is still down for the year following the recent selloff.\nMSCI's all-country stock index rose 0.4 percent but is down 7.0 percent for the year-to-date.\nU.S. data showed nonfarm productivity increased at its strongest pace in 1-1/2 years in the second quarter, keeping wage inflation subdued for now.\nOil prices were last near unchanged, erasing earlier losses in a volatile session. Data from the Energy Information Association showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly last week.\nBrent and U.S. crude prices dropped sharply on Tuesday, ending a 25 percent three-session surge, the largest such gain since 1990.\n\"A rise of around 25 percent in three consecutive days was not going to be sustained,\" BNP Paribas oil analyst Harry Tchilinguirian said. \"The underlying fundamentals are bearish.\"\nBrent crude for October was down 1 cent at $49.55 a barrel. U.S. crude for October was flat at $45.41.\nThe dollar rose as global stock markets steadied, and as U.S. hiring data encouraged speculation that Federal Reserve policymakers will raise interest rates later this month.\nThe dollar index, a measure of six major currencies valued against the greenback, was last up 0.40 percent and had added to gains when payrolls processor ADP reported that U.S. private payrolls increased by 190,000 last month.\nThe more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report is due on Friday, the last monthly report before the Fed meets on Sept. 16-17.\nU.S. Treasuries prices slipped after the fresh efforts in China to steady financial markets mitigated concerns about the world's second-biggest economy and reduced demand for safe-haven U.S. government debt.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 3/32 in price to yield 2.18 percent, from a yield of 2.17 percent late on Tuesday. U.S. 30-year Treasuries were last down 11/32 to yield 2.95 percent, from a yield of 2.93 percent late on Tuesday.
