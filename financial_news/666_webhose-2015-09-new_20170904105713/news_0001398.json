It will update these estimates on Oct. 15, along with fresh figures for the likely level of economic growth.\nThe BOK, which hasn’t specified when it will announce the new goal, said in a report to parliament this month that it would prepare an \"optimal\" target, taking into account changes in the structure of the Korean economy and the experiences of other countries.\nIn neighboring Japan, the price gauge is stuck around zero, versus a goal of 2 percent. On the other side of the world, the Bank of England is looking at the same thing: a 2 percent target and zero inflation.\nThe BOK needs to be “realistic” when it sets its new goal and should lower the mid-point of the band to 2 percent or 2.5 percent, board member Moon Woo Sik said in a July interview.\nKorean consumer price gains have remained below 1 percent this year despite four cuts since August 2014 that took the benchmark interest rate to a record low of 1.5 percent in June.\nAll 10 economists surveyed expect the BOK to retain its current gauge. It had used a so-called core inflation measure from 2000 to 2006 that excluded oil and agricultural prices.\n“The new target could be lowered and widened to 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent to reflect the new reality of a lower but more volatile inflation path,” said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based economist for Barclays Plc.\nHaving a target that is more reflective of inflation conditions also would prevent the BOK from being \"unduly pressured\" into unnecessary easing, said Leong.\nHe expects a further rate cut to 1.25 percent in the fourth quarter. The median projection of economists is for the BOK to stay on hold in fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:08:11.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
