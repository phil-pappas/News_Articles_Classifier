Just about every business sector is harmed by not having a reliable energy supply.\nHowever, it’s not only this country’s energy issues that are problematic. Speaking at the Old Mutual Investment Insights event in Cape Town, former commissioner on the National Development Commission and director at DNA Economics, Elias Masilela said that the state of this country’s infrastructure is the single biggest constraint to South Africa’s growth.\n“The energy sector is just a microcosm of a bigger problem, which is the inadequacy of infrastructure that stops us from growing at 5% to 6%,” Masilela said. “But if we can solve the problems in the energy sector, we can replicate that elsewhere.”\nHe pointed out that water security, public transport, education, healthcare and ICT infrastructure are all areas that need to see improvement. The remedies, however, are largely similar.\nAs a starting point, Masilela listed three requirements for delivering an optimal energy sector.\n“Firstly, it must be driven under an environment of competitiveness,” he said. “That forces more players to participate and forces optimal pricing.”\nThe second requirement is that it delivers in the most affordable and efficient way. In other words, the resources must be well managed, which means that there must be transparency, accountability and good governance.\n“And thirdly, we need to combat illegal access to resources,” Masilela argued. “Eskom is struggling to manage the demand side, and illegal connections compromise the balance between supply and demand.”\nWhile these are critical to solving the issues around Eskom and electricity supply, Masilela argued that these don’t just apply to that area.\n“This is not unique in the energy sector,” he pointed out. “Any other sector needs to be subjected to the same standards to be optimal.”\nChief economist at the Old Mutual Investment Group, Rian le Roux, agreed that infrastructure problems have to be addressed urgently. However, we can’t assume that just doing so will be a silver bullet to solving the country’s economic problems.\n“There is no question that infrastructure is absolutely important,” said Le Roux. “Unless you have infrastructure in place, the economy will not grow. But it is also important to remember that infrastructure alone will not drive your economy forward if other conditions are not in place.”\nHe used the example of South Africa in the 1970s and 80s where the electricity infrastructure was so good that Eskom could afford to mothball a number of its power stations. However the economy did not benefit from this excess generation capacity because of all the other problems it had.\n“So we need to have policy certainty in place, we need government and business to co-operate better, and we need to have the correct skills in place,” he said.\nCritically, Masilela argued that the National Development Plan calls for the country as a whole to take responsibility for its economic development. This cannot just be left up to government. Business needs to be involved.\n“Everyone is responsible,” he said. “Both in the public and private sectors. If you believe that all the infrastructure we are talking about is important for your bottom line, and if you know that to be in business tomorrow you need access to electricity, skills and services, then you must take responsibility.”\nHe said that the private sector has to be prepared to provide leadership.\n“Gone are the days when we leave leadership and policy decisions to government alone,” Masilela said. “Policy is too important. We have to be involved as the private sector.”\nThis also means finding ways to improve the relationship with government.\n“I think the partnership between government and business is a very important one,” Le Roux said. “We need a social compact, not just between business and government, but also labour and society at large. Everyone has to pull together.\n“I sometimes get the impression that government and business scream at each other from public platforms, which is not the ideal way to find solutions,” Le Roux added. “We will not make much progress in the economy unless we can get this relationship to improve significantly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:09:08.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
