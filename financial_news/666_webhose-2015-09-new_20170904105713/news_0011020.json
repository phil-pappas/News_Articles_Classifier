Poor factory reports in China, the UK, Europe and the US weakened sentiment on Tuesday. In particular, two separate figures showing a contraction in Chinese manufacturing fuelled concerns about the slowdown in the world's second largest economy. \nThe data had pushed global stocks into the red but the Asian and UK markets bounced back on Wednesday. \n\"Things are looking a bit better, if still nervy, this Wednesday morning, with the European indices posting sturdy gains as the day began,\" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex . \n\"However, the fears over China are still looming above the markets like the sword of Damocles, meaning it is far too early to tell what the state of trading will be by the end of the day. The saving grace could be the two-day Chinese holiday that begins on Thursday, which in theory should provide a moment of respite for volatility-weary investors and therefore a chance to avoid the usual last minute panic in the minutes before the closing bell.\" Away from China, the focus will be on key economic data releases including Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) 's UK construction purchasing managers' index at 0930 BST, the US private payrolls report at 1315 BST and US factory orders at 1500 BST. \nIn company news, ASOS (LSE: ASC.L - news ) slumped after the founder of the online fashion retailer stepped down as chief executive after 15 years. \nAshtead gained as the British industrial equipment hire company said it was on track to achieve its full-year expectations after reporting a strong first quarter. \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) declined as the supermarket chain reportedly chose private equity firm MBK Partners as preferred bidder to buy its South Korean unit. \nOnline gambling company GVC Holdings (Other OTC: GMVHF - news ) dropped as it said it could go hostile in the £1bn tug-of-war for Bwin.party Digital Entertainment if Bwin's board recommends a lower offer from 888 Holdings Plc, the Times reported. \nRoyal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BP shares were sitting lower as oil prices continued to slide with Brent crude down 1.7% to $48.72 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate down 2.4% to $44.34 at 0906 BST. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,062.60 +0.65% FTSE 100 6,074.15 +0.26% FTSE 250 16,891.83 +0.31% FTSE 100 - Risers Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,335.00p +4.94% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 961.50p +4.85% Meggitt (MGGT) 501.00p +2.52% 3i Group (III) 469.90p +2.33% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 931.50p +1.97% Intu Properties (Other OTC: CCRGF - news ) (INTU (Swiss: OXIGTU.SW - news ) ) 319.70p +1.49% AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,093.50p +1.49% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 582.50p +1.39% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,537.00p +1.39% Capita (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) 1,212.00p +1.34% FTSE 100 - Fallers Royal Dutch Shell 'B' (RDSB) 1,625.00p -1.28% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,619.00p -1.16% Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 235.60p -0.97% BP (BP.) 346.80p -0.74% BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) (BG.) 958.00p -0.72% Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) (TW.) 194.70p -0.66% Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 132.65p -0.64% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 502.50p -0.59% Persimmon (PSN) 2,030.00p -0.59% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 598.00p -0.58% FTSE 250 - Risers Redefine International (RDI) 53.75p +2.97% Electra Private Equity (ELTA) 3,275.00p +2.34% Fidelity China Special Situations (FCSS) 117.10p +2.27% Synergy Health (Other OTC: SYHEF - news ) (SYR) 1,624.00p +2.20% DCC (Frankfurt: DCC.F - news ) (DCC (LSE: DCC.L - news ) ) 4,894.00p +2.09% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 222.80p +1.97% Aggreko (EUREX: AGKF.EX - news ) (AGK) 1,045.00p +1.85% Derwent London (LSE: DLN.L - news ) (DLN) 3,595.00p +1.58% SEGRO (LSE: SGRO.L - news ) (SGRO) 420.40p +1.55% BTG (Other OTC: BTGYY - news ) (BTG (LSE: BTG.L - news ) ) 631.50p +1.53% FTSE 250 - Fallers Halfords Group (LSE: HFD.L - news ) (HFD) 469.80p -7.88% Diploma (DPLM) 665.50p -6.99% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 99.00p -4.53% Evraz (EVR) 68.25p -3.74% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 94.95p -3.31% Clarkson (CKN) 2,265.00p -2.37% Just Retirement Group (JRG) 187.60p -2.04% Foxtons Group (LSE: FOXT.L - news ) (FOXT) 236.10p -1.34% Debenhams (DEB) 74.00p -1.33% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 215.80p -1.33% FTSE TechMARK - Risers Filtronic (FTC) 6.75p +8.00% Dialight (DIA (Amsterdam: DI6.AS - news ) ) 654.00p +3.32% SDL (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 376.00p +1.01% KCOM Group (LSE: KCOM.L - news ) (KCOM) 96.50p +0.52% Spirent Communications (Other OTC: SPMYY - news ) (SPT (Taiwan OTC: 8431.TWO - news ) ) 78.25p +0.32% Oxford Instruments (Other OTC: OXGGY - news ) (OXIG) 842.50p +0.18% Oxford Biomedica (LSE: OXB.L - news ) (OXB) 7.71p +0.13% IShares Euro Gov Bond 7-10YR UCITS ETF (IEGM) € 198.97 +0.12% FTSE TechMARK - Fallers UCW Limited (UCW) A$0.01 -6.67% XP Power Ltd (LSE: XPP.L - news ) .
