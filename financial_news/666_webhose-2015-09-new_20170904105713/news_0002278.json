You're happy, but you quickly realise that there is no job security,\" he said. \nSpain's government is forecasting the economy will grow by 3.3 percent this year, one of the strongest rates in the eurozone. \nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy in 2012 passed reforms making it easier for firms to hire and fire as part of his austerity reforms. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) he has promised a million jobs would be created over the 2014-2015 period. \nPichel and others his age find that hard to imagine. Opposition parties and labour unions dispute the diagnosis given by the conservative government, which is preparing to fight for re-election in December. \nSpain's unemployment rate remains extremely high at more than 22 percent. One in every two eligible workers under the age of 25 is out of work. \n\"Every month in Spain 1.5 million contracts are signed. That's 18 million a year. So what's going on? These are contracts for just a day's or a week's work,\" said Manuel Lago, an economist in the major union CCOO. \n\"Employment in Spain is very seasonal. Jobs start getting created shortly before Easter and the unemployment rate goes down all summer\" before ticking back up in August. \n- 'Unsteady jobs' - \nAnna Laborda of ESADE business school in Barcelona agrees that the jobs being created in Spain are \"very unstable\" ones. \nLabour ministry figures show that one quarter of all contracts signed in the first half of this year were for a week's work or less. \n\"If the unemployment rate has gone down, it is only because the number of people eligible to qualify as job seekers has decreased\" due to emigration, said Laborda. \nSpain suffered two recessions after its housing bubble burst in 2008. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) returned to growth in mid-2013. \nMany of the millions of immigrants who were drawn to Spain during the prior boom years were driven away by the crisis. \nYoung people with qualifications and languages have followed, since all Spain seems to offer is \"seasonal or unsteady jobs\", Laborda added. \nDespite his business diplomas, Pichel had been scraping a living by refereeing football matches at weekends. \nThen he landed a three-year contract at a bank near Dresden, including a fixed salary, housing and four paid return journeys to Spain a year. \nTwo other Spaniards have since joined him at the bank. \n\"I pulled the long straw,\" he said. \"It sounded too good to be true.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:21:56.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
