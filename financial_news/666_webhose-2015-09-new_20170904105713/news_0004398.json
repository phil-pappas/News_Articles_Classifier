The decision, which follows cuts in January and July prompted by an oil-price shock, is due at 10 a.m. Wednesday in Ottawa.\nStanding pat would bolster Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s argument that Canada’s economy “is back on track.” Another rate cut would strengthen critiques of his economic stewardship by the leftist New Democratic Party and centrist Liberals.\n“Things aren’t great but there are signs of life,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial in Montreal. “They are going to take enough encouragement from the data to avoid cutting rates again.”\nExports, Jobs After Canada’s economy contracted in the first two quarters of this year, meeting the textbook definition of a technical recession, evidence the worst is over has started trickling in for the Group of Seven’s biggest oil exporter.\nThe case for a recovery includes a report last week that exports rose 2.3 percent in July after a 5.5 percent gain in June, the biggest two-month increase since 2011. Canada has also added 193,300 jobs in the 12 months through August, defying the normal pattern of a recession. The evidence backs Poloz’s view that momentum outside of Canada’s energy sector would take over in the second half of this year.\nThe central bank predicted in July that gross domestic product would rebound in the third quarter to grow at a 1.5 percent annualized pace. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict it will come in at 1.9 percent. Statistics Canada reported last week the economy shrank by an annualized 0.5 percent in the second quarter, matching the bank’s July forecast.\nSwaps traders are putting the odds of a rate cut Wednesday at about 15 percent, down from 44 percent in late August when there was concern a Chinese stock market crash would dent global growth. Cutting again would return Canada’s benchmark rate to the record low 0.25 percent set by former Governor Mark Carney in 2009 during the global financial crisis, when the country was in a deep recession.\nThe R-Word After his July rate decision, Poloz declined to say whether Canada was in a recession or whether the Conservative government should provide fresh fiscal stimulus to go along with his rate cuts.\nBank of Canada policy makers -- whose next decision is set for Oct. 21, two days after the vote -- may avoid making any comments in Wednesday’s statement that could be seen as political interference, economists said. No press conference is scheduled since the announcement doesn’t coincide with a new quarterly forecast.\n“I’m sure they will want to be cautious but they will stick to the facts,” said Benjamin Reitzes, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.\n“It looks as though the worst might be behind us. Whether that is actually the case we will have to wait and see.”\n‘Overly Loose’ Cutting rates again could add to risks from consumer debt and home prices that have reached record levels in recent years. Such a move could also boost a core inflation rate that has exceeded Poloz’s 2 percent target since August 2014. “Monetary policy is overly loose in Canada,” Derek Holt, Scotiabank’s vice-president of economics in Toronto, wrote in a research note.\nThe recovery is already aided by a Canadian dollar that fell to the lowest since 2004 last month and is near that mark at about C$1.32 per U.S. dollar. That comes as the economy in the U.S. -- which buys three-quarters of Canada’s exports -- is strengthening enough for Federal Reserve officials to signal they will raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.\nHowever there are still important drags on Canada’s recovery. Oil prices, for example, fell below $40 a barrel last month and exports have suffered from years of weak global demand.\n“Oil remaining low remains a risk to the downside,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. However “there probably isn’t any need for an immediate response from the bank.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T12:57:05.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
