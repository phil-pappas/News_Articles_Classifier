James Davies by Kate Cowling Investors with currency-exposed stocks have been in an anxious holding pattern for the past few months.\nA surprise drop in the Chinese renminbi, uncertainty in global markets and endless commentary about a Federal Reserve rate rise have seen traders hit with news of a faltering Aussie dollar several times since the start of the financial new year – something that could be good or bad news, depending on how you're positioned.\nAs a heavily commodities-based economy, the Australian dollar is at the mercy of global forces, primarily the United States and China.\nAnd the Aussie certainly recognises that. After dropping to a six-year low of US69¢ in early September, a short China rally brought it back above the US70¢ mark, where it sat, awaiting the Fed's rate call (after a brief bounce following Malcolm Turnbull's election).\nAbout half of economists and 28 per cent of the market priced in a rate rise, according to Emma Lawson, a senior currency strategist at NAB. So the lack of movement wasn't a huge surprise.\nWhen Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen held fire, we saw a predictable jump. Suddenly, the party was back on and investors were feeling confident.\nWhen the dollar hit US72¢, a selling frenzy began as traders rushed to take advantage of the currency's rally, says Ms Lawson.\nWaiting on the US Fed But few expect the reprieve to last. \"Many are just waiting for that band-aid to be pulled off,\" says Lawson. \"We're range-bound again into the October or December meeting.\"\nBy range-bound, she says the market doesn't expect the dollar to go higher than the low US70¢s or lower than the high US60¢s.\n\"The Aussie is likely to be in this range for a while,\" she says. \"It's hard for it to rally too far because the Fed is pretty comfortable about the domestic environment; they're just worried about the international impact.\"\nA Federal Reserve rate rise could cause global volatility, which would push the US dollar higher, lower the oil price and prevent the US from maintaining its inflation target, she says.\nMany economists have predicted any rate move by the Fed will be gradual in an attempt to keep volatility at a low, but with a strong US economy it's still a matter of \"when\" rather than \"if\".\nIn the meantime, while investors wait for the US to tighten they are likely to re-establish their short positions, Lawson says.\nWhen that US rate trigger is pulled, some analysts, like head of investment strategy at UBS David Sokulsky, say it could fall as low at US65¢ – or even further, depending on China's withdrawal.\nNot so fast A very different scenario has been keeping Equity Trustees head of asset management Paul Kasian up at night.\nThe China situation is unpredictable, he says, and there's a real risk there could be a rally that would push the Australian dollar right up again – something few analysts are talking about or factoring in.\n\"During the GFC, China panicked and overstimulated the economy and we had the biggest resources boom for that flash,\" he says. \"If their current stimulus of dropping the renminbi and dropping interest rates doesn't work, there is a risk they'll panic and start spending money.\n\"If the market gets whiff of that, all the commodities-based currencies, of which we are one, will rally on that because everyone will assume 'away goes China again'.\"\nIt's not something Dr Kasian has been investing for. On the contrary, he's positioned for a falling AUD. But he says the other potential \"irrational\" scenario is worrying him, as humans are unpredictable and have a tendency to panic.\n\"Most people have got a mid 60s to high 60s view, and that's where I think the market is rationally positioned, but people forget the risk that China is slowing. But China is run by politicians who need to shore up their position.\n\"We've got more stocks with overseas earnings as opposed to Australian earnings, and we're underweight resource stocks ... but I'm obsessed with the fact if China was to panic and start spending, I would have to unwind my position,\" he says.\nHe stresses that if he starts to see spending in China, it would encourage him to rethink his allocation quite quickly.\n\"As soon as you get wind that China starts spending, you're better off going a bit earlier than a bit later.\"\nInvestor value spots While speculation on where the dollar will go next is rife, the real question that should be concerning investors is who stands to win and lose from a large currency price move?\nA weaker Australian dollar makes our exports more appealing and encourages investment in service industries such as education, domestic tourism and financial services, says David Bryant, head of investments at Australian Unity.\n\"The Fed's indication that it is ready to move in October or December takes pressure off the Reserve Bank of Australia to act on domestic interest rates and it is likely that the end of quantitative easing, and any increase in interest rates in the US, will be a blessing in disguise for Australian investors,\" he says.\n\"A higher US dollar also improves returns on our resources and makes other materials exports such as agriculture more competitive.\"\nOn China, he says it's \"still a work in progress\".\nA stronger US dollar, against a weaker Aussie, is also welcome news for investors with companies in their portfolios where income is denominated in US currency.\nSince the Australian dollar started to weaken, UBS's Sokulsky has been keen on US technology stocks and European financials. He says investors willing to take on a little bit more risk could also look at US energy companies, some of which still have attractive valuations.\n\"What we've been saying for some time now is to focus on offshore assets and Australian corporates that have US dollar earnings,\" he says.\nThere could also be upside in companies leveraged to increasing tourist flows to Australia, he says.\n\"[When the dollar drops] Australia becomes a much cheaper holiday destination for offshore travellers and, secondly, when you look at Australian travellers they are going to be more inclined to take holidays here rather than go overseas.\"\nInvestors worried about the currency fluctuation could hedge a bit of the risk via the options market, FX forwards or dollar-hedged mutual funds.\nThe downside On the other side of the falling Australian dollar/strengthening US dollar coin, retail stocks could suffer further, as cost pressures on retailers see them pass on costs to either consumers or shareholders, says Farina Parsons, an equity analyst at Morningstar.\nParsons named Pacific Brands and personal care brand Asaleo Care as examples of companies that could face tough times, particularly if the dollar stays low for a long time.\n\"They are all saying they will have price rises,\" she says. \"The majority of them are hedged for the first half for 2015-16, but for the second half, that's where the currency pain will be felt.\"\nProperty impacts When it comes to property any downward move in the dollar is a positive for a market which has been coping with a series of stimulatory and deflationary pressures in the past few months, including new capital holding requirements by the Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority and a booming NSW economy, says SQM Research analyst Louis Christopher.\nHe says property investors should be less worried about the effects of what the US Federal Reserve does and more interested in what the Reserve Bank of Australia does.\nThe market has partially priced in an RBA rate cut to 1.75 per cent by February – or May at the latest – something that would have almost certainly have a stimulatory impact on the housing market.\nIn a speech to Parliament's standing committee on economics last week, RBA governor Glenn Stevens said he's comfortable where the economy is going and said there was some evidence that regulatory measures to curb debt build up were working.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:02:27.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
