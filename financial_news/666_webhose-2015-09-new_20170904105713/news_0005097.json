Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan New Prime Minister and Republican Malcolm Turnbull has said he will prioritise the economy over turning Australia into a republic under his leadership, and said former Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be going through a dark time.\nAhead of the swearing in of his new ministry on Monday , Mr Turnbull said there were much more important issues, and making Australia a republic was dependent on building a people's movement, which he predicted would only be possible at the end of Queen's reign.\nIn his blitz on morning television, Mr Turnbull has also instilled more doubt in the future of deregulating university fees , legislation championed by former Education minister and new Industry Minister Christopher Pyne.\n\"That's certainly not an issue that's on the agenda for Cabinet...We've got political realities to deal with in the Senate.\n#BREAKING: New PM Malcolm Turnbull has announced his new ministry. Scott Morrison, as expected, is the new Treasurer while Turnbull has said Joe Hockey will quit parliament. Here is a full list:\nPosted by Financial Review - Federal politics on Saturday, 19 September 2015 \"I would say it's highly possible that you could change it to something that will get through the Senate,\" he said.\nDespite his role as former head of the Australian Republican Movement from 1993-2000, and accusing former Prime Minister John Howard of \"breaking the nation's heart\" in failing to help the 1999 referendum on the issue get it over the line, Mr Turnbull said he would instead be focusing on the economy.\n\"The republic issues cannot belong to a politician, it's got to be a genuine popular movement.\n\"My own view for what it it worth...is that the next occasion for the republic referendum to come up is going to be after the end of the Queens reign\"\n\"While I am a republican there are much more immediate issues [such as the economy],\" he said.\n@TurnbullMalcolm feel free to stop by any time. pic.twitter.com/2FnGZSeeAL\nâ€” House of Cards (@HouseofCards) September 21, 2015 Mr Turnbull said he did not offer Mr Abbott a cabinet position, nor did he to former Treasurer Joe Hockey, set to take over as Ambassador to the US, as he did not request one.\n\"It's very tough on Tony, I know what it's like to be removed as Leader of the Liberal Party it's horrible it is a dark, black experience, it's awful that sense of rejection.\n\"I deeply emphasise with him, I'm one of the few people that actually has a pretty good insight into how that feels,\" he said.\nMr Turnbull confirmed he will live in the Lodge when it is finished, after Mr Abbott never got the chance to live there.\nDespite reports to the contrary, Mr Turnbull declined to confirm he would be dumping Knights and Dames, saying it's \"a matter that will be considered by cabinet\".\nMr Turnbull also declined to give a clear answer when asked if he did a deal with Scott Morrison in a back-room agreement to make him leader.\n\"I mean seriously. Let's focus on - everyone that's listening really wants to - look, we've got to change the paradigm,\" he said on ABC radio.\nWith Labor attacking Mr Turnbull and saying he was driven by ambition and will not make substantial changes to policy, Mr Turnbull was keen to prove he was his own man.\n\"I decide the colour of my ties and the manner in which I wear them.\n\"I have nothing in common with Frank Underwood, other than we both use a rowing machine,\" he joked when asked why he was being compared to the ambitious President character in the TV series House of Cards .\nFurther fuelling speculation his Prime Minister ship would see a turn to China in Australia's foreign policy, he said \"this is the Asian century\".\nWhile Mr Turnbull did not appoint a disabilities minister when he announced his cabinet on Sunday, new Social Services minister Christian Porter will take on responsibility for disability and aging, including the NDIS.\nOther machinery of government changes include moving childcare of the Department of Social Services and then into Education, as well as moving water into the Department of Agriculture.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm", "https://www.facebook.com/financialreviewfederalpolitics", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://twitter.com/HouseofCards/status/645757536440741889", "http://t.co/2FnGZSeeAL", "https://www.facebook.com/financialreviewfederalpolitics/posts/475964282564533:0"], "published": "2015-09-21T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:51:04.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
