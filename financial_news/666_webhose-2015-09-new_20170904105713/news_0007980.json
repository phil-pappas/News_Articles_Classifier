He noted that currently, some OMCs are making just about 7.00 per cent or less total margin on the ex-pump price to drive volumes.\nHe said margins are shrinking among the OMCs because buyers have become so sensitive to price than quality. \nDr Obeng-Okon who is also an Economic/Investment Management Consultant said OMCs could no longer blame the NPA for the determination of total retail margins even in the face of increasing ex-pump price. \nHe said competition and the forces of demand and supply are now the main determinant of the price mechanism. \n'Liquidity positions of the OMCs have become very tight as most of them now have a shorter working capital cycle because the BDCs now require earlier payment than before,' he said. \nDr Obeng-Okon noted that some OMCs had to put a stop on using the BDCs monies to fund the construction of service station because working capital has become very essential for their survival. \n'To make matters worse for the OMCs, the Special Petroleum Tax (SPT) and OMCs' Guarantees to Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Customs Division have become a further drain on the liquidity of the OMCs. \n'Usually, OMCs are expected to pay the 17.5 per cent SPT on their loadings within two weeks whether or not they have sold the products. Sometimes, taxes are paid on unsold products and this is very worrying,' he said. \nDr Obeng-Okon noted however that the payment of SPT also impacts negatively on the guarantee ceilings of OMCs with Customs. 'The GRA needs to be sensitive to the plight of the OMCs on the flexibility of enforcing the guarantees before loadings if the deregulation is to be successful'. \nHe said the deregulation is beneficial to government because it ensures the paying of the outstanding debt of government to the BDCs as well as ensure that government no longer subsidises the cost of fuel. \nUnder the deregulation, the BDCs have been successful in convincing government and the NPA to remove the Price Stabilisation Margins from the pricing formula. \nHe explained that the deregulation has also improved the liquidity position of the BDCs through the reduction of credit days for the OMCs. \nDr Obeng-Okon said competition among the BDCs has reduced the ex-refinery prices for the OMCs and thus lower prices for the final consumer. \nThe regulator needs to monitor the quality of petroleum products as consumers shift their attention to just the price. \nGNA Other Stories Follow Us This world is not a fair place to be but one must accept that life is full of mystrey.
