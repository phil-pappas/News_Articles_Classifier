Darrian Traynor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby West Australian home builders have been among the leaders in the housing development industry but the resources-induced slump, that has pushed Perth home values down 4.9 per cent in the year to date, may change that.\n\"The more resources-driven states like WA and Queensland will have headwinds to deal with over the next couple of years,\" said ABN Group managing director Dale Alcock. \"The demand will be there over the long term, but we've got a little bit of pain to get through in the interim.\"\nPerth-based BGC Australia was the top housing developer of the year, even though its starts slipped to 4834 from 5004 a year earlier. WA peer Alcock Brown-Neaves (ABN) Group ranked second with 4608 homes - up from 4142.\nThe pain for WA builders is good news for home buyers, however, as prices are likely to be subdued.\n\"The next two years in WA there will not be an increase in lot pricing,\" Mr Alcock said. \"Escalation has disappeared out of the market as greater competition for land sales emerges from a declining market. The same is true for housing prices on the labour side. We are now seeing available labour coming back into the market as our housing production is slow. We are also getting workers returning back to our industry from the mining and resources industry.\"\nMarket share drops The market share of WA's top 20 home builders fell over the past year. While housing starts in WA as a whole rose 9 per cent to 31,569 in the year to June, according to the Housing Industry Association – which published its numbers ahead of the official ABS figures to be revealed next month –the share of the largest builders fell to 57 per cent from 66 per cent of the total.\nThe patchy nature of Australia's housing market means things are not all bad for ABN Group, however, which is offsetting a weaker WA performance with strength in Victoria.\n \"We would have definitely seen commencements slowing in WA, but have not seen a corresponding slowdown in our other market which is Victoria,\" Mr Alcock said.\nBut in the cyclical WA economy, it was only a matter of time before the situation, which is already playing out, improved, Mr Alcock said.\n\"I call it [the painful period] two years for lack of anything better to really reference,\" he said. \"What that means is we're already probably nearly on 12 months into an adjustment.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-23T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:12:28.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
