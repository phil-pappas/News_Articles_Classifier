Meanwhile, the $12.8 trillion U.S. Treasury market is still governed by rules adopted during the age of paper filings and telephone trading.\nThe mismatch became evident to regulators probing how the yield on the 10-year Treasury note could plummet by 8% — then shoot back up and nearly level off just 12 minutes later — as it did last October in what has been billed a “flash crash.”\nSome government investigators were surprised to learn that lightly supervised firms using fast, automated strategies now represent about half of trading volume on a typical day, according to people familiar with the probe. They also couldn’t quickly access the sort of minute-by-minute trading records that are now standard for stocks and other bonds.\n“Put simply, we cannot get the information we need to analyze risk across Treasury markets in anything that approaches real time,” Antonio Weiss, a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, said in a speech at a Washington think tank last month. “That has to change.”\nThe Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission are now hustling to catch up with plans for more data and closer oversight of firms in the market, people familiar with the matter said.\nOne requirement gaining traction is the creation of a regularly updated data feed that the government could use to track and reconstruct dealings in Treasurys, the people said.\nOfficials are also discussing whether venues used to trade Treasurys should be subject to rules similar to those the SEC has adopted for counterparts in the world of stocks, the people said. That could mean more scrutiny of daily operations at Treasury trading platforms such as ICAP PLC’s IAP, +1.18% BrokerTec and Nasdaq Inc.’s NDAQ, +1.84% eSpeed. Currently, platforms for Treasury securities are exempt from rules that impose basic safeguards like having a plan for an event that knocks the exchange offline.\nFirms that trade Treasurys could also come under more scrutiny as a result of the review. The officials are discussing whether they should be required to register with the SEC or another regulator, the people said.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-bond-market-the-u-s-treasury-struggles-to-keep-up-1443027850"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T05:05:05.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
