The company operates under two brands: Poundworld and Bargain Buys. \nBargain chains have enjoyed a renaissance since the recession hit, becoming one of the fastest-growing sectors in retail. \nThis fast-growth profile, coupled with favourable stock market conditions and cheap debt, has led to a wave of new listings. Rival stores Poundland and B&M Bargains have both floated on the London stock market over the past two years. \nThe sector also appears to be in consolidation mode. In August, Poundland's £55m takeover of its rival 99p Stores was provisionally cleared by the UK's competition watchdog after an in-depth probe into the deal. \nThe watchdog said that while only one major single-priced retailer - Poundworld - would remain after the deal, the merged company would still face competition from other discounters including B&M, Home Bargains, Wilko and Bargain Buys as well as supermarket chains including Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Asda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:03:26.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
