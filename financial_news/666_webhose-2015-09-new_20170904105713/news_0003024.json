( Stockpickr ) -- There isn't a day that goes by on Wall Street when certain stocks trading for under $10 a share don't experience massive spikes higher. Traders savvy enough to follow the low-priced names and trade them with discipline and sod risk management are banking ridiculous coin on a regular basis. \nJust take a look at some of the big movers to the upside in the under-$10 complex from Wednesday, including Wave Systems ( WAVX ) , which exploded higher by 76.2%; Liquid Holdings ( LIQD ) , which soared by 59%; Ascent Solar Technologies ( ASTI ) , which surged higher by 42.3%; and WPCS International ( WPCS ) , which spiked higher by 26.6%.

I also like to find under-$10 stocks with a catalyst, but that's secondary to the chart and volume patterns . \nWith that in mind, here's a look at several under-$10 stocks that look poised to potentially trade higher from current levels. 1 of 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:25:43.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
