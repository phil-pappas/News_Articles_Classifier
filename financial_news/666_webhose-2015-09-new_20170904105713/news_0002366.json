Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow National Australia Bank is a big organisation, so we don't want to beat this up too much.\nBut we were interested to hear there's been a bit of internal dissent at Andrew Thorburn 's outfit over the approach of its corporate affairs team on the subject of coal.\nA week ago NAB's corporate affairs team made it known that it would not fund Adani's $16 billion Carmichael coal project – not that anyone had said it was going to.\nThat bit of entrepreneurial public relations impressed activist NGOs from Market Forces to Greenpeace to Australian Youth Climate Coalition.\nBut it was not uniformly welcomed across the Abbott government, many of whom, rightly or wrongly, still typecast the bank as Labor-aligned – even after the departure of Cameron Clyne .\nLast November Paula Benson was promoted from her gig as general manager of corporate responsibility to be NAB's head of corporate affairs.\nWe noted at the time that it had not gone unnoticed in certain Coalition ministerial offices that Benson is married to the ALP's shadow minister for snowboarding, Stephen Conroy – who is not exactly a darling of the Liberal Party.\nLet's just say – again, rightly or wrongly – that those dots have once again been joined in some suspicious, partisan heads.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/national-australia-bank-rules-out-funding-adanis-carmichael-coal-mine-20150902-gjdsfl.html"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:03:41.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
