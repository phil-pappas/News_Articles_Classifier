She is recognized with this prestigious distinction for leadership in accounting. NAPW is the nation’s leading networking organization exclusively for professional women, boasting more than 700,000 members and over 200 operating local chapters. “I’m pleased to present Megan with this important honor,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “Her knowledge and experience in business are valuable assets to her clients and community.”\nAfter completing college, Megan Roswick introduced herself to the field of public accounting. Five years ago, she established Roswick & Company, LLC . As a general practitioner, she guides small business owners, individual tax returns, and corporate and individual tax planning while providing services to the nonprofit industry.\nMs. Roswick’s various skills include explaining financial information to her clients, so they will understand what their business involves. “So many times they feel that accounting professionals ‘talk above’ them and they don’t understand the health of their own business,” said Ms. Roswick. She believes if she explains the breakdown of the financial aspect, she will provide positive and direct answers for her clients.\nFinding solutions may be difficult for Ms. Roswick considering she faces the constant changes in tax laws. Even though she finds the changes to be challenging, she also finds it rewarding to continually learn something new. For the future, Ms. Roswick hopes to grow within her company as a practicing Accountant and also serve the nonprofit community through her involvement in various organizations.\nAwards & Accomplishments: Bachelor’s, University of Delaware, Accounting\nAbout NAPW\nNAPW’s mission is to provide an exclusive networking forum to successful professional women where they can aspire, connect and achieve.
