The money was allocated through the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, and the European Social Fund.\n>>Read: Court of Auditors requests mandate to control Juncker Plan\nThe funds are meant to encourage growth in less developed regions and reduce disparities between different EU countries.\nNew legislation for European Structural and Investment Funds for 2014-2020 introduces pre-conditions that are deemed necessary for the effective use of EU support. Countries must present action plans to show their progress.\nThe Commission has the power to suspend payment if those conditions are not met by 31 December 2016.\nIt told auditors it wanted to reduce the risk of having to suspend payments by supporting member states. “But [the Commission] will not refrain from using the tool of suspension if the targets and milestones […] are not met,” the executive said.\nAt the beginning of 2015, 12 of the 28 EU nations – Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia - had not fulfilled public procurement conditions demanded by EU law.\nA “significant part” of the cohesion policy cash is spent through public procurement, with almost half of all projects audited involving one or more tenders.\nProper analysis of the many failures to comply with public procurement rules was very limited, the auditors warned. The lack of coherent, detailed data on the errors made it impossible to analyse why they kept happening.\n>>Read: E U millions wasted on white elephant airports, say auditors\nThe Court said the Commission should develop a database to analyse the frequency, seriousness and causes of public procurement errors in cohesion policy.\nThe audit found that the Commission and member states had started to address the “consistently high level of errors” but there was still a “long way to go” in analysing the problem and taking action.\nIn its reply to auditors, the Commission said it had been addressing the problem of public procurement errors in cohesion policy for a long time.\nThis was now being coordinated under the umbrella of a public procurement action plan put in place by the Commission in 2013.", "external_links": ["http://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR15_10/SR_PROCUREMENT_EN.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-15T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T09:45:00.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
