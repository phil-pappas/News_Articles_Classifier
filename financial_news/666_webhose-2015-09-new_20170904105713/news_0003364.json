Supplied by Greg Smith Investor concern over China slowing down has weighed on many stocks, and some more than others. One segment coming under particular pressure has been the European \"luxury goods\" exporters that have China as a big customer. This is despite the fact that in many instances a weak euro is underpinning a strong operating performance.\nA good example is BMW, whose share price has fallen to less than €90 ($144), compared with highs of €123.60 in March. China has been the engine of growth for the German premium car brands but sales are starting to come off. The China Passenger Car Association reported that July sales were the lowest since February last year, at 1.3 million units.\nChina is an important market for BMW, and accounted for 21 per cent of group sales in the first seven months of this year. But vehicle sales there were up by only 1.3 per cent from January to July this year on a year ago. By contrast, sales in the Americas were up 8.4 per cent, Europe was up 9.7 per cent and Asia and the rest of world, excluding China, was up 9.5 per cent.\nOverall group vehicle deliveries were up 7.5 per cent to a record 1.272 million. Car sales in July were up 5.6 per cent on a year ago at 173,195, which was a new high for the month. BMW's investment in electric car technology is also bearing fruit, with BMW i-vehicle sales in July up 79.4 per cent on a year ago to 2221. While this is only 1.28 per cent of total July automobile sales, it has had a meaningful effect on growth.\nBMW is clearly not firing on all of its geographic pistons, but three out of four isn't bad. The rebound in Europe and strength of the Americas should in our view help offset the pressure in China. Europe is still a key market, at 44 per cent of unit sales in the first seven months of this year.\nMain driver Against this backdrop, BMW expects a \"solid increase\" in earnings before tax this year. The main driver is the automotive segment, because this generates the bulk of the profit, but the financial services division is also getting solid growth.\nIn the company's most recent first-half results, the group reported a moderate 0.8 per cent increase in profit before tax to €4.85 billion, with profit growth in financial services offsetting a fall in earnings in the car division.\n The automobile EBIT margin in the first half of this year was 8.9 per cent, compared with 10.7 per cent a year ago. Management attributed this to changes in the model mix, fierce competition and higher personal expenses. The fall is disappointing, but the first-half figure is in line with a target margin of 8-10 per cent for this year and next year.\nOn balance, we believe the current valuation makes BMW an attractive ride. At a share price about €85, the stock is trading on a forecast earnings multiple of 8.5 times for this year and with a 4 per cent yield, that is covered three times by profit.\nAs a car maker this is clearly a cyclical company, so BMW is unlikely to have a high multiple rating at this phase of the cycle. However, these figures suggest the shares are in value territory.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.
