And talks with management have resumed in recent months. \nCockpit said Monday that it has made substantial concessions and accused management of seeking to \"smash wage-agreement structures and demolish protective mechanisms in order to weaken the union.\" \nLufthansa, which also owns Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has embarked on a massive reorganisation, farming out much of its domestic and medium-haul services to its low-cost airline division, Germanwings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T01:27:46.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
