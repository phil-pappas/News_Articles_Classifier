He said the property in question is over 100 years old and Nujoma and his family have been using it for the past 26 years. \nHe also said the construction of a new residence is necessary, because the old house has become a safety risk. \nKapofi stated that a feasibility study was carried out by consultants to determine the extent of the renovations needed. \n\"The consultants found that due to the age of the existing structure, renovation is not a viable option. Therefore, a new structure had to be built,\" he said. A local daily newspaper published a report earlier this month saying that government's decision to build Nujoma a new house raised eyebrows after he was left without accommodation in Windhoek. \nKapofi explained that in terms of the Former Presidents' Pension and other Benefits Act of 2004 as amended in 2012, former presidents are to be provided with certain benefits by the State when their tenure of office comes to an end. \"Amongst these benefits, is the provision of a private residence. I should add that the provision of a residence to a former Head of State is not unique to Namibia. It is a worldwide practice,\" Kapofi said. \nHe further said it should be noted that when Nujoma retired in 2005, he felt that it was not necessary for the State to build a new residence for him, because he already had a house given to him by the Swapo Party in 1989. \nKapofi said Nujoma's decision to live there was in part motivated by the need to save public funds and his decision at the time should be applauded. \nKapofi added that any insinuation the government neglected to provide Nujoma with appropriate accommodation should be rejected, because it is simply untrue. \n\"At present the founding president and his family are provided with a safe and secure temporary shelter, pending the completion of the construction of the new residence,\" the presidential affairs minister said. \nHe added Namibia must pride herself over the fact it takes care of its former presidents, unlike in other countries were ex-presidents end up living in destitution.
