This could hardly be considered speedy.”\n7.5pc more Hong Kong funds ahead of mainland China cross-selling deal He said all fund products that qualify for cross-border sales under the scheme have already been authorised by market regulators and individual funds should not have to wait this long.\nA spokesman for the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) declined to comment on the reasons for the delay.\nChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, the lawmaker representing the financial services sector, said the delay had most likely been caused by the stock market slump since mid-June. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had been bogged down with stabilising the market and had had little time to look into the approval of funds, even though applications for cross-border sales started to be accepted from July 1.\nCheung said he believed the SFC had completed its part of the approval process and was waiting for the CSRC’s decision so that they could announce their approvals together. The mutual recognition scheme allows 100 Hong Kong-domiciled funds and 850 mainland funds to sell up to 300 billion yuan (HK$364.44 billion) of products on the other side.\nBritish fund house Schroders and the fund arms of Bank of China (Hong Kong), Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia were among the first 11 institutions to apply to the CSRC for clearance to sell their products on the mainland.\nBank of China Investment Fund was among the 14 mainland funds that were the first to apply to sell their funds in Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong government has been looking to the cross-border funds scheme to promote the city as an international fund centre and compete with Ireland and Luxembourg, where most international funds are domiciled. Under the scheme, only funds domiciled in Hong Kong for more than a year can be sold on the mainland.\nThe scheme has attracted more international fund houses to base their products in Hong Kong. The number of Hong Kong-domiciled funds authorised by the SFC jumped 23 per cent year on year to 607 at the end of June. There are 1,007 Luxembourg-domiciled funds authorised to be sold in Hong Kong and 276 from Ireland.\nThe majority of respondents do not believe that Hong Kong will emerge as a bigger fund domicile than Luxembourg or Ireland by 2025 Sean Tuffy, head of regulatory intelligence, Brown Brothers Harriman In addition, many fund houses like to set up their funds in the format of the Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferrable Securities (UCITS), which can be sold in international markets. Hong Kong-domiciled funds can only be sold in the city and on the mainland.\nSean Tuffy, head of regulatory intelligence at custodian services firm Brown Brothers Harriman, said his firm’s survey of fund managers on the outlook for the industry in 10 years showed they did not think Hong Kong could compete with Luxembourg and Ireland.\n“The majority of respondents do not believe that Hong Kong will emerge as a bigger fund domicile than Luxembourg or Ireland by 2025,” Tuffy said. “Respondents cited a combination of the strength of the UCITS brand as well as first-mover advantage as the main reasons for Ireland and Luxembourg’s continued success.”\nWhile many respondents believe the mutual recognition scheme would attract more fund houses to domicile in Hong Kong to enable them to expand on the mainland, they also said they believed mainland fund managers would adopt the UCITS format when they want to sell in Europe.\nThe survey showed 53 per cent of respondents thought the chances of other Asian fund formats, including Hong Kong-domiciled funds, replacing UCITS by 2025 were low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T12:08:58.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
