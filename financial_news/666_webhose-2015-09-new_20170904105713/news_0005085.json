Alex Ellinghausen That also goes to the heart of the economic challenges facing the country.\n\"Ultimately the Prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs,\" Turnbull says. \"He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.'\nThat is a sentiment with which most senior leaders in the business community would agree. But the risks of this challenge providing the stable leadership are still enormous. Knocking off a sitting Prime Minister in his first term of office leads to bitter recriminations that undermine the party for years - as Labor well knows.\nBut Turnbull's challenge was effectively arguing that there was no choice. And the fact that he actually forced the issue means that became true anyway. There could be no going back to Abbott. He was fatally wounded and his colleagues realised that, even those who support Abbott and distrust Turnbull.\n How it came to this reflects one of the most devastating and destructive periods in Australian politics. Only two years ago Abbott was elected promising grown up government after the soap opera and leadership changes of the former Labor Government and the Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard debacles.\nYet he survived February's non-challenge with 39 of his backbenchers voting against him, despite Turnbull not even standing. He asked for six months to prove himself and to improve the position of the government. That has not happened. And this time around, it is the many ministers who are no longer willing to sit it out that is the lethal new flank of the assault on his leadership.\nThe notion that Turnbull will unite the party is optimistic to say the least given the degree of passion in the anti Malcolm camp. But the public and private backing by deputy Julie Bishop will greatly assist the image of a party that has given their leader more than enough chances to avoid this humiliating fate.\nTurnbull deliberately targeted Abbott only rather than the combination of Abbott and Joe Hockey as Treasurer that has attracted so much criticism. But the result is still that Hockey will go down with Abbott and that there will be a new treasurer, most likely Scott Morrison. Morrison has not joined in the recent swirling rumours and activities but neither is he standing in the way of change.\nTurnbull said correctly that it was not a decision that anyone could take lightly.\nBut it is also true that there has been a sense of inevitability about a challenge coming for months unless things improved for the Government.\nThe initial hopes by Abbott supporters that a well received Budget could overcome the credibility gap for the government quickly became lost in the confusion of the Bronwyn Bishop nonsense and other gaffes. His former supporters became ever more despairing.\nThat meant the coincidence of of the timing of the Canning by election could not have been worse for a Prime Minister under such pressure from his colleagues, assessing every move. Even Western Australia, a state where the conservatives are supposedly at their strongest, had turned against Abbott no matter how much he talked about ending the hated mining tax and carbon tax and stopping the boats.\nThe argument from senior ministers was that a bad result in Canning would lead to a massive reassessment, even from those who had earlier refused to contemplate the idea of a Turnbull Prime Ministership. The sentiment was that this realisation by the party as a whole might take a few months, perhaps even until the end of the year, but that change was coming and was necessary. Either a change of style by Abbott - which looked ever more unlikely - or a change of leader.\nIn the end, the constant leadership speculation - fanned but not driven by the media -greatly accelerated that timetable.\nTurnbull's argument that electoral time is fast running away from the party was a powerful one but it won't convince all of his critics.\nIt means he will now wear the impact of any less than favourable result in Canning. But it also means he will have an immediate test of his basic proposition that he can expand the percentage of voters willing to support the Coalition.\nThere's no doubt that this is the outcome most feared by Labor despite the immediate willingness to berate the Coalition for the disunity and lack of loyalty. Labor MPs understand that Abbott's unpopularity has made their role so much easier and that a change to Turnbull will drastically alter that appealing equation.\nTurnbull is telling his colleagues that he will return to the successful Cabinet government style of John Howard. His colleagues will be sceptical. But they seemed willing to take the bet that this gamble will work well enough to persuade the public to start listening to them again. And that is the start of the Turnbull version of fightback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:11:18.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
