Photo: Adam McLean\nIf your kids are pestering for more pocket money these school holidays, they might just have a case after Solomon Lew's Premier Investments warned prices were on the rise, even at its colourful stationery chain Smiggle.\nPremier has already shifted manufacturing for some of its products and used hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of the weakening Aussie dollar, chief executive Mark McInnes. Now the group moves to higher prices to bolster its profits.\nYet Mr McInnes said that while Premier would follow its rivals and increase prices, it would tread carefully to not deter customers.\nMark McInnes and Solomon Lew.

Premier plans to grow its online business to represent 10 per sent of sales by 2020.\nThe strong full-year result was powered by Premier's international expansion of the Smiggle brand, along with the opening of 14 new Peter Alexander stores.\nUK expansion By Christmas, Smiggle will have 16 new stores trading in the UK, with plans to launch in Scotland and Wales next year.\nThere are eight more Peter Alexander store openings planned for the first half of 2016 as the company is targeting up to 15 new stores in Australia and New Zealand in the next two years.\nThe two popular brands offset a weaker performance by the company's fashion labels Jay Jays, Just Jeans and Jacqui E, however Premier said all its brands reported growth over the past financial year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:27:39.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
