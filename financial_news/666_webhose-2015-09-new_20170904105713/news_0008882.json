Although one should never make real estate investment decisions solely on tax considerations, getting an understanding on the different elements of your personal tax situation can be extremely helpful.\n“First you have to do your due diligence,” comments Vaknin. “Determine if your investment makes sense based on cash flows, cash on cash returns, renovation costs, rental income, financing, and the risk of any particular property – It is only appropriate to look at tax considerations once these issues are addressed.”\nAbout HomeEscape: HomeEscape connects homeowners and property managers with travelers who seek the space, value and amenities of vacation rental homes as an alternative to hotels.
