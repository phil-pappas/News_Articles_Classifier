Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Scott Morrison and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's fractured relationship shows no signs of healing after the Treasurer revealed they still had not spoken since the leadership spill.\nMr Abbott is also set to speak out again on Ray Hadley's 2GB radio show on Tuesday, after he gave legacy-building interviews over the weekend, saying \"nothing had changed\" in the new Turnbull government and singling out economic policy as an example.\nThe fight began when Mr Morrison claimed Mr Abbott had offered him the job of deputy and therefore Treasurer on the night of the spill throwing Joe Hockey 'under a bus', a claim Mr Abbott has denied.\nMr Morrison said he was giving Mr Abbott \"his space\".\n\"These things are really emotional events and I'm sure once the dust settles we'll be able to have that opportunity [to talk]\" Mr Morrison said.\nMr Morrison agreed that Mr Abbott was a \"really good bloke\".\nA 2GB producer then said Mr Morrison \"told Neil he hasn't spoken to Joe Hockey either since getting his job. [A] few texts exchanged.\"\nIn a fiery interview with Hadley earlier in September, Mr Morrison was asked to swear on a bible about his role in dumping Mr Abbott, and responded by refusing and effectively breaking up their on-air relationship.\n On Monday the temperature had lowered, with Hadley promising there was no bible in sight and asked if he could restart their regular chats.\n\"The recently appointed Treasurer I like him, I respect him but that does not mean I won't hold him to account if I think there are questions to be answered,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-28T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:56:42.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
