It said a third bid remains on the table.\nNovo Banco received 4.9 billion euros ($5.5 billion) from a so-called bank resolution fund, a mechanism adopted during the eurozone debt crisis to support the financial sector.\nThe Portuguese Treasury provided 3.9 billion euros of that, with other Portuguese banks providing the rest, and those lenders want to recoup their money.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:58:41.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
