If you’ve been paying attention to the digital video space, you know that videogame tournaments as a spectator sport are massively popular. Amazon plunked down close to $1 billion last year to acquire the videogame-viewing platform Twitch, and Google’s YouTube just launched a competing outlet. Now, Turner Broadcasting is launching a new videogaming league in conjunction with the talent agency behemoth WME/IMG, and the competitions will become the centerpiece of a new Friday night telecast on TBS, reports The Wall Street Journal. “This is going to be the Super Bowl of eSports,” said Turner Sports President Lenny Daniels. That’s a pretty bold statement, considering the guys that generally like eSports are exactly not the kind of guys that do appointment TV (though it’s a good bet lots of them don’t have regular Friday night plans).\nTV’S SLOW START : After the summer the TV business had with cord-cutting fears and plummeting stocks, TV executives were surely anxious for the fall season to kick off. Favorite shows return to revive the ratings numbers, and ideally a few hits emerge. Well, the jury is still out on the hits. In fact, several new shows already seem in trouble. But even more alarming, fewer people are showing up to watch TV than a year ago. For the first two nights of this week, the number of 18- to 49-year-olds watching any TV was down 10% versus the same nights in 2014, reports Ad Age. That’s not a rejection of any particular show but the medium itself. Better hope Fox’s surprise smash from last year -- “Empire” -- delivered a big number during last night’s premiere. Once again, the industry is waiting for Cookie to save the day.\nVOLKS-BRAGGIN’ : Can you brag about being good at something that you kind of cheated on? That’s one question you might ask of Volkswagen , VLKAY 6.53 % which has been getting hammered lately for admitting that software in as many as 11 million of its cars was used to manipulate U.S. admissions tests. (The heat got so bad for the brand that its CEO resigned.) It’s one thing to get caught goosing your efficiency numbers. It’s another thing to have been simultaneously touting efficiency in your advertising, which Volkswagen has done for years , reports CMO Today. In fact, of its 36 different spots that aired this year, 14 are focused on the company’s “clean diesel” message. One spot ran over 3,400 times. It’s probably safe to assume that a more humble approach will find its way into Volkswagen’s next creative brief.\nAOL’S VIDEO PIVOT : Roughly a year ago, AOL hired a top digital media executive from MTV to oversee its budding Web video business, which included everything from original series starring celebrities to video advertising technology and distribution. At that time, AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong boasted about already being a top three company in Web video, which would surely improve by landing Dermot McCormack, whom Mr. Armstrong called a “game changing talent.” Well, the game quickly changed over at AOL, which was of course acquired by Verizon Communications a few months ago. And now, Mr. McCormack is set to leave the company , reports CMO Today. Mr. Armstrong noted that Mr. McCormack’s role had been reduced by the fact that AOL’s video ad tech was now being housed in another division, and individual AOL brands were now producing more of their own video content. But here’s betting that Verizon is far more focused on Go90, its just-launched mobile streaming service--and much less focused on AOL’s own originals push.\nElsewhere Amy Poehler’s production company has signed a pair of pilot deals with ABC and NBC [ Deadline ]\nAmazon has announced five new pilot projects, including a series created by Sasha Baron Cohen [ Reuters ]\nFacebook FB 1.09 % has introduced “spherical video” content, which lets people change their vantage point within clips like the recent “Star Wars” trailer [ WSJ ]\nThe fantasy sports company DraftKings has expanded its offerings to let consumers bet on the performance of professional video game players [ WSJ ]\nBrian Williams’ return to TV gave MSNBC a ratings boost on Tuesday afternoon, with a big assist from Pope Francis [ Los Angeles Times ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://deadline.com/2015/09/amy-poehler-comedies-abc-nbc-put-pilot-1201544701/", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "http://adage.com/article/media/premiere/300509/", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/23/us-amazon-com-television-idUSKCN0RN1PB20150923", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-brian-williams-ratings-msnbc-20150923-story.html", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-09-24T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:01:29.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
