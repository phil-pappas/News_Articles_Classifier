PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 GETTY Dorset-based Meggitt has a market value of £3.8billion \nDorset-based Meggitt has a market value of £3.8billion and manufactures high-performance components in civil aerospace, military and energy – ranging from brake control systems for business jets and military aircraft to combat support, such as ammunition handling. The company’s largest customer is the US Department of Defense, with other clients including the likes of Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky. A total of 49 per cent of revenue comes from the US, with the balance coming from the UK (10 per cent), rest of Europe (22 per cent) and the rest of world (19 per cent). By market, revenues are split between civil aerospace (48 per cent), military (34 per cent) and energy and other (18 per cent). Meggitt’s half-year results early last month showed pre-tax profits had risen by 18 per cent, with full-year guidance unchanged.

These included a £25.9million ($40million) three-year contract for the US Department of Defense and a £10million deal with the UK Ministry of Defence. We last looked at Meggitt in August 2013, since when the price has fallen just under 9 per cent. At that time it was £5.37, peaking at £5.88 in the early part of that year. Unfortunately, its full-year results showed lower military revenues, currency headwinds and income loss, all of which added to valuation concerns that the share price might have risen too far too quickly. But, over the past year, Meggitt has outperformed the wider FTSE100 with shares up 4 per cent, as compared to a 10 per cent fall for the index. One of the risks to the sector is any decrease in military spending, and the civil aerospace industry has historically been volatile. Nonetheless, Meggitt’s specialisation in high technology areas and a substantial research and development budget could both bode well for the future. As such, the market consensus has recently warmed to a cautious buy.
