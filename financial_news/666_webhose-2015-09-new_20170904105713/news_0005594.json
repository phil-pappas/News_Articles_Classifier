The average whistleblower is an engaged well-performing employee, not a disgruntled ex-employee with an axe to grind, as often portrayed. The Network says 92% of those employees report internally first, not to a government agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission, because the report says they are motivated by the fact it is “a big enough crime,” not the potential to receive a substantial monetary award.\nThe SEC has recently released interpretive guidance to clarify its position that an individual doesn’t need to report possible violations of the securities laws to the SEC to be characterized as a “whistleblower” and entitled to Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation protections . However, the courts are still confusing on the issue. The Second Circuit – in a split decision – agreed with the SEC in Berman v. Neo@Ogilvy LLC that a Dodd-Frank whistleblower did not have to make a report directly to the SEC to bring a Dodd-Frank retaliation claim. However, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in Jennifer Davies v. Broadcom , dismissed a whistleblower retaliation claim, ruling that Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation provision only protects whistleblowers who provide information to the SEC.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced it will make significant changes in how it uses its internal administrative courts, The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday . The moves are in response to unrelenting legal challenges to the process, many of them successful, and constant criticism of the alleged unfairness and inherent bias of the process. The new approach responds to many of the criticisms of defendants, their lawyers and other legal experts, including a report by The Wall Street Journal that cited data saying the judges almost always decided against defendants in favor of the SEC and were perhaps pressured to do so. The reforms include giving defendants legal protections that are offered in federal court.\nThey revise what have been characterized by critics as extremely tight deadlines imposed on complicated cases. Defendants will now up to eight months to prepare for trial, compared with the current four months. Defendants will also not be able to take sworn depositions from witnesses or others before trial, something that is customary in federal court.\nThe action comes a week after the most recent setback for the SEC in a high profile administrative court case. A federal appeals court temporarily blocked the SEC fraud case against New York hedge fund manager Lynn Tilton, Reuters reported last Thursday . The constitutionality of the SEC’s appointment of in-house judges is also still at issue in cases in the 2nd and 11th U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal, says Alison Frankel after the commission asked for review of three federal district court decisions that held the SEC’s administrative law judge hiring process likely violates the Appointments Clause.\nA recent decision by an SEC administrative judge in favor of the defendant, however, may dilute at least one argument made by defendants that the SEC’s internal court is tilted in favor of the regulator. The New York Times reported that Jason S. Patil, an SEC administrative law judge, decided the Bolan insider trading case for a defendant, disagreeing with the SEC’s legal theory in the case.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/2015/09/whistleblowers-2nd-circuit-defers-to-sec-in-dodd-frank-retaliation-case-scotus-next.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/business/dealbook/sec-judge-may-have-weakened-justice-dept-stance-in-insider-trading-case.html", "https://www.tnwinc.com/downloads/whitepaper-2015-embracing-whistleblowers.pdf", "http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2015/34-75592.pdf", "http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2015/09/08/in-hurry-up-ruling-sec-declares-in-house-judges-are-constitutional/", "http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-209.html", "http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/2015/09/profiling-the-average-whistleblower.html", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/05/sec-judges-idUSL1N10G2II20150805", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-gives-ground-on-judges-1443139425", "http://www.whistleblower-defense.com/2015/09/24/california-district-court-follows-asadi-dismisses-dodd-frank-whistleblower-claim/", "https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/reg-21f.pdf", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/17/sec-tilton-idUSL1N11N2HG20150917"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:32:14.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
