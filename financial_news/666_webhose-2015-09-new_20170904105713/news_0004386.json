The queen doesn’t feel this is the time for the nation to celebrate, given her accession to the throne aged 25 following her father’s death, a devastating moment for her, according to a person familiar with the matter. A festive commemoration could also be considered insensitive given that Queen Victoria’s reign ended with her death in 1901.\nQueen to become the longest-reigning Monarch (2:14) Queen Elizabeth II becomes Britain's longest-reigning monarch on Wednesday.

The 89-year-old monarch and her husband, Prince Philip, will travel from their summer residence at Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh, where they will open the longest new rail line built in the U.K. in more than a century. The royal couple will then take a steam train along the railway to the Scottish village of Tweedbank. After later returning to the castle, she is expected to have dinner with members of her family, including her grandson Prince William and his wife, the duchess of Cambridge, a person familiar with the matter said.\n“Next year, when she turns 90, is a more obvious moment for a full and national celebration,” the person said, referring to a planned birthday parade in June.\nQueen Elizabeth, who was born in 1926, was crowned following the death of her father King George VI in 1952, after he failed to recover from a lung operation. Her reign has spanned 12 British prime ministers and dramatic changes in society — including the arrival of television and 24-hour news, which have placed the royal family under greater media scrutiny.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/queen-elizabeth-ii-set-to-become-the-u-k-s-longest-serving-monarch-1441720962"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:05:08.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
