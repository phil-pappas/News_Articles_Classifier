The currency has appreciated in value against other currencies because it has been pegged to a US dollar which has strengthened significantly in the last few years. Garrett Knight Associates says the devaluation is being touted as being consistent with a desire to allow the yuan to float more freely in the global currency markets even though the competitive advantage it affords will not be entirely unwelcome.\"China's exports fell 8.3% year on year last month - a weaker currency will help but will also export deflation or falling prices around the world and that could prompt policymakers in the US to take steps to counter the effect. As interest rates are already at zero, the weapon of choice is likely to be more quantitative easing and investors need to be prepared for that,\" concluded Mannion.
