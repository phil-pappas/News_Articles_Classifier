This capital will be invested in low-tech equipment operating leases with high quality corporate credits and Fortune 1000 companies in 2015-2016. “This increased equity capital will allow us to double our funding of true leases to our customers over the next 18 months,” said Dean Cash, Chairman and CEO of ATEL Capital Group. “As the economy has gone through economic ups and downs over the last 40 years, ATEL has been and remains a consistent funding source for American industry during all business cycles.” In advance of this new capital, ATEL Leasing Corporation expanded its lease origination and syndication teams with experienced, high-level producers in Q1 and Q2 of this year. “Our momentum with direct customer relationships and through capital markets perfectly aligns with the growth of our institutional investor programs allowing us to increase the size of our equipment lease portfolio,” said Ken Fosina, EVP ATEL Leasing Corporation.
