Subject to securing necessary clearances/approvals for the additional 91MW capacity at Karcham Wangtoo, JSW will have to pay another Rs 300 crore.\nHowever, JSW will receive Rs 280 crore (Edel estimate) towards FY16E earnings.

JSW will pay Rs 9,275 crore (Rs 300 crore was paid last year) to acquire the Baspa and Karcham Wangtoo projects from JPVL.

While Baspa is a regulated project, Karcham Wangtoo has 70% PPA wherein final tariff is being determined by CERC.\nBased on original project equity of Rs 2,600 crore, we estimate the deal was concluded at 1.8x P/BV. Considering combined profitability of Rs 550-600 crore (RoE: 20-22%), the premium is justified The company has also entered into a MoU with JPVL to pursue acquisition of the 500MW Bina project.
