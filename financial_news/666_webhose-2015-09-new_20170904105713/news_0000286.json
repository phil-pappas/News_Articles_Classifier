Pininfarina’s controlling shareholder Pincar, which has a 76 percent stake in the group, said in a statement talks with the Indian group on the sale of its holding were underway and any developments would be communicated to the market in due course.\nTurin-based Pininfarina’s market capitalisation at Monday’s close was 123.6 million euros ($138 million).\nThe company has been loss-making for years and its net debt stood at 52.7 million euros at end-June. It has been struggling to stay in business as carmakers have moved to hire more in-house stylists at the expense of independent design firms.\nFirst Published on September 08, 2015 10:41 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:56:27.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
