The plan will have to be changed,\" one of the sources said. \nHailed as a return to reality after years of missed output goals, record spending and a giant corruption scandal that led to $17 billion of writedowns, the plan unveiled in June cut the 2015-2019 spending goal to $130 billion from $221 billion. \nBoth sources are directly involved in Petrobras' planning efforts and asked for anonymity because company plans are still under discussion. Both also said a planned sale in 2015 of up to 25 percent of fuel-distribution arm Petrobras Distribuidora SA is now almost impossible. \nChief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine said in June that Petrobras would likely start reviewing its strategic plans on a quarterly basis. \nThe June plan is based on Brent crude oil (LCOc1) averaging $60 a barrel in 2015 and $70 a barrel from 2016 to 2019. So far this year Brent has averaged $57 and Brent futures are trading below $60 a barrel through November 2017 (LCOx7), a sign few investors and traders expect an increase soon. The highest current futures price is $65.10 for December 2022 settlement (LCOZ2). \nPetrobras' plan also assumed Brazil's real currency would average 3.10 to the dollar in 2015 and 3.26 in 2016. But it has already weakened 19 percent since then to 3.85, driving up the local currency cost of paying the company's debts, most of which are in dollars. \nThe S&P move is also Petrobras' second downgrade to junk this year after Moody's Investors Service stripped the company in February. \nMany foreign pension funds and other large investors are required to unload bonds once two separate agencies rate them as speculative grade. That could lead to a plunge in the price of existing Petrobras debt and limit the pool of buyers for new offerings. \nThe second source said that a revision of the plan's premises and spending will be needed. \n\"These are times that will try our hearts,\" the source said. \n(Reporting by Jeb Blount and Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Editing by Christian Plumb)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:01:08.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
