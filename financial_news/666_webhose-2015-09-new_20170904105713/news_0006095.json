Written by: Gina Ragusa 09/14/15 - 2:50 PM EDT \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- What happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas. That's especially true for photos posted on social media that can come back to take a bite out of more than your dignity, says Christine Kelley Storch, president of Dashing Social Media in Winston-Salem, NC. \nStorch says that employers and colleges scan social media to help with decision-making so why wouldn’t a lender consider what a client posts before reaching a credit decision? \n“I’ve been privy to a number of posts gone wrong, where someone has a few glasses of wine or makes negative remarks on social media that start a fire that they can’t extinguish,” Storch says. “You always have to remember that once its out there, you can remove it, but the post or photo remains forever. So be mindful when you post and photograph.” More Headlines Retirement Obstacles: Why So Many Small Business Owners Are Poor Stewards Of Their Futures \nStorch says the bold new world of online interaction can impact how nearly anyone views an individual’s life and lifestyle. “Lenders may not make social media part of their practice, but you just never know who is looking at your profile or posts,” she says. In a world where alternatives to the FICO score are appearing to judge credit -- even SAT scores are being used -- companies like Vouch, Lenddo , Flurish Inc. (also known as LendUp) and Movencorp Inc. (aka Moven) are among the innovative companies tapping into consumers' social profiles to analyze their creditworthiness. Traditional Lenders Don’t Use Social Media…Yet \nStill, most traditional bank and credit union lenders say they don't use social media as a guide for credit decisions, but that doesn’t mean that borrowers are completely off the hook. \n“We usually never check a member's social media page, so I would say it would not affect the loan decision,” said Harry Stewart, vice president of residential and commercial lending at NuMark Credit Union in Crest Hill, Ill. “However, if we did happen to check a social media post that had them taking selfies at the unemployment office, we would probably re-verify the member's employment status again.” \nStewart emphasizes that posting information that doesn't wash with what's attested to in the loan application could possibly become an issue. \n“A social media post containing contradictory information regarding employment, income, credit, collateral, et cetera would send up red flags on any member who has filed an application,” he says. “Again, to be honest I never go to any member's pages, but if I did I guess some of their posts might prompt additional questions.” \nAmy McGraw, vice president of marketing at Tropical Financial Credit Union in Miramar, Fla. said that her credit union has never used social media for loan decisions and never heard of anyone using it to influence the process. “To be honest, [using social media] is nowhere on our radar and actually scary to think that a lender would turn to social media for loan decisioning.” \nSocial media users may forget that anything they post in a public forum is still fair game, Storch adds. “Even though a traditional lender does not make checking the applicant’s social media status as part of protocol, still doesn’t mean that the applicant’s posts will have zero impact on whether they get further ahead in life.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:21:50.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
