The most painful sight for investors is the stock.\nShares of the nation's biggest retailer are down 19.1% this year — including a 3.4% drop to $69.48 Tuesday after the company reported a disappointing adjusted profit a share of $1.08. That missed expectations by 3.6%.\nBut missing earnings forecasts for the second quarter in a row isn't the true problem facing the retailer — at least not in the eyes of investors. Instead, there are two troubling financial developments at the company that investors are keying on:\n* Declining return on equity. Investors looking for a scorecard on management fixate on return on equity. The measure shows how much profit the company is driving from the money plowed into the business by stock owners. This measure of Walmart's performance has been steadily dropping the past three years, falling from 23% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2013, to 19.8% in the past 12 months, says S&P Capital IQ. It's another way to see how the company's isn't driving the profit out of the business that investors had come to expect in years past.\nWalmart's falling return on equity   (Photo: S&P Capital IQ via Microsoft Excel) \n* Anemic revenue growth. If there's a source of many Walmart's woes, it start at the top line. Revenue inched up just 1.1% during the past 12 months — the lowest revenue growth at Walmart since the 12 months ended January 2010. And revenue growth has been steadily falling, dropping from 5.8% in fiscal 2012.\nFalling revenue growth creates problems, even as Walmart is actually holding the line on its core profitability. Walmart kept 24.9 cents on every dollar of revenue after paying direct costs including merchandise over the past 12 months. That's practically identical to the 25.3 cents on every dollar the company kept in the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2011, says S&P Capital IQ.\nOverhead isn't the problem, either. Walmart kept 3.3 cents of every dollar of revenue after paying continuing operations. That's about the same as in 2011, when Walmart kept 3.8 of every dollar from continuing operations.\nWalmart revenue growth   (Photo: S&P Capital IQ via Microsoft Excel) \nIf there's good news, it's that these negatives are well known and baked into the stock price. Research firm New Constructs , which evaluates stocks based on their price compared with the present value of expected cash flow, rates the stock \"attractive.\"\nBut many investors aren't convinced, yet. Analysts rate the stock a \"hold\" on average. Analysts do have an 18-month price target of $78.65 a share, though, which would be 13% upside if correct.\nBut for now, investors are suffering — and they know exactly why.\nWalmart's falling stock price   (Photo: USATODAY.com) \n58 CONNECT 17 TWEET 42 LINKEDIN 37 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LjbTuL TOP VIDEOS Volkswagen Admits Cheating U.S. Diesel Emissions Tests 03:19 Are Streaming Companies a Threat to Cable? 04:26 Volkswagen shares plunge on recall, Apple app store suffers hack attack 01:43 Is Apple ad-blocking the end of mobile monetization? 03:50 Apple Wins Ruling in Bid to Block Samsung 01:59 The Icon A5 Is a Folding Personal Plane Designed for Fun 02:53 Beerlovers Want Big Beers, Not Bigger Beer Makers 02:47 Review: Porsche 911 Targa, a near-perfect revival 02:25 It's decision Day.
