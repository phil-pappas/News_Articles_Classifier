It’s about young professionals who need a decent home but can’t afford the market rents which have rocketed in London,” the spokesman added.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An interior of a flat in Mill Point, where the rent is £940 a month. Photograph: Barking and Dagenham Reside\nAlready 1,000 members of the public have registered interest in the 144 homes, said Hakeem Osinaike, divisional director of housing management at the council.\nBarking and Dagenham council leaders are hoping other councils will follow suit.\nIn the past councils have tried to surmount the housing shortage by paying private landlords to take council tenants, but this is the first time a council has effectively become a private landlord itself.\nThe acquisition of the Abbey Road apartment block cost the council £45m which was funded through a £130m credit facility it secured from the European Investment Bank at below-market interest rates.\nIt has also set up an independent company, Barking and Dagenham Reside , which will market and manage the block on the council’s behalf.\nIt’s a win-win for our council, taxpayers, residents and Generation Rent\nSaima Ashraf, councillor\nThe homes are being let out at 80% of market rent, but will still produce a surplus for the council. Two bedroom flats will be available for £940, almost half of what it would cost in neighbouring boroughs such as Hackney where the median rent for a two-bedder is £1,700 .\nJeremy Grind, divisional director of regeneration for Barking and Dagenham council,told the Guardian:\n“This isn’t just about housing key workers such as teachers and nurses, it’s about housing the baristas, waiters and waitresses – people who can’t afford to get on the the housing ladder or get access to a council home,” he said.\nThe scheme will produce a profit for the council which will be ploughed back into more housing.\nCouncillor Saima Ashraf said: “It’s a win-win for our council, taxpayers, residents and Generation Rent.”\nThe council aims to get 1,000 flats in its private rental scheme over the the next three years.\n“We came up with the idea for Barking and Dagenham Reside because we needed to think of a creative way to build new housing in the middle of an economic downturn,” councillor Cameron Geddes said.\nAndrew Boff, the Conservative housing spokesman on the Greater London Assembly, told the Guardian he thought the scheme was one of the most innovative in the country, from a council financing and housing point of view.\nHe described the council’s development as “fantastic” and said it could be part of a solution to the drastic housing shortage in Britain.", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c/0_173_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0c4e6713361466a6f400acf3b1743990", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ccjc%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ccjc&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fd72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c%2F0_173_3969_2382%2F3969.jpg", "http://www.bdreside.co.uk/about-reside/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c/0_173_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a6921ebc9e5c45f44a739e43a9675614", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c/0_173_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ab6dc881f38fddbf941edb415d50285a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c/0_173_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=42194e29014a06125a91a5b54b63f40b", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=London+council+sets+up+as+private+landlord&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fsep%2F16%2Flondon-council-sets-up-as-private-landlord&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fd72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c%2F0_173_3969_2382%2F3969.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72b600aba25925fbfcda711dd8b11656864235c/0_173_3969_2382/master/3969.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=6002a7eade71d3d9de061044c2fc2de1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=London+council+sets+up+as+private+landlord&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ccjc%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.affordablelettings.london/content/Information/EligibilityCriteria"], "published": "2015-09-16T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:16:59.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
