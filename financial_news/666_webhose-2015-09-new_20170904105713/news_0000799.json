Rob Homer Share on twitter by David Ramli TPG Telecom has quietly resumed sales of its loss-making Fetch TV subscription television service for iiNet customers while hunting for alternative media partners.\nFetch is a pay TV rival to Foxtel that comes with a set top box and is largely sold through iiNet, Optus and M2 Group's Dodo.\nTPG executive chair David Teoh has never been a fan of the service despite holding talks with Fetch several years ago and iiNet was ordered to cease selling it within two days of being acquired by TPG for $1.56 billion.\nBut finding a content partner is potentially vital for TPG as access to premium TV services like Netflix become more and more important for internet customers.\nFetch is a pay TV rival to Foxtel that comes with a set top box and is largely sold through iiNet, Optus and M2 Group's Dodo. Supplied While iiNet continues to restrict online sales of the service, TPG has allowed it to resume selling Fetch through its call centre staff. The prices for would-be customers have not changed.\nMr Teoh said he was reviewing alternative arrangements. TPG is now Australia's second-biggest broadband provider and could use its market power to become a key player in the media market.\n\"The Fetch contract finishes at the end of this year so we'll review that at that time,\" he said. \"But at the moment this deal doesn't make sense, we're losing money [so] unless there's a better offer on the table we will not look at it.\"\nTPG may not completely abandon Fetch TV, and could negotiate a new deal with the company.\n As first reported by Fairfax Media, TPG signed a deal with Foxtel to sell a white-labelled version of the Pay TV giant's basic service to its customers and was expected to roll it out this year .\nTV not a priority But Mr Teoh said the rapidly changing market had given TPG reason to pause and that signing a media contract was not his top priority.\n\"We entered into the agreement with Foxtel quite a while ago,\" he said. \"[But] when you look at the market in the last few months the market has changed with Netflix coming in so aggressively at $10 and there are so many other content providers.\n\"So we're not rushing into it and with iiNet coming in there's a lot to do.\"\nAll of Australia's phone and internet providers are racing to sign up media partners in an effort to make customers more loyal to their services. This will become increasingly important once the national broadband network becomes the main wholesale provider for most Australian homes and businesses in 2020.\nOptus used a partnership with Fetch and US streaming video-on-demand giant Netflix to help turnaround its shrinking broadband subscriber base and win new mobile customers.\nTelstra is set to launch its new TV service in October and has partnered with Foxtel's streaming video service Presto while Vodafone Hutchison Australia is providing free passes for Stan , Spotify or Fairfax Media subscriptions to new mobile customers.", "external_links": ["http://www.fetchtv.com.au/", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/gadgets-on-the-go/tpg-forces-iinet-to-dump-fetch-tv-20150826-gj7yet.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-launches-roku-to-take-on-apple-and-google-20150727-giltvh.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/vodafone-offers-three-months-of-stan-to-red-plan-holders-20150409-1mhow9.html"], "published": "2015-09-23T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:10:20.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
