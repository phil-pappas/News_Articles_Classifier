(The report Overdraft U, was released in March.) \n\"Remember, your college has not necessarily reviewed all of the accounts available and decided this is the best account for their students,\" noted Maura Dundon, CRL's senior counsel. \"In fact, they're getting money to help the bank market this to you.\" \nMore from NBC News: Some see wine as investment option \nThat marketing typically includes co-branded mailings and ads on the school website. The school logo may even appear on the debit card. At some schools, that checking account is linked to the student ID card - offering the utmost in convenience. \n\"This co-branded marketing could leave the student believing this is a superior deal to what they could find on their own and that's not necessarily the case,\" the CFPB's Williams told NBC News. \"That's why it's so important for students to shop around and look at the terms and conditions before they choose a college account.\" \nIn a recent blog, the CFPB reminded students that \"just because an offer looks like official mail from your college, you don't have to accept it.\" The bureau also has a checklist for opening a bank or credit union account on its website. \nThe banking industry says these marketing agreements benefit both the students and the educational institutions they attend. The American Bankers Association (ABA) states that students often do better with campus bank accounts because bankers often offer them at a loss in order to build a financial relationship. 6 ways an interest rate hike will affect your money Kevin Lamarque | Reuters \n\"The only difference between a campus account and a non-campus account is that the monthly fees are lower and they may pay less at an ATM,\" said Nessa Feddis, the ABA's senior counsel. \nThe U.S. Department of Education sees it differently. It found \"excessive fees\" and \"troubling practices\" on the nation's college campuses. In March, the department released proposed rules to regulate on-campus debit cards. Final rules should be announced this fall. \nTo get the best deal you need to shop around \nShopping for a checking account is like any other purchase. You need to see what's available and which financial institution offers the best deal for your needs. \n\"Look everywhere, credit unions, community banks and online banks,\" advised Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with Bankrate.com. \"And don't feel locked into an account with the name 'student' on it.\" \nWhen you compare checking accounts, look at the terms and conditions. Pay close attention to the fees: Is there a monthly fee if you don't maintain a minimum balance? What are the ATM fees? Is there a fee to use your debit card to make a purchase? How much are the overdraft fees? \n\"Don't be lured into accounts that are marketed as free or easy,\" cautioned the CFPB's Rich Williams. \"It's very rare to have an account with no fees.\" \nSuch an account could have high overdraft or ATM fees that can be much more expensive than paying a couple of bucks each month, for example. \nOverdraft fees can drain an account \nOverdraft fees are a big problem for students. Many don't realize they can be hit with a steep fee for making purchases that overdraw their checking account. \nRead More Consider this next time your kid asks for cash \n\"Students do more and smaller debit card transactions, so that means the debit card overdraft fees are more likely to rack up more quickly for them,\" said the Center for Responsible Lending's Maura Dundon. \"So there could be a $35 overdraft fee on that $2 cup of coffee. And they may have five or six of those small purchases a day.\" \nStudents need to understand how overdraft protection on a debit card works. They have to say \"no\" to this protection to avoid the fees - which is counterintuitive. \n\"Opt-in\" or agree to overdraft protection: You'll be charged an overdraft fee if a point-of-sale purchase or ATM cash withdrawal overdraws the account. \nTurn down this protection: Debit card purchases or cash withdrawals that would overdraw the account will be declined, but you won't be charged a fee. \nThe decision to opt-in or opt-out of overdraft protection can be changed at any time. The website NerdWallet has a list of checking accounts that have no or very low overdraft fees. \nIt's also a good idea to sign up for email or text alerts that flag when your balance gets below a certain level. And to avoid extra fees, cash withdrawals should only be done at ATMs that are part of the originating bank or credit union's network.
