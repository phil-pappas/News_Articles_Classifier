This was due to overall low inflation in the UK, which stood at 0pc in August , as well as competitive pricing from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. \nTesco’s sales fell 1pc in the three-month period, while Morrisons sank 1.4pc and Asda was down 2.9pc, according to Kantar Worldpanel. \nThe data indicate that Asda’s sales decline has sped up; in the last three-month period tracked by Kantar , its sales were down 2.5pc. \nHowever Asda’s share of the grocery market remained steady, at 16.7pc, keeping it comfortably in the second spot ahead of Sainsbury’s, which had a 16.2pc market share. \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) 's share also held firm, at 28.2pc, as did Morrisons’, at 10.2pc. \n“Sainsbury’s has grown sales by 0.9pc compared with a year ago, attracting 250,000 new shoppers through the doors in the last 12 weeks,” said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. \n“The retailer has been helped by the continued expansion of its Sainsbury’s Local outlets.” \nUpstart German discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to enjoy a boom, with sales up 5.6pc and 4.2pc respectively. The pair now hold a combined market share of 9.8pc. \nWaitrose held its share at 5.2pc, though its sales growth slowed on the last three-month period, falling to 2.9pc from 3.7pc. \nThere was also good news for frozen-food retailer Iceland, with sales up 2.9pc, and The Co-operative, where sales grew 1pc. \nOverall growth in the grocery market was static at 0.9pc. \n“With shoppers moving their custom away from the traditional, larger-size supermarket stores, online sales are continuing to boom and are up by 12pc compared with a year ago,” Mr McKevitt said. \n“Almost 7pc of grocery sales are currently purchased through the internet and existing online supermarkets will be watching closely to see when Amazon Fresh will launch in the UK and whether it will steal market share or grow the online market even further.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:30:14.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
