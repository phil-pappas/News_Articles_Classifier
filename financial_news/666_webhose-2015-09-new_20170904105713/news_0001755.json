If you can demonstrate that, when wrestling with the fiscal demons, you at all times put the nation's best interests first, there's a good chance they'll give you grudging respect despite some pain. Photo: Bloomberg\nDear Scott,\nCongratulations on the new job and the pay rise that comes with it. As Treasurer, you should be the second most important person in the government and will therefore earn it. And if it goes nicely, there is the chance of further promotion, isn't there? Not that you're thinking about that, much.\nYou have the chance to start with a huge advantage: you can act with integrity in seeking to balance competing interests instead of looking after the perceived Liberal Party backers and cheer squad first and the nation second.\nJust managing the job is a tough gig with a very steep learning curve and then herding cats as everyone wants to spend money and no one wants to raise it. And to go beyond mere management, into leadership with the possibility of genuine, broad tax reform, everything back on the table, well, that's another level of challenge again.\nBut it doesn't have to be nearly as hard as your predecessor made it. You might even enjoy it.\nAdvertisement For a start, you have an economically literate and engaged Prime Minister who is much less likely than what's-his-name to toss grenades in your path. The fact that Turnbull has put everything back on the table makes your life easier.\n2. You have much less baggage. All those silly slogans from the pre-government period and the narky and constraining Total Opposition positions. You have a relatively clean sheet.\n3. You come to the job with recently garnered, detailed knowledge of where a great deal of the money gets spent in the Social Security portfolio and a very useful relationship with the people who occupy that space. They're key players in winning acceptance of some of the more difficult bits of tax reform. Unlike your predecessor, you haven't called a significant proportion of Australia a bunch of leaners who don't drive cars.\n4. (Yes, the list thing is pervasive) a great deal of ground has been prepared for you. With nothing happening in the Abbott/Hockey space, civil society began to get on with it anyway. There is acceptance of the need for reform. Parties with very different immediate priorities can see there will indeed have to be compromise. They're talking and negotiating. They've been educating each other in the process.\n5. At least some of the states are getting it, too. That Jay Weatherill from South Australia is proving interesting. He has to be – South Australia's demographic future is promising to send the place broke if it doesn't lead the way in doing things differently, doing them better. He's an everything-on-the-table sort of guy out of necessity. And there's Mike Baird, the very model of a modern Liberal leader. (He led a government into an election and won.) They could be the nucleus of federation reform.\n(A little aside here: the \"competitive federalism\" explicit in the Commission of Audit, the IPA and assorted right-wing ideological warriors and implicit in Hockey's budgets – don't do it. It's just a theory. It turns into a race to the bottom.)\n6. Given all of the above and a lead in the polls, you have the chance to start with a huge advantage: you can act with integrity in seeking to balance competing interests instead of looking after the perceived Liberal Party backers and cheer squad first and the nation second.\nThat, ScoMo, really is the way to go. Most people are going to give you the benefit of the doubt to see what you're made of. If you can demonstrate that, when wrestling with the fiscal demons, you at all times put the nation's best interests first, there's a good chance they'll give you grudging respect despite some pain.\nAt the risk of boring you with my own personal little yardstick of fiscal integrity – yes, it's the FBT changes for motor vehicles , the novated lease thing. You can choose to continue to subsidise the tax minimisation industry's salary packaging division, or do the right thing by the rest of the nation and save several billion to spend on matters more deserving, or not spend at all.\nIt's only a start, of course, but it's a good measure of whether you will be prepared to ignore a lobby group that donated a quarter of a million dollars to the Liberal Party. No pressure.\nMany of the other very necessary changes will be much harder. Getting the right balance for bringing our direct taxes up to speed, for example, will be extremely tricky. (Go the GST broadening rather than increasing – most of us can work out 10 per cent.)\nAnd you have no shortage of advice coming at you from all angles, even from Fairfax hacks trying to be helpful. Sifting through it will be easier if you consistently adopt the idea behind the best recommendation in the Murray financial system review, Resolution 9 :\n\"Seek broad political agreement for and enshrine in legislation, the objectives of the superannuation system and report publicly on how policy proposals are consistent with achieving these objectives of the long term.\"\nReplace \"superannuation\" with whichever system is in play and go for it.\nGood luck,\nMichael", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:41:29.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
