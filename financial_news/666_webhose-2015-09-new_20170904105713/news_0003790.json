He will also provide insights into how Prime Minister Narendra Modi -led government is tackling these challenges.\nThe Finance Minister would be pitching for overseas investments in various sectors, including infrastructure.\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest growing markets globally, despite a turmoil in most of the international markets, while foreign investors have been one of the mainstays of the country’s capital market growth story.\nHe is also seeking investments from large overseas players, many of whom operate in Asia through Hong Kong and Singapore, for the capital-intensive infrastructure sectors.\nThe Asia Pacific Investors Cooperation (APIC) is a business platform created by and for Asian institutional investors including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, government funds, social security systems, and insurance companies. These institutions represent APIC’s private membership.\nAPIC covers 22 Asia Pacific markets and represents over USD 30 trillion worth of Assets Under Management.\nJaitley would also hold meetings with Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and Greater China Chamber of Commerce besides meetings with financial sector investors and fund managers. He would also be addressing an event organised by the Indian community here.\nTomorrow, Jaitley would be meeting the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, before leaving for India.\nDuring his visit to Singapore, Jaitley met Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and discussed matters relating to taxation for foreign investment and detailed steps being taken by India to attract investment.\nThe two leaders discussed bilateral and global developments as also the matters relating to taxation for foreign investment in India and the facilitating role to be played by the government in getting regulatory approvals.\nJaitley also had meetings with representatives of GIC, the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Singapore, Future Fund, Sovereign Wealth Fund of Australia and Canadian Pension Fund and invited them to participate in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) being set up by the Indian government to boost infrastructure investment.\nThe Finance Minister also met several other institutional investors and discussed about vast opportunities for investment in infrastructure sector in India.\n 20, 2015 1:13 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:57:03.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
