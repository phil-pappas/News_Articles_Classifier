Narendra Modi , Prime Minister of India, is in Ireland today accompanied by a high level delegation. He is the first Prime Minister to visit Ireland in 60 years. The Taoiseach of Ireland Enda Kenny, TD, will be hosting PM Narendra Modi for high level talks which are also being attended by foreign affairs minister Charlie Flanagan, education minister Jan O’ Sullivan, and health minister Leo Varadkar. Discussions will cover opportunities to strengthen trade and investment links, and cooperation in education. Also this high level meeting will focus on enhancing tourism links between India and Ireland.\nWelcoming the Indian Prime Minister to Ireland, Flanagan said, “It is a great honour to welcome PM Modi to Ireland. I am conscious that Ireland is only the third EU Member State that PM Modi has chosen to visit since his election and I believe that this is significant in the context of strengthening and the development of the relationship between our two countries. Our busy embassy in New Delhi, works alongside our state agencies, to provide support to Irish companies active in India and Irish based companies seeking export opportunities in the world’s ninth largest economy. India is predicted to be the world’s fastest growing majority economy in 2015, with a projected growth rate of 7.2 per cent. PM Modi’s high level visit to Ireland will provide a significant boost to our visibility in this high growth market.”\nThe focus of the talks will be on further strengthening the economic, trade and investment relationship between the two countries as well as building on recent progress in increasing education and tourism links. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister will later this week, along with other world leaders, attend the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York and this will also be an item for discussion.\nDuring this visit, PM Modi will also meet representatives of the sizeable Indian community in Ireland at a special event organised by the Indian Embassy in Dublin.\n 23, 2015 7:13 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:14:47.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
