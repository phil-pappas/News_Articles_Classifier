John Veage by Joanna Mather The giant Department of Social Services could bankroll \"social impact bonds\", which provide a financial return for saving the government money by helping people.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison signalled a desire to experiment with a social impact investing portfolio after witnessing pioneering work by Mike Baird's government in NSW.\nMr Morrison said some programs within the $150 billion social services budget could be funded using the social impact bonds.\nSocial impact (benefit) bonds use private capital to invest in social programs. Investors share in the savings to the government, achieved by keeping people out of jail or foster care, for example.\n\"Social impact bonds can deliver better services and results, better partnerships between the government and non-government sectors, and better value for taxpayers,\" Mr Morrison told a gathering of philanthropists in Canberra on Wednesday.\nNSW Premier Mike Baird in 2013 introduced a $7 million social impact bond trial aimed at returning children under six in foster care, to their birth families.\nReturn applauded It has produced a return of 8.9 per cent â€“ a rate applauded in the current low-return environment but below the 10 per cent to 12 per cent anticipated.\n \"They are being used widely overseas, and just last week Common Ground in South Australia ... launched the first homelessness specific [social impact bond] venture in Australia and only the fourth of its type in the world,\" Mr Morrison said.\nImpact investing is a broad term used to describe investing in something for both a social and financial return.\nImpact bonds are a sub-set of impact investing and effectively allow governments to outsource the risk associated with novel programs for tackling social disadvantage. Health and community services superannuation fund HESTA is another early adopter.\nThe fund has committed $30 million to a Social Impact Investment Trust managed by Social Ventures Australia.\nIt is the largest single commitment to the local impact investing market to date and the trust will invest in social impact bonds, and other ventures such as affordable housing.\nSocial Ventures Australia is in talks with other industry and corporate superannuation funds and aims to eventually have $100 million in funds under management. Ian Learmonth is a former Macquarie executive director who runs SVA's impact investing team.\n\"The commitment by HESTA is another step in the development of this growing market and indicates that institutional investors are now clearly looking for both attractive financial returns and demonstrable social outcomes,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:19:45.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
