Are they a smart investment now?\nGrant Carlson, San Francisco\nStep-up municipal bonds are long-term bonds with initial coupons that rise over time, at set periods, as long as the bonds aren’t called, or redeemed, by an issuer.\nBecause the bonds may be redeemed, they often trade at a higher yield than comparable bonds without a call provision. If interest rates rise and the bonds aren’t called—perhaps because the issuer deems it costly to refinance their debt—the yield of the bond increases, or steps up, giving the holders a bonus.\nStep-up muni bonds can be popular when investors anticipate rising interest rates—as they do today—because they can provide a higher yield in such an environment. They’re also in demand lately because most high-grade municipal bonds sport meager yields. Even if the issuer pays the debt back early, an investor will have enjoyed higher payments with these bonds than with standard muni bonds.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Wealth Management Money and College: The Crucial Questions for Parents and Children More U.S. Students Look to College Abroad Why Peer Pressure May Not Help You Save More for Retirement When Millennials Move Back Home Mistakes Charitable Startups Make “Step-up bonds make sense if an investor has a view that rates will rise over time and wants the future coupon to rise with the higher expected market rates,” says Michael Degernes, head of municipals at Aberdeen Asset Management . ADN -0.88 % Mr. Degernes says prices of these bonds usually are less volatile than other munis as rates rise.\nFor those interested, Chris Brigati, managing director and head of municipal trading at Advisors Asset Management, recommends buying step-up munis when they are first issued and can have a “lower price point” than other high-coupon muni bonds.\nBut if interest rates stay low or drop and the bonds are called, investors must reinvest the proceeds in a low-rate environment. These bonds aren’t “for everyone,” says Jim Colby, senior municipal strategist at Van Eck Global. “You can find yourself losing bonds you deem attractive.”\nAdam Buchanan, senior vice president at investment banking firm B.C. Ziegler & Co., notes that some issuers have “checkered histories or are speculative startup projects” and were forced to issue these bonds because it was their only means of raising capital in the muni market. It is important to do extensive research on these issuers, he says.\nStep-up munis usually are callable on the date the coupon steps up, Mr. Buchanan says, pointing out the risk that investors who hold such bonds won’t benefit. Moreover, he adds, “If interest rates increase at a pace that exceeds the step, the bonds lose value.”\nMatthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Tactical Management, says floating-rate bonds are a better option than step-up bonds when rates rise steadily, though step-ups remain more attractive than fixed-rate bonds.\n“The other problem with step-ups is you can’t access them through an ETF so you would have to buy individual bonds” which can be more challenging to purchase, partly because it can be difficult knowing if an investor is getting the market price, Mr. Tuttle says.\nDan Heckman, senior fixed-income strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Kansas City, adds: These bonds sometimes aren’t very liquid, or easy to sell without moving prices, because they’re a small part of the market. Further, the upside appreciation is limited because issuers can call them.\nStep-up bonds can be a good option when interest rates rise slowly and steadily, argues Seok Jo, chief investment officer of Crown Financial Partners in Beverly Hills, Calif. But investors need to calculate the yield-to-call, or the yield they would receive if the bond is called, rather than assume they can hold the bonds to maturity.\nMr. Zuckerman is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
