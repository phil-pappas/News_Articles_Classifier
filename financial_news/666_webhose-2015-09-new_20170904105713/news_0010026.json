The Prime Minister ( Narendra Modi ) has been in office since just May of last year and these are difficult and complicated issues and are going to take time.\n“The notion that all of these things will be addressed or fixed in that short period of time I think is somewhat naive and unrealistic,” he said.\n“We saw some of the debate around our trade promotion policy that we have in this country earlier this summer. These things are complicated and can have a political component so they are going to take time,” he said.\nThe US is trying to help the Indian government to achieve its targets.\n“We at the commerce department are eager and active in trying to be as helpful as we can to help the Modi government achieve its goals,” Selig said.\n 15, 2015 10:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:38:38.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
