He added miles to his runs. He started doing yoga three times a week. Then he went to a park near his apartment in Manhattan and threw tennis balls against a wall.\nAt this year’s U.S. Open, Mr. Slater is a rookie ball person, a job that requires a rocket arm. The Open is the only one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments where the people who fetch balls between points also throw them to each other, rather than roll them.\nENLARGE Edmund Raheb That is part of the reason why so many of the ball boys and girls at the U.S. Open are adults.\n“Baseball is not as popular as it was when I was growing up,” Mr. Slater said. “It’s more of a soccer generation.”\nThis year, though, grown-ups like Mr. Slater are more valuable than ever because Labor Day, part of the tournament’s traditional middle weekend, is late and the young arms have to go back to school, some earlier than usual in anticipation of snow days.\n“It’s never happened like that before,” said Tina Taps, who is in charge of U.S. Open ball persons. “I’m hopeful that we have enough over-18s that we can get through the second week.”\nEdmund Raheb, a 56-year-old rookie who is taking time off from his custom-curtains business in Manhattan, sees the shortage as an opportunity.\nAdult ‘Ball People’ Work at the U.S. Open The New York tennis tournament doesn’t rely only on ball boys and girls to assist the players.

Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal … of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION fullscreen “I want to do a big match,” he said. “Plus I get to work at night because I’m over 18.”\nAs a child growing up in Brooklyn, Mr. Raheb dreamed of becoming a professional tennis player. “I ended up being an upholsterer,” he said, before moving on to curtains.\nMr. Raheb still plays tennis and works out regularly. Before he tried out for a ball person job this summer, a friend who is a physical therapist taught Mr. Raheb exercises to strengthen his rotator cuff. He is proud of the American tradition of throwing balls rather than rolling them.\n“We’re still tough guys, you know?” he said.\nA thrower’s most challenging moment comes when a game ends and all the balls must be hurled to the other side of the court with one bounce, so the other player can serve.\n“You have to throw three balls machine-gun style to one place,” Mr. Slater said.\nInside Arthur Ashe Stadium, standing behind the baseline, a ball person might have to throw a ball more than 80 feet before it bounces. The tennis balls used weigh a mere 60 grams, or about 2 ounces.\n“My arm was hurting the first day a little bit,” said Bernadette Campbell, a 53-year-old retired New York City police officer who is a rookie ball person. “It’s got no weight to it.”\nMs. Campbell and her friend, 55-year-old Colleen Brady, both served on the police force for 20 years and played a lot of softball before trying out to be ball people. At the tournament, they were sitting among a pack of teenagers.\n“I could probably be these kids’ grandmother,” Ms. Brady said. “You see the way these kids sprint? If I sprint like that, I’m going to pull a hamstring.”\nThe drill sergeant of U.S. Open ball persons is Cathie Delaney. Each morning, Ms. Delaney calls her crew to order and announces assignments.\n“I don’t know why you guys are laughing, this is serious!” Ms. Delaney said on the first Monday of the tournament, before matches began. “Focus! That’s all I can say. You’ve got to focus and you’ve got to hustle.”\nThat is because there is a lot to follow, like the score, if a player misses a serve and needs another ball, whether another ball person has already bolted after a ball and if a player needs a towel. Mr. Raheb, the curtain maker, said his management experience helps.\n“I’ve been working a long time, I know how to deal with people,” he said. “That’s one of the advantages I have here as opposed to the kids.”\nWhile other tournaments rely mostly on ball boys and girls, the U.S. Open has long included more-mature ball people.\nBrowse Recent A-heds ENLARGE Who Wants to Ring the Closing Bell on Bad Days? Where Do the Indian and Atlantic Oceans Meet? Japan’s Most Powerful Follow the Sensei of Seaweed About 400 people tried out to be ball persons this summer. The tournament usually needs about 260 and takes around 80 rookies. They must be 14 or older and are paid minimum wage to start. This year, 39 ball persons are age 30 or older.\nBall persons work six to a court unless there is a shortage. The throwers stand at the back walls, while the runners kneel on towels near the net, ready to pounce when points end.\nVeterans like Laray Fowler, who is working her 18th U.S. Open, know the stars and their habits: when they want towels, how many balls they like to inspect before serving. Ms. Fowler, a 31-year-old sales associate for a leather-goods company, was a fixture at the matches of her favorite player, Kim Clijsters, including her three victories in the finals. But Ms. Fowler missed Ms. Clijsters’s last singles match before she retired in 2012 because her boyfriend forgot to pick her up at work.\n“I didn’t talk to him for two weeks,” Ms. Fowler said. “Sometimes when I get mad I bring it up.”\nLuckily, Ms. Clijsters had a doubles match the next day, and Ms. Fowler was there.\nMr. Slater, a former advertising salesman who grew up going to the tournament, recalled the time his parents pulled him out of camp so he could try out to be a ball boy, only to meet with disappointment.\n“We got there and we found there was a minimum age requirement,” he said.\nThis year, his family’s summer plans aligned perfectly with the tryouts and his wife agreed to take vacation so he could work the full tournament. Mr. Slater said he isn’t even bothered by the one squeamish task that all ball persons must perform: holding on to the towels that sweaty players wipe down with between points.\n“I don’t have a problem with that,” Mr. Slater said. “I have kids.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD401_0903ba_P_20150903104535.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD398_0903ba_H_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD398_0903ba_M_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD395_0903ba_P_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT862_Raheb_G_20150903143540.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD401_0903ba_M_20150903104535.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD395_0903ba_H_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD401_0903ba_H_20150903104535.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD399_0903ba_P_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD397_0903ba_M_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD396_0903ba_M_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD399_0903ba_H_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD397_0903ba_H_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD400_0903ba_M_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD395_0903ba_M_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD399_0903ba_M_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD396_0903ba_H_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD398_0903ba_P_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD400_0903ba_P_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD396_0903ba_P_20150903104522.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD400_0903ba_H_20150903104523.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD397_0903ba_P_20150903104522.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:18:09.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
