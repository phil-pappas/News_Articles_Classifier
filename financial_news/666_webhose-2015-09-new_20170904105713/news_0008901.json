Further information is available at tsb.co.uk/car-loans. \nMoneywise Verdict If you're buying a car on credit you could probably save a little money with this offer. \nTSB charges 3.9% APR for loans in this bracket, so borrowing £10,000 over three years would cost £294.49 a month, paying £601.75 interest over the loan. \nRateSetter currently offers the best comparable terms, charging 3.5% APR. That would cost £292.78 a month, or £540 interest overall. \nThat’s a £60 difference, which will be more than offset by the three free MOTs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:35:02.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
