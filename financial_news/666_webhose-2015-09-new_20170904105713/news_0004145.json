It touched a weakest intraday level of R13.9671 to the greenback.\nAgainst the euro the rand was at R15.449 from R15.4589 previously and was at R21.2331 against the pound from a previous close of R21.1964.\nThe euro was at $1.1203 from a previous close of $1.1207.\nBidvest Bank head of foreign exchange Ion de Vleeschauwer said emerging market currencies faced pressure, but the rand was not the worst performing Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and SA) currency.\n\"Others currencies have fallen further, so there is still potential for a further rand slide.
