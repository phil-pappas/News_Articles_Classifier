Millionaire's wife jailed in WA over fraud AAP – 34 minutes ago Print \nThe wife of a wealthy mining executive will spend at least nine months behind bars after pleading guilty to fraudulently claiming more than $60,000 in welfare benefits. \nJulie Bohannan, 42, used a false name and repeatedly lied to Centrelink over eight years about her marital status, where she lived and how much money she had, even after she married former chief executive of Braemore Resources and Bathurst Resources, Hamish Bohannan, in 2006. \nShe was sentenced in the West Australian District Court on Wednesday to 18 months in jail. \nIn sentencing, Judge Andrew Stavrianou said the mother-of-two had engaged in deliberate and sustained deception between November 2001 and July 2009. \nHe said Bohannan's husband had a significant income between 2004 and 2009, including $1.8 million in 2004-05, and she had no significant need to receive the Centrelink benefits. \n\"It was planned, deliberate and dishonest conduct,\" Judge Stavrianou said. \n\"You abused the system for your own personal gain.\" \nBohannan repaid the money in 2010 and then moved to New Zealand, but was arrested at Perth Airport during one of her visits to WA last year. \nJudge Stavrianou noted that Bohannan was remorseful, had no prior convictions, had not re-offended since paying back the money and was a good parent. \nBut he said personal and general deterrence were also important considerations for sentencing. \nThe court heard one of Bohannan's daughters had learning difficulties, but Judge Stavrianou found her circumstances were not so exceptional that no-one else could care for the girl while Bohannan was in prison. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook G20 must stick to growth plan: Hockey AAP \nTreasurer Joe Hockey will urge his G20 counterparts to stick to the promise of raising world growth by an additional …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T08:22:24.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
