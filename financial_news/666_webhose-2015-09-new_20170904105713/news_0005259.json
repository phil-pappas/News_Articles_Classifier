The fall took the shares below the 94 cents price placed on the new shares offered to existing shareholders. It's also well below the $4.10 Myer shares were valued at when they first went to market in October, 2009. To help fund its new plans, Myer has so far raised $99 million from institutional investors, and expects to raise a further $122 million through a fully underwritten retail entitlement offer.
