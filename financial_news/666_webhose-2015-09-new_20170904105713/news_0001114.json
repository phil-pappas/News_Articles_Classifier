They did not, they actually rose slightly,\" Wohlrabe said.\nWohlrabe said the scandal around Volkswagen, which has admitted to deliberately falsifying U.S. diesel emissions tests, broke too late to be reflected in the latest Ifo survey, with any negative fallout having an impact on next month's result.\nHe also said that the influx of thousands of refugees into Germany in recent weeks had boosted the retail sector, in particular sales of groceries, with supermarkets seeing a clear rise in turnover that was expected to continue.
