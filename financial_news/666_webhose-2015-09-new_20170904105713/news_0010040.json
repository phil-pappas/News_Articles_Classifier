Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan The Abbott government have yet again been forced to throw cold water on speculation the Prime Minister's leadership is under pressure, as new reports surface that a cabinet reshuffle is imminent.\nMr Abbott issued an unusual statement rejecting the report, saying it was \"wrong\" and \"reports of end of year reshuffles are absolutely a dime a dozen\", but senior ministers acknowledged it is damaging and distracting for a government who have otherwise had a good week.\nMeanwhile, Joe Hockey, not named as under threat in the report, has come under attack by 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley, who has suggested he \"take one for the team\" and resign as Treasurer.\nThe report from The Daily Telegraph names ministers, assistant ministers and parliamentary secretaries for Defence, Kevin Andrews, Employment, Eric Abetz, Industry, Ian Macfarlane, Trade, Andrew Robb, Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion, Veterans Affairs, Michael Ronaldson, Infrastructure, Jamie Briggs and Environment, Bob Baldwin, saying their roles were in danger.\nThe same report says 'rising stars' Christian Porter, Dan Tehan, Marise Payne, Kelly O'Dwyer, Michaella Cash, Fiona Nash, Darren Chester, Alan Tudge, Karen Andrews, Arthur Sinodinos, Michael McCormack may get a look into any new ministry.\nIt also repeats ongoing speculation on a possible leadership challenge, this time saying the challenge may come from Malcolm Turnbull.\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton, Education Minister Christopher Pyne and Social Services Minister Scott Morrison all rejected the reshuffle speculation.\nMr Pyne said the stories, which have racked the government in recent months, \"do all sorts of distracting damage during the day\".\nHe said those listed as in danger were \"all good men doing a good job\", while Mr Morrison, tipped as a leadership contender, said they were all \"doing excellent jobs\".\n Mr Morrison acknowledged the report would have rattled those listed as a threatened species, when asked if Jamie Briggs would be happy to see his name mentioned.\n\"I suspect Jamie's not, but it's speculation on speculation and these are matters for the Prime Minister,\" Mr Morrison said.\nMr Hockey, whose future as Treasurer has been the subject of speculation, was faced with an aggressive interview with Mr Hadley on Friday, who said \"the gloss has come off him\" and \"the affable Joe has disappeared\".\n\"There is people in danger, you're not one of them according to the story...in the strange scenario would you take one for the team if he tapped you on the shoulder?\" Mr Hadley asked.\nMr Hockey said he was getting on with the job, and while some of his colleagues may no be happy with him because \"cut a few of their budgets\", these decisions were just part of his role.\nWith the politically important Canning by-election just a week away , Mr Dutton also defended the current ministry on Friday morning.\n\"That's an issue for the Prime Minister to comment on but from my perspective I think we've been a good Government,\" he said.\nStraight after the by-election Mr Abbott is expected to head to New York to talk with Barack Obama and other world leaders about national security, while just three days later Mr Turnbull is slated to speak at the National Press Club .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-11T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:05:23.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
