Nationwide, more people are heading to their nearest SoulCycle studio, barre class, or CrossFit facility rather than to a large health club.\nResearch conducted by the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) shows 54 million Americans, or 18.5% of the U.S. population, were health club members in 2014. Of that, 42% are members of a studio, which includes a boutique or discipline-specific facility. (Some people are members of more than one facility.)\nThe studios might be small, but the money is big. In 2014, the U.S. health club industry tallied $24.2 billion in revenue, a 7.4% increase from 2013, according to IHRSA, and “much of the industry’s growth has come from smaller boutiques and sport-specific studios.”\n“Millennials are not cheap, but frugal. They are willing to spend money if they find value.” Matt Powell, sports industry analyst, The NPD Group Figures from the trade group also show that Americans spent 13% more each month, $52 on average, for their membership dues in 2014 than in 2013. Studio members spent between $80 and $140, the most on average.\nBoutique operators sense an opportunity. Last month, SoulCycle, a chain of stationary bike studios that considers itself more of a movement than just an exercise regimen, filed for an IPO.\nSee also: 6 things to know about SoulCycle ahead of its IPO\nPlanet Fitness Inc. PLNT, +2.56% which owns a chain of gyms and boasts low membership prices, went public in August at $16 a share, and has been volatile ever since. The stock was last trading at $17.58.\nClassPass, an online service that offers classes at a variety of local studios for $99 each month, has expanded across 32 cities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. since its founding in New York in 2013. It was valued at more than $200 million in January 2015 Series B financing.\nAnd IHRSA research shows that studios are expanding into smaller towns that normally wouldn’t sustain larger health club facilities, because boutiques have lower overhead.\nThere are a number of reasons for this shift, according to Bruce Cohen, head of private equity and strategic practice at management consulting firm Kurt Salmon, which included a lengthy feature on boutique studios in the latest issue of the biannual Kurt Salmon Review.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/iR4Y8r6fANL", "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/03/12/classpass-valued-at-more-than-200m-taps-into-gym-craze/"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:18:07.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
