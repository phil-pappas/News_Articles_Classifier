Supplied Share on twitter by John Davidson There is something about taking a tablet into the shower with you that never grows old.\nThe way the water beads on its screen like little rhinestones, glimmering. The way shampoo and conditioner, rubbed vigorously into the glass front and polycarbonate back, give the tablet a lustre you could never achieve with a mere damp cloth. The way you could never do any of that with an iPad. The way iPad owners are so smug with their total market dominance and all the brilliant apps such dominance begets. The way a nice cold shower would wipe that smile right off their faces …\nCould Sony's Xperia Z4 tablet be the one that finally knocks Apple's iPad off its perch?\nProbably not – but not because the Z4 isn't a great tablet, isn't as good as an iPad Air 2 in most respects and better in others (its water- and dust-proofing being the obvious ones), isn't our pick (along with Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2) as the best tablet on the market right now. If the Xperia doesn't take the iPad down a rung or two, it will only be because of the iPad's momentum.\nSony has barely put a foot wrong with the Xperia Z4 tablet, the same as with its previous waterproof tablet, the Z3, the compact version of which remains one of our favourite tablets of all time. If there was one thing wrong with the Z3, it was that you had to unseal the waterproof lugs every time you wanted to attach a USB cable – a very minor quibble that made recharging a little fiddly if you didn't have the charging dock.\nWith the Z4, Sony has solved that quibble, by coming up with a micro USB port you can leave exposed to the elements, even when you have the tablet with you in the shower. So there's very little to complain about whatsoever.\nOr, at least, there was very little to complain about, till Samsung came out with its Galaxy Tab S2.\nComfortable ratio I reviewed the 10.1-inch Xperia Z4 at the same time as Samsung's new 9.7-inch Galaxy Tab S2 and, while they're very similar machines – they both run Android 5.02 (hopefully, with upgrades to Android 5.1 in future), both are as thin and light as an iPad Air 2, if not more so – it's interesting how their subtle differences make them suitable for quite different applications.\nThe main difference is the aspect ratio. The Xperia Z4 has a screen resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels, giving it an aspect ratio of 16:10, quite close to the 16:9 aspect ratio of TVs. The Samsung Tab S2, however, has a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels, the same as an iPad Air 2, which is a ratio of 4:3.\nAfter four or five days of carrying both around, I have to admit I reached for the Samsung more often, just because of that aspect ratio and despite that Sony has a sharper screen. (An incredible screen, in fact.) It turns out that Apple knows a thing or two about usability, and the 4:3 ratio feels a little more comfortable, especially when you're using the tablet for applications such as reading magazines or books, or for the word processing or productivity apps that were the focus of my review. It's kind of like the difference between A4 and foolscap in the old days. To my mind, foolscap was always a little too long and skinny.\nIt's not a huge difference, though, and probably not as big as some of the other differences between the two Android tablets. Hands down, the Xperia sounds better than the Tab S2, thanks to its two front-facing speakers. The Samsung has bottom-facing speakers, like an iPad, which can leave the sound a little muffled, especially if you're trying to watch a video in bed.\nAlso the Xperia played videos better than the Tab S2, which tended to stumble over high-bit-rate videos in a way that made us wonder whether there might have been something wrong with our device.\nOur benchmarks were a little inconclusive, with the Samsung outscoring Sony in some tests and vice versa. Both of them scored so anomalously low in some tests we were left scratching our heads wondering whether we might be seeing some of the performance issues that Android 5.0 was known for, and that were said to be fixed in Android 5.1. If so, we can only hope that Samsung and Sony hurry up with their upgrades. Android 5.1 was released in March, and both tablets should have it by now.\nAnd of course there's the waterproofing, which probably won't make so much difference to the way you shower – I only ever take phones and tablets into the shower with me three or four times a year, when a new Xperia comes out basically – but could make a difference to the way you cook, read in the bath or by the pool or at the beach.\nSo it comes down to what you want a tablet for. For spreadsheets and word processing, the 4:3 aspect ratio on the Samsung is pretty appealing. But more appealing than a day on the beach, followed by that hot, hot shower you bagsed on the way home?\nSummer is coming. I know what I would choose.\nLikes: Incredibly light and easy to hold. Great screen, good sound.\nDislikes: Hmmm. Maybe a 4:3 screen would be better for reading? Might benefit from upgrade to Android 5.1.\nPrice: $799 for Wi-Fi-only version, Telstra plans start at $55 for LTE version.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-09-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:04:27.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
