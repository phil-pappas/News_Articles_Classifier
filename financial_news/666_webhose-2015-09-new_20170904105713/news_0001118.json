The two currencies’ fluctuations versus the dollar are the most alike since the 2007 financial crisis.\nIt’s a reflection of how even with the challenges faced by both economies,\nfrom stagnant growth to an aging population, their strong trade positions mean they don’t need to rely on foreign capital to finance deficits. That’s allowed the euro to defy many of the market’s best and brightest who’ve been calling for it to weaken to parity versus the greenback.\n“The euro has behaved like the yen, and recently more so,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign-exchange strategy in Frankfurt at Commerzbank AG, which topped Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc’s currency research rankings for 2015. “The policy challenge for the ECB is that the currency appreciation may come at the moment when they least want it -- when it’s totally out of line with the economy.”\nThe trend was illustrated Wednesday by the currencies’ reaction to a key Chinese manufacturing gauge, whose slump to a 6 1/2-year low sparked a selloff in Asian stocks. The euro posted the biggest gain among major peers versus the dollar, while the yen briefly climbed to the highest level this week.\n“The euro is looking like the yen, where money tends to come home when the world is a scary place,” said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “The ECB wouldn’t want to see the euro strengthen much from here, and the danger is that it might if we see renewed risk aversion.”\nA stronger exchange rate has the potential to curb exports and cap inflation, which dents demand. ECB officials led by President Mario Draghi project consumer prices will barely rise this year and might even fall.\nJapan and the euro zone also share surpluses in their current accounts, the broadest measure of trade, which make their currencies less vulnerable to capital outflows -- and popular with investors fleeing risk. And they both have near-zero interest rates and a bias for their central banks to provide more stimulus.\nCarry Trades These similarities have allowed the euro to take on one of the yen’s traditional roles: funding carry trades, where investors borrow cheaply in one currency to purchase a higher-yielding asset elsewhere. Unwinding the deals amid the turmoil in emerging markets involves buying back Europe’s single currency, which has provided support.\nWhat SocGen’s Juckes calls the “Japanification” of Europe showed up in the government bond market first, where yields started falling to records-- and approaching the lows seen in Japan -- as far back as 2012. From more than 2 percentage points higher than their Asian-nation peers at the start of this decade, the difference is now less than half a percentage point, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.\nEurope’s single currency has arrested the slide that saw it lose a fifth of its value from the middle of 2014 through March. It reached a seven-month high of $1.1714 on Aug. 24 as concern China’s economic woes were deepening sent a measure of global stocks tumbling by 3.8 percent. The euro has since pulled back to $1.1172 as of 11:05 a.m. Thursday in Tokyo.\nIn Step With the yen recovering from a 13-year low reached in June, the 120-day correlation between the currencies against the dollar climbed to 0.6 this month, the highest since the start of 2007. A figure of 1 would mean they’re moving in lockstep.\nDespite the euro’s recent strength, SocGen is one of a shrinking number of banks that still sees the shared currency falling to parity with the dollar, predicting that level by the end of the first quarter of 2016. Commerzbank forecasts a drop to $1.05 in that period, about level with the median estimate in data compiled by Bloomberg.\nLong Term? Andreas Koenig of Pioneer Investments acknowledges the similarities between the euro and yen, while questioning whether they’ll last.\nThe euro isn’t a haven, but is acting like one because of its role in the carry trade, according to Koenig. The distinction is important, he said, because it means the link between the euro and riskier assets will diminish as these positions, or shorts, are unwound.\n“We see the euro as a funding currency rather than a haven currency, which investors turn to for safety,” said Koenig. “It’s just cheap to short the euro. People have lightened up those positions during the recent period of risk-off. The more that happens, the weaker the correlation will become.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:24:34.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
