Notably, one week ahead of its North American debut, Fox's \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" is off to a great start in 21 international territories with $26.8 million. \nIn North American action, Sony has been on a roll in the late summer/early fall corridor with \"War Room\" and now, their latest release, \"The Perfect Guy,\" takes the top spot with $25.9 million. The PG-13 suspense drama starring Michael Ealy and Sanaa Latham took advantage of a great release date ahead of notable debuts this week with impressive results. In a very close contest, second place goes to Universal's thriller \"The Visit\" from director M. Night Shyamalan and producer Jason Blum with $25.4 million. \nOn this week's Movies on Demand chart, Warner Bros.' brilliant \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" directed by George Miller and featuring a landmark performance by Charlize Theron debuted in the top spot. This moved director Cameron Crowe's comedy, \"Aloha,\" starring Bradley Cooper to the second spot after taking first last week. Lionsgate's well-reviewed \"The Age of Adaline\" starring Blake Lively landed in third. \nOn our digital purchases and rentals chart, Sony's \"Aloha,\" now in its third week of release, climbed up the charts into the number one spot. Warner Bros.' big screen version of the HBO series \"Entourage\" debuted strong in its first week of release, landing in the number two position. Notably, Warner Bros.' 1985 cult classic, \"The Goonies,\" entered the charts in the number nine spot, most likely due to its 30-year anniversary celebration. \nIt's no surprise that our DVD and Blu-ray Disc sales chart had a newcomer at the top of the chart with this week's Movies on Demand winner \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" at number one. Anchor Bay's release of \"The Walking Dead: Season 5\" moved to second after a first place finish last week. Meanwhile, Fox's Dreamworks Animation family favorite \"Home\" continued to be a popular title, taking third place in its sixth week on the chart. \nOn the DVD and Blu-ray Disc rentals side of the ledger, Warner Bros.' buddy comedy \"Hot Pursuit\" took first place once again in its fourth weekend on the chart, followed by Fox's Dreamworks Animation release of \"Home\" and Sony's comedy \"Aloha.\" Our Top Viewer Engagement for Broadcast Telecasts chart features Telemundo's \"El Senor de los Cielos\" on top once again followed by Univision's \"Yo no creo en los hombres\" in second and CBS's long-running hit show \"NCIS\" in third. \nOn our Top Viewer Engagement for Cable Telecasts chart, AMC's \"Fear the Walking Dead\" kills it in the top position for the second week in a row, followed by TNT's \"Rizzoli & Isles\" and VH1's always-popular \"Love & Hip Hop Atlanta\" in third. \nFinally, on our Combined Social Media and Digital Engagement chart for viewers of broadcast and cable telecasts, NBC's \"America's Got Talent\" leads the charge by generating a popular video on YouTube of mentalist Oz Perlman using Instagram to blow the judges minds and earned 800k+ views. In second place, Comedy Central's \"Key & Peele\" played a skit off of CBS's \"Undercover Boss.\" The video was uploaded to YouTube and earned 1.8M+ views. Finally, with the first half of Season 5 complete, MTV's \"Teen Wolf\" ended on a strong note with an Instagram post of a few cast members garnering 158k+ interactions.
