That's according to JP Morgan Asset Managemenet - and they've produced a chart they say proves it. \nIt shows what would happen to an investor's return if they missed the very best days of stock market gains over a 10 year period. Missing the best 10 days would almost halve returns, the company said. \nIt goes on to explain that the best days of gains very often occur immediately after sharp falls - so anyone who panics will miss out. \nSomeone who invested £10,000 in the FTSE 100 20 years ago and reinvested dividends, but missed the best 10 days in the market, would have achieved an annualised return of 3.8pc and ended up with £21,347. \nBut those who adopted a buy and hold approach, holding their nerve during aggressive market sell-offs in 2000 during the tech crash and the financial crisis in 2008, would have fared better; making 7.3pc and seeing their investments grow to £41,236. \nDavid Stubbs, an investment strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: “Selling on days when stock markets plunge can be a recipe for locking in losses. Rather than making usually futile attempts to time the market, focus instead on taking the emotions out of decision making and staying invested for the long term.” \nThe FTSE 100 lurched back into the red yesterday, with concerns over slowing economic growth in China once again taking centre stage . \nThe index was down 3pc at one stage, trading just above the 6000 points mark, with weak manufacturing data from China the trigger. Since its 7,104 peak on April 27 the index has fallen 14pc. \nBut rather than selling in the hope of cutting losses, the answer for most investors is to do nothing and steer clear of trying to predict the peaks and troughs of the stock market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T11:38:30.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
