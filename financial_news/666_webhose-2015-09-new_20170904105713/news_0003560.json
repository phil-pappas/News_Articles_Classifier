The stricken company was so-called because of its plans to piggyback ultrafast broadband networks on existing sewer networks in mid-size towns such as Bournemouth. \nEdinburgh Council previously relied on BT’s part-copper-wire infrastructure to connect many of its services and buildings. CityFibre’s new network, being built in collaboration with local telecoms retailer Commsworld, is fibre-optic throughout, providing the council and around 7,000 businesses with internet access more than 10 times faster than BT’s superfast broadband service. \nGreg Mesch, CityFibre’s chief executive, said: “A future-proof wholesale network of this size provides a credible alternative to that provided by BT Openreach and points to the crucial role of competition at an infrastructure level for the technological and economic development of the UK’s towns and cities.\" \nThere are no firm plans yet to connect the network to homes, but CityFibre is working with Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) and TalkTalk on an ultrafast domestic broadband rollout in York that is designed to establish the economics of such an investment. \nBT is coming under increasing pressure from alternative infrastructure providers, although they still represent a small slice of the market. \nVirgin Media’s £3bn expansion plan, Project Lightning , has now added more than 250,000 properties to the cable network, and is on track to hit four million by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:47:34.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
