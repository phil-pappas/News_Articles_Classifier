MGI has tied up with Bank of South Pacific to provide money transfer service in the region of Tonga and Samoa – two island states in the Pacific.\n\nThese two destinations seem most attractive to MoneyGram given the growth opportunities from their dependence on remittance. The economies of Tonga and Samoa are otherwise primarily agricultural.\n\nThe World Bank estimates more than $200 million being remitted to Samoa and Tonga annually, most of which comes from Australia, New Zealand and the United States.\n\nMoneyGram specifically chose Bank of South Pacific since it is a leading financial services provider in its market. Moreover, the purchase of Australia’s Westpac group in Samoa, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Tonga has widened the bank business network, which will provide a ready customer base to MoneyGram.  \n\nRecently, the company announced a partnership with Agricultural Bank of China. Per the agreement, MoneyGram will provide money transfer services in over 3,700 locations. MoneyGram’s successful cooperation with the Agricultural Bank of China will provide the immigrant Chinese a fast, reliable and convenient money transfer service to their families back home. The company also announced the launch of a new account deposit product with Banco de Occidente Bank of Honduras. This new service will allow the customers of the global innovative money transfer and payment services provider to send money directly to all Banco de Occidente accounts in Honduras.\n\nMoneyGram actively tries to forge bank alliances since these are a great way of expanding its business network. The company is also working out partnerships with industry leaders to add value and convenience to its existing customers, and to expand its network. By 2013 end, the company expanded its worldwide agent network by twofold since 2007. The network was further increased by 14,000 locations in 2014.\n\nCurrently, MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other stocks worth considering in the same sector are, Euronet Worldwide, Inc. EEFT, StoneCastle Financial Corp. BANX and Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. HAWK. While Euronet Worldwide carries a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy), the other two stocks hold the same Zacks Rank as MoneyGram.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
