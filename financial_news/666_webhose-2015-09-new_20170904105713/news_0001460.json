With land prices only expected to go upwards, there is no stopping this trend. Moreover, in second quarter in 2015 (Q2) launches, there is only 3.21% of housing in the Rs31-65 lakh ticket size and none under Rs30 lakh ticket size in Mumbai,\" says Ramesh Nair, COO & International Director of JLL India in a release. According to JLL India, all launches expected within the city limits in the future too, will largely consist of units priced above Rs1 crore and above. From the number of new launches in Q2, the share of housing units that are worth over Rs1 crore each (within BMC limits), stands at 83%, it added. Although the share reduced from 90% at the end of first quarter of 2015 due to some new launches in suburban locations, JLL India said, it is still overwhelmingly high for a city where only a limited percentage of residents are able to afford ticket sizes of over Rs1 crore and this percentage share is expected to go up, albeit marginally, in launches in the near term. Among the new launches in Q2, not a single unit is offered below Rs30 lakh, while less than 4% new homes are priced between Rs31 to Rs65 lakh across Mumbai. \"Compared to pan-India figures, the numbers are highly skewed towards the higher ticket sizes in Mumbai. Very few units in the affordable range were available from all these launches and mostly were in the suburban locations. Even if the overall inventory is considered, there is very little stock in the affordable range, or Rs65 lakh and below in the city,\" JLL India said. This makes it very difficult for budget buyers to own a home in Mumbai. The normal multiplier should be six times of the annual household income; in other words, it should take six years’ salary to own a house. From the Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2014-15, the annual income of a four-member household is calculated below. Similarly, taking the weighted average of ticket sizes in Mumbai city, JLL India said, we get a number slightly above Rs2 crore. Resultantly, at an annual income per household of Rs7.5 lakh, it will take 27 years for a person to afford an apartment worth slightly over Rs2 crore in Mumbai. For a house worth Rs1 crore, it will take 13 years, it added. JLL India said, \"To suit the budget of a majority of home buyers in Mumbai, developers have been steadily reducing average unit sizes over the last few years and will continue to launch smaller-sized apartments for the same reason. The reduction in average unit sizes has been the highest in Mumbai at 26.4% from 2010-Q1 of 2015. The average unit sizes in Mumbai have been the lowest among Indian cities.\" More in Moneylife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:15:48.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
