But that doesn't exempt it from making an effort in solidarity,\" French President Francois Hollande told a news conference on Monday. \n\"Everyone must understand: You can't ask for solidarity when there's a problem and then exempt yourself from doing your duty when there is a solution,\" Hollande said.
