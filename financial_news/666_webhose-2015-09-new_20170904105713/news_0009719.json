EPA Share on twitter by James Thomson Finally, a little relief for Glencore chief Ivan Glasenberg, who watched the miner's stock climb 6.6 per cent on Thursday night after two horror days of trading that saw it fall 6.7 per cent and then 8.4 per cent.\nGlencore stock has hit record low after record low since Glasenberg delivered the company's results on August 19. Obviously this has been a period of extreme volatility for global markets, and a global commodities trader with a debt pile of $42.7 billion won't win any awards for defensive stock of the month. But a 26 per cent fall in 12 days isn't pretty.\nThursday night's jump came despite Standard & Poor's revising its outlook on Glencore to \"negative\" from \"stable\" after lowering its price assumptions for aluminium, copper, and other metals, \"reflecting a change in market conditions and uncertainties about China's economic outlook.\"\nBut it did take a little financial show of strength to get the shares moving in the right direction again. On Wednesday Glencore said it would pay back $US350 million ($500 million) of perpetual bonds next month, at the earliest possible date. It was a clever way of showing the company has cash to pay debt as it battles the commodity price slump.\nBut investors aren't the only ones applying the blowtorch to Glasenberg. On Thursday, Rio Tinto, the company Glencore would like to merge with, fired what many will see as another shot at Glencore.\nThe battleground? Who can read China the best.\nGlasenberg caused quite a stir when he said in August that \"at the moment none of us can read China.\"\n\"None of us know what is going on there and I'm yet to find the guy who can predict China correctly. China in the first half was a lot weaker than anyone expected.\"\n BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie was first to disagree, but at its investor strategy day on Thursday, Rio's iron ore boss, Andrew Harding, upped the ante by dedicating the bulk of his presentation to demonstrating how Rio had invested \"millions\" in a new \"granular\" examination of China's economy and how that relates to demand for steel and, therefore, iron ore.\nHarding's conclusion is that China has much further to grow, and that peak steel demand will indeed hit 1 billion tonnes by 2030. Therefore, Rio isn't backing away from its push to build production to 360 million tonnes in the next few years.\nBut the other part of his message could be interpreted as a shot across the bows of Glencore – Ivan might not understand China, but we sure do, and here's how.\nThat particular battleground might seem petty, but you must remember that Glasenberg has in the past raised questions about the management of Rio (and by extension BHP) by criticising its strategy of increasing iron ore supply in the face of falling prices, and its shareholder return policies .\nBut through his presentation on the state of China, Harding (who is developing a reputation as a bit of enforcer for Rio, having led its battle with Andrew Forrest earlier this year) has deliberately provided evidence of just how forensic Rio management is about understanding its markets.\nWas the presentation deliberately aimed at rebuffing Glencore? No. Rio needed to reassure all investors that the thinking that underpins its iron ore business is sound and unchanged – even if there will still be plenty who dispute its read of the Chinese steel market, even after yesterday's avalanche of data on that topic.\nAnd given Glencore's shares have fallen 60 per cent from October 7, when Rio revealed the Glencore merger approach, any scrip-based deal looks increasingly unlikely.\nBut if the presentation helps make the differences between Rio and Glencore a little starker, Harding and his boss Sam Walsh won't mind that at all.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-09-04T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:08:52.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
