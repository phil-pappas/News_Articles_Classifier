Photo: Supplied\nUnions are claiming a new enterprise agreement covering Chevron's $73 billion Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia represents a new standard for the resources industry, with workers winning a 5 per cent pay rise and improved roster arrangements.\nA strike planned for Friday was called off after contractor CB&I agreed to what the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) describes as \"more family-friendly rosters\".\nThe unions, including the AMWU, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) and the Electrical Trades Union (ETU), had pushed for a 20 days on, 10 days off roster to replace the current arrangements of 26 days on, nine days off.\nOn Thursday, workers endorsed CB&I's offer of a 23 days on, 10 days off roster, which the AMWU hailed as \"the most family-friendly construction roster to date\".\nAdvertisement Workers will also receive a 5 per cent pay rise, to be paid within the first four months of the new agreement being voted up.\n\"A 23/10 roster is both groundbreaking and industry-leading. Without doubt, the Gorgon project now provides some of the best roster and wage conditions available on a construction job in Australia,\" said Mick Buchan, the West Australian state secretary of the CFMEU.\nA Chevron spokesperson welcomed the decision to call off the strike. \"The project contractors continue to negotiate in good faith with the unions to finalise a new agreement.\"\nCB&I declined to comment.\nThe agreement may help prevent further delays to the start of production at the troubled project, which is Australia's biggest single resources venture. Production is currently more than a year behind the original schedule and due to start in the second half of 2015.\nBut the deal will not calm concerns about labour cost blow-outs in the sector.\nChevron Australia boss Roy Krzywosinski has previously expressed concerns about the lagging competitiveness of the LNG construction sector in Australia and inflexibility in the labour sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:09:59.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
