I liked the fact that we could trade through those days and not lose any money.\"\nDimon, CEO of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, commented briefly on a wide range of topics as he took questions without giving a speech.\nHe called a recent slowdown in growth in the Chinese economy \"a speed bump\" and said that even if the rate of expansion is 5 percent, it would \"not be a devastating thing for the world.\"\nHe warned that the bank may spend \"a little bit of money\" to expand its retail operations into a new city in the United States and open as many as 100 branches there over two years.\nBecause JPMorgan has more than 10 percent of insured deposits in the United States, it is not allowed by law to buy other banks. As a result, it must take the more expensive route of building its own offices in order to expand, he said.\nThe bank has not said which urban market it wants to enter.\nDimon also said JPMorgan intends to take advantage of weakness among European banks to take a bigger share of their capital markets business.\nDimon spoke at a conference sponsored by Barclays, where in the past two days executives from Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc gave their 5 percent revenue decline estimates with two more weeks to go in the quarter.
