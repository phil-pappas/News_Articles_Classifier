Aaron Sawall Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith An energy revolution has crept up on us with very little fanfare.\nLarge-scale solar looks set to usurp wind power from its long-held position as the cheapest new renewable energy source in just a few years, and in some regions it will undercut thermal power by 2020.\nUBS's global utilities research team has come up with the startling view that solar power could account for a quarter of the world's installed power generation capacity by 2050. It's a fundamental shift from the circa 4 per cent of existing global capacity and would be driven by some â‚¬3 trillion ($4.8 trillion) of investment.\nIn a comprehensive report, UBS portrays a vision where solar eventually replaces nuclear power and coal, establishing itself as the default power supply technology of the future, backed up by storage and thermal power.\nUtilities are set to go from marginal players in solar to lead actors, snaring half the global market by 2025, eroding the market share of third-party developers, UBS forecasts.\nLocally, the dynamics are a little different with no nuclear in the mix. But the trend is similar, with Origin Energy managing director Grant King presenting figures indicating rapid cost reductions in utility-scale solar that should make it competitive with new wind projects in Australia around the end of the decade.\nOrigin's figures show solar costs in 2017 of $100-$120 per megawatt-hour of electricity, compared to $80-$90 for new wind. While solar is still more costly, it is not out of the ball-park given the $100/MWh forward price in 2016-17 for the combination of \"black\" electricity and large-scale renewable energy certificates that comprise the revenue stream for a renewables producer.\nCheapest new project out done By 2020, the cheapest large-scale solar technology is outdoing the cheapest new wind project and the trend is set.\nHelping close the cost gap is the rising cost of new wind farms as the best sites are snapped up and projects have to be built further away from the transmission grid, increasing connection costs. Meanwhile, with wind already reasonably mature, any further cost reductions there are seen as modest.\nBut costs for the less-established solar industry continue to drop rapidly, while development schedules also play in favour of solar: Origin cites 1 to 2 years for a wind project with development approval to reach a final investment decision, then 1 to 3 years for construction.\nThe upshot is that large-scale solar looks likely to capture much more of Australia's Renewable Energy Target than the minimal share currently assumed.\n\"Our view is that people will probably be surprised at the rate at which utility scale solar will be able to take up a significant amount of this renewable energy target,\" Mr King said.\nHe points to bustling activity among renewable site prospectors, who are now scouting around for utility-scale solar sites with as much vigour as they were 10 years ago for wind sites.\nOrigin's investment in a utility-scale solar project in Chile, which Mr King describes as the \"leading edge\" destination for utility project costs and development, makes clear that company's intention to be involved. Rival AGL Energy is in on the action with its two projects in NSW, which will have a combined capacity of 155 megawatts.\nNew York-based UBS analyst Julien Doumoulin-Smith says the cost structure for solar power is falling by 5 per to 15 per cent a year depending on the region, with average capital costs across the OECD seen falling from almost $US1.50 per watt towards $US1 in the next few years.\nA reduction in the cost of capital is helping, thanks to the declining risk profile for solar projects.\nThis is now \"a go-to product for a lot of long-term capital oriented investors,\" Mr Doumoulin-Smith said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-09-03T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:04:01.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
