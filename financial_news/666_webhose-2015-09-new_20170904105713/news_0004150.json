The Shanghai composite was down 1.39%.\nChina’s consumer inflation in August surprised to the upside at 2% year on year, compared with a 1.6% rise in July, mostly driven by food prices. However, PPI deflation accelerated, with the headline producer price index falling 5.9% year on year in August — its sharpest decline in almost six years.\nEuropean equities followed the weaker Asian markets as investor focus shifted back to US interest rate hike expectations, Barclays Research said in a note.\nAlthough recent economic data confirm that the US economy is close to full employment, slow wage growth, low inflation and increased uncertainty in global markets would probably deter the US Federal Reserve from hiking in September, Barclays said.\nThe FTSE had lost 0.98% by the JSE’s close and the Paris CAC 40 was 1.02% lower. The DAX was down 0.5%.\nAt 5pm the all share was 0.39% lower at 49,528.10 and the blue-chip top 40 had lost 0.51%. Platinum led losses, with the index closing 3.83% lower while resources retreated 1.72%. Banks were down 1.46%, financials shed 0.51% and industrials softened 0.22%. The gold index picked up 1.11%.\nStanlib Asset Management chief economist Kevin Lings said the exact timing of the Fed’s hike remained something of a guess. Analysts were pricing in a 25-basis-point hike at next week’s Fed meeting, but the futures market ascribes only a 28% probability.\n\"The market’s view has fluctuated wildly,\" he said.\nIn early July the implied probability was down to 20%, but by mid-August it had risen to more than 50%. It then fell back down to below 25% by the end of August, and rose to more than 35% in early September.\nMr Lings said it was likely that the first rate hike was already priced into global markets. \"Markets could react positively to a hike as this would eliminate a key uncertainty,\" he said.\nMarket focus was on the annual results of FirstRand and Discovery, which were delivered earlier in the day. Both of their share prices closed weaker despite strong results. FirstRand reported normalised earnings up 14% to R21.2bn and Discovery’s headline earnings rose 16% to R4.02bn.\nFirstRand was 2.61% lower at R50.73 and Discovery closed 0.75% weaker at R129.03.\nAmong mining stocks, Glencore was 3.47% lower at R28.65, while steel producer ArcelorMittal plummeted 9.93% to R8.25.\nAfter announcing the acquisition of Anglo American Platinum’s mines near Rustenburg on Wednesday, gold producer Sibanye was 1.03% weaker at R18.31. Anglo American Platinum was 5.67% lower at R305.08.\nAfter a reprieve on Wednesday Lonmin resumed its previous weakening trend, closing down 6.37% at R5.\nRetail stocks had a good day, with Pick n Pay picking up 3.43% to R64.75. Woolies rose 3.31% to R99.23.\nSouth African property stocks had a positive day, with the index climbing 0.92%. Growthpoint added 1.38% to R25.65.\nSpur rose marginally by 0.57% to R35.40 after reporting full-year diluted headline earnings per share were down 3.2% to 152.76c.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:18:56.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
