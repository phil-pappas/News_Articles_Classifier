Nikki To by Jill Margo Young Australians fighting to enter law school are heading into a profession which carries a high risk of anxiety and depression.\nNow one of them has stepped out of the crowd and named it.\nJerome Doraisamy, 27, has used his personal experience of depression to create a tool, in the form of a highly readable book, for every law student and young lawyer.\nAlthough research shows at least one in three legal professionals suffer depression, the condition remains stigmatised and hidden.\nThe Wellness Doctrines by Jerome Doraisamy sheds light on a condition that remains stigmatised and hidden. supplied Courageously, he has written a frank account of how, after pushing himself to his physical and emotional limit, and achieving his goals, it suddenly dawned on him that he had been clinically depressed and was having a breakdown.\nHe wrangled with the notion: \"How on earth did this happen to me? What the hell went wrong?\"\nTelling almost no one – not even his parents – he admitted himself to hospital. Since his recovery he had in mind to write a practical book to make his peers who are suffering from depression feel safe enough to disclose their issues and seek help without fear of personal or professional reprisal.\nHe writes that depression can have devastating and incapacitating effects on self-confidence, career success and personal life. While remaining well requires an ongoing process of management, he hopes that from his book, his peers will draw strength from the fact that things can get better.\n Called The Wellness Doctrines , the book identifies the danger signals and suggests preventive or remedial steps. It is widely researched and has drawn impressive support from the legal fraternity.\nIn the foreword, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, describes how the pathways of entry have changed during his professional lifetime. As law schools proliferate, employment prospects have correspondingly diminished.\nThe pressure to achieve is great and he suspects a majority of undergraduates are engaged simultaneously in study and some form of paid employment, leaving them short of time and subject to serious levels of stress.\nA book of its time Admiring Doraisamy's candour, he notes he was not restricted by his own experience but drew widely on the experience of others, liberally quoting from them.\n\"This is a book of its time and a book for its time,\" he writes.\nAs a student, Doraisamy won awards, held several positions on councils and societies and despite being overloaded, found it difficult to say no to requests to \"do good\".\nHe later worked as an academic researcher, a law clerk and a tipstaff before dedicating himself to tackling the issue of depression in the profession.\nHe said research has shown 86 per cent of professionals would rather suffer in silence than disclose a mental health condition out of fear of being fired or passed over for promotion.\nIn a testimonial, barrister, human rights and refugee advocate, Julian Burnside, says depression has been his own constant (but unwelcome) companion in life.\nHis only regret in seeing this book is that he did not see it earlier. Burnside highlights the dissonance between the idealism that attracts many to law school and the reality of big law firms. \"Many, including the brightest and the best, see their earlier ideals looking more naïve, more unachievable.\"\nThe book is being launched in Sydney this week at McCabes Lawyers. Its principal, Terry McCabe, believes Doraisamy is making an important contribution to the profession.\nMcCabe suffered for many years from a low level of anxiety and depression which was exacerbated during times of stress.\nHis family paid the price. During such episodes he was so focused on keeping the balls in the air, that by the weekend he was often exhausted and wanted to be alone.\nWith today's technology, he says the demands to be available and respond to clients, the courts and other lawyers have never been stronger.\n\"We used to have snail mail. It was expected that the advice would take a week to deliver. Now it is expected you will respond to an email within minutes. Add to this the invention of smartphones, and lawyers are available almost 24 hours a day.\n\"It's not surprising that depression is a major factor in the legal industry.\"\nthewellnessdoctrines.com", "external_links": ["http://www.thewellnessdoctrines.com/"], "published": "2015-09-29T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:11:25.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
