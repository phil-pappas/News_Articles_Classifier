We remain confident in the size of the future opportunity available to Smiggle and our management capability to achieve it.\"\nPeter Alexander sleepwear delivered double-digit growth in sales.\nStrong sales and margin growth at Smiggle and sleepwear brand Peter Alexander underpinned a 20.7 per cent increase in net profit to $88.1 million for the 12 months ending July - slightly below market consensus forecasts around $90 million.\nGroup sales rose 6.2 per cent to $961.9 million, as double-digit growth at Smiggle and Peter Alexander and solid gains at casual clothing chain Jay Jays offset subdued growth at Just Jeans and womens wear brands, Dotti, Portmans and Jacqui E.\nComparable store sales rose 3.4 per cent across the group in the July-half, an improvement on the 1.1 per cent growth in the first half, taking full year same-store growth to 2.2 per cent.\nOnline sales rose 31 per cent, fuelled by strong gains at Dotti, Portmans, Smiggle and Peter Alexander, and are expected to reach 10 per cent of total sales over time.\nEarnings before interest and tax jumped 13.9 per cent to $105.7 million, exceeding forecasts around $102 million. Premier also booked a $12.8 million profit from its 27 per cent stake in appliance maker Breville.\nGross margins rose a weaker than expected 103 points to 63.1 per cent, swelled by lower clothing tariffs, reduced discounting and more direct sourcing from overseas.\nHowever, costs of doing business rose sharply as Premier opened 16 Smiggle stores in the UK.\n\"The company had good second half sales momentum, but gross margin expansion was constrained by (the weaker Australian dollar) and rising costs,\" said Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford.\nPremier increased its final dividend from 20¢ to 21¢, taking the full year payout, including a special dividend in the first half, to to 51¢.\nMr Lew said the group, which is sitting on $282 million cash and a $200 million pool of franking credits, would consider further capital management initiatives in future.\nMr Lew and Mr McInnes issued no profit guidance, but analysts are forecasting net profits to grow 15 per cent in 2016 to $101 million, fuelled by strong sales growth at Smiggle.\nThe company is expecting cost savings of more than $2 million a year over three years from its new national distribution centre in Truganina in Melbourne, with all seven brands now operating from the DC.\nMr McInnes said the new DC had the scale, capacity and technology to support Premier's growth aspirations across all sales channels.\nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:34:26.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
