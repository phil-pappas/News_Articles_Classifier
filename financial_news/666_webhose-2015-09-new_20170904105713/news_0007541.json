This company seems to believe in being a full bouquet player and now has smartphones priced all the way from around Rs 7,000 to Rs 25,000. The Vivo X5Pro is the flagship in this range.\nThe Vivo X5Pro is surely a very stylish phone and also among the slimmest around at just 6.4 mm. The phone looks a lot like some other phones in the market, especially those in the same price range thanks to the perforated speaker grill under the screen. However, the metallic frame that runs around the body will remind you of some Sony Xperia models, though in a good way.\nWhat is good?\nOverall, the phone offers you the feeling of something robust, something that will last. And that itself is an achievement these days. The build quality is really good and the plastic at the rear and front does not\nfeel flimsy.\nThe phone has a very good Full HD display that works well even in bright sunlight. However, the company needs to take a look at whether it needs to use up so much space and above and beyond the display, which thankfully is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The phone offers decent performance and you will not have issues with multitasking. I tried some high-end games and was happy with the graphics as well as with the response offered by\nthe device.\nThe best thing about the phone has to be its 13 MP rear camera. The camera is one of the fastest I have used, certainly in a phone that is not priced like a flagship. The sapphire lens offer great clarity in the photos and there is a great level of detail even in low-light shots. With touch-to-click activated you can see how fast the auto-\nfocus works on this phone and that is impressive. The only time there is even a slight lag is when you are trying to shoot macro.\nThe camera app packs a few presets—even one for PowerPoint presentations—and it pretty much covers all common use cases. The battery life is decent and should be able to last 12 hours if the Snapdragon processor behaves and does not go on one of its heated, power draining, phases.\nWhat is not good?\nYes, the processor does heat up at times. We have come to expect that from a Qualcomm processor, so much so that it could be considered a unique feature. When this happens, which is thankfully not that often, the phone will lose battery in a hurry. I experienced this the most when apps were updating in the background.\nThe Funtouch OS is easy to use and not that complicated. But it does go against a lot of things you are used to with Android. For instance, the new apps will be added to the Home screen and you will need to create folders to keep things clean. Plus, the back button is on the right and this will take some getting used to. The audio quality of the phone is not that great, especially since the company wants to call it a Hi-Fi phone. I tried to test the Airtel Wynk Movies app with the phone and could not hear the dialogues clearly with the fan running in the room.\nVerdict: Overall, the phone is a decent, more affordable, option for those looking to buy the Samsung A8 or the HTC M9+. It offers similar features at a better price. However, if you look bottom up, the phone looks overpriced in comparison to Chinese competitors like the OnePlus 2 and the Xiaomi Mi4i.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n* Display: 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display\n* Processor: Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 processor\n* Operating system: Funtouch OS 2.1 based on Android 5\n* RAM: 2 GB RAM\n* Storage: 16 GB internal storage, expandable up to 128 GB\n* Camera: 13 MP rear camera, 8 MP front camera\n* Battery: 2450 mAh battery\n** Estimated street price: Rs 28,650\n 24, 2015 12:06 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T04:18:06.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
