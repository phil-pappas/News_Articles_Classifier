As a result, the watchdogs' budgets have been effectively frozen. \n\"We are really going under water, to be honest,\" said EBA Chairman Andrea Enria, referring to the difficulties of meeting targets with limited resources. \nBanks are already putting pressure on EBA to \"close the books\" on reform so they know where they stand, he added. \nThe three watchdogs face having to cut back on their work next year despite legally-set timetables in many cases, Maijoor said. \nLondon-based EBA's budget in euros has also been hit when converted into a strengthening sterling, prompting one lawmaker to quip that the watchdog should move to Frankfurt. \nGabriel Bernardino, who chairs EIOPA, said his oversight team consisted of just four people at a time when the EU was preparing to introduce the most sweeping reform of insurer capital rules in decades, next January. \n\"How can I do convergence of supervisory practices with four persons?\" Bernardino said. \nEnria and Bernardino said that constrained budgets meant they were also struggling to liaise with regulators elsewhere and play a full role in drawing up the global regulation that is used to shape rules in Europe. \nWhile writing new rules remains the main focus, fewer resources being devoted to making implementation consistent meant that risks could be building up in the system, such as banking activities shifting to unregulated players, Enria said. \nThe EU wants to build a \"capital markets union\" (CMU) to raise more funds for companies from listings on stock markets and issuing corporate bonds. \nMaijoor said having the resources to properly implement EU financial rules would be crucial to making the CMU a success. \nRegulators in the United States have also complained that a limited budget has hampered them.
