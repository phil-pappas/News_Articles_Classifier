Chief executives are feeling the heat and during reporting season, SEEK's Andrew Bassat returned fire at investors who are only focused on \"next week's\" results, concerns backed by Tatts CEO Robbie Cooke and Wesfarmers Richard Goyder .\nGraphic: Les Hewitt The new breed of incoming CEOs have a distinctly international flavour with half of the 14 new top 100 CEOs born overseas, ranging from Quebec to Colombia.\nBut executive recruiter Guy Farrow, the managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles' Sydney office says the days of simply importing a global CEO have been tempered by boards opting for international executives who have also acquired a deep local knowledge from living in Australia for a decade or more such as REA's Tracey Fellows (born in Quebec), Telstra's Andy Penn (born in Tonbridge, England) and Westpac's Brian Hartzer (born in New York).\nLocal knowledge \"You're getting a global athlete with local knowledge,\" Farrow says.\n \"If you look at Tracey [Fellows at REA] she didn't come straight into the job at REA, she came out with multinational IBM before moving to Australia Post and then REA. Andy Penn didn't come straight into the Telstra CEO role, he was the CFO and with AXA Asia Pacific for 20 years. And Andrew Mckenzie at BHP who is Scottish didn't come straight into the CEO role, he came out of Rio Tinto,\" Farrow says.\n\"Andrew Vesey at AGL is another great example, he came out of [US energy company] AES but he previously spent some time in Australia in the 90s, so he isn't coming in cold turkey. And Alberto Calderon at Orica was a BHP Billiton executive and director at Origin, so he has had global roles but isn't coming in [to the Australian market] cold turkey either,\" Farrow says.\n\"There is a big push at the moment for diversity of thinking and these people have seen different countries, different business environments, different cultures and they bring all of that to the table.\"\nOur Pathways research confirms the archetypal ASX 100 CEO has barely changed in 2015, a 55-year old Australian born, private school educated man with a commerce or economics degree. But there are other paths to the top as last year's Boss cover story on how Gail Kelly – who rose from being a school teacher in Zimbabwe to Westpac CEO – showed (September Boss \" How I broke the glass ceiling \").\nCountry kids still make up an extraordinary 20 per cent of top 100 CEOs and 36 per cent of the Australian-born CEOs, including newly appointed Bank of Queensland chief Jon Sutton who was born in Wagga Wagga, NSW and Suncorp's Michael Cameron born in Cootamundra, NSW, confirming the Boss theory that country kids are born CEOs .\nAnd while 27 per cent of top 100 CEOs hold an MBA, there are still those university drop outs such as carsales.com Greg Roebuck who have risen to the top and claim that life experience beats lectures . But others warn not to be fooled by our hero worship of billionaire dropouts like Gates, Zuckerberg and Jobs with research finding that 95 per cent of successful entrepreneurs still hold at least an undergraduate degree .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/bossceos_hype/index.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://www.brw.com.au/p/leadership/degrees_hession_fooled_entrepreneurs_GzmX8Qs7EUVMKDahdd5LCK", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/westpac-chief-gail-kelly-steps-down-to-be-replaced-by-brian-hartzer-20141112-11liy5.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:09:46.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
