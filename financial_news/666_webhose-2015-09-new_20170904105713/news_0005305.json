How we pursue risk and reward financially is relevant to life's pursuit of threats and opportunities. The first post in the series examined the value of free cash in a portfolio and how it helps investors maintain an opportunity-focused mindset. The free cash in our lives is free, unstructured time--the time we devote to self-examination, fresh pursuits, and strategic direction. The second post in the series emphasized the importance of a process, rather than outcome, approach to money management. By focusing on making sound decisions rather than making money per se, we reduce performance pressures and align ourselves with best practices. A process orientation to life means that we approach each day in the spirit of Gawande's checklists, doing the things that yield positive emotional experience, life satisfaction, productivity, and creativity--the very factors that can bring us closer to longer-term goals.In this final installment in the series, we'll examine the importance of diversification in money management and in life. While it may seem sexy to go \"all in\" and win at life's poker table, the reality is that it's the player who knows the odds and bets many, good hands that ultimately wins the lion's share of tournaments. Through diversification, we manage risks while optimizing returns. Diversification In Money Management One of the important differences between trading and portfolio management is that the former typically focuses on relatively short-term holdings of a small set of positions while the latter emphasizes longer horizon holding periods across many positions. The day trader may only trade a single asset class, managing risk by limiting the holding period of trades. The investor may hold positions across multiple stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies, balancing returns over the longer time horizon. As we move from trading to investment, diversification becomes important in avoiding the risks of ruin that result from going all in with any particular position. Research finds considerable benefits to diversified portfolios , though the benefits differ for more aggressive and conservative investors. Within asset classes (such as stock portfolios) as well as across assets, diversification offers superior risk-adjusted returns: better returns per unit of risk taken. Well-managed hedge funds take advantage of diversification by allocating capital to skilled managers who are relatively uncorrelated to one another. This smooths the return stream, allowing the funds to put more of their capital to work. If there is only one bet in the portfolio, it would be exceedingly dangerous to put all capital to work. Many diversified, positive-expectancy bets allow for efficient utilization of capital.There are important psychological benefits to diversified money management as well. The portfolio managers I work with are far more able to stick with their investment ideas when there are multiple independent ideas represented in the book. When most of the eggs are in one basket, it doesn't take much of a shakeout to destabilize even the most veteran manager. In a diversified portfolio, some ideas at any time will be working; others won't. That buffer makes for relative peace of mind during times of turmoil.Alternatively, when one investment becomes the rage to the exclusion of most of the rest of the financial universe, as Josh Brown noted earlier this year with the focus on U.S. equities , returns can suffer greatly when seemingly impossible trades become excellent performers. It is precisely our limitations in predicting the future that make it wise for us to place many sound bets and allow averages to work in our favor. Diversification As A Life Principle When you think of it, life consists of myriad investments of our time and emotional capital. We invest ourselves in careers, families, communities, romantic relationships, causes, and friendships. While such diversification can be challenging and require considerable bandwidth, it also allows for superior risk-adjusted personal returns. It is much easier taking risk in one area of life--say, career--when life's other investments are stable and paying off.Conversely, a surprising number of the people I meet with as a psychologist lead rather non-diversified lives. They invest themselves heavily in a career--and little else. They immerse themselves in family, but then have little to sustain them when children leave the home. On the surface, it looks as though they lack resilience: they cannot weather career or family stresses that others seem to take in stride. The problem, however, is that all their emotional capital is at risk; that places a psychological magnifying glass on setbacks. A wealth of research in positive psychology finds that multiple factors contribute to health and life success, including engagement in meaningful activity, close relationships, positive emotional experience, and achievement. Each of these factors is a potential holding in our life portfolios, offering a unique source of positive returns . It is the diversified life that is likely to be the resilient life: We are able to weather setbacks because all of life is never set back.Once we appreciate the role of diversification in achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns, we can ask meaningful questions about the diversification of our days and weeks and the nature of the emotional investments we make. That daily schedule we fill out--and that too often runs our lives--can become a template for sound life management if it becomes a tool for diversification. Money Management And Life Management: Putting It All Together By now it should be clear to you that the three themes tackled in this series of posts converge in an important way. When we have available cash in a portfolio and a process orientation to finding opportunities, we are most likely to pounce upon sound, diversified investments as they arise. Similarly, when we sustain unstructured time and have a process orientation to maximizing our experience, we are most likely to find fresh ways to diversify our lives and add to happiness, success, and life satisfaction.Your career is an investment. Your relationships are investments. Your personal activities are investments. What returns are you achieving from these? Do these energize one another and diversify your life, or are they in conflict? Asking the questions that make you a successful money manager can be invaluable in successfully managing your life.", "external_links": ["http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/04/12/the-impossible-trade-is-working/", "https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/fimrc/papers/framework_for_assessing.pdf", "http://positivepsychologyprogram.com/perma-model/"], "published": "2015-09-08T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:40:48.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
