A forward sale is a commitment to sell at a predetermined price and date. \nBut in a statement the PBOC denied the move amounted to a capital control as it did not restrict transaction volumes and did not require approval for individual transactions. \nChinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said China will keep the currency stable and vowed to push forward making the yuan freely convertible. He also promised to allow foreign central banks to directly trade in the country's currency market. \n\"We will continue to keep the (yuan) exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level,\" he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in the Chinese city of Dalian. \nAddressing business executives attending the forum on Wednesday, Li denied China had sought a competitive devaluation to boost exports as economic growth slows. \n\"China will not want to see any currency wars,\" he said. \nThe yuan closed 0.16 percent lower against the dollar at 6.3778 on Wednesday. On Thursday, the central bank set its daily rate for the yuan 0.22 percent lower from the previous day's fix at 6.3772 to the dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:21:01.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
