I don't know if I'm going to end up in a residential aged care facility. I really don't want to think about it now and I don't know how much it's going to cost me'.\" Supplied by Ben Potter Karen Chester has peered into the morass of retirement incomes policy in Australia and doesn't like what she sees.\nThe average superannuation balance for Australians aged 65 to 74 is about $300,000 – not bad for a \"teenage\" universal super system.\nBut the median balance – held by typical 65-74 year olds – is a big fat zero.\nAnd the median is what matters, says Chester, an economist and Productivity Commissioner overseeing a series of inquiries into retirement incomes.\nThat leaves the typical retiree dependent on the age pension – not enough for the kind of lifestyle many enjoyed as workers and would like to continue in their golden years.\nYet the typical retiree is reluctant to tap into his or her largest asset – the family home – Chester told the Committee for Economic Development of Australia event nine days ago. Eighty-five per cent of retirees own their homes outright.\n\"There's an overwhelming precautionary savings habit in Australia,\" she said.\nUncertainty the main driver \"Part of that is driven by: 'I don't know how long I'm going to live. I don't know if I'm going to end up in a residential aged care facility. I really don't want to think about it now and I don't know how much it's going to cost me'.\"\nCauses include cultural pressure to pass the family home unencumbered onto the kids; incentives thanks to its exemption from the pension assets means test and capital gains tax; and \"cognitive bias\" and \"information asymmetry\" borne of confusion about choices and challenges – such as the cost of residential aged care – facing retirees.\nPrudence is ingrained in spite of the fact that people typically underestimate their longevity – women by five years, and men by three.\n(Cognitive bias is a systematic deviation from rational judgment. Information asymmetry occurs where one party to a transaction has more information than the other.)\n\"For the 85 per cent of older Aussies that own the family home it remains an illiquid assets till death do us part,\" Chester told AFR Weekend .\n'Tail wagging the dog' She told CEDA the aged pension was \"the tail wagging the dog here\". The incentives mean that bucket is not being used. \"I find that really scary.\"\nChester fears many people dying without tapping into the family home via a \"reverse mortgage\" may be making \"unintended bequests\" to their children.\nShe says more should do so to supplement their incomes but reverse mortgages got off to a bad start a decade ago with some poor products and the market remains miniature.\nNew rules have reduced abuses but the products remain costly because the market is not big enough for providers to sharpen their pencils, Chesters says.\nOnly about 1 per cent of over-65s are tapping the family home. Deloitte says the market is worth $3.7 billion, a tiny fraction of home equity held by over-65s. The average drawdown is about $70,000.\n\"They're like a supermodel,\" she says. They're not going to get out of bed unless there's a pool of capital to manage the longevity and house price risks and $3.7 billion \"ain't a pool of capital\".\nThe controversial suggestion gives an insight into the direction of the Productivity Commission's forthcoming report on Housing Decisions of Older Australians , which follows Superannuation Policy for Post-Retirement .\nInvoluntary retirees Another statistic that shocked Chester is the rate of involuntarily retired 60 to 64 year olds. Half of men and just more than a third of women in that age group are retired not through choice but because of ill health or because they've been sacked and haven't found another job.\nAt the other end of the scale are \"well-educated hopeless romantics\" – the main group who are doing well in retirement.\nA good education likely helped them earn more, work for longer, buy a family home and save for retirement. Avoiding divorce made it easier to hang onto those assets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:09:29.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
