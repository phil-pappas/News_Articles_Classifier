But Charles Evans, head of the Chicago Fed, took a far more dovish view, calling for rates to stay near zero until mid-2016.\nSeveral other Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, keeping the focus firmly on US monetary policy.\nTraders will also be closely monitoring data, including non-farm payrolls due on Friday, to gauge the strength of the economy.\nNon-interest-paying gold has lost about 4 percent this year on fears that demand could take a hit in a higher interest rate environment.\nThe rate hike fears outweighed any benefit that bullion could have received from a drop in the US dollar and equities.\nGlobal equity markets and commodities slumped on Monday, pulled lower by worry over the economic health of China and other big emerging markets.\nMarket participants have been cautious ahead of a week of key economic data, including euro zone inflation on Wednesday, Chinese industrial and service sector PMIs on Thursday and US jobs figures on Friday.\nAmong other precious metals, platinum fell to $906.50 an ounce on Tuesday, its lowest since January 2009.
