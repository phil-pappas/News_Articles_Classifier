Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington. Photo: Bloomberg\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart said while recent market volatility raised risks to the US economic and inflation outlook, he remains confident the central bank will raise interest rates this year.\n\"I put most of the decision weight on prudent risk management around recent and current market volatility,\" Lockhart said in a speech in Atlanta Monday, referring to his vote backing the Fed's decision last week to hold rates near zero. \"As things settle down, I will be ready for the first policy move on the path to a more normal interest-rate environment. I am confident the much-used phrase 'later this year' is still operative.\"\nThree regional Fed presidents - San Francisco's John Williams, St. Louis's James Bullard and Richmond's Jeffrey Lacker - argued over the weekend for lifting the central bank's key interest rate before year's end, just days after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave rates near zero.\nChair Janet Yellen, in a post-FOMC press conference on Thursday to explain the decision, cited financial market turmoil and slowing growth in China as raising doubts about the outlook for US growth and inflation. Yellen will deliver a speech on September 24 in Amherst, Massachusetts, granting her another opportunity to communicate the Fed's policy view.\nLockhart told the Buckhead Rotary Club that the Fed had achieved its desired requirement of ''further improvement in labour markets,'' but the recent volatility cast doubt on the desired ''reasonable confidence'' that inflation will return to the Fed's 2 per cent target.\n\"Even so, I have gotten comfortable enough on the inflation question to take a first step in one of the coming FOMC meetings in what will likely be an extended process of normalisation of the interest-rate environment,\" he said.\nInflation expectations appear well anchored and continuing expansion of the economy should result in tightening in labour markets, Lockhart said.\nLockhart said policy makers were focused on market volatility only because it suggests the risk of impact on the US economy.\n\"About a month ago, uncertainties loomed larger, market volatility rose, and, from a policy maker's perspective, risks to the domestic economy ratcheted up a little,\" he said. \"It's too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock to the economy or just a nervous spasm in the markets.\"\nLockhart cited slowing growth in China and concern over emerging markets amid falling commodities prices as causes of the volatility. The direct impact of China on the US doesn't appear large, he said.\n\"My summary assessment is that the sources of uncertainty that fuelled financial market volatility represent a modest risk to our economy, but a risk factor nonetheless,\" he said.\nMost FOMC participants expect a rate increase this year, according to their forecasts released last week. Investors are less persuaded the central bank will follow through. Trading in federal funds futures indicates a 20 per cent probability of a rate increase at the October 27-28 FOMC meeting and 49 per cent chance of an increase by the gathering on December 15-16.\nWhile US unemployment has fallen to 5.1 per cent, close to the Fed's estimate of full employment, inflation remains far from the goal. The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation has remained under its 2 per cent target since April 2012 and rose 0.3 per cent in the year through July.\nThe Fed has kept its benchmark policy rate near zero since December 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:06:08.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
