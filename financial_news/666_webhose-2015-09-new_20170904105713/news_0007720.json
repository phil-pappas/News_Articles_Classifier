The site, owned and operated by Suez, will supply the UK's largest cement kiln with a direct replacement for fossil fuels, manufactured using locally-sourced rubbish. \nThe site can handle up to 300,000 tonnes of residual waste each year, with nearly 70 percent coming from companies in the region, and the rest from household waste. \nOne and a half tonnes of the waste will produce the same energy as one tonne of coal. At full production capacity, the plant can consume up to 40 tonnes of the waste per hour.
