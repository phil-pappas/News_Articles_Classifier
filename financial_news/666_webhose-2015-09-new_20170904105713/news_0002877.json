KSS recently announced its plans to hire more than 69,000 associates for its 1,166 stores to handle the rush during the holiday season. This year, the recruitment is about 3% higher than last year. Kohl's had hired 67,000 seasonal workers in 2014.\nThe company said it also expects to hire about 9,500 seasonal workers at its distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers and about 660 in its credit operations. The company believes that this improved staffing will help it to better serve customers during the holidays. Most positions will be filled by mid-November.\nWe note that Kohl’s intends to make the most of the upcoming holiday season in order to boost its sluggish top line. Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending is hurting sales at department stores. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company also delivered lower-than-expected earnings and sales in its recently reported second quarter fiscal 2015. Net sales fell short of expectations as customers delayed back-to-school shopping. Comps growth was marginal and was lower than the preceding quarter’s growth. Expenses were also high owing to the initiatives taken up by the company.\nRetailers are on their toes during the holiday season, flooding the markets with offers and promotions. They attract buyers with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a third of their annual sales and generates nearly 40% of their profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.\nMoreover, given the rebounding U.S. economy, the retail space is brimming with optimism and hence, retailers will leave no stone unturned to make the most of this season. A gradual recovery in the housing market and manufacturing sector, along with an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices, is favoring the economy and raising buyers’ confidence.\nLike Kohl’s, other retail bellwethers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT and Macy’s Inc. M have also announced their hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season anticipating heavy store traffic. While Macy’s plans to add 85,000 people to its workforce, Wal-Mart plans to hire 60,000 seasonal staff.\nA better-ranked stock in the related industry is Foot Locker, Inc. FL, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .
