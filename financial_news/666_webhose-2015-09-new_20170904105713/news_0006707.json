Supplied Share on twitter by Angus Grigg\nIt's set to be the most expensive apartment ever offered in Shanghai at $44 million and comes amid a mini-boom in Chinese luxury property which is defying the recent stock market turmoil and slowing economy.\nThe penthouse apartment in the down-town Xintiandi area, complete with roof garden and private swimming pool, is being pre-marketed at 250,000 yuan ($55,000) per square metre.\nWhile the overall price is never advertised in China, the 800 square metre, seven-bedroom duplex will cost the eventual buyer 200 million yuan ($44 million).\nThe display apartment at Shui On Land's new Shanghai development where the penthouse is priced at $44 million photo: supplied Supplied \"Wow that's up there on the aggressive side,\" said Michael Cole, the founder of real estate information provider, Mingtiandi when told about the price. \"That is really going to test the market.\"\nIf the asking price is achieved it will be at the very top end of sales across mainland China, putting Shanghai's luxury apartment market on a similar level to Sydney, but well below London and New York.\nBooming at the top It comes at a time when the data suggests Chinese property is recovering, while luxury sales are booming.\nThe display apartment at Shui On Land's new Shanghai development where the penthouse is priced at $44 million photo: supplied Supplied In the first six months of the year 230 luxury properties (over 100,000 yuan per square metre) were sold across China, according to real estate consulting firm Tospur. That is 1.6 times the number sold during all of 2014.\nThis surge in buying has been attributed to investors pulling cash out of the volatile share market earlier in the year and putting it into high end property, which is perceived as a safer bet.\nHong Kong listed developer Shui On Land is betting this trend will continue, when it begins selling its super-luxury Shanghai project in November.\nThe eight tower, 301 apartment complex, is the latest phase of its Lakeville development which has consistently set price records across Shanghai.\nThe cheapest apartment in phase four will sell for around 50 million yuan ($11 million) or 250,000 per square metre. For this buyers will get three bedrooms and a study, across 200 square metres.\nThe Shui On Land development is slightly more expensive than apartments in Sydney's \"Pacific Bondi Beach\" which have sold for around $50,000 per square metre.\nBut this recent record is set to be beaten by the Wanda Group's Circular Quay development in the old Goldfields House and the apartments in Crown Group's new Sydney Casino.\nNothing on London and NYC These prices, while still heady, put Sydney and Shanghai well below the top prices achieved in London and New York.\nIn 2014, British Land Co sold apartments in Mayfair for around $100,000 per square metre, while Manhattan's One57 development, dubbed the \"billionaire building\", is selling for around $103,000 per square metre.\n\"The big thing for London and New York is the liquidity of the market,\" said Mr Cole.\n\"I don't believe Shanghai property is the compelling story it was five years ago, especially given the currency risk and difficulty of repatriating funds.\"\nMr Cole said in previous years the super rich from Hong Kong and Singapore have bought property on the Chinese mainland, but they are not in the market any more.\nThe broader Chinese property market has seen a modest bounce over the last four months, as state-owned banks loosened credit requirements for home buyers and the government eased restrictions on the purchase of second homes.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics said new home prices rose in 35 cities across China in August, while prices were down in 25 and unchanged in ten.\n\"The structural problem of oversupply may have eased slightly with better sales and lower housing starts, but it is still far from resolved and high inventory pressures persist,\" said Nomura in a note to clients.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-23T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:10:04.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
