At the top of all TLDs is .COM, with other country specific TLDs such as .CO, .IO, .ME and .TV also gaining traction. But, even with other TLDs available, .COMs remain the Park Place and Boardwalk of internet real estate, with all the others relegated to the likes of Baltic Avenue. Sector specific TLDs \nCreating a change in the TLD structure, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) opened up a bidding process for the creation of new strings of TLDs. The new application of names ushered in an expansion of available TLDs such as .GURU, .CLUB and the aforementioned .XYZ. It all created the opportunity for sector specific names for people to choose TLDs that better fit their business. \nAs an example, a law firm can now replace a long URL like DavisandJonesLaw.com, with DandJ.Lawyers, or a cybersecurity could grab Cyber.Technology for their domain. Overall, with the lack of available .COMs, the new TLDs provide an entirely new way for companies to brand themselves on the internet. \nNot to be excluded, the forex and trading sector will soon see the availability of new TLDs that can be used for branding purposes within the industry. .FOREX and .CFD \nGetting launched in phases starting in October, are new TLDs from BostonIvy , a newly formed Domain Name Registry (DNR) backed by IG. Having bid to grab an assortment of trading related TLDs, Boston Ivy are bringing to market the .FOREX, .BROKER, .TRADING, .SPREADBETTING and .CFD TLDs. \nSpeaking with Finance Magnates, BostonIvy explained that they became a DNR and will manage the database and registrar information for these new TLDs. Like other domains, the new ones will be available for purchase through third-party registrars such as Network Solutions, 101Domain and MarkMonitor. Based on the TLD, registration costs using the new domains will start at $58 and top at over $1000 for the .FOREX TLD. \nAs they begin to market the new TLDs, BostonIvy believes that they provide a unique method for brokers and trading related firms to distinguish their brands. As part of this belief, BostonIvy will be partially banking on that more firms like Google will take up the brand new TLDs, which would be expected to increase overall awareness for the .COM alternatives and create more demand for domains with .FOREX or .BROKER in their URL.
