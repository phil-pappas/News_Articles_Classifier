GSAM, which supervises nearly $1.2 trillion in assets, is part of an investor group represented by law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and by investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc., the people said.\nGetty, which is controlled by Carlyle, is seeking to raise between $50 million and $100 million of new debt as it attempts to bulk up its flagging stock-photo business, people with knowledge said earlier this week. The company said during a private conference call in July that this part of its business continued to struggle this year while other segments improved, people told Bloomberg.\nGSAM, the largest publicly listed holder of the notes, owned $81 million of the unsecured obligations, according to the latest data available compiled by Bloomberg.\nRepresentatives for New York-based GSAM, Seattle-based Getty, Washington-based Carlyle and Los Angeles-based Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. A spokesman for Akin Gump didn’t immediately provide comment.\nThe bondholders want confidential talks between their advisers and Getty executives to discuss how to organize a swap and structure the new debt, the people said. The investors already signaled that they would seek to add a debt exchange while raising fresh capital, people with knowledge said earlier this week.\nThe bonds, $550 million of 7 percent notes due October 2020, fell 2.8 cents to 33 cents on the dollar at 4:42 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The secured debt Getty plans to raise would outrank the bonds.\nGetty, which doesn’t disclose its business performance or corporate actions publicly, hired Guggenheim Securities LLC in August to explore a debt deal, people with knowledge said last month. Anthony Lacavaro, a spokesman for New York-based Guggenheim, didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:38:18.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
