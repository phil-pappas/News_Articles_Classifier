Accolade Wines is also selling its 50pc stake to Conviviality and both shareholders have entered into a 10-year non-exclusive supply contract. \nThe deal, which is classed as a reverse takeover due to Conviviality Retail’s smaller market value, is being funded by a £130m share placing and a £80m drawdown of the group’s debt facilities. \nThe placing, which is being handled by Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) and Zeus Capital, has a price of 150p a share, a 3.2pc discount to Conviviality’s closing price on July 8 before shares were suspended. \n“We are pleased to have reached agreement on the acquisition of Matthew Clark as this will accelerate our strategy of expanding our wholesaling expertise into new markets and channels,” said Diana Hunter, chief executive of Conviviality. \n“Matthew Clark has a leading position in the independent on-trade market, complementing Conviviality's position in the off-trade, and the team bring significant on-trade wholesaling expertise and an unrivalled portfolio of high quality and loyal customers.” \nConviviality shares were trading up 37.7p, or 24.4pc to 192.75p, while Punch Tavern shares were up 3.88p, or 3.18pc, to 125.8p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:43:35.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
