Simple as that.”\n“The allegation that Narendra Modi ought to be viewed with suspicion, if not disdain, by business leaders in Silicon Valley because of surveillance implications in the Digital India initiative seems a desperate ploy rather than any genuine concern for India,” the petition says.\nMeanwhile, the academicians also expressed their “surprise” at the presumption that only science and technology experts pay attention to the effects of technology on society, since the questions of digital society and freedom require attention by scholars in other fields as well.\n“Digital Humanities initiatives, for instance, illustrate the ways some of us actively think about the relationship between technology and society,” they wrote.\nThe academicians said that historically, all technology has social, political, and ethical effects u2013 precisely because technology is so powerful and far-reaching.\n“Perspectives from our varied fields of scholarship offer crucial insights into the nature of this impact,” they said.\nHowever, they clarified that they never asked Silicon Valley companies not to invest in India, but their statement last month was to raise awareness and debate about the various policies of the Modi government.\n“We did not send our statement to Silicon Valley CEOs. The statement is addressed to Mr. Modi’s audiences in Silicon Valley, which includes Silicon Valley industries,” the academicians, a significant majority of whom are Indian- Americans, said in a statement posted on the Academe Blog of American Association of University Professors.\n“We did not ask Silicon Valley companies not to invest in India; we asked them to consider carefully the terms of partnership with India. The objective of our letter is to raise awareness and debate in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, of Mr. Modi’s record on key issues related to ‘Digital India’,” it said.\nThe statement, written by scholars almost all of whom are of humanities and arts background, has since generated heated debate in the academic circles, many of them questioning motives behind writing such a letter before the Silicon Valley visit of the Narendra Modi, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in decades.\nThe petition says the academicians offer “no evidence for their claim, and neglect to mention that the Indian government has been pursuing several digital initiatives long before Narendra Modi assumed office, a fact that never bothered them when the UPA government, with which several US-based South Asian academics have had close ties of patronage and privilege, was in power”.\nIn their petition, Juluri and others have alleged that it is Modi who has been a victim of assault of academic freedom.\n“For all their talk about assaults on academic freedom, the signatories of the anti-Modi letter have never reflected on the possibility that the subject of the greatest censorship and distortion in South Asian academics in recent years might well have been Narendra Modi.\n“Just a few years ago, Modi was effectively prevented from addressing by videoconference students and faculty at UPenn (University of Pennsylvania) because of a campaign similar to the present one,” the petition said.\nIt went on to add that “the only effective (if invisible) restrictions on free speech and academic freedom that exist today are the ones that silence those scholars, writers and concerned citizens who have dared to question the South Asianist academy’s institutionalised Hinduphobia and disdain for facts”.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 8:32 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:32:54.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
