Between 1962 and 1968, export crops were the country's main foreign exchange earner. \nAccording to Forbes, the country was number one globally in palm oil exports, well ahead of Malaysia and Indonesia, and exported 47 percent of all groundnuts, putting it ahead of the US and Argentina. \nBut its status as an agricultural powerhouse started to decline steeply. While Nigeria once provided 18 percent of the global production of cocoa, second in the world in the 1960s, that figure went down to 8 percent after the introduction of oil. \nWell, farmers then relied on the Government to offer seeds and fertilizer but then the government's reliance on a corrupt system resulted in the siphoning off of billions of dollars and a small percentage of farmers actually receiving the inputs. \nIt is as a result of this that the then Minister of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Nigeria, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina oversaw the introduction of a first of its kind Electronic Wallet (\"e-wallet\") System in 2012 through which subsidized electronic vouchers for inputs were delivered directly to the farmers' mobile phones and then the vouchers were used like cash to purchase the inputs directly from agro-dealers. \nWith support from the Nigerian national government and state governments and in partnership with others in the private sector, Cellulant, a technology business in the mobile and digital services' sector in Africa that operates a payments ecosystem connecting financial sector customers, Mobile Network Operators and businesses to their increasingly mobile consumers, spent the last two and half years developing a mobile wallet network that extends to tens of thousands of villages and some eight million farmers. \nOf these, approximately three quarters are active users of this digital financial service receiving direct subsidies that cut the cost of fertilizer by 50 percent. This is a contrast to an earlier, non-digital scheme that began in 2011, which despite upwards of $180 million in government spending failed to make a dent in smallholder farmers' production costs. \nDubbed as Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GES) the system helps ensure that farmers can access subsidies directly, using mobile phones as a platform to conduct basic transactions and make payments. Going far to show how mobile technology can impact Government operations and boost economic growth. \nThe eWallet system went live in all but one state in Nigeria and by 2014 had over 1,000 agro-dealers registered on the system 1.2 million farmers have also received inputs via their eWallets while 14.5 million farmers are registered on the system, with 7.1 million farmers receiving inputs using their eWallets a farming tip information alert service is also piloted \n\"The e-wallet system has had an impact to the Nigerian economy which was an estimated 30- 40billion to GDP and helped drop the food import bill from $16bn in 2011 to $4bn in 2014 this is how we transformed agriculture, the lives of individuals and in no small measure positively impacted the fortunes of the country, through mobile technology.\" said Bryan Kariuki, CEO at Cellulant Kenya, \"We also plan to work with the Kenyan Government and maybe adopt the same system in Kenya and other countries across the continent where we have a presence in.\" \nCellulant was founded in 2003. \"We saw an opportunity to build a world class business in Africa and to transform our customers through mobile technology. What was a 2-man start-up in 2003, has turned into a company that builds and operates mobile commerce ecosystems. We run Africa's leading mobile commerce network connecting 33 mobile operators, 41 of Africa's largest banks and some of the leading corporates in East Africa,\" added Mr. Kariuki. \nCellulant's ecosystem powers mobile services ranging from mobile banking, mobile payments, branchless banking, micro-insurance, music downloads, mobile information services and sector outreach programs. \nCellulant has its operations and transformational services for customers across 10 countries which include Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Rwanda & Uganda. Cellulant has also worked with UBA, Intercontinental, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Standard Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank across some of those countries.
