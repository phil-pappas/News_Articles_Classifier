(NasdaqGS: SCOR). Under the terms of the agreement, Rentrak shareholders will only receive 1.15 shares of comScore for each share owned. Based on the closing price of SCOR before the deal was announced, the consideration is valued at $49.63, which is significantly lower than the 52-week high and significantly lower than at least one analyst’s estimated value of $100.00 per share. \nIf you are an affected investor, and you want to learn more about the investigation or if you have information that you believe would be helpful to our investigation of the fairness of the proposed transaction, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com , Patrick Powers at Powers Taylor LLP via e-mail at shareholder@powerstaylor.com or by calling toll free at (877) 728-9607. There is no cost or fee to you. \nThe investigation centers on whether Rentrak’s Board of Directors is acting in the shareholders’ best interests, whether the board considered alternatives to the acquisition, and whether the board has employed an adequate process to review and act on the proposed transaction. Notably, at least one analyst with Yahoo! Finance believes the true inherent value of the stock could be as high as $100.00. \nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation and shareholder rights advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters. \nPowers Taylor LLP is a boutique litigation law firm that handles a variety of complex business litigation matters, including claims of investor and stockholder fraud, shareholder oppression, shareholder derivative suits, and security class actions. \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150930006682/en/ \nCompany Legal & Law Matters Patrick Powers Contact: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 877-728-9607\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com \nor\nPowers Taylor LLP\nPatrick Powers, 877-728-9607\nshareholder@powerstaylor.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:09:53.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
