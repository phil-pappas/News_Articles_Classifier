Before the opening bell, women's fashion brand Vera Bradley will report numbers; in the afternoon, we expect earnings from discount retailer Five Below after the market close. \nPhiladelphia-based Five Below operates about 360 stores in the U.S. and sells products ranging from fashion accessories to school supplies, mostly targeting pre-teens and teens. All of the products are priced at $5 or less. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015, analysts forecast earnings of $0.13 a share on revenue of $184.69 million. TheStreet's Jim Cramer is paying close attention, as Five Below posted strong earnings results last quarter. \"I expect the stock to be brought down hard ... it's a great buy ahead of Halloween.\" He also added, \"I think the risk is very low, you put half on before [earnings], and then half on after.\" \nOn the economics calendar, the ADP employment report will be released at 8:15 a.m. ET, showing us how many jobs the private sector added in August. Forecasters expect the number to be approximately 210,000 jobs. Next, at 8:30 a.m. we'll get the productivity and costs report, which measures the growth of labor efficiency in producing goods and services. Additionally, the factory orders report is set to be released at 10 a.m. Last, the Beige Book, which will be released at 2 p.m., will analyze economic activity and conditions.
