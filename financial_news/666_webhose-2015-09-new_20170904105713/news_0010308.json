China markets will be closed for the remainder of the week for holidays.\nMeanwhile, Oil prices fell in Asia today followed a mixed US petroleum report that showed an increase in reserves but a dip in production.\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell 45 cents to USD 45.80 while Brent crude for October slipped 38 cents to USD 50.12 in late-morning trade.\nThe benchmark BSE Sensex ended higher by 311.22 points or 1.22 per cent today. Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said: “Today also Rupee traded range bound and eventually depreciated by almost 5 paise for the day to close at 66.24. FIIâ€™s selling in the market has dented the Rupee movement… yesterday also FIIâ€™s were the net sellers of Rs 1,573.42 crore.”\n“Taking cues from this, rupee traded weak and overlooked the positive closing of local equities which supported the rupee against dollar. The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 65.80 to 66.60,” he said\nIn forward market today, premium for dollar fell on fresh receivings from exporters.\nThe benchmark six-month premium payable in February fell to 207.5-209 paise from 213.75-214.25 paise previously and far forward August 2016 also moved down to 426-427.5 paise from 433-434 paise.\nThe RBI fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 66.2280 and for the Euro at 74.3343.\nThe rupee dropped against the pound sterling to close at 101.17 from 101.08 while firmed up further against the euro to 74.37 from 74.52 previously.\nIt also inched up further against the Japanese currency to finish at 55.11 per 100 yen from 55.12 yesterday.\n 03, 2015 9:52 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:02:07.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
