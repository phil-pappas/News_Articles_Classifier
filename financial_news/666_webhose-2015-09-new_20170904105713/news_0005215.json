High deductible plans have many advantages, especially for Millennials and Gen X-ers who rarely go to the doctor because they are healthy and do not rely on many prescription drugs. The catch is that the out-of-pocket costs might prove to be a surprise for consumers who don’t budget for meeting the higher deductible. \n“If they’re young and healthy, a high deductible plan may be a good fit,\" said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. “Shoppers who come to these plans in pursuit of lower premiums don’t always understand what they’re getting themselves into.” More Headlines The Top High Tech Hotels Around the World \nBenefits of Buying a High Deductible Plan \nSaving money each month is critical for many consumers who are healthy and would rather allocate the extra money toward paying down their student or auto loans or stashing the money away for a rainy day if an emergency arises. \nThe monthly savings can also be allocated toward a Health Savings Account (HSA) , which provides the same tax advantages as an IRA . Only people who have a high deductible plan can open an HSA account at a bank or credit union. The plan must have an annual deductible of $1,300 for individual coverage or $2,600 for a family , according to the IRS. The maximum amount of the contribution is $3,350 for individuals and $6,650 for families. \nThe HSAs can cover certain medical expenses and many common ones include prescription medications, doctor and dentist visits and eyeglasses. Contributions to an HSA are not subject to federal income taxes and can be invested like an IRA. The advantage of HSAs is that any unused funds roll over each year and any remaining money can be used for retirement after the age of 65. \nConsumers who opted to purchase coverage on the public health insurance exchanges are especially good candidates since most of the purchased plans, including silver and bronze plans under Obamacare are high deductible plans. \n“You fund it ahead of time, which means you will get a discount for any medical procedures you need in the future, said Laura Adams, insuranceQuotes.com’s senior analyst said. “It can add up to some substantial savings.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:44:31.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
