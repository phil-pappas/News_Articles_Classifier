Louise Kennerley by Jonathan Barrett Western Australian Treasurer Mike Nahan​ has warned that there are difficult economic times ahead for the resources-rich state, despite a modest improvement in its financial standing.\nIn its annual report on finances released on Thursday, the state recorded an operating deficit of $431 million in 2014-15, representing its first deficit in 15 years and a hit to Liberal Premier Colin Barnett's pledge to never preside over a budget deficit.\nBut the report was an improvement on the $1.3 billion deficit forecast for last financial year , with the result attributed to savings measures including restricting public sector wage increases to inflation and a $499 million grant from the Commonwealth to offset the state's falling share of GST revenue.\nIn a frank assessment of the state's financial position, Mr Nahan​ said iron ore prices appeared to be \"stuck\".\n\"We are seeing very slow growth in our revenue,\" he said. \"Where we forecast in the budget last time is where we are going. I'm just telling people like it is.\"\nThe western state has forecast a $2.7 billion deficit for this financial year, with a return to surplus in 2017-18.\nThe iron ore spot price, which helps determine the amount of iron ore royalty income earned by the state, is less than $US60 a tonne, or one-third its 2011 high.\nThe Liberal government has found the costs of major works are dropping in the post-boom economy, which has led to significant savings in its asset-investment program.\n Nothing to be proud of Shadow treasurer Ben Wyatt said the government had nothing to be proud of in delivering a deficit or creating cost savings linked to a weakening economy.\n\"The fact that they think a slowing economy is good for the economy, well, that says everything,\" Mr Wyatt said.\n\"There's no pride to be taken in delivering this result.\"\nThe state's net debt to revenue ratio – a key measure used by credit rating agencies to assess a state's financials – improved in 2014-15 from an anticipated 67.9 per cent to 61.4 per cent.\nThis measure is forecast to blow out to more than 80 per cent this financial year, which has put the state at risk of a second rating downgrade, having already lost its AAA rating in 2013.\nThe state of the books has made it problematic for Western Australia to capitalise fully on favourable borrowing conditions , which the civil construction industry is urging the government to access.\nIn a report released this week by BIS Shrapnel, commissioned by the Civil Contractors Federation (CCF), the research house said the cost of finance was at historic lows and there was significant industry capacity in the state after the resources boom.\n\"Debt levels for both the state and federal governments, while higher than they once were, are still very low compared to international peers and do not prohibit further borrowing for productive purposes,\" the report said.\nBIS Shrapnel forecasts that civil construction activity – which includes roads, bridges, pipelines, drainage, ports and utilities – has begun a four-year decline in activity, where work will decrease by nearly $12 billion a year in Western Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:01:41.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
