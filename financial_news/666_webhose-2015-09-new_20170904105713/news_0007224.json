It’s expensive. \nIn 2012 alone, Ex-Im authorized $36 billion in loans, guarantees, and insurance. The bank can carry a portfolio of up to $150 billion, meaning that taxpayers could be on the hook that much money.\n2. It doesn’t boost U.S. exports. \nAccording to the Mercatus Center ’s Veronique de Rugy, Ex-Im’s favored firms account for around 2 percent of the total dollar value of American exports and 2 percent of the jobs associated with exports.\n3. It’s crony capitalism at its most obvious. \nAlthough Ex-Im’s defenders like to claim the bank levels the international playing field for small U.S. companies, virtually all of the agency ’s resources go to supporting giant, politically connected firms such as Boeing, General Electric, Caterpillar, and John Deere. The American taxpayer shouldn’t be subsidizing their market share at home or abroad.\nThe new House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, has said he is against reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. He’s joined by representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle who are offended by the uselessness and cronyism of Ex-Im.\nHopefully, this is one New Deal–era policy that will finally disappear for good.\nAbout 2 minutes.
