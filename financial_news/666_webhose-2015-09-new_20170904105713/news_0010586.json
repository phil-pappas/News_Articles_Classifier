The government is trying to crack down on traders seeking to deliberately drive shares lower.\nCredit Suisse global head of foreign exchange strategy Shahab Jalinoos attributed the Australian dollar's fall to a \"risk off\" trading day in global markets and the Reserve Bank of Australia's commentary about softness in China.\n\"There are still downside risks to Australia from external sources which is probably a negative for the currency,\" Mr Jalinoos said.\nShare indexes on Wall Street fell almost 3 per cent on Tuesday. Commodity currencies like the South African rand, Mexican peso, Brazillian real and Canadian dollar were also sold off.\nChina is Australia's largest trading partner and a big buyer of mining commodities including iron ore and coal.\nAustralia's current account deficit blew out to $19 billion in the June quarter , from $13.5 billion.\nIron ore exports fell 8 per cent - or by $1.6 billion - in the June quarter, with volumes down 2 per cent and prices down 6 per cent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.

Economic activity in Japan and South Korea was also weaker than expected.\nSouth Korea said on Tuesday that its exports had fallen 14.7 per cent in August, the most in six years.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia kept the overnight interest rate steady at 2 per cent on Tuesday .\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens noted there had been \"some further softening\" in conditions in China and east Asia of late, but stronger US growth.\nThe Australian dollar was little changed soon after the decision was announced on Tuesday afternoon in Sydney, trading at US71.40¢, before the plunge overnight.", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2015/mr-15-15.html"], "published": "2015-09-02T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:14:53.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
