Site engineers are paying greater attention to detail, shop floor operators are gaining better insight into factors that drive key performance indicators and site managers are providing regular coaching. The site has also driven down water usage by 27% over the past two years. This has been an essential goal to demonstrate GGBL’s commitment to the environment and its surrounding communities, given the site is situated in a water-stressed region. \nBenjamin Hanson, Site Lead of the PPMS programme, added, ‘this transformation has been made possible through consistent operator behavioral change. The engineering team has been challenged to focus on using the PPMS tools & techniques in resolving issues to achieve their objectives. This performance has raised the game and we are looking forward to greater results in this financial year. \nPreba Greenstreet, Corporate Relations Director of GGBL said, ”we are very proud of this achievement especially in these challenging economic times. GGBL is continuously looking for the most efficient and sustainable ways of doing business to improve our business performance.” \nDiageo reported strong progress against its 2015 sustainability and responsibility targets with the publication in its 2015 Annual Report, which for the second year integrates its performance in this area alongside financial reporting. \nDiageo made notable gains in its improvement in water efficiency, reduction of carbon emissions and sourcing of local raw materials as the company now looks towards its ambitious 2020 targets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:06:37.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
