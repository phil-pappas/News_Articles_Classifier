Only time will tell. Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Anne Hyland The powerful brand of the country's second ranked free-to-air television network Nine is inseparable from that of its talented chief executive David Gyngell.\nSo what would happen to that brand if Gyngell were to depart? The chatter that won't go away in the bitchy Australian television industry, and among fund managers, is that Gyngell has his eye on the exit door.\nHe's had a rollercoaster five years as chief executive of what's now called Nine Entertainment Company. He was central to saving the television network from bankruptcy. He guided the company through its listing on the stockmarket and has been making gains on arch rival, the Seven Network.\nIt's been a hard slog, although Gyngell has been rewarded handsomely for it, pocketing at least $20 million.\nThe difference a year makes The last 12 months, however, have been particularly challenging. During this time Gyngell, 48, has copped flack for selling shares a few weeks prior to an unexpected earnings downgrade, which prompted an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Gyngell, who is the company's largest individual shareholder, was cleared by ASIC but he was still heavily criticised.\nThe release of the earnings downgrade late on the Friday of the Queen's birthday weekend also raised eyebrows, as did the decision to write down the value of Nine's television licence from $1.7 billion to $1 billion – 20 months after the previous valuation.\nMorgan Stanley's analyst Andrew McLeod wrote in a note to clients that the writedown was a negative because it confirmed the television industry's structural decline, as more audiences watch TV online or through streaming devices.\n Fusion Strategy's Steve Allen, who has analysed the advertising and media industry for two decades, is more blunt: \"The size of the write-down of these licences in a newly floated business and the speed at which they wrote it down after the IPO raises a serious question.\"\nWhile those are the challenges there have also been wins for Gyngell in the past year. He sold events business Nine Live for $640 million, signed the $925 million National Rugby League deal for sporting television rights, and Nine is winning the ratings battle lately.\nOzTam says Nine has won 11 weeks of prime time ratings (6pm-10.30pm) to August 29, which has prompted much chest beating over at the network. When Nine's other channels are also included, GO! and GEM, it has rated No. 1 in that period.\nBut even those positives haven't quelled speculation about Gyngell's future at the company.\nA long-term Gyngell friend, who wouldn't be named, says: \"I think Gyngell would like to be doing something else.\"\nSome analysts, fund managers and Nine Entertainment Company staff are also talking of his departure.\n\"I think Gyngell is on the way out,\" says veteran fund manager Peter Morgan. \"He's done his job getting the company listed. You've got a possible management change there and that may have an impact.\"\nFrom October 1, Gyngell's contract requires that he give one year's notice should he wish to depart. When contacted by AFR Weekend Gyngell declined to comment.\nHard to replace talent Allen, from Fusion Strategy, says Gyngell has that rare intuition in television programming, which he's only seen elsewhere in David Leckie and the late Kerry Packer. \"It'll be a sad day and a dangerous day for shareholders when David Gyngell doesn't renew his contract and retires because their ability to attract a similar talent is not going to be great because they're very rare talents.\"\nBut he adds: \"The trouble is he got too rich too quickly. He doesn't have to work in the business. He's made a lot of money out of this IPO and he deserved it.\"\nThe talk of Gyngell's departure raises the obvious question of who would replace him?\nFund managers and analysts don't expect the board would tap either Peter Wiltshire, Nine's group sales and marketing director, or chief operating officer Simon Kelly. The next rung down is Darren Wick, Nine's director of news and current affairs, who's put Nine back in the No. 1 spot in this genre after it had lost that mantle to Seven. And there's also Michael Healy, director of television at Nine.\nThe problem with the television industry is that it attracts dominant personalities, such as Kerry Packer and David Leckie, who have a habit of eating their young rather than nursing up and coming talent. It's why there are often succession vacuums.\nIt's also an industry that requires a particular skill set – it's in the entertainment business – and that can't be tapped from an executive who might have worked in banking or the building products industry.\nOne outsider who is rated with a chance at replacing Gyngell is Ian Audsley​, now chief executive of Prime Media Group, and formerly a chief operating officer at Nine.\nHowever, Audsley is more a numbers man. \"Ian's not a bad operator but he doesn't come up with original ideas,\" says one observer. \"You've got to find the rainmakers who actually come up with ideas.\"\nAnd then there is Angelos Frangopoulos​, the chief executive of Australian News Channel, which runs Sky. He's seen as more of a contender than Audsley because he's got what television veterans call \"showbiz\" about him. But Nine insiders dismiss him, saying running Sky is the same as managing NBN in Newcastle, NSW. It is a bitchy industry.\nNine's share price has fallen by 25 per cent over the past year but there are plenty willing to buy the stock because the company is offering a 8.5 per cent fully-franked dividend and is trading on a price-to-earnings per share ratio of 10 times, which is below the overall market average of 15 times. In short, value-driven fund managers see it as cheap, such as Dougal Maple-Brown, head of Australian equities at Maple-Brown Abbott, which owns Nine stock.\nGood solid stock \"The stock is on 10 times, it's got a good balance sheet, with no debt and a good dividend,\" says Maple-Brown. \"That's enough for us.\"\nThe Australian television industry is facing challenges from the online streaming providers, such as Netflix, which arrived in the Australian market determined to try and squash everything in its ecosystem.\nFusion's Allen estimates the free-to-air television industry has lost about 11 per cent of prime time viewing audience to streaming services this year.\nAnd he blames half of that 11 per cent drop on the wall-to-wall reality shows from The Block , House Rules to Restaurant Revolution , Hotplate , MasterChef , The Voice, The X Factor , The Great Australian Spelling Bee and The Batchelor broadcast by the three free-to-air networks.\nLaurence Freedman, a former Network Ten director and fund manager, doesn't see any value in old media and says that streaming services, whether through Netflix, Apple TV or Crackle, are changing the industry permanently. The free-to-air networks have also launched their own streaming services, such as Stan, which Nine has in a joint venture with Fairfax Media, and Seven's Presto.\n\"It's a no-win game,\" says Freedman. \"It's a little bit like the carriage manufactures fighting Henry Ford with his model T. The industry is being disrupted.\"\nBut calling the death of television is probably too soon. The industry still draws almost $3 billion in annual advertising and its sports programming is one of its biggest audience draws.\nAnd that perhaps explains why Nine paid $925 million for its sports rights deal with the NRL, which delivered it an additional 100 hours of prime time programming on top of the games it already broadcast. It will also be broadcasting the Rugby Union World Cup.\nSome analysts and fund managers have criticised Nine for overpaying in the NRL deal but the flipside to that criticism – and one straight out of the Rupert Murdoch playbook – is what would the cost have been to Nine's earnings had it not done the deal?\nJust how long Gyngell will be around to see how that NRL sports deal pays off remains to be seen.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/newsandimages", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/113603699450999731037"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:08:21.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
