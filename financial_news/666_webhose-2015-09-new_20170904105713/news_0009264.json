The surprise resignations come as United is the subject of a federal investigation into whether the airline gave preferential treatment to leaders of the agency that operates New York-area airports. \nMunoz has been on the board of Continental Airlines since 2004, coming over to United as part of the two airlines' 2010 merger. He formerly served as president and chief operating officer of railroad CSX . United's lead independent director, Henry L. Meyer III, was named non-executive chairman of the airline. \nThe resignations come as prosecutors continue to look into David Samson , the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, including whether United began a direct flight from its Newark hub to Columbia, S.C., where Samson has a summer home, to gain influence with the airport head. Even without the probe, Smisek was an unpopular figure among United workers, customers and increasingly among shareholders. The exec was well regarded as CEO of Continental and took the top spot at United as part of the 2010 merger, but has come under criticism for operational woes and his inability to fully integrate the two carriers. Shares of United over the past five years have generated about half the return of rival Delta Air Lines , and analysts have worried the company is falling behind once-bankrupt American Airlines Group as that company integrates its merger with US Airways Group . Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said in a note the management change \"will bring a different perspective to a company with significant earnings potential\" but which has lagged rivals in terms of multiple expansion and earnings power. Smisek had been a target of union grumbling, with pilot leaders in recent months calling for the CEO to be replaced due to United's operational issues and complaints about the airline's treatment of workers. All of the United's major unions issued statements welcoming the change in leadership, with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers saying they enjoyed a strong relationship with Munoz while he was with CSX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:52:56.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
