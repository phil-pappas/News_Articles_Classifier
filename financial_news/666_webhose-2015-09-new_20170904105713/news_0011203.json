Shaban, on behalf of the forum said, 'In view of all the above enumerated facts and practical realities on the ground, we would, with due respect, appeal to the government, through your good offices to stop any attempt at imposing any additional tax, levy or charge in the name of revenue mobilization for national development.' \n'We also appeal to government to ensure that all the agencies in the value chain respect all pending and outstanding transactions during the transitional resumption period of customs.' \nBY Melvin Tarlue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:40:26.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
