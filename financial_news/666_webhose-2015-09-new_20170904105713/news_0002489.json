( www.peaxy.net ), a software provider that enables data access and supports advanced analytics across the enterprise, today announced it has closed $15 million in Series B funding. The investment, which was made by a number of luminaries including Federico Faggin , brings the total investment in Peaxy to $32 million since it was founded in 2012. \"Enterprises are discovering that data access is vital to enabling greater productivity, innovation and new business models.  Companies in a variety of industries such as aviation, automotive, genomics and energy stand to benefit greatly by addressing the fundamental data access challenges they all face,\" said Manuel Terranova , President and CEO of Peaxy. \"This funding provides additional resources to expand our platform features and commercial efforts into a wider range of industrial and life sciences customers,\"  said Francesco Lacapra , CTO and VP Engineering.\nPeaxy software makes it possible for enterprises to find, mine, manage and reuse the growing volume of data assets that enterprises generate.  Customers today use various tools including Hadoop to extract additional value from their data. Peaxy software ensures they have a way to trace back to the original information. \"This is one way we enable new data-centric business models for our customers, such as predictive maintenance and accelerated drug discovery,\" said Terranova.\nAccording to Svetlana Sicular , Research Director at Gartner, \"Many organizations are at the point where they figured out how to get the data in Hadoop, but not how to get the data out and derive value from it.
