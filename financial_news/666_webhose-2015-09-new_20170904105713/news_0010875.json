They purchased the Oakleigh IGA for $3 million prior to auction and snapped up Gisborne Foodworks for $7 million.\nOverseas investors were looking for secure, income-producing investments, Mr Wizel said.\nThey were also becoming more comfortable with buying in regional areas, he said.\nMr Dowers said Chinese buyers were reacting to the lower Australian dollar. The sharemarket turmoil gripping the country was likely to prompt a flight of capital, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:52:29.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
