Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nNasdaq has reported its trading volumes and metrics for the month ending August 2015, which showed an uptick across its global equities business, according to a Nasdaq statement. \nLast month, Nasdaq’s July 2015 figures showed an uneven performance across its global business , underpinned by sagging volumes and largely a summer lull that was by and large its worst performance of the year. \nFor the month ending in August 2015 however, Nasdaq once again managed to right the ship and build on last month’s weak performance by reporting a figure of 88.0 million contracts, up 12.8% MoM from 78.0 million contracts in July 2015. The growth is congruent across a yearly timeframe as well, with August 2015 representing a similar rise of 12.8% YoY from 78.0 million contracts in August 2014. \nEquity derivatives also notched solid growth in August, climbing to 7.2 million contracts, up 7.5% MoM from 6.7 million contracts in July 2015. This ascension was equidistant over a yearly timetable, which was similarly good for a jump of 7.5% YoY from August 2014. \nFICC Business Shows Mixed Results \nAugust 2015’s results were rather stagnant at Nasdaq’s Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities business. US Fixed income volume (in billion USD traded) saw $2,601 for the month ending August 2015. This corresponds to a tepid drop of -2.3% MoM from $2,661 in July 2015. \nIn terms of European fixed income, August 2015 yielded soared to 2.5 million contracts, or 25.0% MoM from just 2.0 million contracts in July 2015. \nLate last month, Nasdaq unveiled a new foreign exchange (FX) trading platform , its latest bid at expanding its markets – the launch of Nasdaq’s new FX trading platform is set for 2016.
