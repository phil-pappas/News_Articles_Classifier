Investors were shaken as talks between Greece and its negotiators stalled, once again. A special Eurogroup meeting was held on Wednesday, but was unsuccessful, according to CNBC. Greece has a payment due to the International Monetary fund on June 30. Oil ended the trading day lower, settling at $60.27 per barrel. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn sold his stake in Netflix (NFLX) on Wednesday, in an announcement on Twitter. This comes after the company announced on Tuesday it will execute a 7-for-1 stock split come July 14. Plus, homebuilder Lennar (LEN), was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, after reporting second-quarter earnings per share that exceed analysts&#39; estimates by $0.15.\n3\n 0:55 \nNow watching Up next Thousands of Greeks Rally In Athens Against Austerity Before Debt Deadline \nGreek citizens held a massive rally in Athens on Sunday, urging Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to resist pressure from international creditors to accept more austerity in exchange for unlocking billions of euros in bailout funds. Singing, waving Greek flags and banners with slogans such as &quot;No to the euro&quot;, several thousand people filled the street in front of parliament. The demonstration by supporters of Tsipras&#39;s ruling Syriza party and others opposed to the euro, was the second anti-euro rally held this week in central Athens. The latest rally comes a day before a vital summit meeting in Brussels to try and break the deadlock that has left Greece on the brink of financial default.\n4\n 0:55 \nNow watching Up next Greece would Get Hammered If it Left the EU, but would Europe? \nMost economists seem fairly certain a Greek departure from the euro would be a disaster indeed. For Greece. But for the rest of Europe? Some think a Greek exit, or &quot;Grexit,&quot; would not in fact inflict serious damage on Europe&#39;s economy as it struggles to work past a crisis over too much government and bank debt. Comparing a Greek exit to the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which spread panic and deepened a global financial crisis, are misplaced, they say. Others aren&#39;t so sure. They think that while short term market turmoil might pass quickly, letting a eurozone member leave could permanently damage the 16-year old currency that&#39;s now shared by 19 countries. Meanwhile, Greece&#39;s new left-wing government is struggling to convince its international creditors that its reform plans are credible\n5\n 4:34 \nNow watching Up next Will tech unicorns impact the IPO market? \nWe continue to hear a lot of talk about the increase of unicorns—or startup-companies whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion.\n6\n 6:43 \nNow watching Up next San Francisco 2.0: Are tech millionaires changing the city for good? \nFilmmaker Alexandra Pelosi explores whether the culture of San Francisco has been permanently changed by the influx of tech entrepreneurs and what will happen when the bubble pops.\n7\n 2:38 \nNow watching Up next Whole Foods to cut 1,500 jobs \nWhole Foods is planning to cut 1,500 jobs over the next 8 weeks.\n8\n 3:07 \nNow watching Up next Trevor Noah to make Daily Show debut \nThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah premieres tonight... and while the show will be based on Comedy Central, Viacom pans to simulcast the debut across all of its networks, including VH1 and MTV.\n9\n 2:41 \nNow watching Up next Apple iPhone sales shatter record \nThe tech giant says it shattered previous first weekend sales record by moving some 13 million new phones since Friday&#39;s launch.\n10\n 4:17 \nNow watching Up next Trump unveils tax plan that would lower taxes for millions \nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is calling for an overhaul of the tax code that would eliminate income taxes for millions of Americans, while lowering them for the highest-income earners ...\nLoad More Jim Cramer has finally reached the point where he can clearly see that the main force behind the market's bear phase is not just earnings. Investors are worried about credit, specifically pertaining to high-yield bonds.\n\"If your company needs debt in order to grow, then your stock is being punished, and there is not much that can be done except to watch the carnage, wait it out, or just take a loss,\" the \"Mad Money \" host said.\nCramer cited the case of XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) , the trucking company that visited \"Mad Money\" on Friday. CEO Bradley Jacobs confirmed that while the company is doing well, the stock is hurting.\nThe reason? It's because XPO is a roll-up company. That means it is a vehicle used by the CEO to buy other companies to grow or dominate an industry. XPO recently announced the purchase of Con-way (NYSE: CNW) , a giant trucking company, for $2.72 billion. This deal was right on the back of another large acquisition by XPO; it purchased European logistics company Norbert Dentressangle (Euronext Paris: GND-FR) earlier in the year.\n\nAnd while XPO has the borrowing capacity to make both acquisitions without much stress, the market has punished the stock brutally; it's down 47 percent for the year.\nCramer marveled that a deal that would have been applauded by investors a year ago is now hated, simply because times have changed. So, the stock was pulverized.\nHowever, Cramer can see the other side of the risk coin when he looked at Olin (NYSE: OLN) , which is buying Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) 's commodity chemical business. It had to borrow at a rate of 9.75 percent last Friday in order to obtain the money to finance the deal. This interest rate was insanely high, in Cramer's opinion. In fact, it is unrealistic for most companies to pay without risking default. So, in this case, the decline in serial acquirer stocks does make sense to Cramer.\n\"I think if a company's future growth is going to rely on acquisitions and those acquisitions need debt, you have to accept that the window for cheap debt for these kinds of roll-ups is closing,\" Cramer said.

Ultimately, Cramer thinks that if XPO can manage to cut costs and get the most out of its two most recent acquisitions, then the stock will rebound like crazy.\nFor now, XPO is stock in the vortex of the most hated group on Wall Street. Investors want as little risk as possible, and unfortunately these debit-financed deals are being viewed as toxic.\nOne day they will not be viewed as toxic, but that day is not here yet.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
