It was a coup. After the death of collector Edmund de Unger (1918-2011), almost 2,000 of the seventh- through 19th-century works he acquired over some 50 years seemed destined for Berlin’s venerable Pergamon Museum. But his heirs and the museum parted ways, and the Keir collection (named after De Unger’s London home) veered west to Texas, thanks greatly to the efforts of Sabiha Al Khemir, the DMA’s senior adviser for Islamic Art.\nENLARGE Carved crystal ewer from the late 10th-early 11th century.

As the first crates arrived in the spring of 2014, the DMA displayed a single prized treasure: a flawless block of crystal that, sometime between the 970s and 1060s, artists in Egypt hollowed, shaped and carved into a ewer aswirl with reliefs. Now, in the current phase of this skillful reveal, a show of some 50 works gives us a tantalizing look at beautiful and sometimes rare ceramics, manuscripts, textiles, carved crystals and metalwork. “Spirit and Matter: Masterpieces From the Keir Collection of Islamic Art” is also a preamble to the museum’s first permanent galleries of Islamic art, scheduled to open next year with about 250 pieces on display at all times.\nThroughout this introductory exhibition, we can feel Ms. Al Khemir’s yearning to connect her audience to what might be unfamiliar art. Greeting us at the entrance is a sequence of detail shots filling a large screen. Because we can also see into the exhibition, the video is more enticement than distraction, promising rewards to those who look closely. The objects all deliver, and none more dramatically than the crystal ewer. One of only seven such works known to have survived, it sports reliefs of foliage, an imposing arabesque and two spotted cheetahs, tails raised. Ready to assist in a royal hunt, the leashed felines look heraldic and, if you lean in (preferably with a magnifying glass), you will see inside each spot, as though trapped in a drop of water, another cheetah.\nENLARGE Egyptian bowl from the 11th-12th century. Photo: The Keir Collection of Islamic Art on loan to the Dallas Museum of Art Grouped by medium, the works illustrate the variety of styles and techniques in Islamic art, while often attacking a tenacious myth. The copper-hued luster painting on an 11th- to 12th-century Egyptian bowl shows two men about to release roosters for a cockfight. The silver inlay on a 1242 brass ewer by Ahmed al-Dhaki al-Mawsili of Mosul (Iraq) portrays courtiers and Christian priests. A finely woven silk brocade (c. 1600) is decorated with a repeating scene of a man leading a prisoner through a landscape of trees. And the list goes on. Anyone who leaves the show believing Islamic art is devoid of figures has walked through with eyes closed.\nSimilarly, religious inscriptions and subjects recur throughout, but pages and manuscripts of the Koran appear only midway through the show. This placement conveys its centrality for Islamic societies. In concert with references to Egypt’s Hellenistic and Coptic heritage or Iran’s pre-Islamic literature, it also signals that Islam integrated into existing cultures.\nReligion was important, but so was science, beauty and inventive fun. A folio from a highly prized 14th-century manuscript of Iran’s national epic poem, the Shahnameh, portrays a king in sumptuous dress and rich interiors. A 13th-century botanical painting helped disseminate ancient Greek medical knowledge, while a miniature from a 1315 Egyptian or Syrian copy of the “Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices” offers a blueprint for a drinking version of spin the bottle. Open a valve and the bird whirls, whistling. It is bottoms up for whomever it points to when it stops.\nEven before “Spirit and Matter” opened, the arrival of the Keir collection had made an impact in academic circles. The long-term loan agreement impelled the recently established Edith O’Donnell Institute of Art History at the University of Texas at Dallas to create a center for Islamic art. It has since endowed a full-time professorship and is preparing to launch graduate programs and undergraduate classes at the museum. To this end, it has partnered with the DMA to build on-site study and teaching facilities for students and visiting scholars.\nMs. Al Khemir and Max Anderson, who suddenly resigned as director on Monday, have made it plain that they hope De Unger’s magnificent collection will also have an impact on interfaith and cross-cultural relations in the community at large. Can an 800-year-old tile crowded with human figures help us move beyond stereotypes? Probably not. But offering people the chance to appreciate and understand Islamic cultures through their art very well might.\nMs. Lawrence writes about Asian and Islamic art for the Journal.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CD582_kier1_JV_20150929165926.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CD583_kier2_FR_20150929172523.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:42:38.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
