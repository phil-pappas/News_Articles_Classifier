The International Business Times reported on how to preorder the iPhone 6S on Sept. 11, 2015. Preorders for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will begin early Saturday morning. \nAn early reservation for the exciting new Apple smartphone could save customers hours of waiting in line when the new smartphone hits the store shelves on Sept. 25. Still it's important to think ahead about a preorder since in the past few years new iPhones have sold out within one or two hours. \nPromptly at 12:01 a.m EDT on Saturday preorders will begin. It is suggested that American customers will either have to stay up late that evening or grab some sleep before rushing to their computers just after midnight to order the new Apple smartphone. Reservations for the new smartphone will be accepted on Appleâ€™s website and from major wireless carrier websites such as Verizon , AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile . Best Buy and Target will also be accepting preorders with their own incentives at the time of launch. \nT-Mobile is taking $125 off the price of the iPhone 6S reports The Verge . T-Mobile CEO John Legere has decided to offer an exciting deal on Apple's newest smartphones. Via T-Mobile's Jump on Demand program the iPhone 6S will be available for $20 a month with the 6S plus being offered for $24 a month. In this 18-month leasing program customers can change devices up to three different times a year. This all sounds very exciting as preparations are being made to welcome in the new Apple iPhones.
