The screen now acts as 'flash', which varies in intensity depending on the light levels around you. \nEarlier, Mr Cook showed off a new iPad line, saying: \"Today we have the biggest news in iPad since the iPad.\" \nHe revealed a new device - called the iPad Pro - with an ultra-high resolution screen measuring 12.9-inches. \nApple says the device has \"desktop class\" power, as well as a cover containing a \"smart keyboard\". \nA stylus which Apple is branding \"Apple Pencil\" is also being released which will work only on the iPad Pro model. \nThe width of the Pro is the same as the height of the Air. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) contains an A9X chip, making it 1.8 times faster than the iPad. \nApple has also shown off its overhauled Apple TV service, with a redesigned remote featuring a glass surface, and Siri integration. \nMultiplayer gaming will also feature on the TV platform, and the developers of classic iOS game Crossy Road demonstrated their game on the system. \nThey were followed on stage by developers from Harmonix, the creators of Rock Band, who are bringing a new game called Beat Sports exclusively to Apple TV. \nYou'll also be able to shop on screen, and watch two video feeds side by side. \nHowever despite the raft of announcements, Apple's share price steadily fell during the presentation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:33:43.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
