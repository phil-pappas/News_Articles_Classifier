M&T spokesman Michael Zabel also declined to comment.\nFour former Wilmington executives, including Harra, were criminally charged on Aug. 5 with lying to regulators about the health of the bank's loans.\nHarra pleaded not guilty on Aug. 20. Cecala has not been criminally charged.\nWilmington last September agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that it concealed delinquent loans and did not set aside enough money for loan losses.\nThe case is In re: Wilmington Trust Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 10-00990.
