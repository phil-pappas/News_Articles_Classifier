ADVERTISEMENT And it's a sign that the business community and the financial advice industry has successfully convinced half of the Democratic caucus — as well as all Republicans — that Obama's current plan does more harm than good.Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) circulated the letter, which was first reported by The Hill, and nabbed signatures from different wings of the caucus, including House Democratic vice chairman Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.).\"We continue to hear from constituents, academics, providers, and investors that there are specific provisions of the Rule that may cause market disruptions and limit the ability of segments of the market to reasonably access advice,\" according to the lawmakers' letter, sent to Labor Secretary Tom Perez.Obama wants to implement a \"fiduciary standard\" that would increase disclosure requirements for financial advisers. He says it's needed to help consumers understand that their financial advisers might be earning a profit from Wall Street institutions by selling them financial advice packages.But the industry argues that the proposal is not needed given the bevy of regulations that already exist. And they argue that the regulations would serve as a disincentive for financial advice firms to take on low-income clients, whose financial planning needs are less lucrative than wealthy Americans.The large contingency of Democratic opposition on a financial services issue is rare, especially given that Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced the proposal in March at a high-profile event at AARP's D.C. headquarters.Notably, House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) did not sign the letter.The Democratic dissent presents a hurdle for Perez, who now must weigh whether to significantly alter the proposal.Appropriation bills in both the Senate and the House attempt to block the Labor Department from implementing the current proposal. And should Democrats get onboard with those measures, it will make it next to impossible for the administration to implement the regulation before Obama leaves office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:20:52.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
