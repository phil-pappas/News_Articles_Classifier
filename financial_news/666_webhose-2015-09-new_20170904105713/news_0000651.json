(PRWEB) September 17, 2015\nZoot , a global provider of advanced origination, acquisition and decision management solutions, will celebrate 25 years in business on September 18, 2015. The company’s worldwide client base includes; top-ten financial institutions, automobile manufacturers, retailers and payment providers.\nZoot was established in 1990 by CEO Chris Nelson . From its humble beginnings in the founder’s basement to the multi-million dollar company it is today, Zoot now employs more than 250 people, most of who work out of the corporate headquarters in Bozeman, Mont. The company also has offices in Frankfurt, Germany and Leeds, UK.\n“We chose a different path from other technology companies by writing a language that could solve any problem. That has defined us for 25 years and set us apart from our competition,” said Chris Nelson, founder and CEO of Zoot. “We’ve been living in the future for a long time with our distributed processing model. What lies ahead is making the configuration of our services so fast and easy that anyone can do it. That is going to define the next era of Zoot and I couldn’t be more excited if I were twins.”\nThe core of Zoot’s business is to help lenders open new credit and loan accounts while effectively managing risk and compliance. Zoot uses automated processes to pull credit data and render decisions in seconds, enabling financial institutions to give their customers immediate responses to credit and loan applications. This is particularly important as consumers increasingly use mobile devices to perform banking functions.\nZoot clients benefit from established connections to nearly 100 data and service providers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. International expansion is part of Zoot’s growth trajectory as current clients expand globally and new clients are brought on board by the company’s European operations. Zoot also holds industry patents for its enterprise cross-sell management solution, test file modification tool and interface design tool.\nTo commemorate the company’s 25 years in business, Zoot will host a party for clients, partners and employees.
