It will not take effect for at least 90 days.\nGayles imposed the civil penalties in a case brought in January 2012 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A jury in December found the defendants liable for misleading investors about BankAtlantic's health in a July 2007 conference call.\nEugene Stearns, a lawyer for the defendants, said his clients will appeal.\nThe SEC accused BankAtlantic and Levan of having downplayed, in press releases and conference calls, the risks of loans that the Fort Lauderdale-based lender had made on large tracts of land that were meant for single-family homes and condominiums.\nIt said the defendants knew by March 2007 that many loans were troubled but waited until October to disclose large losses. BankAtlantic's stock price then fell 38 percent in one day.\nThe fines were close to the $5.2 million and $1.56 million that the SEC sought against BBX and Levan, respectively.\nStearns said the judge \"scolded\" Levan at a Thursday hearing for not admitting that the SEC's claims were valid.\n\"To be punished for protesting your innocence is a little disturbing,\" Stearns said.\nLevan, in a statement, said he was \"very disappointed\" in the penalties.\nSEC spokeswoman Judith Burns had no immediate comment.\nBankAtlantic was renamed BBX after selling its main banking assets in 2012 to North Carolina's BB&T Corp.\nIn 2008, BankAtlantic had sued prominent banking analyst Richard Bove over his report, titled \"Who Is Next?\", which it said intimated that it might be at risk of failure.\nLevan at the time said \"no one would ever conclude that BankAtlantic belongs to any list of 'next.'\"\nBankAtlantic and Bove eventually settled.\nThe case is SEC v BankAtlantic Bancorp Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No. 12-60082.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb)\nBankAtlantic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:23:15.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
