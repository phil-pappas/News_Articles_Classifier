We would also like to invite all Rwandans to help us in this campaign by telling their neighbours, relatives, and employees that it's important to get health insurance,\" he said. \nWhile the government tasked the RSSB to manage Mutuelle de Santé when subscriptions to the scheme were dropping, Rulisa said RSSB hopes to attract people back to the scheme by improving its financial management which is critical in the running of the fund. \nHe said some subscribers were giving up on the scheme when they couldn't access services such as the medicine they needed from hospitals and pharmacies in the country. \nRSSB hopes to reverse the trend by paying hospitals and pharmacies on time so they can procure the medicines needed by patients insured with Mutuelle de Santé, Rulisa said. \n\"We are going to explain to the people that there are a lot of benefits for subscribing to Mutuelle de Santé because we are going to improve our services,\" he said. \nYouth reluctant \nWhile medical insurance is about solidarity among members of the scheme, officials at RSSB say many Rwandans are yet to adopt the habit of being covered all the time, leaving those who are sick or susceptible to get sick with the burden of paying for their own medical services through Mutuelle de Santé. \nRulisa said some people who feel that they don't tend to get sick, such as young people who live alone and have got no families to look after, tend to be reluctant to join Mutuelle de Santé. \nThis, he said, makes it challenging to operate the scheme because the less subscribers it gets, the harder it becomes to raise enough funds for medical care. \n\"We need to convince the youth that the right time to get health insurance is when they are healthy,\" Rulisa said. \nRSSB targets to realise 100 per cent subscription rate to Mutuelle de Santé by December and the three-month sensitisation campaign that kicks off today is one of the means to achieve that target, Rulisa said.
