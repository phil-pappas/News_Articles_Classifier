The number of medallions is limited by the city and they sell for very high prices - as much as $1 million as recently as 2011.\nThe four lenders - Melrose Credit Union, Montauk Credit Union, Progressive Credit Union and Lomto Credit Union - have argued that Uber has driven down the value of New York Taxi medallions by as much as 40 percent.\nThey hold nearly $2.5 billion in taxi medallion loans covering around 5,300 medallions.\nDelinquencies at the credit unions have soared in the past year, according to financials filed with their regulator, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\nMelrose, for instance, had more than ten times as much in loans that were more than sixty days delinquent than a year earlier. The credit union said it has nearly $400 million in delinquencies and troubled debt restructurings in its medallion loan portfolio.\nLomto, which had only $73,000 of delinquent loans in June 2014, has more than $9 million of loans that are more than 60 days delinquent as of the end of June 2015.\nThe credit unions are not the only ones making loans for taxi medallions. Other lenders include large banks like Citibank and specialty lender Medallion Financial Corp, whose shares are at their lowest level since 2010 and have lost more than 60 percent of their value since their 2013 peak.\nCredit unions are non-profit, member-owned financial institutions. Members' accounts are insured to the limits of the NCUA's insurance fund.\nThe NCUA said it carefully reviews its credit unions' lending and risk-mitigation plans and has issued guidance about taxi medallion lending.\n\"Like any other form of lending, the agency expects credit unions that offer this product to analyze the potential risk and have proper mitigation in place,\" NCUA spokesman John Fairbanks said.
