Vasco Celio by Olivia Riordan From Kolkata to Bangkok, chef Gaggan Anand has taken Indian cuisine into uncharted territory. Anand's eponymous fine-dining restaurant, Gaggan, is challenging the status-quo, proving that an Indian restaurant can cut it with the world's best.\nAnd in March, Anand's vision was realised. Gaggan, in Lumphini in central Bangkok, was awarded the number one restaurant at Asia's 50 Best Restaurant awards. This was shortly followed by 10th place (up from 17) at the World's 50 Best Restaurant awards in June – the only Indian restaurant to crack the top 50.\n\"Gaggan is trying to change people's perceptions, trying to prove that Indian cooking can be finer, more exotic,\" says Anand. To do so, Gaggan offers two menus, ranging from 15 to 22 courses, with only one curry. Instead, Anand takes a deconstructive approach to many Indian classics. A style inspired by Spain's revered Chef Ferran Adria and honed during Anand's two-month stint at the former number one restaurant in the world, el Bulli (now closed).\n\"I was witnessing this change, a global change towards food, starting with chefs like Heston [Blumenthal], Thomas Keller and Ferran Adria​ – these chefs were all redefining food,\" says Anand. \"I think I was in the right place at the right time, to adapt and change.\"\nClassics stand out Anand and his research team travel to India many times a year and Gaggan's menu changes every two months. But some classics stand out. Chowpati Year 2050 is an imaginative take on papdi chaat (a savoury Northern Indian street food) – a spherical yoghurt \"egg\" infused with chaat masala, ginger and mango powder (akin to Adria's olive spherification), with herbal foam and tamarind chutney. While Anand's take on pani puri (a savoury street snack from Magadha, India) is re-interpreted with a white-chocolate sphere, filled with a savoury blend of coriander, mint, green chillies and cumin, topped with edible silver.\nAnand calls his style \"progressive Indian cuisine\" – a name befitting Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon , on high rotation in his kitchen. \"After I came back from el Bulli, I was trying to work out how to describe my style – is it modern Indian? Is it fine dining Indian?\" says Anand. \"But then I thought of progressive rock and roll – it's avant garde, it's experimental and it's based on a constant approach of improvement.\"\nWhile Anand is breaking barriers in Bangkok, he has a love-hate relationship with the city where he has made his mark. \"I was an aggressive young Indian chef, aggressive in my approach; but then I found myself in this pleasant, relaxed, Thai environment – it changed my approach, I actually started understanding food better,\" he says. On the other hand, Anand has faced an uphill battle convincing locals to embrace Indian cuisine. Although recent accolades have attracted a new audience and the restaurant is now booked out months in advance.\n This year, Anand joins the star line-up at the Margaret River Gourmet Escape (November 20 – 22), alongside good friend David Thompson of Nahm in Bangkok (2014's number one restaurant in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants awards), Sat Bains of Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham and the unflappable Marco Pierre White. There are also leading local chefs, Brent Savage of Sydney's Monopole and Yellow, David Moyle of Franklin in Hobart and Aaron Carr of Margaret River's Vasse Felix.\n\"When I received the email, I replied with four words: yes, yes, yes, please!\" he says. Anand joins the event's signature Gourmet Beach BBQ, as well as a number of cooking demonstrations. But it's a panel discussion \"Global chefs, local food\" – with Thompson, Chris Salans of Mozaic in Bali and Chele Gonzalez of Gallery Vask in Manila – that strikes a chord. So what does it takes for an Indian chef in Bangkok to stand out from the crowd?\n\"I think the most important thing when you are an expat chef, is that you don't take things for granted. When you're a local, you have certain advantages. For expats, it's a steeper mountain to climb, but it makes our job more exciting and more challenging,\" says Anand. \"It motivates me as a chef.\"\nIt may be Anand's first visit to Australia, but it hasn't taken him long to figure out a loved Australian culinary tradition. \"I'm looking forward to a big, bad, Aussie beach barbeque.\"\nNEED TO KNOW\nGaggan, eatatgaggan.com\nMargaret River Gourmet Escape, November 20-22\ngourmetescape.com.au", "external_links": ["http://edition.cnn.com/video/api/embed.html#/video/tv/2015/06/05/spc-culinary-journeys-gaggan-anand-a.cnn"], "published": "2015-09-27T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:06:06.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
