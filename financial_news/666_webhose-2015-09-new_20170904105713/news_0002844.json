Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images \nToday Mary Ray, the former chief deputy auditor for La Porte Indiana was convicted of two counts of theft of government funds, seven counts of wire fraud ; in addition to making false statements on her tax returns. Not only did Ray steal money from the government and county contribution funds, but she also managed to defraud her own elderly father out of over $400,000. Her sentencing will take place later this year on December 22, 2015. \nAccordingly, when it comes to identity theft , the elderly are the most vulnerable because all too often their own family members can do what they want without detection. In this case, Ray was not only stealing money from the state but she also betrayed her own father who is a disabled veteran. She was supposed to have been a trusted government employee only to have turned out to be a criminal in disguise. \nIt is important to note however, that when it comes to identity theft, we as a community need to watch out for our neighbors and friends because sadly it is often family members who end up taking advantage of the elderly. If you live next to someone who is elderly it can never hurt to check up on them to make sure they are okay. The FTC warns that if you spot sudden changes or if they recently fall ill it doesn't hurt to try to go visit them. Recently I witnessed two sons who had found out that their father was sick and who immediately checked him into a nursing home simply because they didnâ€™t want to be bothered with taking care of him. They also wanted to have full access to his funds while he was still alive. The saddest part about this case was that this poor man wasn't provided the things he needed and could have bought with his own money, nor was he given the option to say goodbye to other family and friends before he died, all because the sons wanted his money and couldn't care less about his well being or health. \nFurthermore, the FTC warns that elder financial abuse goes undetected because many people are not sure if they should report it. If you see sudden changes in wills or power of attorneys this could be a sign of elderly abuse. If a person is able to gain power of attorney for an elderly family member who is mentally incapacitated they may be able to take all their money even before it goes to the rightful heirs. If you have an elderly family member you want to protect from elder abuse and identity theft have them visit the FTC's pass it on page for more information on how to spot the many scams on the rise. \nIf you have been the victim of identity theft by a scammer or family member visit the Federal Trade Commission's identity theft plan help page for assistance on what steps you can take to restore your identity. Unfortunately, identity theft is a crime that spans across many different offenses. In this case Mary Ray used the money she stole to gamble, so it is highly likely she had an addiction. This however, is no excuse for her behavior.
