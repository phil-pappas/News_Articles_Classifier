The Oracle development was tossed into the hands of receivers Korda Mentha by a selection of Australia's big four banks, which then sold their debt positions to Goldman Sachs, hedge fund Varde and Macquarie.\nInstead of selling the penthouse at basement prices Korda Mentha refurbished it and waited until now to sell it. Set on levels 50 and 51, the 1117 square metre penthouse comprises four bedrooms, a media room, a study, a private rooftop pool, spa and steam room and views spanning 360 degrees.\nA recent marketing campaign by KM Sales and Marketing – the group behind the $25 million, off-the-plan sale of Australia's record-breaking penthouse – Australia 108 in Southbank, Melbourne – helped capture the strongest sale since 2008 for Broadbeach.\nKM Sales and Marketing Jayde Pezet and Tanya Mathews said the sale showed clear signs that their selling channels into China were helping bring the Gold Coast market back to life.\n\"The market backed off and we were probably 40 per cent off the top, then it plateaued and then in the last 12 months we have seen very good growth in both investor stock and the top of the end market,\" Mr Pezet said.\n\"I've done 12 trips over the last four years to China and we have been pretty focused on that space. The Chinese respond very well to having a presence on the ground,\" he said.\n He said the next big high rise developments on the Gold Coast were dominated by Chinese developers such as Wanda, which were likely to sell back into the country.\n\"It is logical that they will go down that track.\"\nHerron Todd White's Luke Nichols said the sale of the penthouse showed improving values.\n\"We don't get many $8 million sales down here so I think it is a good sign that the prestige market is coming back to life.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-09-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:05:52.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
