(Nasdaq: GRIF ) (“Griffin”) announced that a subsidiary of Griffin closed on a $14.1 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the “Mortgage Loan”) with Webster Bank. The Mortgage Loan is collateralized by the newly constructed approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building at 5220 Jaindl Boulevard in Hanover Township in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the Mortgage Loan (before financing costs) of $11.5 million. An additional $2.6 million of mortgage proceeds will be received when the tenant that has leased approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl Boulevard exercises its option to lease the balance of the building or when another tenant leases the currently unleased space. The Mortgage Loan has a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.65%, but Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster Bank at closing to fix the interest rate at 3.77% on the loan proceeds received at closing over the term of the loan. The Mortgage Loan has a ten year term, with payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. Griffin intends to use the mortgage proceeds for general business purposes, including continued investment in Griffin’s real estate assets. \nForward-Looking Statements: \nThis Press Release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
