At a level of 38, business confidence is thus not too far away from this threshold. \nRMB chief economist Ettienne Le Roux said anything could push it over that threshold. \n\"To be sure, given how weak the economy is right now, and made even more vulnerable by increased uncertainty around political, economic policy and labour developments, it wouldn't take much of a setback to actually push it over the edge,\" he said. \n\"As such, a drawn out strike in the gold mining sector and/or another strong blow to the steel industry could easily do the trick. The economy's resistance level is simply not strong enough.\" \nThe cumulative decline over the past six months has reduced confidence to its lowest level since the end of 2011. \nRetail confidence fell by 18 points to 34 and wholesale confidence dropped by 14 points to 50. Building confidence declined somewhat, but the mood among manufacturers and new motor dealers improved slightly from depressed levels, explained the BER. \nSales are increasingly being suppressed by moderating wage inflation, higher tax rates, rising interest rates, growing job losses and sharply lower consumer confidence, it explained. \nThe BER survey results show that wholesale sales volumes remained under pressure in the third quarter, which also knocked confidence. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:39:19.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
