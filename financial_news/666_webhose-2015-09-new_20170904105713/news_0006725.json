Michael Clayton-Jones Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger One of Collins Street's landmark office buildings, the former National Australia Bank head office at 271 Collins Street, is now fully leased after its wealthy Toorak landlords secured deals with two rising online operators.\nRestaurant review website company Zomato, which bought out local player Urbanspoon for $60 million in January , has taken 1144 square metres of office space and a roof terrace in the 10-level, 32,700-square-metre office tower while Redbubble, an online marketplace for custom-designed T-shirts and hoodies, has taken 278 square metres.\nThe building, with an imposing Chicagoesque stone facade was completed in 1929 and occupied by NAB for more than 70 years. It forms part of a two-tower retail and office complex covering a massive 6000-square-metre site bounded by Elizabeth Street and Flinders Lane.\nThe complex is owned by two Melbourne families, the Hubays and Kornhausers, who paid $50 million for it in 2001.\nLeasing agents Fitzroys and Colliers International declined to comment on the commercial terms of the leases but said one of the attractions of the building was its \"market-sensitive pricing\". Asking rents were $430 a square metre.\nRecent leasing deals at 271 Collins Street include Monash College, a diploma-level institution tied to Monash University, which took almost 6500 square metres across two levels in October last year, replacing Origin Energy. Other office tenants include Optus, Oakton, HSBC and Serco.\nIn the retail part of the complex, Woolworths will soon open one of its new smaller CBD convenience stores.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-09-23T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:05:57.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
