On September 4, prices were ~$1.60 per gallon.\n\nUS diesel prices followed crude oil prices. They fell on Wednesday, September 9 by ~3.50%, but rose the next day. They were pulled by rising crude oil. Prices fell again the next day as the markets took in a more-than-expected rise in distillate inventories. This includes diesel, as we reported in our latest analysis of the Weekly Petroleum Report. You can read more about the latest distillate inventory trends at US Distillate Inventories Rise More than Expected .\nWhy diesel prices matter A fall in US diesel prices might discourage refiners like Tesoro (TSO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Valero Energy (VLO) from increasing their diesel production, all else remaining equal. As with gasoline, which we discussed in the previous part of this series, investors also need to watch crude oil prices (USO) in order to gauge what could happen with diesel production and prices.\nUS-produced diesel also satisfies some demand from European countries. They rely heavily on diesel-fueled vehicles. Keep in mind that refiners will also look at the feasibility of exporting diesel to satisfy overseas markets. Combined, Tesoro, Valero Energy, and Marathon Petroleum account for ~8.60% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nIf refiners choose to decrease production, MLPs such as Tesoro Logistics (TLLP), Valero Energy Partners (VLP), and MPLX (MPLX) would transport a lower volume, which could reduce their revenues.\nDiesel price forecasts According to the EIA’s STEO (Short-Term Energy Outlook) report released on September 9, diesel fuel retail prices should average $2.73 per gallon in 2015 and then rise to $2.77 per gallon in 2016. Prices averaged $3.83 per gallon in 2014. Retail prices differ from the futures prices we discussed above. Retail prices include the added costs of taxes, distribution, and marketing.\nThe rise in the price forecasts of 2016 is fueled by expectations of higher consumption in 2016 compared to 2015. The EIA forecasts that distillate fuel, which includes heating oil and diesel, consumption will rise by 60,000 bpd (barrels per day)—or by 1.50%—in 2016 compared to 2015’s consumption. The EIA expects the higher consumption to be driven by rising manufacturing activity, marine fuel use, and foreign trade.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - WTI and Brent Crude Oil Prices Fell Due to Gloomy 2016 Outlook Part 2 - XOP Traded Better than USO in the Week Ending September 11 Part 3 - WTI-Brent Spread Fell below $3 Last Week Commodity Markets Basic Materials Industry crude oil prices September 11 Marathon Petroleum Valero Energy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:18:32.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
