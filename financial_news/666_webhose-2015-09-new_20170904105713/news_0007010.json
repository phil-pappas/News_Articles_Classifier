Prices were 0.2 percent lower compared with the previous month. \nAugust marked the tenth straight month prices have fallen year on year, a trend which started in late 2014 but was exacerbated from January when the Swiss National Bank abruptly removed its cap on the franc, set at 1.20 per euro. \nThe franc's subsequent surge has lowered the price of imports from the euro zone. In August the cost of overall imports fell by 5.5 percent year on year, the FSO said. \nCheaper oil has also kept a lid on prices. \n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Michael Shields)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:14:47.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
