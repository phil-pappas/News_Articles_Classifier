The Answer: A Host of MSNBC Hosts and a Sex Museum.” Owing taxes isn’t funny, however, as John Willis points out, “If you owe the IRS back taxes, don’t beat yourself up. Just do the right thing and work it out with your tax attorney. In the meantime, know that you are not alone.”\nWillis goes on to elaborate the nearly comedic trend pointed out in a Washington Post article about MSNBC hosts who owe taxes. And, Willis adds, “Accounting Today has revealed that sex doesn’t pay. Well, New York’s Museum of Sex doesn’t pay the IRS.”\nThe next bit of humor comes when Willis writes, “If you do owe back taxes and have the right qualifications, one of which might just be your debt to the IRS, you might look into existing opportunities at MSNBC. Maybe you would be eligible to host a show.”\nWillis concludes with the following, “I know many people come to the end of tax season with a pit in their stomach knowing they owe taxes. It may be a burden, however, there is always a solution when you work with a reputable tax professional. And, despite the gnawing pit and the burdens, laughter is always the best medicine.”\nThe entire article can be read at: http://www.irsallstar.com/articles/who-owes-the-irs-the-answer-a-host-of-msnbc-hosts-and-a-sex-museum.php\nABOUT JOHN WILLIS\nMr. Willis believes strongly in supporting and representing the “underdog” and has devoted his entire professional life to protecting and defending those who need it most.
