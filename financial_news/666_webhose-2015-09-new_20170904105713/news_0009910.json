Basking in the afterglow of getting within striking distance of a target to boost global growth by 2 per cent over five years, Hockey declared, \"By God, we've made great strides in Cairns.\"\nHundreds of \"concrete\" proposals by Group of 20 member states would kick-start a fresh wave of growth to excise the ghosts of the global financial crisis after more than half a decade of recession, joblessness, budget and debt crises, and market turmoil.\nTwelve months on and, perhaps not surprisingly, it's clear not much has changed.\nFinancial markets have been on tenterhooks for much of the year over three big questions, in ascending order of importance; Greece; the US Federal Reserve's will they, won't they September rate meeting; and the future of China, for which 2015 marks its arrival on the global stage as the main influencer of sentiment in just about every asset market imaginable.\nThe common theme across all three questions? Not enough sustainable growth, too much reliance on monetary policy and debt-fuelled government spending.\nWhich was supposed to be the point of Cairns: a chance to reset the agenda, reboot growth.\nYet there is a growing sense of despair that hopes for a lasting worldwide recovery have again been delayed, hurting the credibility of the G20 and Hockey, who campaigned hard for the agreement.\n Must try harder \"Downside risks to the outlook have increased,\" said International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde this month, repeating what must surely be the most overworked line of her four-year stint in the job.\nG20 finance ministers meeting in Turkey's capital Ankara in early September conceded sheepishly that the globe was once again falling \"short of expectations\".\nBoffins at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – charged with monitoring progress on Hockey's 2 per cent growth target – estimate that only a third of more than 700 commitments made by the G20 under Australia's presidency have been implemented.\nMore \"effort is needed\", the group declared in its official communiqué. No kidding.\nWhat has become apparent is that so many of the growth pledges involved a fair bit of padding – in Australia too, which was always likely to some extent, given they were being written by professional politicians.\nYet the lack of genuine progress on many of the goals underlines how fraught the business of government has become.\nHoping to set the example, Hockey provided a long list of pledges that Australia would undertake. A year later, many of them are in tatters.\nThe Treasurer counted as part of his G20 growth contribution the Coalition's infrastructure asset recycling initiative which has been wounded by the return of Labor governments in Queensland and Victoria.\nAnother was the government's May 2014 budget proposal to cut dole payments for job seekers under 30, scrapped earlier this year. Same story with Prime Minister Tony Abbott's unpopular paid parental leave scheme.\nIn industrial relations, Hockey nominated the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission – another washout.\nAdd to the list Christopher Pyne's troubled – and now stalled – plan to deregulate the higher education system.\nMost fundamental of all, Hockey and Abbott's 2014 obsession with debt and deficit is now well and truly on the backburner.\nWhat, in the wake of all that failure, does the Abbott government now stand for on economic policy?\nWith a performance like that being replicated around the world, there's a good chance next year's G20 will be even more dispiriting. Perhaps the 2016 host, China, can inject some fresh vigour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:55:14.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
