Blame the Venture Capitalists Written by: Robert McGarvey 09/30/15 - 11:47 AM EDT More Headlines Get Rid of Credit Cards That Aren't Pulling Their Weight \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Your apartment rent is just too high? Word from a recent study is: blame the venture capitalists. That is the plain takeaway from the Zumper Venture Capital Rent Study, said Devin O’Brien, head of strategic marketing at San Francisco based rental listings website Zumper. Fact: in some cities, over 25% of apartment rent is directly attributable to venture capital flooding into the town, according to Zumper. Breathe easily, however. Much of America is unaffected. Zumper data pinpointed just 20 cities that it said have measurable rent boosts due to venture capital. Zumper also said that ten U.S. cities got 78% of all VC money in 2014 and it’s in those towns where impacts on rent are highest. The impacts may be deep, but they are not wide. But since when are VCs buying apartment buildings? They are not. They as a rule gravitate towards high opportunity niches - often tech related - and staid investments such as residential real estate are definitely not their thing. What VCs do, however, is fund tech companies that create high paying jobs where employees can fairly easily afford rent ordinary workers might not. San Francisco is ground zero for the impact of VC money on residential rentals, said O’Brien, and that’s because Zumper data found a one-bedroom in Baghdad by the Bay rents for $3,252 - the highest rent of any city in the Zumper 20 - and of that amount, a whopping 33% is attributable to the flood of VC money into town. That’s $1,069 in rent that is paid, because VCs have bumped up the going rates. San Francisco has also won the lion’s share of recent VC money, per Zumper. It says San Francisco took in $15.4 billion in 2014, representing almost one-third of the total VC investment of $48.984 billion. In the process entire neighborhoods - such as the Mission and the Tenderloin - that had once been neglected, in some views seedy, have suddenly become upmarket. Just about no neighborhood has completely avoided the impacts of VC money as tech startups have proliferated in San Francisco. There just seems no end of them. It’s not the only city utterly transformed. Zumper also pointed to neighbor San Jose - with $6.8 billion in VC investment, 14% of the total - which has produced an average one-bedroom rent of $1,905, of which Zumper said 25% is due to the VC funding. Other cities, too, are seeing significant VC impacts on rents. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:12:46.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
