Group relies on a networked cross-functional culture to deliver rapid fire innovations throughout the year. Wayne Taylor by Corinne Canter Close to 3 billion \"screenagers\" around the world are able to organise their day, work, play, track their kids, shop, and do their banking as well as myriad other tasks without doing anything more than pressing a button or uttering a voice command. \"Business as usual\" is being renegotiated as the digital age creates faster and better access to a broader, switched on customer base.\nBut organisations hoping to make the most of this opportunity using innovation specialists and traditional processes may find they are left behind in the race to attract and retain customers. Those ahead of the curve are making innovation go viral in their organisations by involving all employees and adopting processes that mirror the more fluid and networked market in which they are doing business.\nAt Human Synergistics Australia, a consulting firm specialising in creating high performing leadership and culture, we've seen how this works at clients like online bookmaker SportsBet and KFC.\nSportsBet chief executive Cormac Barry puts it this way: \"Our marketplace is fast, very fast. Our edge is to innovate constantly rapidly and totally. If there is a bottleneck, we fall behind, so we are always striving for better ways to meet the customers' needs - whether they know them yet or not.\"\nKFC Zinger Taco. Supplied Since being taken over by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power in 2010, SportsBet has gone from being a small ambitious start-up with a little over 50 employees to now being the most successful, fastest growing company in its sector, employing more than 600 people.\nA secret to SportsBet's success is in the way it develops its leaders and its heavy emphasis on creating the right culture. It looks for and develops leaders with vision, who can come at things from different perspectives. And the company creates a culture that allows the great ideas from staff to come to life. Rather than create a specialist innovation team, SportsBet's strategy activates innovation across the organisation at all levels through its leaders. Its leader development involves 360 degree feedback, in which leaders receive detailed insights not just on their behaviour but their impact on their teams, their peers and the business.\nThis in turn is supported by coaching, regular team and peer to peer feedback dialogue as well as enabling leaders to keep up to date with new ideas and changes in the global business community. Barry believes that providing clarity and direction through agile leaders enables them to create a highly motivated workplace, explaining that \"getting the environment right is the key\".\n\"We've got outstanding people, we just constantly focus on giving them the opportunity to realise that potential.\"\n Anticipating and defining future customer needs, tastes and wants is not restricted to digital businesses. The KFC part of the Yum! Group relies on a networked cross-functional culture to deliver rapid fire innovations throughout the year. KFC launches a new product at least every four weeks. This is no easy feat, because it has 700 stores across Australia and New Zealand and 30,000 employees. KFC's chief people officer Rob Phipps credits this kind of cross-team innovation for the successful \"zinger taco\".\nInnovation is not limited to its product base, however. Employees are also encouraged to come up with new ideas on how to benefit the business and community in other ways. When faced with the logistics of disposing of about 60,000 old uniforms as KFC switched to new uniforms last year, instead of sending 7000 kilograms of fabric to landfill, they worked with their produce suppliers to leverage their supply chain network to sustainably transfer the uniforms to Pacific NonWovens, a fibre technology company, for conversion to 25,000 square metres of Superfelt carpet underlay, to be sold commercially.\nSportsBet and KFC have adapted, but they are in the minority. At Human Synergistics, we have analysed the results of more than 2000 Australian and New Zealand organisations showing that more than 70 per cent of these organisations have cultures that will actively work against any efforts to grow innovation. Shaun McCarthy, chairman of Human Synergistics, believes these cultures are based on outdated assumptions about how to build performance through people. They have a top-down hierarchical structure that reduces influence and involvement of employees, jobs that have little autonomy, internal competition between business units to get resources and managers who think their job is to control. Achieving innovation in such cultures is nigh on impossible.\nThe five key areas Organisations seeking to accelerate innovation need to invest in five areas:\n1. Developing constructive, \"intraprenuerial\" leaders.\nThe best are those who know how to solve complex problems creatively while recognising and facilitating great innovative ideas.\n2. Removing the barriers to autonomy.\nEmpower people to problem solve and make decisions at the lowest level. Escalating to the next level should be the exception, not the norm.\n3. Radical Transparency.\nShare business information, involve your people and let them be part of the solution. Failing to trust employees with important information is a sure indicator of old thinking and will slow performance.\n4. Providing permission to fail fast.\nOrganisations too conservative in their mindset fear failure when in fact they need to be creating \"safe to fail\" cultures that have a bias towards action, learning how to incorporate failing quickly and course correct as part of their product development process.\n5. Developing an interconnected networked culture across teams.\nThe degree to which an organisation innovates with speed is directly in proportion to their ability to work across functions.\nKFC SOPAC managing director Tony Lowings and SportsBet CEO Cormac Barry will be joining other leaders in sharing their culture building strategies at Human Synergistics' \"Business Done Better\" culture and leadership conference in Melbourne and Sydney in the coming months.
