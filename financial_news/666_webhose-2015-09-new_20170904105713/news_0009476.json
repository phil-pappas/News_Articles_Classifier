What we’re going to do is make sure we can manage our economy, tackle the deficit without austerity. That's what we are saying. That’s the dividing line between us and the Tories.\" \nIndependence of the Bank of England has been part of the political consensus in the UK for nearly two decades. \nMr McDonnell's plans for a review of the central bank fall short of that, but may see a change in its mandate. \nHe will also call for openness at the Office for Budget Responsibility and an effectiveness review at the HMRC, responsible for tax collection. \nMr McDonnell attended a fringe meeting for advocates of a Financial Transaction Tax last night and admitted \"contretemps\" with his predecessor Ed Balls over the issue in the past. \nHe indicated Labour could be open to a unilateral FTT, rather than its current position of adopting it only alongside other major economies. \nEconomist Richard Murphy, an early inspiration for so-called Corbynomics and \"People's Quantitative Easing\", told Sky News that much of the economic strategy of the new Labour leadership was dependent on there being another economic crisis. \n\"Peoples QE was a plan for economic downturn. I believe - and I think John believes - we are going to have one... \n\"John is saying we should put in place the plans that real opposition has to put in place - the plans that will revive the economy,\" Mr Murphy told Sky News. \nThe previous shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, called on Sunday for more \"clarity\" on Mr McDonnell's fiscal plans. \nMr Leslie said Labour would be \"laughed out of the court\" if it tries to balance the books without spending cuts or tax rises. \nMr McDonnell will also confirm a new economic advisory panel - that includes Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and best-selling economist Thomas Piketty - will meet every quarter to develop Labour economic policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T07:19:17.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
