RICHARD CARSON by Lisa Von Ahn Caterpillar slashed its 2015 revenue forecast on Thursday and said it would cut as many as 10,000 jobs through to 2018, joining a list of big US industrial companies grappling with the mining and energy downturn.\nShares of Caterpillar tumbled as much as 8 per cent to a five-year low, pulling down the sector and knocking as much as 37 points off the Dow Jones industrial average.\nOver the past year, miners and energy companies have chopped budgets and put expansion projects on hold as prices of raw materials such as crude oil, copper, coal and iron ore have plunged to six-year lows amid lingering worries about oversupplies and China's slowing economic growth. As a result, orders for equipment have dried up.\nThe news came as Halliburton, the world's second-largest oilfield services provider, said it had also cut 2000 more jobs, mostly in North America, the region hardest hit by the crude collapse.\nThe Houston-based company has now laid off a total of almost 16,000, or about 19 per cent of its global workforce, since its peak last year, Emily Mir, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday in an emailed statement. Halliburton had previously said in July that 14,000 jobs had been eliminated.\nPeoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, the world's biggest construction and mining equipment maker, has also been hit by a slowdown in industrial activity in China.\nS&P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore termed the restructuring \"a strong reaction\" to market conditions.\n\"The company has shown a lack of revenue growth in the last few years [and] earnings are in a decline,\" he said. \"That definitely puts pressure on the CEO to find a way to react to the environment, which at this time shows no near-term catalyst for improvement.\"\n This month, mining equipment maker Joy Global issued a profit warning as it struggled to adapt to slowing demand for its services.\nDeere & Co, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, announced layoffs of more than 900 plant employees in January as declining grain prices have hurt demand for agricultural machinery.\nCaterpillar had raised its 2015 profit forecast in April and affirmed it in July.\nMorningstar analyst Kwame Webb said: \"That they had hung in with their guidance for so long was probably the most surprising, given the ... accumulating evidence around them that things were slowing.\"\n'Way, way too much capacity' Caterpillar expects revenue to fall in 2015 for the third straight year, to $US48 billion ($68.4 billion), below the average analyst estimate of $US48.82 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFor 2016, the company forecast a 5 per cent revenue decline, mainly in higher-margin products, to about $US45.6 billion. Analysts had expected $US47.36 billion.\nCaterpillar said it would update its 2015 profit forecast when it released third-quarter results late next month. It expects to provide a 2016 earnings outlook in January.\nChief executive officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement: \"We are facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors - namely in mining and energy.\"\nCaterpillar's announcement was no surprise to Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based steel-mill operator Lapham-Hickey, which supplies the company's road construction and road equipment operations.\n\"There is way, way too much capacity worldwide,\" he said. \"And the question is, how long will the cycle last? Our best guess is that there is going to be oversupply on steel and other commodities until maybe late next year.\"\nCaterpillar said it would cut 4000 to 5000 jobs by the end of next year, most of them coming this year. It has already reduced its workforce by more than 31,000 since mid-2012.\nThe company had 114,233 employees as of December 31, last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nCaterpillar expects to incur about $US2 billion in pre-tax costs from the restructuring and save about $US1.5 billion a year.\nCaterpillar said it might close or consolidate more than 20 plants around the world across its three large businesses - construction, resources, and energy and transportation.\n\"2016 would mark the first time in Caterpillar's 90-year history that sales and revenues have decreased four years in a row,\" the company said in a statement.\nIt last reported annual revenue growth in 2012, the first full year after it bought heavy equipment maker Bucyrus International in its largest acquisition ever.\nCaterpillar's 2015 revenue forecast is a 27 per cent drop from 2012. Wall Street's net income outlook for this year is 50 per cent lower than the company's 2012 profit.\nShares of Caterpillar, which already had fallen 23 per cent this year, were down 6.3 per cent at $US65.81 in afternoon trading. The S&P Industrials Index fell 0.7 per cent.\nThe company's market value was about $US39 billion on Thursday, down from nearly $US60 billion at the end of 2012.\nReuters with Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:05:17.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
