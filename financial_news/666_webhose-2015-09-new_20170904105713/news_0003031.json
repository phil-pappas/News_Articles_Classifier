The units are being built under a pay-in-advance scheme.\nA critic of the nuclear plant said local electricity rates will have to rise to pay for the construction costs. Tom Clements, director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch, said on Wednesday in a telephone interview: \"The shareholders and the company aren't responsible for any of the cost. In the end, the rate payer pays for all of it.\"\nClements, who said he has followed the nuclear industry for four decades, said modular construction methods had not kept costs and construction schedules under control as the industry had hoped.\n\"Modular construction was the hope for the nuclear renaissance,\" Clements said. \"There are a lot of lessons being learned that the modular process isn't working out.\" (Reporting By Harriet McLeod; Editing by Dave Gregorio)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:12:18.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
