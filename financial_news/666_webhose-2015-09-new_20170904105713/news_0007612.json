PUBLISHED: 11:43, Fri, Sep 11, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:19, Fri, Sep 11, 2015 GETTY Wetherspoon has complained about the cost of the living wage \nChairman of the pub chain that also owns Lloyds No.1 bars today lashed out at the legislation that means a 70p an hour salary increase for the UK's lowest-paid workers from next April . Tim Martin said the new pay rules had been decided on a whim and for political reasons and, would hurt Britain's struggling pub far more than supermarkets selling alcohol.He said: \"By pushing up the cost of wages by a large factor, the Government is inevitably putting financial pressure on pubs, many of which have already closed.\"This financial pressure will be felt most strongly in areas which are less affluent, since the price differential in those areas between pubs and supermarkets is far more important to customers.\"The attack comes after Next yesterday said its prices will also rise to pay the bill of wage increases, which could come in at £27million a year for the retailer. The firm said the biggest part of the cost is increasing salaries of staff who earn above the living wage to maintain the different pay structures between senior staff. Experts now expect many more companies, including food chains and supermarkets to follow suit.

Seeing as they are all in it together, they will probably pass the costs on, which would mean an end to plunging prices across the food aisles.\" Currently British companies only have to pay the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. Campaigners have long said this is not enough to afford housing, food and basic needs in today's society.As a result, a compulsory living wage of £7.20 is to be introduced from April 2016. But it now looks as though the cost is to be passed on to customers rather than absorbed by companies. \nSome critics said that costs could be met by reducing the huge salaries of the firms's chief executives. The average FTSE 100 boss earns 183 times more than its lowest paid employee, according to the High Pay Centre. Debroah Hargreaves, director at the High Pay Centre, said: \"The Living Wage is a modest increase and only for those over 25. \n\"These businesses are profitable and are making money for shareholders. \n\"What's more, the staff are consumers too so with more money in their pockets they could spend more in these stores, cafes and pubs and it could actually benefit the businesses in the long term. \n\"Let's stop over-rewarding those at the top and under-rewarding everyone else and the economy would be on a much firmer footing.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:20:30.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
