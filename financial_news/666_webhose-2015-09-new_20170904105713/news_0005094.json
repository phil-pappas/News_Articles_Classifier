AP Share on twitter by John Stensholt He is the quiet force who is literally carrying Jason Day to victory and has earned more than $1 million this year. A figure that puts him above just about every AFL and NRL player on the pay scales.\nMeet Colin Swatton, Day's caddie who has been beside the champion golfer, and newly crowned number one player in the world, carrying his bag to five victories this year that has already earned Day almost $13 million – and made Swatton about $1.28 million.\nCaddies such as Swatton, who are the unsung heroes tracking yardage and motivating their clients, are typically paid 8 to 10 per cent of their golfer's earnings.\nIt means huge paydays for those carrying the bag for the very best in the game. When Tiger Woods was at the peak of his powers, his New Zealand caddy Steve Williams was his nation's highest-paid sportsman.\nCaddie Colin Swatton is also a big earner on the course Based on Day's success this year, Swatton would easily make the BRW Top 50 Sports Earners list, for which the cut-off for entry in 2014 was $1.28 million – earned by female golfer Karrie Webb.\nSwatton has already made about that figure, and should Day take home a $US10 million ($13 billion) bonus next week for winning the Fedex Cup on the lucrative United States Professional Golfers' Association tour, Swatton's estimated earnings could top $2.5 million for the year.\nAt that level, he will earn more than just about any AFL, NRL, Super Rugby or A-League player, with only several Australian cricketers and overseas-based basketball, football and motor sports above him.\nAs well as bonuses, which typically range from an 8 per cent cut of prize money to 10 per cent for a tournament win, caddies reportedly make about $US1500 to $2500 per event on the tour. A tournament can take up the best part of a week, including practice rounds and other sponsorship events before four rounds of competitive play begins on a Thursday.\n Swatton has long been a vital part of Day's career, as the golfer readily admitted after his breakthrough PGA Championship major win in August.\n\"He's taken me from a kid that was getting in fights at home and getting drunk at 12, and not heading in the right direction to a major champion winner,\" Day said at the time. \"And there's not many coaches that can say that in many sports.\"\nThe pair met when Day was a schoolboy and Stratton a golf coach at the Koralbyn International School in Queensland, where Day's mother had sent him after the golfer's father died.\nDay and Stratton's first day ended in a huge argument. Over time a mutual bond developed and Swatton has become a father figure and mentor – and a constant companion on Day's journey to golf's top echelon.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:09:24.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
