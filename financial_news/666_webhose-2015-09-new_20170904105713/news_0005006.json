It accounted for more than a third of the Nikkei's losses.\nFor the week, the Nikkei has dropped 6.0 percent for the fourth successive week of losses, and is poised to post the biggest weekly drop since April 2014.\n\"Those who were on the sidelines before the U.S. jobs report are gradually shifting their positions to sell,\" said Chihiro Ohta, general manager at investment research and investor services at SMBC Nikko Securities, adding that selling could accelerate if the dollar falls below an overnight low of 119.65 yen.\nThe dollar stood at 119.93 yen as of 0054 GMT.\nExporters were mostly lower, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 1.3 percent and Panasonic Corp dropping 1.5 percent.\nBanks also lost ground, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropping 1.4 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 2.4 percent.\nNGK Insulators tumbled 2.8 percent after the U.S. Justice Department said the company has agreed to pay $65.3 million for fixing the prices of parts supplied to car makers and plead guilty to criminal charges.\nThe underlying sentiment in the market remained fragile, traders said, noting persistent worries about the Chinese economy.\nIn the last week, net selling of Japanese cash and futures stocks by foreign investors hit a record high as they shunned riskier assets on worries that a China-led slowdown could hurt global growth.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.7 percent and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.8 percent to 13,147.29.
