Photo: Louise Kennerley\nWestpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted says the government's move to scrap plans for a tax on bank deposits has made his day, as the industry voiced its support for the decision.\nAfter the proposed 0.05 per cent tax was dumped on Tuesday, Mr Maxsted told The Australian Financial Review 's Chanticleer lunch the move \"made my day.\"\nMr Maxsted said the tax, widely opposed by banks, did not seem the \"right thing to do\" because of the way it would have affected banks' customers and investors.\nHe also compared it to \"bank bashing\" in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States, where he said regulators \"keep putting new impost after impost on the banking sector\".\nAdvertisement \"Once you go down this path then many of us fear it's the thin edge of the wedge,\" he said.\nBut while banks welcomed news that the tax would be dropped, it did little to stem their ASX losss, with all of the \"big four\" banks being heavily sold on Tuesday.\nThe bank deposit levy would have applied to all deposits worth up to $250,000, which are guaranteed by the taxpayer. The idea had been backed by top regulators including the Reserve Bank as a way of funding the cost of rescuing any failed banks in the future, but banks threatened to pass the cost on to their customers .\nCommonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev also backed the government, citing the Financial System Inquiry recommendation that any payouts to depositors be funded by liquidating the failed bank.\n\"Today's policy decision strikes the right balance between maintaining confidence and supporting economic growth,\" Mr Narev said in a statement.\n\"The Australian banking system is strong and resilient without the need to impose additional costs on savers and investors.\"\nWestpac chief executive, Brian Hartzer also welcomed the government's decision. \"This is a sensible decision and reflects the fact that a pre-funded guarantee scheme is not necessary in Australia and would have effectively been a tax on Australian savers,\" he said.\nAn ANZ spokeswoman said the lender supported the existing protections for depositors, and said moves by banks to hold larger capital buffers would further strengthen the financial system.\nRob Goudswaard, chief executive of the country's biggest credit union, CUA, said he was pleasantly surprised by the announcement.\n\"We're delighted, and we believe with our current capital adequacy levels, and the [mostly mortgage] asset classes of mutuals, it augurs well for the future.\"\nBanks were widely expecting the deposit tax to go ahead until today, but with smaller banks exempt.\nMr Goudswaard, like most other banks chiefs, had met with Treasurer Joe Hockey to argue why the levy should not go ahead.\n\"It is fair to say that all the financial institutions have all gone about explaining to the various stakeholders in support of the FSI that this was not a wise thing to do,\" he said.\nModelling by the Customer Owned Banking Association found the 0.05 per cent tax would have wiped between 5 and 7 per cent off the net profits of its members compared to 1.3 to 2 per cent for the big four. The hit would have been greater on smaller banks because they rely almost entirely on deposit funding and have higher costs than the listed banks.\nSome mutual lenders said this would have cancelled any relative gain they get from the hike the big bank's risk weighted capital, which the banking regulator will impose from July 2016.\nIt is understood the plan until today was to go ahead with the tax, but limit to a 0.01 per cent tariff on deposits at banks with more than $10 billion in liabilities. This would have still hit the very biggest of the mutual lenders, including CUA, but exempted more than 90 per cent of credit unions, building societies and mutual banks.\nCOBA chief executive, Mark Degotardi said the government's change of heart is pro-consumer and pro-competition.\n\"The decision supports the more competitive and resilient financial system recommended by the independent Financial System Inquiry,\" he said.\n\"This outcome is exactly what the FSI intended in its blueprint to make our financial system stronger, without anti-competitive distortions. Australian savers now no longer have to worry about an additional burden at a time of low returns on their savings due to record low interest rates.\"\nMr Goudswaard said if the tax was brought in CUA would likely have to pass it on in lower deposit rates to bolster their wafer-thin net interest margins, which are already below 2 per cent. Banks had to absorb the last cash rate reduction rather than lower their term deposit rates because these are so low that customers can't see the point of locking up funds for six months.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/rba-calls-for-bank-levy-to-protect-depositors-20140402-35yre.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-says-deposit-tax-may-be-passed-on-to-customers-20150401-1mcjn1.html"], "published": "2015-09-01T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:13:07.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
