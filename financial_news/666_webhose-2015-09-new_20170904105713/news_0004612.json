He said there will always be an increasing demand for electricity. \nSouth Africa, looking at its current situation, needs to work out how to create economic opportunities in the energy sector, how to mitigate costs, and also look at the environmental impact. \nOther experts on the panel said it was important to explore other forms of energy other than electricity, such as gas, nuclear energy, solar power and so forth. \nThey encouraged stakeholders to use the country's own products by its own citizens to boost the economy and open doors to job creation. \nClosing the summit, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the summit had been fruitful and it was one of the better Nedlac summits he had ever attended. \nThe summit touched on issues that are aligned to the Nine-Point Plan which President Jacob Zuma introduced this year, and resolving the energy challenge is at the top of the list. \n\"It is wonderful that we were able to address this issue, not only on how we can deal with this challenge but looking into the future,\" said the Deputy President. \nHe was glad that the issue of energy costs was discussed but said there was a need to broaden it. \n\"The issue of mixed energy sources is a wonderful debate. We have possibly seven sources of energy in our country: we have got coal, wind, sun for solar energy, hydro, gas, nuclear, and liquids. \n\"We need to accept that we have different sources of energy and we are going to see how these energy sources will be divided to deliver energy to citizens,\" he said. \nHe said in the end, it should be about the affordability, especially to the poor, and also the affordability to drive and fuel the South African economy.
