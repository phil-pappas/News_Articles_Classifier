Peter Braig Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Indian energy giant Adani's battle to build the $16.5 billion Carmichael mine in Central Queensland has struck another hurdle with a protracted legal battle with resources company Glencore over the operation of Abbot Point coal terminal.\nWith Adani struggling to gain finance for the mega-mine in the Galilee Basin and still awaiting environmental and mining approvals for the project, the legal battle with Glencore is now set to proceed to trial early next year.\nAdani is moving to kick Glencore out as operator of Abbot Point coal terminal – which it plans to use for its export hub for its mega-mine – and is also suing them for loss and damages over an alleged breach of contract. The size of the losses is not outlined in the legal documents obtained from the Supreme Court.\nAdani would not comment on the court case, but the latest legal skirmish will continue to raise doubts about whether its controversial Carmichael mine – which has become a flashpoint for anti-fossil fuel and environmental activists – will ever get off the ground.\nAdani purchased Abbot Point coal terminal from the former Bligh Labor government in 2011 for $1.83 billion. It was crucial to its plans for a vertically-integrated mine, rail and port project to export coal to its power stations in India.\nA subsidiary of Xstrata, known as Abbot Point Bulkcoal, had a 10-year contract to operate and maintain the terminal, which is near Bowen, between 2000 and 2010. This was extended to 2015 before Adani bought the terminal.\nThe first terminal, known as T1, is being used to export coal from across the Bowen Basin. It has a capacity of 50 million tonnes a year and is used by BMA, QCoal and Glencore's two mines at Collinsville and Newlands. It shifted 28.7 million tonnes last financial year.\nThree terminals approved Adani also has approval for a second terminal, known as T0, to be used for its exclusive use for its project in the Galilee Basin, and has a capacity of 70 million tonnes. Another Galilee Basin proponent, GVK/Hancock Coal has approval for a third terminal at Abbot Point.\nBut things soured after the 2013 takeover of Xstrata by global resources giant Glencore. Glencore, which has coal, copper, nickel and zinc mines in Queensland and NSW, asked to store 3 million tonnes of coal at Abbot Point coal terminal.\nAdani, which is racing against the clock to build its Carmichael mine to deliver coal to its power stations by 2017, claims the takeover of the subsidiary which operates Abbot Point was a breach of the original contract.\nIn May 2013, lawyers for Adani sent a notice to Abbot Point Bulkcoal saying they failed to get written approval for the transfer of ownership to Glencore. In June of that year, a show-cause notice was issued and further legal missives were sent in early 2014.\nBut in October 2014, Glencore asked for a five-year extension to the port contract which was refused by Adani saying they had breached the original contract.\nIn late 2014, Adani engaged a health and safety expert to audit Abbot Point Bulkcoal which found a string of alleged deficiencies. A second audit report in 2015 found the original deficiencies \"which posed a significant risk to safety or health of people\" at Abbot Point coal terminal.\nA fourth notice to remedy the breaches was sent to Glencore in May this year. It outlined nine major non-compliance issues in relation to the original audit and 25 minor non-compliances.\nGlencore fired back saying the fourth notice to remedy included errors and was the \"latest example of concerning behaviour by Adani\".\n​Adani continued its bid to kick Glencore off the terminal, saying it had failed to keep the terminal in good condition.\nBut in June Supreme Court Justice James Douglas said Glencore was allowed to continue to operate the terminal until the court case was resolved.\nAdani's Carmichael mine was further delayed last month when the federal court set aside environmental approvals for the project . Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt was given another six to eight weeks to reassess the impact of the mine on two threatened species - the Yakka skink and the ornamental snake.\nThe court action by little-known environmental group, the Mackay Conservation Group , led to the former Abbott government introducing legislation to limit legal challenges against big resources projects.\nThere has been growing speculation the changes to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act would be dumped by the new Turnbull government, but there has so far been no decision.\nAdani Australia chief executive Jeyakumar Janakaraj said the company was committed to the Carmichael project despite the delays.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-24T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:05:21.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
