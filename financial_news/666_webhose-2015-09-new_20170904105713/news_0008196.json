Judges from nine different countries were on hand to assess and score the wines.\nPenfolds 1971 Grange topped the list, scoring 98.5 out of a possible 100 points, to narrowly beat Chateau Y'quem 1975 from Sauternes, which scored 98 points. Rhone red Guigal La Mouline 1976 came third with a score of 97.5 points.\nA selection of the 100 great wines blind-tested in the 1970s test. French wines dominated, with eight of the top 10 positions, but Penfolds Grange managed to snare four spots inside the top 40. The 1976 Grange came 14th (96.5 points), the 1972 Grange 25th (95.5 points) and the 1970 Grange came 36th (94.5 points).\nPeter Gago, head winemaker at Penfolds and the man now entrusted to make Grange, says the result is an \"incredibly proud moment\" for Australia's most famous wine estate.\n\"I almost fell off my chair when I heard,\" Gago says. \"This isn't just competing with wines of one vintage or from one country. This is competing with the greatest wines from an entire decade, sourced from the whole world, and including some of the greatest vintages in the history of Bordeaux and Champagne.\n\"It was a blind tasting, too, with an international panel of judges, which removes any suggestion of bias. To have Australian wines not just compete, but top the list, is an incredibly proud moment for us.\"\n Penfolds chief winemaker Peter Gago. David Mariuz It's not the first time the 1971 Grange has bettered the French at their own game. In 1979, Penfolds caused a sensation in France when the upstart Australian winery topped the Gault-Millau Wine Olympiad in Paris. The1971 Grange beat some of the best Rhone wines ever made.\n\"If you had to point to a wine which fulfilled the ambitions of Grange it would have to be the 1971,\" Schubert remarked in 1993, just months before he passed away.\nAccording to the tasting notes, the 1971 Grange is \"medium deep brick red\" and \"an immensely complex and mature wine with lifted smoked meat, dark chocolate, mocha and liquorice aromas\".\nThe 1971 Grange is a blend of 87 per cent shiraz and 13 per cent cabernet sauvignon grapes, which were sourced from the Kalimna Vineyard in the Barossa Valley, and Magill Estate in Adelaide, Clare Valley and Coonawarra. The wine has an unusually low alcohol of around 12.3 per cent, which may have helped contribute to its incredible longevity.\nThe judging panel contemplates the best wines the 1970s had to offer. Schubert was sent to Jerez in Spain in 1949 to study sherry production and the making of fortified wines, which dominated Australian wine sales in the mid 20th century. He only travelled to Bordeaux as part of a private side trip on his way back to Australia. While in Bordeaux, he visited some of the great first growth estates, including Château Lafite Rothschild, Château Latour and Château Margaux.\nHistory shows the Australian learned much on that trip. At the latest judging, his Grange wines beat out all three of those famous estates, even from the legendary 1970 and 1975 Bordeaux vintages.\nGago points out that the 1971 Grange almost never came into being.\nSchubert made his first vintage of Grange in 1951. \"He was then told by management to stop making it, but secretly he defied orders and made three vintages on the side,\" Gago says. \"Just as well for me he did that.\"\nSchubert is deservedly considered one of the world's great winemakers. In the end, the company acquiesced to Schubert's request to make fine table wines.\nThe Penfolds 1971 Grange sells for upwards of $1500 a bottle, if you can find one. \"It's a very rare wine these days,\" Gago says.\nThe latest 2011 Grange, marking 40 years since the release of Schubert's seminal wine, is due for release on October 15.\nThe top 40 from the 1970s (as ranked by the FINE blind tasting)\n1.
