Here's What You Should Do \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) -- Way too many U.S. retirement savers believe they're seeing light at the end of the tunnel with their savings funds, but more likely, that light is coming from a speeding, oncoming train. Too much hyperbole? Not really - not when only 43% of Americans have put \"some thought\" into their retirement and 38% have not thought about it at all, according to fresh data from BMO Harris . More bad news on the retirement front. Even though BMO reports that 75% of non-retirees under 60 are utilizing a 401(k) or IRA account, signs are abundant that retirement investors are under-invested in their \"Golden Years\" portfolios. What's more, over 50% do not know how much they will need in retirement. To boot, only 19% of Americans under 60 have a \"definite idea\" what their retirement will look like . BMO Harris also surveyed current U.S. retirees, asking them what savings advice they'd give to the younger generation. Some 93% respondents strongly advised \"opening a 401(k) and/or IRA account as soon as possible and making regular contributions.\" \"We're seeing that today's retirees are satisfied with their retirement lifestyle -- what they have learned with the retirement planning process can serve as a model for future generations as they plan for their golden years,\" notes Stuart Thompson, head of premier banking strategy at BMO Harris Bank. \"The notion of an 'ideal retirement' changes with each generation.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T13:03:08.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
