It has the second largest amount of GDP at risk from earthquake behind Lima. \nLloyd’s said it has produced this Index to help increase the understanding of, and shape the world’s response to, the shifting risk landscape. \nThe findings showed the need for governments and businesses to work together to build more resilient infrastructure and institutions. \nInga Beale, CEO of Lloyd’s said: “Insurers, governments, businesses and communities need to think about how they can improve the resilience of infrastructure and institutions. Insurance is part of the solution. \n“Insurers must continue to innovate; ensure their products are relevant in this rapidly changing risk landscape, offer customers the protection they need and, as a result, contribute to a more resilient international community.” \nMark Cooper, Lloyd’s Middle East General Representative, added: “Lloyd’s City Risk Index highlights the economic exposure of the major cities in the Middle East and the significant levels of GDP at risk from both manmade and natural threats. \n“We are all too familiar with some of the natural threats and have robust contingency plans in place; however, we should be increasingly aware of a number of manmade and emerging threats highlighted in the report and the importance of risk management to mitigate the potential economic impact. \n\"The study shows that a market crash is the greatest economic vulnerability and this is also true in the Middle East, where $143bn could be at stake.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:14:04.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
