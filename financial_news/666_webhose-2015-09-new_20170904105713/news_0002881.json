Getty Images by Greg Smith This week has been the bumpiest of rides for Volkswagen, with revelations last weekend that the world's largest car maker has manipulated emission test results to make diesel vehicles appear less polluting. The company now faces an inquiry by a United States watchdog and fines are likely to run into the billions. The market reaction has been scathing, and VW is now trading at less than half the peak levels of €250 ($400) seen earlier this year.\nThe company has immediately set aside €6.5 billion to meet the costs and fines related to the scandal. However, investors have focused on the 11 million vehicles worldwide that may be equipped with software that could be used to cheat on emissions tests.\nThis is 20 times the 482,000 vehicles sold in the US that were initially indicated as being affected. A key issue is whether emissions test cheating took place outside the US.\nProsecution In terms of financial impacts in the US, customers may be entitled to direct compensation as well as any vehicle rectification, or even complete reimbursement. Regulatory fines could reach up to US$37,000 a vehicle, or a maximum of US$18 billion ($25.5 billion). Criminal prosecution is likely to be aimed at senior executives.\nThe wider issue is the brand impact for Volkswagen and how the scandal affects sales. In terms of Volkswagen's brand, credibility in clean car technology and general trustworthiness are likely to take a hit. We note that the group has been marketing \"clean diesel\" cars for some time. In the US around 4 per cent of the market is made up of diesel cars but in Europe they account for half of all the new cars sold. Volkswagen's diesel sales in Europe may suffer if they are now perceived to be less \"green\".\nOverall it is likely to be some time before we have a definitive guide to the global impact. The market, though, as always, has assumed the worst.\nDamaged momentum While a big, and unknown, number, Volkswagen should be reasonably well placed to meet the direct financial costs (if they fall into the middle of a fairly wide range of expectations). The company recently sold its stake in Suzuki for US$3.8 billion and key premium brands such as Audi and Porsche have also been delivering record monthly sales. However, the brand damage may interrupt Volkswagen's momentum in the US (around 9 per cent of sales volumes) and have an impact in Europe and Asia (both around 40 per cent of volumes). Concerns over the latter has already been weighing on the share price in recent months.\n\" Deep value\" has emerged in the stock, though, which now trades on around five times earnings, and already there are more than a few parallels (casualties not being one of them) with the crisis BP endured following the Gulf spill. Just as then, Volkswagen may prove an opportunity for the brave once the dust settles and as more colour is gained on likely outcomes. Another angle is that other stocks in the sector which have been tarnished with the same brush of sentiment (for example, BMW and Daimler) could prove to be compelling value if they are found to be squeaky clean.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.
