The 1906 single-story Craftsman home needs some work. OK, a lot of work. But the price is what has people talking. The asking price is $350,000, for 2 bedrooms, one bath and a mere 765 square feet — about the size of a hotel suite. A “(d)istinguished home in need of work,” is how Vanguard Properties agent Brian Tran describes it. \n“We keep an eye out for distressed homes, but this one went above and beyond,” said Tran in an interview. Tran said the house is currently under contract and spent just 10 days on the market before four all-cash offers rolled in. While Tran wouldn’t disclose the selling price because the transaction hasn’t closed, he said the seller is “very happy” with the price. \nThe currently boarded-up house, with security grates over its windows, is nestled between two story homes. You might actually miss it. \nDepending on the down payment, a 30-year mortgage for that home, if it sold at the $350,000 asking price, would be likely to run about $2,100 a month, not including property taxes and insurance. Tran estimated the property tax, calculated at 1.2% of the selling price, will be about $4,000 a year. \nNot surprisingly, given the shape of the actual building, Tran said the home’s value isn’t in the structure but in the land that it sits on. Tran said he didn’t know what the buyer’s plans are — whether the property will be razed and rebuilt to match the stucco homes in the neighborhood or rehabbed. \nThe San Francisco real-estate market is probably the hottest market in the U.S., with its median home value having just reached an all-time high of more than $1.1 million, up 14% in the past year, and it’s expected to climb another 5.2% in the year ahead, according to Zillow.com . \nThe median monthly rent in San Francisco is soaring, too, hitting $4,895 a month. Midtown Manhattan rents in August, by comparison, topped $3,460, according to StreetEasy, a New York real-estate research firm that’s part of the Zillow Group Z, -0.29% . \nEarlier this year, a fixer-upper along San Francisco’s famed Great Highway overlooking the Pacific Ocean, within walking distance of the city zoo and Golden Gate Park, sold for $1.2 million. \nThe tiny home at 16 De Long St. six miles away doesn’t have such views, as it backs on to the eight-lane 280 freeway and a Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, rail line that begins running at 5 a.m. and doesn’t stop until nearly 2.a.m. \nBut the flip side is that it’s just a 15-minute walk to the Daly City BART station, and a bus to the station runs every five minutes from nearby Mission Street . It’s also just 15 minutes to San Francisco International Airport by BART and 14 minutes to downtown San Francisco, also via BART. \n“Being close to public transportation in San Francisco is so key right now,” said Tran. “Even somebody like me who needs to be in his car, I find myself using public transportation here because traffic is bad.”\nBiking to the BART station takes just eight minutes, according to Google Maps. Getting on to the freeway isn’t difficult either, if you want to get out of town or into the city by car. Three golf clubs (Lake Merced, San Francisco Golf Club and the Olympic Club course) are nearby, too. \nAnd, for those late-night milk and beef jerky runs, a 7-Eleven convenience store stands just a few steps away at the corner of De Long and San Jose Avenue. \nSo maybe this $350,000 shack isn’t such a bad deal, after all.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T06:07:02.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
