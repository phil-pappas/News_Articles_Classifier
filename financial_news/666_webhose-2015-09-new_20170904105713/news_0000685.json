Don Simkovich \nMake three high quality films for the price of one, a bargain for filmmakers working in the animation space. The deal comes from House of Moves, a full-service animation production studio in Playa del Rey with 20 years experience. \nMeeting a Need \nThe production pricing isn't a fire sale or a way to drum up business, but it's a realistic aim, according to CEO Brian Rausch. His company has been the partner on projects that include HALO Reach, Mortal Kombat X and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. \nLike any successful business, House of Moves is meeting a need in the marketplace. In the feature film animation space, gaming, and specialty video productions there's a need to create high end content in a reasonable amount of time within a reasonable budget. \nThe studio is now using a proprietary technology that both streamlines a production and reduces the labor needed to get all the assets looking right. \n\"We're steaming actors, interactive props, lights, and visual effects directly into an engine ,\" says Brian. \"We shoot like it's theater, edit like it's TV, and animate like it's film.\" \nThe manhours, he explained, are spent getting scenes looking right and the process reduces the risk of financing only one production and hoping it 's a hit with the audience. \n\"It's very difficult to get high end content to screens quickly. We're able to reduce render times, increase throughput, maintain quality, and give Intellectual Property (IP) owners the ability to track their IP throughout the entire production process.\" \nCreating Efficiencies \nRecently, House of Moves has been working on the new Barbie Vlog, Mattel's move to use a character to discuss topics relevant to pre-teen and teenage girls. The studio started production with a blank slate. They got a script on a Monday and by Friday had an entire production ready to go, including shooting at full performance to capture the voice and all physical movements of an actress, create the environment, and work with the client to make adjustments. \n\"The client actually had their fingers in this the entire way through. We're so free in our process, we're like 'sweet, bring it on.'\" \nThe groundbreaking software technology is known as Helibug and enables House of Moves to create a space for directors that's like a live action set. They can light, block multiple cameras and trigger visual effects all in their final textured hi-resolution environment in real time. \nAn editor can build the story by the end of the day and within one to two working days, a production, especially one heading for viewing primarily on an iPad, can have a final look and feel without the added expense of post-production. \nBrian says Helibug can bring down the total cost of productions at any scale and, ultimately, that's a benefit for the client and the consumer who won't have to be charged continually higher fees to enjoy high quality entertainment. \nFor the latest on House of Moves' projects, visit their website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T04:53:09.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
