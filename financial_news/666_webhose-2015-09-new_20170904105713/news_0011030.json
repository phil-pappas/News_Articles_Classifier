But opponents said halting the funding would adversely affect the women's health services, including cancer screenings and wellness checks, which Planned Parenthood also provides to about 60,000 men and women a year. \nGov. Scott Walker — who has been touting the fact he cut state funding to Planned Parenthood on the presidential campaign trail — has said he supports efforts to curtail federal funding as well. \nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos has voiced his support for both bills and the fetal tissue research ban, saying they are likely to be debated this fall. Support is less clear in the Senate. Republican Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald has not said whether the bills will be debated. His spokeswoman Myranda Tanck said the bills will be discussed by Republicans in a closed caucus Sept. 16. \nAt least one Republican — Sen. Alberta Darling — has said she opposes the research ban on aborted fetal tissue because it would have a negative effect on work being done at the University of Wisconsin. \nOne of the bills heard Wednesday attempts to prevent Planned Parenthood from being eligible for federal Title X money allocated to the state of Wisconsin and is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. \nPlanned Parenthood receives more than $3 million from that grant each year, and is the only recipient in Wisconsin. \n\"When the money is being used to actively terminate human life, it is in direct conflict with its intended use,\" said the bill's co-sponsor Sen. Chris Kapenga, a Republican from Delafield. \nRep. Andre Jacque, a Republican from De Pere, introduced the bills in the Assembly. \nThe proposal will force health care providers that receive funding through the federal program to deny women referrals for abortions, said Eliza Cussen, chairwoman of NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin, a leading abortion rights advocacy group. \n\"This bill is the most dangerous bill to abortion rights we have seen in decades,\" Cussen said in a statement prior to the hearing. \nThe other bill targets family planning clinics that receive birth control drugs at a discounted rate through Medicaid. The proposal would require them to bill Medicaid only the actual acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee — a change that would cost Planned Parenthood an estimated $4.5 million a year. \nCutting off federal money for family planning services makes sense because doing that would make it harder for Planned Parenthood to have money to pay for abortions, said Matt Sande, legislative director of Pro-Life Wisconsin. \n\"These bills respect the consciences of Wisconsin taxpayers who oppose the use of public funds for abortion,\" Sande said in a statement. \nThere are 22 Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin, three of which perform abortions. Five clinics have closed since the state budget passed in 2011 by the Republican-controlled Legislature, and signed by Walker, did away with about $1 million in state funding each year. \nOpponents of the bills said they could lead to more clinics closing, further restricting access to health care services. \nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:58:50.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
