The ratification bonus would be $3,000. The automaker also would invest as much as $5.3 billion in the U.S. \nUAW President Dennis Williams is seeking ratification of the tentative agreement he reached with Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne so he can move on to Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. to seek similar, but more lucrative deals. The contract must be approved by more than 50 percent of the votes cast. The union document didn’t say when the membership vote will take place. \n“Back in 2007, we understood why we had to negotiate a dual-wage structure to address the historically dire financial problems Chrysler (and the other two Detroit automakers) went through at the time,” Williams and UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell said in the document, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “But that was then and this is now.” \nSenior assembly workers, who now make $28.05 an hour, would get 3 percent increases of 84 cents for the first year and 87 cents for the third year. They also would get 4 percent lump-sum bonuses of $2,404 for the second year and $2,476 for the fourth year. \nSecond-tier workers, who have started at $15.78 and hour, would see that rise to $17 on ratification of the new agreement and to $22 in the final year. The highest hourly rate for such workers would climb to $24 on approval of the contract and to $25.35 by the last year. Key Goal \nGetting raises for both groups of assembly workers was a key goal for Williams in the negotiations. Senior workers at Fiat Chrysler haven’t had a raise in nine years, while their counterparts at Ford and GM haven’t had one for a decade. \nThe Fiat Chrysler agreement also includes an improved profit-sharing formula, according to the UAW document. Workers would get $800 for each 1 percent of North American profit. Under the 2011 contract, they got $1,000 for every $1 billion of profit in the region. Second-tier workers can receive extra profit sharing when the margin exceeds 8 percent. \nThe ratification bonus is smaller than the payout workers received for approving the previous contract four years ago. For the 2011 contract, Fiat Chrysler workers were paid $3,500, while UAW members at GM got $5,000 and those at Ford received $6,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:23:42.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
