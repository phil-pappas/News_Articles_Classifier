Just ask financial planners how often they have clients come in thinking they’re well informed about money but really are making decisions based on myths. \nIf you’re letting what you believe to be a financial fact guide how you manage money without actually knowing whether there’s any truth behind it, you could be putting your finances at risk. Here are seven common myths that advisors frequently hear, and why you should stop believing them. \nSee: How a Financial Planner Helps You Reach Financial Goals 1. Budgets Are for People Without Money \nIt’s wrong to think that only people who need to watch every penny should have a budget. In fact, Edi Alvarez, a certified financial planner and founder of Aikapa , a wealth planning and management company, said she has each of her clients — regardless of income — track their expenses and create a budget. \nUnfortunately, many people hate budgets because they assume they’re meant to put a straight jacket on spending — that they’ll “stop them from living,” Alvarez said. “Budgets are intended only to be an understanding of your spending. Whether you use it to stop your spending (is) up to you.” \nThe process of budgeting allows you to figure out where your money is going, and if you’re sufficiently prioritizing needs over wants. A budget can also help clarify what you want to do with your hard-earned money. Alvarez asked, “Do you want to spend it all now or save for the future?” That’s a question everyone should be asking. \nRelated: 10 Ways to Take the Fear Out of Budgeting 2. Complex Investment Strategies Get Decent Returns \nKathleen Hastings, a certified financial planner and portfolio manager with FBB Capital Partners , said she’s had clients come to her with pie charts showing that their investments are divvied up among 20 asset classes ranging from U.S. stocks to obscure emerging market debt instruments. She said a portfolio can be “so overwhelming that it’s impossible to understand and doesn’t achieve what you’re looking for.” \nFor most people, a basic investment portfolio that is tailored to your risk tolerance and includes large and small company stocks, bonds and cash should get you the returns you want over the long term, she said. Even a target-date fund that adjusts your holdings as you near a certain age or goal — such as retirement — is a good place to start. “You’d be surprised how many of those outperform complex strategies,” Hastings added. 3. An Emergency Fund Needs to Cover You for Six Months \nAlvarez said she often hears that if you save for three to six months’ worth of expenses, that amount will guarantee you have enough to cover an emergency. “That’s just fallacy,” she said. It’s financial advice that is often touted, but everyone needs to look at their individual situation to figure out how much to set aside for emergencies. \nFor example, if you’re a tenured teacher or professor, your chances of losing your job are slim. So, you probably wouldn’t need to save for a potential long period of unemployment. \nHowever, your emergency fund should be able to cover unexpected expenses, such as a major car repair or insurance deductibles — assuming you have health, disability, life and long-term care insurance to cover catastrophic costs. If you’re self-employed, on the other hand, you might need a bigger cash reserve because it’s up to you to cover all of your expenses. The key is to consider what sort of emergencies you could be faced with. \nAlthough many people aren’t saving enough for emergencies, some people actually save too much. Alvarez said she sees new clients with hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings accounts but not much in investment accounts. These large cash accounts provide for every emergency but can’t grow or keep up with inflation. 4. Home Ownership Is Always a Good Investment \nYou’ve probably heard this before: “You’re just throwing your money away when you rent. A home is an investment.” The truth is, Alvarez said, “a home is often a losing proposition. It’s seldom an investment unless you treat it as one. It’s often a lifestyle asset that’s costing you every month and has an emotional — not business — link to your finances.” \nEven if you pay off your mortgage and live in your home for years, your tax bill can rise since you can no longer claim a mortgage interest deduction, said Alvarez. Your home will still need maintenance as you age too, and it is likely you’ll need to pay someone to do it for you. Lastly, you might need more assistance if you stay in your home. “Owning a home becomes a more expensive proposition as you go into retirement,” she said. \nNow, if owning a home is the lifestyle you want, there’s nothing wrong with that. However, Alvarez cautioned that the home you buy must be one you can afford. “Too much house can stop you from living,” she said. She also said that if you want to treat your home as an investment, you must be willing to sell and buy with some frequency to capture capital gains exclusion, which is one of the few tax-free ways to gain wealth. 5. Insurance Is a Waste of Money \nMany people forgo insurance, assuming they won’t need to use it. “People don’t want to spend money on insurance because they think it’s a waste of money,” Hastings said. “It’s better that you waste it than the alternative of not having it.” \nFor example, if you’re in a car accident that leaves you disabled and unable to work, your finances could be devastated if you don’t have disability insurance. If you’re sued for an accident and don’t have an umbrella liability policy for your car and home to protect your assets from lawsuits, all of your savings could be wiped out. That’s why you have to cover your risks with insurance. 6. Social Security Will Cover You in Retirement \nWhen it comes to Social Security, Alvarez said there are two common misconceptions. Some people don’t save for retirement because they assume their Social Security benefits will cover all of their needs. However, even if you get the maximum benefit — which is currently $2,633 — in most areas of the country you will need other sources of income in retirement to live comfortably. \nRelated: Can You Really Rely on Social Security in Retirement? \nPeople also assume that Social Security pays for Medicare, Alvarez said. You’re eligible for Medicare Part A, which provides hospital coverage, but might not cover prescriptions and other medical services. Also, neither Medicare nor Social Security cover long-term care from top to bottom. \nOn the flip side, many people assume that Social Security won’t be there for them when they retire. Despite the system’s funding issues, Social Security should be around for young adults when they reach retirement age. “There’s no better guaranteed income that can give you the guarantees that Social Security can,” Alvarez said. 7. Your Financial Advisor Will Handle Everything \nDon’t assume that because you’ve hired an advisor that you no longer have to take responsibility for your finances. “Nobody is going to care about your financial future and money as much as you do,” Hastings said. That’s why you have to understand the financial products you are sold or invest in and the plan your advisor creates for you. \nThat doesn’t mean you have to muck through the financial planning process on your own. Hastings said financial planners should take as much time as you need to answer your questions and provide financial planning help as you make periodic updates. If they aren’t doing that, it’s a sign you should fire your financial planner . \nShare This Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:46:50.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
