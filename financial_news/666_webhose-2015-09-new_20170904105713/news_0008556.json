Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague Ambush: the faceless men who stalked Abbott\nJulia Gillard may have beaten her to the Lodge, but is Julie Bishop Australia's most successful federal female politician?\nBishop emerged victorious in the overthrow of a first term prime minister this week , extending her reign as deputy Liberal leader to eight years under three different leaders.\nMore often than not, deputies are deposed along with the leader.\nClaire Underwood from The House of Cards has a similar death stare to Julie Bishop. \"She wouldn't be unique, but in political history she would be the first to survive that many [spills] in that position,\" says former deputy federal Liberal Party director Grahame Morris.\nThose behind the plot knew Bishop was crucial but protected her.\nDespite being close to Turnbull and privately upset at a number of Abbott's \"captain's calls\", sources say she refused to entertain talk of ousting Abbott.\nWhether it was conviction or a reluctance to be cast as the backstabbing, conniving woman as Gillard suffered so deeply from is a moot point. She remained loyal until the end.\n Turnbull plotters wanted to protect her. She is viewed as extremely capable and a strong asset for the party and was kept at arm's length.\nIt was at the eleventh hour, when Bishop was presented with a list of names that showed Malcolm Turnbull had secured the numbers – including from people she had previously felt unlikely to support him like Senator Scott Ryan – that she acted and told Abbott.\nIt was when he called the spill, including spilling her position as deputy, that she was cut free. She joined Turnbull.\n\"She never white-anted Abbott,\" says one source. \"She was a loyal deputy to a fault.\"\nBishop is smart and, like any politician holding power, at times ruthless.\nSome view her as Australia's version of Claire Underwood from the fictional TV series House of Cards , a cunning character intent on getting to the White House alongside her husband. The comparison perhaps aided by Bishop's short hair cut, immaculate dress sense and keenness for running.\nWhat's interesting about Bishop is that she has not just survived in the past couple of years, she has thrived.\nMost agree that Australia's first female foreign minister sits alongside Scott Morrison as the standout cabinet performers.\nThe awkward years managing the shadow treasury portfolio – which included not knowing the official RBA cash rate in 2008 – are long gone.\nIt has been replaced with a mature handling of the MH17 plane crash in Ukraine , winning her plaudits while Abbott was mocked for claiming he would \"shirtfront\" Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSporting striking power suits – her corporate uniform often sourced from Giorgio Armani – she chaired the Security Council of the United Nations and fought valiantly until the end to try to save the lives of Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.\nAbbott, on the other hand, was criticised for overreaching by linking Australia's financial aid following a tsunami in the region in 2004 with pleas for clemency.\nLeading Perth businessman John Poynton, a close friend of Bishop, says the woman who has evolved in the past couple of years is the result of a decision by Bishop to turn her back on a wall of advice on how to look and behave.\n\"I think she made a conscious decision a few years ago not to get whipsawed around by other people trying to get her to be someone else,\" Poynton says.\nShe has got fitter, trimmer, perfected the death stare and become a guru on social media by developing a fluency in emoji – pictures used in text messages and Twitter.\nShe's also struck a new relationship with property developer David Panton.\n\"She had a pivotal moment. She stopped listening to the advisers and decided to be herself. She has carved a different perception as a result but the Julie you see now is the Julie I've long known,\" Poynton says.\n\"She is highly intelligent. She's articulate and charming, and as a result can persuade people to support her views.\"\nIn the cut-throat, turbulent Canberra corridors of power Bishop has become an enduring force.\n\"She was a prominent lawyer in WA in the 1980s in an era dominated by men,\" says one political source.\nBishop studied law at Adelaide University before moving to Perth in 1983 – a result of her marriage to Perth property developer Neil Gillon. She practised commercial litigation for Clayton Utz. Bishop and Gillon would divorce five years later, but not before Bishop fell in love with Perth, which has remained her home.\nShe became Clayton Utz's managing partner in 1994.\nFour years later, and after a sabbatical studying at Harvard Business School, she decided to enter politics.\nHer illustrious career began winning the blue-ribbon seat of Curtin, making her the local federal member for Perth's business glitterati, including mining magnates Andrew Forrest and Gina Rinehart, and Wesfarmers managing director Richard Goyder.\nBishop became deputy Liberal leader under Brendan Nelson in November 2007, when the Liberal Party was in opposition.\nOne source says she considered going for the top job, but decided it was better to have a grounding as deputy before taking the next step.\nShe continued as deputy after Turnbull successfully rolled Nelson less than a year later. Then in December 2009, the climate change debate got the better of Turnbull, who was rolled by Abbott.\nYet again Bishop remained deputy. Abbott had wanted Joe Hockey or Andrew Robb, but Bishop's political instincts kicked in.\nAware of civil war raging in the party, one source says she made it clear she would not go quietly, forcing Abbott to stop the party bleeding and back her.\nSources say she runs her office like a law firm. It demands long hours but also attracts the bright people. She is also renowned for her work ethic. Some say she's ruthless. Others that she's \"tough as nails\".\nThe workload includes finding time to visit backbench electorates, be it Wyatt Roy in Queensland , Louise Markus in NSW or Kelly O'Dwyer in Victoria.\nIt's a tactic she learned from John Howard. It offers a certain \"rock star\" charm for backbenchers. And it wins loyalty.\nOne source says Bishop has developed a block of about 15 to 20 hard-core supporters. Some are extremely conservative; Bishop is more moderate.\n\"It's not a traditional factional base; she's just got a cult following,\" says one Canberra insider.\nMorris says Bishop has the trust of the backbench.\n\"Her colleagues know they can come and talk to her about anything; that's a terrific position to be in,\" Morris says.\nIn fact, some suggest if she wanted to she could have potentially won a ballot to become PM.\nBut she knew it would create a three-way contest and it risked blowing up both her and Turnbull if neither drew enough support to topple Abbott.\nSo she fell in behind Turnbull, and in doing so more than likely closed a door on ever being PM.\nIf Turnbull improves in the polls and wins the next election Australian politics will enter the Turnbull era.\nIf he doesn't, the party will clear the decks and generational change is likely. The door may be shut, but those who know her well say she's never been driven by blind ambition for the top job.\n\"She's not pathological like Malcolm,\" says one source.\nShe's happy as deputy and Foreign Minister, say her close friends.\n\"In the last few years, to a large degree, the prime ministership has become something of a poisoned chalice,\" says Poynton. \"If you have the job of your dreams why would you want to take that on? It is a huge honour to be PM but the job comes with huge stress and the extra layer of scrutiny, not just on you but on your partner.\"\nMark Barnaba, Macquarie WA chairman, is also a close friend of Bishop. He's adamant Bishop is the best female politician Australia has seen.\n\"Julie is simply a class act. She prioritises what is right for this country and its citizens, and what is right for the Liberal Party, above all else. Julie isn't in politics for herself only, and I think people see and respect that.\n\"I would say she is the equivalent of our Hillary Clinton. In my opinion, Julie has to be the most impressive female politician this country has seen.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JulieBishopMP", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-09-18T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:05:30.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
