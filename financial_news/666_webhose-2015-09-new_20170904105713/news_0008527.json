This follows a solid 0.7 percent gain in inventories and 0.4 percent sales increase in June.\nCheaper oil prices are weighing on wholesalers' holdings, while consumer spending elsewhere has yet to fully offset the steep drop in petroleum costs. Oil inventories - which are measured in dollars - plunged 4.8 percent in July and 19.8 percent over the past 12 months.\nInventories for autos, furniture and groceries advanced in July, while pharmaceutical drugs fell.\nDespite the overall July decrease in stockpiles, wholesale inventories are at a seasonally adjusted $584.3 billion, 4.9 percent above a year ago.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:23:46.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
