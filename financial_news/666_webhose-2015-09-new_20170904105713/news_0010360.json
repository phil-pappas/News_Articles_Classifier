This is to match up with Apple's directive to telcos to start accepting pre-orders from only 12.01am California time.\nThis is also when all the telcos will ramp up their marketing and advertising, using templates that have been approved by Apple HQ.\nAustralian telcos could theoretically have started releasing their pricing to the public from midnight on Thursday evening / Friday morning. But most are planning to wait until Saturday afternoon to prevent their rivals from tactically matching or lowering their prices to win more customers.\nA key point to watch for customers buying the Apple iPhone 6S using a 12-24 month contract is how much extra you're forced to pay above the contract price to get the phone you desire. The long-term trend amongst the Big 3 carriers has been to pass on more of the cost to consumers.\nThe Australian dollar has fallen substantially against the US dollar since the Apple iPhone 6 launch last year and this could lead to plans being more expensive.\n But all the mobile carriers have been fighting to increase the amount of download data that comes included with phone plans and they're desperate to keep winning more customers to maintain market share and growth.\nSo if you can spare the time and effort, call your telco and see what kind of offer they're willing to make to keep you as a customer.\nIt's also worth thinking about buying the phone outright before getting a \"BYO\" contract with your operator of choice. Doing so will save you money and give you more control.", "external_links": ["http://www.optus.com.au/shop/mobile/phones/iphone/iphone-6s?SID=con:hme:15apl:postmob:afeat:iph6s2:prereg", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "https://www.telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/apple"], "published": "2015-09-11T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:03:17.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
