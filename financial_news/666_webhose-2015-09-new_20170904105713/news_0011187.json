As he lifted it, the fish relieved itself on his shoes. \"Uh-oh. What happened there?\" he asked.\nObama spoke with Alannah Hurley of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who is part of a coalition fighting the mine.\nHurley told reporters before his arrival, \"We have never seen a mine the size of the Pebble project.\"\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has placed restrictions on the proposed mine, which the company is fighting in court.\n\"Our view is that if the president is interested in the issue he should try to hear from all perspectives about it including those closest to Pebble who would like the jobs Pebble may provide,\" said Mike Heatwole, a spokesman for Pebble Limited Partnership.\nObama did not directly address the mine in brief remarks to reporters.\nIn December, he took steps to designate the fish-rich Bristol Bay area \"off limits\" for oil and gas leasing to protect the fishing industry.\nThe White House noted at the time that the area off Alaska's coast supports a $2 billion annual fishing industry as well as the tourism sector.\n\"There are other threats to this environment that we've always got to be alert to,\" Obama said.\nThe stops in remote communities, at the end of a three-day tour of Alaska, will add to Obama's legacy of improving ties with Native Americans. He has also traveled by foot and boat to see glaciers that are quickly receding due to climate change.\nObama boasted this week that he will have visited more tribal communities than any previous sitting president by the time he leaves office.
