We must remain vigilant in addressing this new reality of Ethiopian health.\" \nCountries that went backwards include Lesotho and Swaziland, where life expectancy has decreased by a decade, with smaller drops recorded in South Africa, Botswana, Belize, Belarus and Paraguay. \nDespite progress in recent years, the fastest-growing global cause of health loss since 1990 has been HIV/AIDS. Heart disease, stroke, lower back and neck pain and road injuries are all on the rise, while diarrhea, birth complications and respiratory infections have all declined. \nThe 10 countries with the highest life expectancy at birth are Japan, Singapore, Andorra, Iceland, Cyprus, Israel, France, Italy, South Korea and Canada. \nThe 10 lowest are Lesotho, Swaziland, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Chad, South Sudan and Zambia. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T03:57:39.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
