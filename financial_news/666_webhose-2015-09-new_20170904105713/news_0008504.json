This would reverse a decision by a previous Labour government to let the central bank decide monetary policy. \nThe Conservative Party, which won a May election on a pledge to cut public spending and deliver economic stability, has warned that Corbyn's policies are a threat to the country's economic security. \nHowever, another of Corbyn's appointments, foreign affairs spokesman Hilary Benn, tried to ease fears over the party's stance on an upcoming European Union referendum, promising Labour would campaign for Britain to stay in the bloc \"under all circumstances\". \nMcDonnell has also said Britain's rail system should be renationalised and that the power of the country's six big energy suppliers should be reduced by expanding renewable energy production in local communities. \nIn 2010 he stirred controversy by quipping that if he could return to the 1980s he would assassinate Margaret Thatcher, Britain's Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990. He later apologised for the comment which he said was a joke. \nCorbyn's leadership rival Andy Burnham was appointed shadow home secretary.
