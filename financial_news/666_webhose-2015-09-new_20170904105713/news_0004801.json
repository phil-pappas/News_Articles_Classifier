(credit: Andrew Cunningham) \nApple announced today that the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have sold a total of 13 million units in their first weekend, continuing the company’s tradition of outdoing the previous year’s sales every time it introduces a new iPhone model. \nThere are a few factors that contribute to the increased sales. First, Apple had another week to rack up online preorders ahead of the iPhone’s first weekend in stores—the phones usually launch about a week after preorders begin, but this year there were two weeks between the start of preorders and in-store availability. The devices were also available in China, Apple’s fastest-growing market, on launch day, something that wasn’t true last year. \nApple also provided some details on the iPhone’s launch in additional territories. On October 9, the 6S and 6S Plus will be available in Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan.
