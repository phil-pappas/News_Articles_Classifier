Michel O'Sullivan Share on twitter by Philip Baker Justin Braitling probably wouldn't describe himself as a mythbuster. But he's got a message for any investor out there who thinks that by having a diversified portfolio they're safe.\nThis time round, you're not safe at all. Far from it.\n\"Portfolio theory would have you believe asset diversification is the best means of diversifying risk and this is the principle means of risk mitigation employed by most investors. Unfortunately when this asset reflation cycle turns, investors will discover the shortcomings of this defence,\" says the director of Watermark Funds Management.\nHaving a diversified portfolio has always been seen as the key to any successful long-term investment strategy.\nIt's meant to help investors get a more consistent return over time and in theory reduces their risk.\nMost investors think of having a split between shares, bonds and property, and that when one does badly the others come to the rescue.\nWhen it comes to shares the idea is to balance your investments across a range of sectors from resources to banks to energy to technology, communications and so on.\nThat way investors can balance the normal ups and downs. But lately, it's just been down.\n Stock indices drop The month of August was a shocker and the major S&P ASX 200 index fell 8.5 per cent , the worst month since a 12 per cent drop in October 2008. This past week the index has fallen another 4.5 per cent and is now down 10 per cent this calendar year.\nBut August was a good month for Watermark Market Neutral Wholesale Trust, a fully hedged fund, meaning half the fund is held in short positions and half in long positions.\nBasically the fund uses the money it gets from borrowing and selling the shares it didn't like, to invest in the companies it did.\nBraitling reckons it's a highly attractive but poorly understood strategy.\nThe fund was up 4 per cent in August and over the past six months it has returned 15.7 per cent, compared with a 9.4 per cent fall in the All Ords Accumulation index.\nThe one-year return is 12.8 per cent, compared to a fall of 3 per cent in the accumulation index, while the three-year return is 16.7 per cent and 15.6 per cent over five years. Both are well above the 11 per cent and 7.9 per cent return from the accumulation index.\nSo what happens now?\nBrace yourselves for more selling. And not just in shares.\n\"We believe risks remain elevated in shares even though they have fallen sharply. This is true in fact of most asset classes as they have all benefited from excessive monetary stimulus,\" says Braitling.\nBut now it's all coming to an end.\nDespite the latest signals from the European Central Bank on Thursday night that implied the bank is still open to the idea of further stimulus, there's a concern among investors that central banks have done all they can and there's still not enough growth around.\nEasing flows to be turned off In the meantime all asset classes have been winners from the strategy of ultra-cheap money so now there's going to be the fallout. And it won't be enough to be diversified.\nAs Braitling points out, the correlation across asset classes in this cycle has been very high, as all assets have benefited from extremely low interest rates.\n\"This was clearly evident in August when we saw heavy losses not just in shares but in traditional safe haven assets like treasuries as well. The only true means of protecting one's wealth when this cycle turns will be to hold cash or to hedge,\" he says.\nWhat makes the Watermark fund stand out is it has had a negative correlation, minus 0.25, with the share market since it began.\nThat's unusual but there's a range of funds out there that have a neutral market style.\nIf Braitling is right this cycle will test investors and their asset diversification theory so maybe it's time to work out what a neutral fund is all about.\nBasically the old diversify cliche encourages investors to take on risk they don't want and it also means they avoid holding cash.\nBraitling says \"that's not right\" and there's nothing wrong with holding high levels of cash if it's appropriate to do so.\nExpect interest rates to rise He also sees some early signs of a \"breakdown\" in financial markets right now and warns then when it all turns it will be tied in with more normal level of interest rates and a \"diminishing confidence in policy makers\".\nWhat makes it all tricky is how policymakers react as they have shown little willingness to sit back and watch losses in financial markets stack up as their whole strategy revolves around supporting the economy with higher asset prices.\n\"When asset prices fall investors lose confidence and when the tide turns it all collapses,\" says Braitling.\nA worrying sign this week has been the performance of high quality government bonds. Normally there would be a switch into safe haven assets like bonds when shares don't so well but that switch hasn't happened and that's the point Braitling is making about the perils of diversification.\nThat means it's time to do \"what big brother doesn't want to you to, hold cash\", he says.\n\"They want you to take risk, but the only way to avoid market risk is hold cash or go short. The traditional method will fail investors as the end of the debt cycle comes unstuck and growth remains low despite these record low rates,\" adds Braitling.\nIn recent times the fund has been short biotechs, the contractors and the more speculative end of the resources sector.\nStocks it has held include Qantas, Harvey Norman, infrastructure and agricultural names.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-ecb-to-the-rescue-20150903-gjevbt.html"], "published": "2015-09-04T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:06:44.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
