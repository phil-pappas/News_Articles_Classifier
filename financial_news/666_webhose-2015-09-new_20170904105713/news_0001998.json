And \"is the argument getting though?\". Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Conservative broadcaster Alan Jones has chastised the Coalition saying it is failing to effectively refute Labor Party and union arguments that the China free trade agreement puts Australian jobs at risk.\nInterviewing Trade Minister Andrew Robb, Mr Jones asked \"why don't you put the boot in?\" And \"is the argument getting though?\".\nA taken aback Mr Robb paused, laughed, and said: \"well I think you know we've been attempting to\".\n\"I asked my team to tell you off air, the argument that is read by those listening to you every day is that Chinese companies for projects over 150 million will be able to bring their own workforce into the country and they won't have to offer the jobs to local workers first,\" Mr Jones said.\nThe key changes in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement are subtle and varied , making them particularly vulnerable to confusion and misrepresentation in a heated political debate.\nIn July, unions launched an emotive prime-time TV advertisement against the government's free trade agreement with a father telling his son the news that there will be \"no jobs\" out of the deal.\nLabor say they are concerned about loose language in the deal regarding the importation of tradespeople such as electricians, and the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, ramped up his accusations of racism against Labor, question why the opposition had supported similar deals with similar labour market provisions with Japan, South Korea and Chile.\nOvernight Indigenous leader Nyunggai Warren Mundine joined a raft of former and sitting Labor leaders – such as Bob Hawke, Bob Carr, Daniel Andrews, Jay Weatherill, Andrew Barr and Luke Foley – who have pushed the party to not put the deal at risk.\n Mr Mundine conceded, however, that the Coalition had issues getting their message through on the FTA, a point Trade Minister Andrew Robb has acknowledged , saying he does not underestimate the power of advertising.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://twitter.com/ColinJBettles/status/641499898328670208", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-10T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:06:54.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
