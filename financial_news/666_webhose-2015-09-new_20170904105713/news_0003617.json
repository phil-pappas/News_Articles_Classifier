But for those retiring to countries such as Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, the state pension is frozen . \nSince it fails to rise each year, it becomes worth less and less in real terms as each year passes and the cost of living goes up. \nFigures from the Department for Work and Pensions released earlier this year show that more than half of all state pensions for expats are frozen, affecting about 560,000 people. \nDespite constant campaigning and various court cases brought by pensioner groups abroad, there has been no progress. Those affected are, in some cases, getting derisory amounts. Some pensioners in their 90s are getting as little as £17 per week. \nThe sense of injustice is all too real . \nThe countries where pensions are frozen for British expats primarily the Commonwealth ones seem to the outsider to be arbitrarily chosen. Since the state pension is also paid out based on National Insurance contributions made throughout your life, these people will in many cases have paid full contributions but be treated differently to their compatriots who either stay in the UK or choose to retire elsewhere. \nToday you need to have paid in 30 years' worth of NI contributions to qualify for a full state pension. Previously women needed to pay 39 years to qualify, while men had to pay 44 years, so those currently affected will typically have paid more into the system to qualify than their younger counterparts. \nFor some expat pensioners, the frozen pension problem bites to such an extent that far from being able to enjoy their retirement overseas, they are finding they can no longer live independently and have to rely on their family to help them financially. Worse still, some are even being forced to return home. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) pensions minister Ros Altmann has previously said she would like to see the Government \"look again\" at the issue of frozen pensions. As a consumer campaigner on issues affecting older people prior to her appointment, Baroness Altmann has worked to improve the pensions situation for the masses. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) though she has now been expelled from the Labour Party she was still a paid-up member despite being a Conservative minister she and Mr Corbyn could get their heads together on this issue. \nThere are few greater injustices in pensions that need putting right. \nAlison Steed is founder and editor of MyMoneyDiva.com , a personal finance website offering information and deals  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:50:43.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
