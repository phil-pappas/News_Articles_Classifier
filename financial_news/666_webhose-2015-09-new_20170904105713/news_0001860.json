It was buying 120.18 yen in early Asian trade, slightly above late U.S. levels after falling as low as 119.80 yen overnight in the wake of the Fed's more downbeat assessment.\n\"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\" the U.S. central bank said.\nThe latest count put 13 of 17 Fed policymakers expecting to raise interest rates in 2015, down from 15 at the bank's June meeting. Four policymakers, up from two, now believe the bank should stand pat until at least 2016.\n\"With the overwhelming majority in the FOMC still expecting to hike this year, and the domestic economy maintaining its momentum, we stick to our call of a December rate hike,\" strategists at Rabobank said.\n\"Although Yellen said that October remains a possibility, we doubt that the economic data between now and then will be sufficient to hike,\" they said in a note to clients.\nRates futures placed an 18 percent chance that the U.S. central bank would end its near-zero interest rate policy in October, down from 41 percent Thursday morning, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.\nThe Australian dollar edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7182 with investors focused on parliamentary testimony by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens.
