The timing of Australia's official daily data dump is under review. AP by Geoff Winestock In a move that could change the sleep patterns and lunch habits of bond traders, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is considering changing the release time of its official data from 11.30am.\nThe ABS is unusual in releasing market moving data so close to the time when the minds of financial traders often turn to the choice of a restaurant. Eurostat puts out its data at 11am. The US Economics and Statistics Administration puts out its reports at either 8.30am or 10am and in Britain the Office for National Statistics hits the publish button at 9.30am.\nDavid Kalisch, Australia's chief statistician, said he was not sure exactly what time of day or night might be more convenient. Alternatives include 8.30am before markets open as in the United States, or 1am â€“ the release time for Productivity Commission reports.\n\"What is actually a good time? It's not obvious to me because there are such different purposes and reasons for timing, part of which has got to be what's suitable for [ABS] processes. In terms of users, 11.30 worked well in the pre 24-7 time period but do we move to 1am like the PC [Productivity Commission]?\"\nStephen Halmarick, head of economic and market research at Colonial First State, suggested the data should be published earlier.\n\"Maybe the US is the good model: 8.30 when the bond market opens. You could get them out early. You are ready to get on with your day,\" he said.\nLunch timing In response Dr Kalisch quipped that would make it easier for people in financial markets to get to lunch early. Mr Halmarick said it would not affect him because he no longer had the job of writing the briefing notes for clients after the official data was released.\n \"I don't have to write the notes any more. All these guys write them for me,\" he said.\nPaul Brennan of Citi global markets said releasing data at 11.30am was \"archaic\" and dated back to a time when the ABS reports had to be hand delivered to offices around the country.\nChanging the release time could have consequences for where trading happened: if the time was early in the morning financial markets in the US could still be open.\nMr Kalisch said the review of release times was only part of a much wider modernisation program that had been made possible by a decision in the May budget to give the ABS an extra $250 million over the next five years.\nIn the next six months the ABS will start public consultation on the data release time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:18:59.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
