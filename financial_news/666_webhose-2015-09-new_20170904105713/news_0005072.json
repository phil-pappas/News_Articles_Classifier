AP Share on twitter by Katie Walsh The technology behind Bitcoin, which can be used to build \"smart\" contracts, and a coming surge of 3D printing carrying massive patents implications, are among the disruptions that will shake the legal world: but consultants warn that the classical training that makes lawyers conservative beasts is holding them back from the innovation necessary to thrive in a technology-dominated future.\nLexisNexis Pacific head of strategy Denise Farmer said that innovation inertia remained a barrier, despite momentum among many law firms and across in-house corporate teams.\n\"Innovation in the legal sector really is gaining traction and is no longer happening on the periphery – we're seeing it move mainstream and traditional firms adopting dedicated innovation roles,\" Ms Farmer said.\nBut a LexisNexis survey of more than 140 law firms of all sizes on the topic showed that \"collective trained conservatism will hold the profession back in terms of innovation and partnership structures can act as an 'innovation killer',\" she said.\n\"The need to move away from time billing to alternative pricing structures was probably the topic that generated most heated debate everywhere we went.\"\nInnovation important Ms Farmer said the broader results – including that 96 per cent of firms thought innovation was important – added to optimism that there was \"real momentum to up the ante in terms of innovation\".\n Corrs Chambers Westgarth, which launched legal resourcing company Orbit and has introduced a communication tool that helps mitigate risk in the event of a crisis, is among award winners at a Lawtech summit on the Gold Coast on Thursday night.\nFuture Crunch co-founder Angus Hervey said that the world was a much better place than most thought and business was picking up but warned that lawyers couldn't write off code as \"something for the geeks\".\n\"That's what the internet was in the 1990s. It was clunky; the law firms said 'we're lawyers, we've been around for hundreds of years, it's not going to change anything'.\"\nCode was enabling \"smart contracts\" that cut out lawyers in the process; in particular, \"block chain\" technology that underlies products like Bitcoin.\n\"The best thing a law firm can do right now is hire five really great coders. See what they can create,\" he said. \"It sounds crazy but if I was a partner at a law firm, that's something that I would start thinking about very quickly.\"\nLaw firms should pull highly talented, over-achieving Generation Y graduates off \"drudge work\" and get them to work on products that could \"destroy\" the business if they were offered by competitors, he said.\n\"They're the ones that can see it coming. The older generation can't.\"\nMr Hervey, who advises on how to future-proof businesses through science and technology advancements, said that the changing nature of manufacturing would have big implications for patents and commercial law.\nProcesses were moving from large factories into the hands of smaller businesses and individuals, led by 3D printing which Mr Hervey said was far more advanced than most realised.\nWithin five years, people will be able to scan any object with their mobile phone and send the diagnostic for printing, he predicted.\n\"If you think the wars around copyright around music and video have been big, wait until we are able to copy anything anywhere,\" he said.\n\"These things are coming whether you like it or not, and the more you start to engage with these ideas the better prepared you'll be when that disruption starts happening. It's not like a comet or a lightning bolt from the sky. It happens quite gradually.\n\"Technology will be at the heart of what most companies do.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh"], "published": "2015-09-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:06:40.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
