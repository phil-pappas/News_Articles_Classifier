Many policymakers still cling to hope that inflation will rise enough to allow them to consider phasing out QQE around 2017.\nBut with a sales tax hike looming that year, many analysts doubt the BOJ can withdraw stimulus so soon.\nIf the BOJ bumps into trouble buying JGBs, some analysts say it could abandon the 0.1 percent interest the central bank pays on reserves the financial institutions park in BOJ accounts, or even charge a fee for them. That might particularly hurt regional banks, which are already struggling with thin margins on bond investments.\n\"The BOJ can combine this step with an increase of risky asset purchases and call it a new version of QQE,\" said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas, who was once considered a candidate to fill a BOJ board vacancy.\n\"That would effectively mean shifting the BOJ's target to interest rates from the volume of money.\"\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has ruled out the idea as it would make it hard to achieve the BOJ's base money target by discouraging banks from depositing funds with it.\nBut he also said that in Europe, negative interest rates had had essentially the same effect as QQE in pushing down yields across the curve.\nThe IMF's Kochhar said cutting the 0.1 percent interest could be one way to \"get the money out the door\".\n\"The BOJ has told us while nothing is ruled out, they would watch carefully the European Central Bank's experience.\" ($1 = 119.7500 yen) (Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Will Waterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T00:21:06.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
