(Submitted photo) Top Projects: Surly Destination Brewery By: Frank Jossi September 4, 2015 7:05 am 0 \nEditor’s note: This is the 19th installment in Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects of 2014 series. Previous installments are a vailable here . \nProject name: Surly Destination Brewery \nAddress: 520 Malcolm Ave. SE, Minneapolis \nProject cost: $17 million \nProject size: 50,000 square feet \nOwner: Surly Brewing Company \nArchitect: HGA Architects and Engineers \nEngineer: HGA Architects and Engineers \nWhile Surly always has been widely heralded among beer geeks, its new “destination brewery” takes the brand to another level. Built not just as a brewery but also as a regional attraction, the Surly Destination Brewery seats hundreds on two floors and has an undeniable, and intentional “wow” factor. \nThe building looks nothing like its warehouse neighbors. A long line of bike racks leads visitors from the parking lot to an entrance with an outdoor fireplace and rock-encased fountain. Inside, a massive beer hall features walls of windows showcasing the brewery production on one side and an outdoor area on the other. \nSan Diego’s Stone Brewery served as inspiration, but only to a point. “We made that design [of Stone Brewery] look like it was done by Boy Scouts compared to the theatrical awe and power and connectivity of Surly,” said architect Steven Dwyer. \nIndeed, everything connects. The second-floor restaurant and event area overlooks the beer hall and the outdoor area. Floor-to-ceiling windows are everywhere, including those along the first floor that open on warm days to the garden. \nThe architecture is intended to reflect the industrial site while focusing on the west side, where an outdoor patio, amphitheater, beer deck and garden seamlessly flow together outside, he said. \nMore than a dozen sustainable features, from storm water retention to solar-powered water closet flush valves, save money and lend an environmental patina to the operations. The project was also assembled from several brownfield sites in Minneapolis only a short walk from a Green Line light rail station, he added. \nMcGough’s Tim Nagle said the site required removing substructures from the previous building on the site and the removal of contaminated soil, a process that took more than three months. Surly owner Omar Ansari “wanted to do it right and he wanted to do it smart,” he said. \nWhen approaching Surly, it’s hard to miss a grain elevator, purposely left as a testament to the Twin Cities’ architectural and economic heritage, added Dwyer. That beacon, the brew and the building have brought visitors from around the world. “We see Surly as an ambassador for all of Minnesota,” he said. \nA gallery of additional images is below: Pause Play Play Prev | Next The Surly Destination Brewery’s beer hall features walls of windows showcasing the brewery production on one side, pictured, and an outdoor area on the other.
