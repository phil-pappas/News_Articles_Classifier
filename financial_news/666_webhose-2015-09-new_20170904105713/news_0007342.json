Powers", "Sean Nichols"], "text": "By Sean Nichols Sep 11, 2015 BNP Partners has moved to reassure clients waiting for confirmation of their allocations of Ferrari IPO stock that the marked volatility in US equity markets is unlikely to affect their investment when the floatation takes place in the fourth quarter of 2015.\"We've received an influx of emails and calls from clients expressing concern that the steep falls in the US indices could somehow affect their allocations or even see the most highly-anticipated IPO of the year postponed,\" explained Gerald E. Powers, Chief Investment Officer at BNP Partners. US stock markets have taken their cue from precipitous declines in the mainland Chinese bourses which show little sign of finding a bottom as investors continue to worry over the extent of the economic slowdown in the world's second largest economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Ferrari stocks will trade when current owners FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) sell 10% of its stake, fell over 1,000 points at the start of trade on Monday's morning before recovering to close out the day's trading down 588 points. \"This volatility is a knee jerk reaction to what's going on here in China and, frankly, we think that's being a little overdone. We can't see anything short of a full financial crisis derailing the Ferrari IPO. If anything, the turmoil could result in the stock debuting at a lower price which would be great news for investors,\" added Powers.BNP Partners reiterated its view that, regardless of short term volatility in broader markets, the Ferrari IPO would continue to represent a ground level opportunity for ordinary investors to buy into one of the world's most prestigious brands.About BNP Partners:At BNP Partners, they define effective wealth management as an overall strategy that seamlessly integrates their clients' personal ROI (return-on-investment) aspirations with their investment management prowess.Whilst today's markets can often demonstrate the type of characteristics that have served to hamper the efforts of many traditional investment methodologies to secure the returns they once did, BNP Partners continue to secure exceptional returns for their esteemed clients utilizing a meticulously applied combination of those same traditional methods whilst diligently complementing them with new, pioneering techniques.
