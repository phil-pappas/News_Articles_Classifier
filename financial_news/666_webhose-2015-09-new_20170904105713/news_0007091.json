This is Kapil Sharma’s Bollywood debut and he seems to have got a big dollop of beginner’s luck. Reports coming in from all quarters of the country suggest that ‘Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon’ has started on a very good note and that will carry it on a high note through the week.\n‘Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon’ box office collections have got the huge benefit of releasing on ‘Eid’ holiday and the best part is still to come as Saturday and Sunday make for an extended weekend, which should lure people to theatres in large numbers.\nThe film has opened well in not just metros but also in smaller centers, which indicates that it has attracted multiplex as well as single screen audiences. This romantic comedy flick opened to packed houses at several theaters and it seems the negative reviews from critics have not hampered the opening day occupancy of the film.\nWith negative reviews being sidelined by audiences, the film is likely to receive good word-of-mouth boost.\nThe movie has also received a boost in the form of its rival release Madhur Bhandarkar’s ‘Calendar Girls being targetted at mature audiences, leaving the rest of the movie-going public with little choice than to watch Kapil Sharma – filled with bikini-clad women, the film looks to have lacked depth and reportedly it has not fared well on day 1.\nKapil Sharma’s comedy flick is directed by Abbas Mustan and is a family entertainer although bizarrely, it features a man who has to handle 3 wives simultaneously! But then, with Kapil Sharma, you always have to expect the unexpected.\n(With Bollywood Hungama inputs)\n 25, 2015 8:35 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T08:21:04.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
