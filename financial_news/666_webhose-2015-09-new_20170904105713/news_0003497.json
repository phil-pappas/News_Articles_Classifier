The mine is expected to employ some 500 workers. \nOfficials say it's the biggest gold mine in Guyana since Omai Gold Mines Ltd. ceased operations in 2005. That mine was shuttered after waste overflowed into a nearby dam and caused an environmental disaster. \nGold is Guyana's main export and generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2013. But earnings have since dropped because of weaker gold prices. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T21:48:22.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
