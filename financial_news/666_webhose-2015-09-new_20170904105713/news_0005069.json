We’re here not only to applaud the record-breaking achievements and commercial successes of the legal industry, but also to celebrate the spirit of Halsbury – the whole of the law and the legal community connected – encapsulated so well by tonight’s winners. Recognising and rewarding how we, as a profession, respond to the challenges facing the rule of law and access to justice at home and abroad puts these awards in a class of their own.”\nSerjeants’ Inn Chambers and Ropewalk Chambers scooped the London and Regional Chambers of the Year Awards respectively, while the award for Law Firm of the Year (50+ employees) went to Brachers and Crossland Employment Solicitors scooped Law Firm of the Year (fewer than 50 employees).\nThe Innovation Award went to the National Archives for its revolutionary approach to managing and organising legislation while Just for Kids Law was honoured for its end to end commitment to children in crisis.\nEmeritus Professor Andrew Ashworth QC was distinguished for his superlative Academic Contribution.\nThe full list of winners can be found at: http://www.halsburylegalawards.co.uk .\nAbout LexisNexis Legal & Professional\nLexisNexis Legal & Professional ( http://www.lexisnexis.com ) is a leading global provider of content and technology solutions that enable professionals in legal, corporate, tax, government, academic and non-profit organisations to make informed decisions and achieve better business outcomes.
