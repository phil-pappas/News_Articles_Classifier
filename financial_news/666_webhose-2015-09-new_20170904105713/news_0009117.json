Every major currency in the region weakened against the dollar, while the MSCI Latin American stock index dropped for the seventh session in eight. Data on Monday showed profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined 8.8 percent in August from a year ago. Signs of economic deceleration in China are problematic for Latin America, which counts on the country as a major purchaser of its raw materials exports. Commodities prices erased the previous session's gains, dragging the Chilean and Colombian pesos about 0.5 percent lower. The region's currencies also saw downward pressure from growing expectations for a U.S. interest rate increase after New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley suggested the U.S. central bank could pull the trigger as soon as October. Brazil's real fluctuated near the four-per-dollar level, seen by most traders as an important psychological threshold. The currency has been hammered by expectations for a worsening economic recession and higher inflation. A central bank poll released before the market open on Monday showed economists expect a contraction of 1 percent in 2016, up from estimates of 0.8 percent a week earlier. In equities markets, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index slumped for the seventh session in a row, driven lower by shares of mining firm Vale SA. Vale counts China as its biggest customer and tends to swing on the outlook for the world's No.2 economy. Mexico's IPC stock index and Chile's IPSA stock index both fell about 1.2 percent.
