An EPC is required for every home put up for sale. \nCurrently, banks take your region, income and household size into account when working out your energy spending. \nBut analysis of the energy habits of 2,600 households shows that predicting energy bills becomes more accurate when EPC ratings are added to the mix, which analyse installations like home insulation and double-glazing. \nIf you look at a person's age and the type of home they are buying details already included on mortgage applications the predicted bill spending becomes even more accurate. \nA new semi-detached house which costs £650 a year to power, for example, is assumed by banks to cost £1,600 in the same period. But using their model, the authors of the study said they could accurately predict this energy spend to the penny. \nBy overestimating energy bills in this highly efficient property, the shortfall over the term of the mortgage (25 years) increases to £45,000, the report claims. Its calculations included a 5pc energy price rise. \nRichard Griffiths, of the Green Building Council, one of the co-authors of the report, said: \"The Government wants lenders to be more responsible, but they're currently failing to account for the energy costs faced by would-be borrowers.\" \nThe report goes further, claiming that people in poorly-insulated properties are being given \"too much\" money by banks which underestimate their energy bill spending. \n\"This also means lenders are potentially giving more money to buyers of inefficient properties than they can truly afford,\" Mr Griffiths said. \n= Verdict = \nCritics warn that lending extra money on green homes could fuel unfair practices by banks and penalise buyers who can only afford to buy run-down homes. \n\"Lenders are already scrutinising every aspect of a mortgage applicant's income and outgoings, so adding energy-efficiency into the equation will make life even more complicated,\" said Jonathan Harris, of broker Anderson Harris. \n\"Borrowers are being discriminated against even though they can easily 'afford' the mortgage they require because they are deemed too old or pay school fees, for example.\" \nIntroduced last year to prevent irresponsible lending, the \"Mortgage Market Review\", or MMR, told lenders they are responsible for making sure borrowers can afford their repayments. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority said borrowers and banks would be better off if banks have the power to scrutinise your lifestyle including energy bill spending, gym membership and shopping habits. \nBut among the unintended consequences are a rise in borrowers being unfairly denied home loans despite earning a good wage , on the basis that they are \"too old\" or are self-employed, for example. \nMeanwhile \" mortgage prisoners \" are on the rise. These are people trapped with their existing lender, unable to remortgage because they cannot meet the affordability requirements, and comprise 40pc of borrowers according to experts. \nBanks will \"over-predict\" energy bill spending whatever model they use, accoring to Peter Gettins, of broker London and Country. \n\"Although theoretically cutting energy bills should enable higher lending, I'm not sure the affordability suggestion made here would work,\" he said. \n\"Lenders will apply average figures if the specifics are too far out of step, to protect against over-optimism, fibbing and so on.\" \nHowever, a few specialist lenders do take energy-efficiency into account. Ecology Building Society, for example, says \"unusual and innovative projects are welcome\" to its specialist mortgages for energy-saving projects, eco-builds and converting disused buildings. \nBorrowers get 0.25pc knocked off their interest for each time they go up one energy grade on their EPC rating, and a 1pc discount if they borrow money specifically for energy-saving measures like insulation and double glazing. All mortgages are variable, so interest rates can go up or down. \nNorwich & Peterborough Building Society also used to offer \"green\" and \"brown\" mortgages, for energy improvements and refurbishment works respectively. \n• I got a mortgage aged 92: is the tide turning for older borrowers? \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:06:43.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
