Here, in five charts, is a look at this week’s financial-market highlights. \n#1: New Bond Market: Bigger, Riskier \nThe U.S. bond market is among the biggest financial markets in the world, equivalent to 1½ U.S. stock markets. It’s a market long associated with safety and predictability, but since the financial crisis, a new bond market has taken shape. Bond markets now appear vulnerable as never before. In a series of articles this week, The Wall Street Journal explores how a world of low interest rates has fueled massive debt issuance (here and here) and investor risk taking (here, here and here), and the rise of asset managers and fast-trading firms that are changing how bonds are bought and sold. \n#2: Brazil Gets a Battering \nBrazil’s battered currency touched a succession of new lows this week, even as the central bank sought to stem the slide, amid a litany of woes that suggest a major crisis ahead for this once high-flying economy. The country’s collapse is one telling marker of the forces shaking emerging-market currencies around the world, as stalling growth and falling commodities prices damp confidence at home while the prospect of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve draws money to the U.S. \n#3: Some Chinese Shares Have Gone Up \nAmid the carnage of the Chinese stock market, a handful of stocks have posted huge gains. The reason: the love affair Chinese investors have with initial public offerings. Regulators put a stop to new listings during the summer selloff, fueling demand–and prices–for stocks that listed just before the selloff. \n#4: Relief for Students Snarls Debt Market \nFederal programs designed to ease the burden of college loans are causing snarls in the bond market and raising concerns that banks may soon ratchet back lending. The programs, which let struggling borrowers scale back their repayments, have made student loans more affordable. But that slowing stream of money is having a knock-on effect in the market for bonds backed by that debt. Investors are beginning to worry that they may not get repaid on time, and they are balking at buying new bonds being offered by financial institutions. \n#5: Blankfein's Illness Hits Hard at Goldman \nGoldman Sachs Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said he is suffering from a curable form of blood cancer, raising anew the sensitive issue of who may one day replace him. Mr. Blankfein, who at nine years has held the top job for longer than most big U.S. bank CEOs, said he would continue to run the firm as he undergoes chemotherapy treatment for lymphoma over the next few months. Yet the announcement moved to the fore an issue that neither Mr. Blankfein nor the Goldman board has been comfortable addressing in public: What is Goldman’s succession plan?
