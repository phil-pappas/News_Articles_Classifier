Energy drinks, such a Red Bull and Rockstar, contain high levels of caffeine and change the chemical state of the body, which can prevent people from getting back on track after a TBI.\nHe added that brain injuries among adolescents are particularly concerning because their brains are still developing.\nAt a time when energy drink consumption is rising among teens in Canada and the United States, the study also suggests that the caffeinated drinks are particularly linked with those who play sports.\nAccording to the new study, a better understanding of the link between TBI and energy drinks could help medical professionals, parents, teachers and coaches understand how to better prevent, diagnose and treat brain injuries.\nThe study is published in PLOS ONE.\n 21, 2015 2:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:54:08.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
