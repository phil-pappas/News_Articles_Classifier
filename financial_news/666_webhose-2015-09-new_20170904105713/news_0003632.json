Some conservatives had also threatened to try and oust Boehner over the fight. ADVERTISEMENT But a bill funding the government and blocking money for Planned Parenthood failed to advance in the Senate, and now the House and the Senate are slated to vote on short-term spending bills that include money for Planned Parenthood.\nLooming over the votes is Boehner's impending exit and a host of future fights over raising the debt limit and the fate of the Export-Import Bank. \nRepublicans will also be jockeying to find Boehner's successor, with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) the favorite so far. \nHouse Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is weighing a challenge, with a decision expected soon. \nElsewhere on Capitol Hill, the House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday during which Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray will testify. \nAlso on Tuesday, the House Financial Services subcommittee on Housing and Insurance will have a hearing titled “The Impact of Domestic Regulatory Standards on the U.S. Insurance Market.” The hearing looks to examine the complex structure of state and federal regulations. \nOn Thursday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) will convene a full-panel markup on the American Crude Oil Export Equality Act. \nOn Wednesday, the Banking panel's Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment will have a hearing titled “Oversight of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.” \nExpect lawmakers to debate whether to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, especially now with Boehner on his way out. Supporters of the bank argue it sustains jobs but are losing a key ally in the Speaker. \n\n-- Boehner resigning as Speaker, by Scott Wong and Ian Swanson: http://bit.ly/1iAEJKC \n-- Boehner explains decision to step down, by Cristina Marcos: http://bit.ly/1MuVVLJ \n-- Starting gun fired in GOP leadership race, via Scott: http://bit.ly/1LDulxl \n-- Economy grew at 3.9 percent in spring, via Bernie Becker: http://bit.ly/1KzUqLI \n-- Dems rise against Obama's financial adviser regs, via me: http://bit.ly/1KzUD1k \n-- McConnell tees up vote on bill to avoid shutdown, via Jordain Carney: http://bit.ly/1R6tzt0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:28:59.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
