Tony Smith (right) got the nod. Nick Xenophon says the Liberal Party has lost the benefit of incumbency in Boothby now that Dr Southcott is going. Alex Ellinghausen by Simon Evans Senator Nick Xenophon says the decision by long-serving Federal Liberal MP Andrew Southcott to bow out of Federal politics after almost two decades will enhance the chances of his own Nick Xenophon Team stable winning lower house seats by capitalising on anti-Tony Abbott sentiment in South Australia.\n\"The benefit of incumbency has been lost,\" Mr Xenophon told Fairfax Media on Friday morning after Dr Southcott revealed he wouldn't contest the next Federal election for the southern Adelaide suburbs seat of Boothby, which he has held since 1996.\n\"The problem isn't the candidate, the problem is just the Liberal Party policies toward South Australia,\" Mr Xenophon says.\nDr Southcott was one of the Federal Liberal MPs who put their hand up to become Speaker in the Federal Parliament following the resignation of Bronwyn Bishop in the wake of the damaging fall-out over her infamous 80km helicopter trip from Melbourne to a golf course near Geelong at taxpayers' expense.\nThe job ultimately went to Victorian MP Tony Smith, with Dr Southcott unable to muster much support.\nDr Southcott dismissed suggestions that his failure to win the role of Speaker had been a big influence on his decision. He told Fairfax Media on Friday morning that it was time for him to move on and re-start his medical career, as he urged the Liberal Party to pre-select a female candidate, which had never happened in Boothby.\nHe also says it's likely the Federal election will be held later in calendar 2016. \"I think that will be the most likely time,\" he says, believing the Abbott Government will run its full term.\nDr Southcott says he has kept pace with changes in medicine in the 19 years he has been a Federal MP but will need to go through the formal processes to return to medicine.\n Mr Xenophon is deliberately targeting Federal Liberal seats in South Australia and is close to finalising candidates to run in various seats as part of his Nick Xenophon Team. Mr Xenophon began his political career as a No Pokies MP in state politics before transferring to the bigger national stage as a passionate backer of South Australia's interests.\nMr Xenophon says Dr Southcott is \"well-liked\" in his electorate and he has nothing against any of the SA Federal Liberal MPs personally. Mr Xenophon also plans to target Federal Education MInister Christopher Pyne's eastern Adelaide seat of Sturt.\nBut he says the policies of the Abbott Government have been bad for South Australia, with car maker General Motors-Holden to shut its car manufacturing plant at Elizabeth in northern Adelaide by 2017, and uncertainty continuing over the construction of the next generation of submarines.\nMr Xenophon said Mr Abbott made a promise before the 2013 Federal election to build the next generation of 12 submarines at the ASC facility at Osborne, near Port Adelaide. A process is underway where Japan, Germany and France are all competing to be the international partner for the submarine build but just how much local work will be part of that is unclear.\nAn announcement in early August by Mr Abbott that Adelaide would be at the centre of a $39 billion shipbuilding program was seen by many observers as a recognition that the Federal LIberal party was concerned about internal polling in South Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:50:28.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
