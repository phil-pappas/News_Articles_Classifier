Meanwhile, Oktoberfest celebrations in Cincinnati; Denver, New Ulm, Minn., LaCrosse, Wisc.; Mount Angel, Ore., Levenworth, Wash.; Torrance, Calif.; Hermann, Mo., and elsewhere have either come and gone or have just begun. \nWhile the German celebration dates back to 1810 and the wedding of King Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, it is connected to various festivals celebrated by 46 million U.S. citizens of German descent by a thin river of beer. Adolphus Busch, Joseph Schlitz, Frederick Pabst and Frederick Miller, August Schell, David Jüngling (later Yuengling) -- all those pioneering brewers draw their lines back to the tide of German immigrants who entered the U.S. in the 19th Century. They brought a brewing tradition with them, but they'd also bring the Oktoberfest lager known as Märzen. More Headlines Will ClintonCare Mean Cheaper Drugs For You? \nBy their most stringent definition, Oktoberfest beers are supposed to be brewed according to the German Reinheitsgebot law of beer purity -- which dictates that only hops, malted barley and water (and, eventually, yeast) can be used to brew beer. Also, those beers are supposed to be brewed within Munich, which meant only Spaten, Löwenbräu, Augustiner-Bräu, Hofbräu-München, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr brewed “official” Oktoberfest beers. \nHowever, that doesn't mean those beers were brewed with any consistency. Though they're still brewed in March and are left to ferment in cold storage through the summer, today's Oktoberfest bears little resemblance to the dark or even amber Märzen of years past. If you see photos of waitresses at Oktoberfest carrying mugs of frothy, golden beer, that's pretty much what Märzen looks like today. \nThat isn't necessarily true in the U.S., however, where both traditional and craft brewers have experimented with original recipes and tinkered with Märzen to their taste throughout the years. Märzen, or Oktoberfest, is now part of a seasonal beer slate that makes up 15% to 25% of the more than $19.6 billion in annual craft beer sales, according to market research firm IRI. \nWith Oktoberfest upon us and more than 3,700 U.S. brewers producing hundreds of takes on the Märzen style, we've selected just ten to get you started: \nVarious Hofbräuhaus locations \nAlcohol by volume: 6.3% \nOf all the Munich breweries that produce Märzen, only one decided to franchise itself throughout the United States. Back in 2003, Hofbräu Müchen decided to open its first Hofbräuhaus location in the U.S. in Newport, Ky. -- a city with a deep German brewing heritage located right over the Ohio River from Cincinnati and its Over-the-Rhine brewing district. Franchises followed in Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Cleveland and Columbus -- not including a beer garden in Panama City, Fla., and the Bierhaus pub in New York. As for the beer itself? Well, let's just say it's true to the modern Munich interpretation: crisp, mild and on the lighter side. That isn't necessarily a bad thing when you're drinking it a liter at a time. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:39:22.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
