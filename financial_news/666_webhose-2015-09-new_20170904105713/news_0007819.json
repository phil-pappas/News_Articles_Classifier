So why does its reign feel tenuous? Perhaps because NBC hasn’t had a breakout hit in a few years and relies on “The Voice” and “Sunday Night Football” to prop up its numbers, as The Wall Street Journal reports. Sports rights aren’t cheap and reality shows don’t last forever, so every network needs new hits to compete with each other and streaming services. NBC could really use a show like the intriguing “Blindspot” to pop among viewers. Really, so could any of the big broadcast networks, which is why they are promoting their new shows like crazy, as CMO Today reports. But critics are lining up to dump on the fall crop of shows, which Grantland called the “worst fall season in modern television history.”\nIAB CHIEF ON AD BLOCKING : Over the past few months, the drumbeat surrounding the growth of ad-blocking software and what that means for the very future of digital advertising has been relentless. It started with an alarming report claiming that the ad industry could lose upwards of $20 billion, then the noise reached hysteria levels last week when Apple released its new mobile software update that allowed for multiple ad-blocking apps. Now, the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s chief executive Randall Rothenberg is speaking out, and his comments may surprise you. In an exclusive interview with CMO Today, Mr. Rothenberg acknowledges the ad-blocking problem, while hinting that it’s been hyped up. And he’s rather frank in his assessment of Google GOOG -2.01 % and Apple’s role in this--and their true motivations.\nFACEBOOK FB -2.71 % ’S VINE MESS : Facebook has been hearing it lately from YouTube stars about the social network’s apparent lack of protection for video content. These creators say that unlike YouTube, Facebook lacks an automated means of tracking their video--and more importantly, lacks a way for them to make money. That’s the latest side effect in the battle between Google and Facebook to own Web video. But quietly, Vine stars are also feeling ignored and unprotected by Facebook, where their videos are being posted without permission, resulting in lost opportunities for them to gain more followers and viewers. That hurts them as they pursue deals with advertisers, reports CMO Today. That, in turn, inadvertently puts parent company Twitter into the middle of the YouTube/Facebook war.\nDEAD TALENT : While some top marketers will pay big bucks to try and get stars like Beyoncé or LeBron James to endorse their brands, these celebs can be expensive, they might turn you down, and they might not be willing to say or do exactly what you want. But deceased celebrities should theoretically be a lot more available and amenable, since they are dead. That’s the bet being made by a pair of companies looking to lock up the dead celebrity hologram market. Yes, this is a real thing, reports WSJ. There’s Hologram USA, founded by Greek billionaire Alki David, which licensed the technology that helped project holograms of Tupac Shakur at a music festival, and there’s Pulse Evolution Corp. PLFX -9.15 % , a startup focused on “virtual humans.” Sound off the wall? If you think about it, deceased celebrities can have even more resonance as the years pass and their legends grow. Plus, they aren’t going to embarrass brands by getting arrested, or worse.\nElsewhere HBO took home the top prizes for best drama series and best comedy series during the 67th annual Emmy Awards [WSJ]\nMeanwhile, host Andy Samberg gave out a working HBO Now account during the show [Mashable]\nThe recent firing of the L.A.
