Peter Braig Share on twitter by Christopher Joye My analysis headlined \" Westpac's hybrid deal a dud \" on 22 July annoyed the bank and the many folks spruiking the overpriced security to naive investors in exchange for chunky 100 basis point commissions. Yet, based on the searing 3 per cent capital losses the supposedly safe hybrid has imposed on investors since its listing on Wednesday, my conclusion that it was \"equities for dummies\" appears to have been spot on.\nPity the $1.32 billion of retail money that was cajoled into the issue on the basis of an advertised \"6.7 per cent yield to maturity\".\nThat 6.7 per cent return was always wrong. Westpac Capital Notes III is a \"perpetual\" equity instrument that actually has no maturity at all and only pays a discretionary (not legally binding) dividend (not interest) of 4 percentage points above the 2.17 per cent bank bill rate. So the total expected annual income at the time it was launched was 6.17 per cent, not 6.7 per cent.\nPromoters created the 6.7 per cent fiction by adding the hybrid's 4 per cent margin to a completely inappropriate fixed 5.5 year swap rate. The problem is that the hybrid is a floating (not fixed) rate instrument that pays a margin above three-month bank bills, not the 5.5 year swap rate.\nThe bad news is that investors in the original issue will now earn a total return of less than half what they were marketed given the hybrid's $97 price, which is $3 below the $100 they shelled out for it.\nBack in July I said \"I would personally considering buying [the hybrid] if the total return was within 100 basis points of the dividend yield on [Westpac's] voting equity, which implies a margin above bills of 4.5 per cent or better\".\nCapital losses As a result of the hybrid's 3 per cent capital loss new (not old) investors are now being effectively paid a much juicer 4.6 per cent (rather than 4 per cent) margin above bills, which translates into a superior 6.8 per cent income return. Superficially, that looks like it is close to my fair value estimate.\n The complication is that the annual grossed-up dividend yield on Westpac's shares has also increased significantly to an attractive 8.6 per cent. The dividend yield is important because the hybrid counts as loss-absorbing, \"going concern\" additional Tier 1 equity capital on a bank's balance sheet and is, therefore, a de facto substitute for Westpac's ordinary shares. Indeed, the two securities tend to be highly correlated during equity market corrections, when they both suffer synchronous losses.\nWhile the hybrid is perpetual like all other forms of equity (cash, bonds and debt have hard maturities that mean borrowers must repay your principal), it does rank ahead of the shares in a wind-up and dilutes them down if the bank's core equity capital falls below 5.125 per cent (wherein the hybrid is automatically converted into ASX shares).\nThis is why it is reasonable to think the return required by prudent investors from the preferred hybrid is within 100 basis points of the dividend yield on the equity. One test of that proposition is to evaluate the extra interest rate institutions demand from the major banks when they move one step down the capital structure from senior to (old-style Basel 2) subordinated bonds with the same maturity. That increment is about 85 basis points.\nShare price falls The 24 per cent fall in Westpac's share price from $40 in April (when despite my warnings the market still thought the majors could remain 25 times leveraged forever) to circa $30.50 today has actually made the stock more appealing in valuation terms than the hybrids.\nThe 100 basis points dividend yield benchmark suggests fair value for Westpac's hybrid is now in the vicinity of a 7.6 per cent total return (or a 5.4 per cent margin above bills). That implies it is still very expensive compared with Westpac's shares.\nMedia reports indicate AMP is about to launch another of these complex instruments, promising a 5 percentage points margin above bills (or a 7.17 per cent total return). Interestingly, that's superior to AMP's grossed-up dividend yield of 6.5 per cent. While my 100 basis point test is seemingly satisfied, one needs to apply additional valuation filters.\nThe first is that you can currently get similar (albeit slightly lower) returns from major bank hybrids, and there may be a case the majors are a better trade on a risk-adjusted basis. To make this determination you would need to compare, among other things, AMP's core equity buffer and balance-sheet loan risks to the majors.\nAnother factor to consider is the long-term \"equity risk premium\" the Australian sharemarket has delivered investors in dividend yield terms above the interest rate on a quasi-risk-free asset like a government bond. Using over 100 years of data, NERA Economic Consulting has found that this has been between 6 per cent and 7 per cent annually. That lends weight to the notion that non-voting preferred equity like a hybrid should be offering margins above bank bills of, say, 5 per cent to 6 per cent annually (or 7 per cent to 8 per cent in total). Note here that if an investment is paying you 4 per cent to 6 per cent above the cash rate, it is not remotely cash- or bond-like in its risks. You are buying equity, not debt.\nValuation errors All of this begs the question why so many investors, and their ostensibly sophisticated advisers, are making heinous valuation errors. The culprit is the practice of blindly pricing assets off peer securities and not in engaging in fundamental, bottom-up analysis of the expected returns required from an investment as compensation for the probability of loss.\nAlmost exactly a year ago, $3 billion of mum and pop money was herded into CBA's \"Perls VII\" hybrid on the basis it was a surrogate for cash and paid a super-duper margin of 2.8 percentage points above bills. Investors rationalised the 2.8 per cent margin by benchmarking Perls VII off similar securities at the time.\nThe flaw in relying on this \"top-down\" valuation framework that ignores fundamentals is that markets sometimes get asset prices wrong. In the past week CBA's Perls VII has traded as low as $89 (versus the $100 issue price), slugging investors in the October 2014 deal with an incredible 11 per cent capital loss. Even after its puny 4.97 per cent dividend, Perls VII investors have still lost about 6 per cent of their money over the past 12 months.\nI see the same problems afflict even supposedly savvy punters at the top end of town. It was, for example, clear that the recent $2.25 billion bond issue by Apple offered no discount to fair value based on a top-down relative valuation and a bottom-up expected loss estimate that projected the probability of default and recovery rate on the security.\nIt should have been no surprise, then, that the record Apple issue almost immediately traded at a loss.\nIn Australia today there is a palpable asymmetry in the power between the promoters of debt and equity securities and those buying them. Investors have to drive harder bargains to ensure they are adequately compensated for the risks they are being asked to bear.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-09-11T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:02:55.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
