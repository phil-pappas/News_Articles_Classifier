Photo: AP\nStandard & Poor's latest downgrades to its oil price assumptions have weakened Origin Energy's credit standing, while the impact on pure-play oil and gas producers Woodside Petroleum and Santos remains uncertain.\nS&P has left Origin's BBB- rating unchanged but pointed to a \"significant\" reduction in the buffer the company has within that band, which is the lowest investment-grade rating.\nThe agency reduced Origin's credit rating from BBB in April and kept it at that level even after Origin's $NZ1.8 billion sale of its 53 per cent in New Zealand's Contact Energy in August. Moody's reined back its rating on Origin to Baa3, its lowest investment grade, after the Contact sale, saying it cut the diversity of Origin's revenues without materially reducing debt.\nS&P has yet to release its assessment on the impact on Woodside and Santos, which are more exposed to commodity prices because of Origin's large electricity and gas retailing business.\nAdvertisement Woodside is rated BBB+ by S&P, while Santos is rated BBB.\nA sub-investment-grade rating typically increases a company's debt costs, while Origin would also have to put in place arrangements to avoid restrictions on its electricity trading business in the wholesale power market. Otherwise it may choose to sell assets or raise equity to avoid a rating cut.\nS&P last week slashed $US10 a barrel from its Brent crude assumptions for 2016 and 2017, to $US55 a barrel and $US65 a barrel, respectively. It now assumes that Brent, the global oil benchmark, will average just $US50 this year, rather than $US55.\nThe new assumptions are more in line with prices on the forward curve, although are still several dollars higher for 2017, for example, where the forward curve indicates $US58 a barrel.\nS&P pointed to prospects for \"a more prolonged recovery\", noting that US oil output had yet to see much of a downturn despite spending cuts of 30-40 per cent by many producers.\nCitigroup energy analyst Dale Koenders said S&P would have flagged its price adjustments with companies and this could have prompted Santos' strategic review and Origin's mooted sale of its Perth Basin ventures and a stake in the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas project in Queensland.\nCommodity analysts at banks Credit Suisse and UBS have also pulled back oil price forecasts recently.\nUBS cut its long-term Brent oil price forecast to $US80 a barrel from $US90. It slashed its 2015 prediction to $US55 from $US61.50 and its 2016 forecast to $US57.50 from $US70.\nThat drove sharp reductions in its valuations of oil stocks, including 31 per cent in Santos, 17 per cent in Oil Search and 12.6 per cent in Woodside. Earnings estimates took an even bigger hit, with 2016 earnings per share estimates cut 39-44 per cent across the three.\nCredit Suisse, meanwhile, now expects Brent to average just $US49 this half, recovering only modestly to $US58 next year, almost a quarter lower than it had previously assumed. Its long-term forecast dropped from $US85 to $US75.\nCiti said it didn't believe a downgrade in Origin to sub-investment ground would be \"catastrophic\" to the electricity business and that Origin could retain its credit rating if APLNG raised external debt to refund shareholders.\nIt assesses that Origin needs to make $2.5 billion-$6 billion of disposals to get gearing down to a more sustainable 30-40 per cent by the end of the 2018 financial year, so asset sales alone were unlikely to be enough, signalling a risk it will have to raise equity if oil prices don't recover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:31:52.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
