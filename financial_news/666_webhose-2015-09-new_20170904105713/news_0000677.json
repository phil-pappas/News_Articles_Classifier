AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Most investors are probably cursing the recent swoon in share prices, but Warren Buffett is rubbing his hands with delight about the market dips.\n\"Down days I like because we buy them cheaper,\" Mr Buffett told American financial news channel CNBC on Tuesday.\nMr Buffett, who has earned a reputation for being the world's saviest investor, is confident stock prices will move higher – eventually.\nThe Berkshire Hathaway chairman was speaking after stocks on Wall Street posted their second-worst week of the year last week. The S&P 500 fell 3.4 per cent, before rebounding strongly on Tuesday when markets reopened after the Labor Day long weekend in the US.\nShare prices in Australia, Japan and Europe have also been on a wild ride of late in response to unprecedented volatility in China's equities market and concerns about slowing growth in the world's second largest economy.\nAgainst that backdrop, a candid Mr Buffett admitted he had \"no idea\" where stock markets were heading in the short term because \"I've never been any good at it\".\n\"If we're thinking about where they're going to be in five or ten years, I'm confident they will be considerably higher.\"\nMr Buffett, 85, has always been a believer of investing in stocks for the long term, arguing that stocks will outperform other assets like bonds and cash.\n In August he placed his largest ever bet, when Berkshire outlay a $US32.5 billion cash bid for aviation parts manufacturer Precision Castparts.\nHis investment philosophy has generally been proven right. For an investor who bought $US1 worth of shares in Berkshire when Mr Buffett took over a struggling textile mill in Massachusetts in 1965, the value of the investment would now be worth almost $US1800.\nMr Buffett has amassed a personal fortune of $US70 billion by buying large stakes in publicly traded firms including The Coca Cola Company, bank Wells Fargo, computer giant International Business Machines, credit card provider American Express and retailer Wal-Mart.\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when panicked investors were selling shares, Mr Buffett snapped up heavily-discounted stakes in blue-chip companies like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Mars and Dow Chemical.\nHe said on Tuesday that Berkshire in August added to its holdings in IBM, the technology giant that has been struggling to keep up with competitors like Apple.\nIn June, Berkshire acquired a 3.7 per cent stake in Insurance Australia Group via a $500 million placement.\nMr Buffett vowed to keep at least $US20 billion in cash on hand, to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities that may arise.\nOn the US economy, he said it was growing steadily at around 2 to 2.5 per cent annually as it has for much of the past six years.\n\"It's not a bad rate, but it's not a booming rate either,\" Mr Buffett said.\nMany traders are focused on when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the first time in more than nine years, with financial markets pricing in about a 28 per cent chance of a rate rise on September 17.\nMr Buffett was not too focused on interest rates, though appeared cautious about borrowing costs rising too high, too quickly.\n\"If our rates got substantially higher than Europe's, then I would think that would not necessarily be good for exports for this country,\" Mr Buffett said.\nMr Buffett has in the past been a critic of the Fed's huge $US4 trillion bond buying program, warning – wrongly – that it would stoke an \"onslaught of inflation\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:03:20.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
