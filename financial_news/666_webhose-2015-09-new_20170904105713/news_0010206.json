The company says it has more than 1.5 million listings — homes, apartments, guest rooms, even houseboats and tree houses — in more than 34,000 cities in 190 countries.\n\"It's a global phenom,\" said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures who made an early personal investment in Airbnb in 2010. \"(It) is going to continue to grow at a substantially higher rate than other businesses.\"\nUnlike hotels, Airbnb does not own properties and is not responsible for services like housekeeping.\nThe research arm of investment bank Piper Jaffray estimated earlier this year that the service would have about 61 million nightly bookings in 2015. But the company has blown past that estimate, the investors said.\nRead More Airbnb: Will its China wanderlust pay off?\nIts growth comes despite Airbnb's ongoing battle with regulators and lawmakers over who can list properties and how they should be zoned and taxed.\nIn its hometown of San Francisco, a proposed law on the November ballot would limit the use of homes as hotels through services such as Airbnb. Supporters of the law argue that Airbnb exacerbates the city's brutal housing shortage.\nSome travelers prefer to use Airbnb not just for the cheaper price but also options such as renting an entire house, enjoying quiet neighborhoods lacking in hotels and benefiting from their host's local knowledge.\nTravel industry analysts say the growth rate suggests Airbnb's push in Europe and efforts to win over business travelers are succeeding.\nRead More The short-stay services disrupting Airbnb in Asia\n\"Airbnb is certainly being very, very aggressive,\" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel research firm Atmosphere Research Group.\nThis is the compelling factor of Airbnb\nHans Tung, managing partner of GGV Capital, says peer-to-peer rental site Airbnb has an \"unparalleled franchise.\"\nParis has more listings on Airbnb — about 60,000 — than any other city, said an Airbnb spokeswoman. About 50 percent of the company's revenue comes from Europe compared to about 30 percent from the United States.\nSome homeowners in European cities have reported receiving letters from Airbnb inviting them to list their homes on the site.\nThe company is also going after the booming Chinese travel market, working with Sequoia China, the local affiliate of the American venture capital firm.\nOnce a startup selling cereal, Airbnb today is the third most valuable venture capital-backed company in the world, valued at $25.5 billion. By comparison, Hyatt Hotels has a market value of about $6.7 billion.\nRead More 10 of Airbnb's most luxurious homes in the world\nIn a survey of 300 hotel groups and hotels earlier this year by Atmosphere, 70 percent said Airbnb and similar home-sharing services would pose a significant threat to their business within the next three years.\n\"If Airbnb is on track to book 80 million rooms nights a year, that is 80 million room nights that the global hotel industry is not getting,\" Harteveldt said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:57:20.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
