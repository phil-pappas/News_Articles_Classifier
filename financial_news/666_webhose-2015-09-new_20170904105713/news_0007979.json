It happened to Kevin Rudd and, oh yes, it happened to Malcolm Turnbull in 2009. Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Goodness knows, it's hard being the most fabulous person in the room.\nBut enough about me. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull really showed the rest of those amateurs in question time how to rock da House (of Representatives).\nBill Shorten kicked off question time with an attempt to embarrass the new Prime Minister about the latest Cabinet leak coming not even two days into his leadership.\nThe opposition might have expected Turnbull to sweat - or at least squirm a little.\nBut that would not be Turnbull's style. This man who \"invented the internet\" as Tony Abbott once said, a man so handsome scientists say it could sway elections , and the man who wrote a eulogy for his dog Mellie that was so heartfelt it won the loyalty of a legion of dog lovers.\nThe latest leak on Thursday morning seemed to indicate Turnbull might have a previously undiagnosed problem with women . A top secret document indicated Turnbull had promoted fewer women to government boards since September 2013 than his Cabinet colleagues.\n\"Given that it's only taken two days for the Liberal Cabinet to start leaking again, doesn't this just prove that even though there's a new Liberal leader, it's the same policies, the same chaos and the same division?\" Shorten asked, with a smirk.\nLabor's first question was on verge of being ruled out order, so just to be helpful, Turnbull stepped in to help out old Bill.\n Forget \"mansplaining\", as he was accused by Tanya Plibersek on Wednesday. Turnbull rose from his chair for an outburst of \"Malcolm-splaining\" of such virtuosity that Labor could only watch and admire.\nHelping the Opposition leader\n\"It is indicative of the engaging and collaborative style of my government that I'm prepared to help the Leader of the Opposition and actually show him a question,\" Turnbull said.\n\"So the question could have been, how does the Prime Minister react to the claim that a very small percentage of women were appointed by him to government boards?' That would be a reasonable question.\"\nHaving impressed with himself for being such a reasonable chap, Turnbull agreed to answer his own question by saying the government remained committed to its target of women holding 40 per cent of positions on Australian government boards and in fact the forthcoming and yet-to-be published 2014-15 annual reports will show that women held 40 per cent of board appointments in his communications portfolio.\nAll Labor could do was make fun of his rich-man idiosyncrasies: calling himself \"one\" instead of the more plebeian \"I\" and having, umm, fancy glasses.\nNow the danger of being the most fabulous man in the room on a daily basis is that it gets on colleagues' nerves. It happened to Kevin Rudd and, oh yes, it happened to Malcolm Turnbull in 2009.\nOn Thursday though, government ministers were all on their best behaviour for the new boss ahead of Sunday's reshuffle.\nAll except Defence minister Kevin Andrews. Chastising Labor for failing to ask questions of substance, Andrews said \"all we get is more of this insider nonsense\" - at which he turned his back on his new Prime Minister, looked up at the press gallery and gave a very large, conspicuous wink.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/leaked-document-tars-malcolm-turnbull-as-worst-minister-on-appointing-women-20150916-gjoh3o.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/will-being-handsome-help-malcolm-turnbull-win-your-vote-science-says-yes-20150915-gjn3ol.html", "https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-20/turnbull---eulogy-for-mellie/3739246"], "published": "2015-09-17T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:13:36.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
