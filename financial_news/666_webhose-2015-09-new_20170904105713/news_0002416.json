Videgaray said the 2016 budget would be 1.15 percent of GDP less than 2014 spending.\nHe also said that President Enrique Pena Nieto had nominated Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens to serve another six-year term. Carstens' term ends in December.\nThe proposal projected the economy will grow between 2.6 percent and 3.6 percent next year compared to an expected 2.34 percent in 2015 seen by analysts in the latest central bank poll from last week.\nThe government cut back its projections of oil output, from 2.4 million barrels per day forecast in March to 2.247 million in Tuesday's proposal. It projected an average price of $50 per barrel for Mexican crude next year.\nLast month, the government said it had bought put options to hedge a chunk of its oil exports at $49 per barrel.\nThe government traditionally relied on income from oil sales by state-run company Pemex to fund about one-third of its budget.\nBut due to the drop in oil prices and output, combined with stronger tax income following a fiscal reform in 2014, oil revenue made up about one-fifth of income in the first half of 2015, according to data on the finance ministry website.
