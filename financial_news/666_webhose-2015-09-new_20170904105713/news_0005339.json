This is both true and false, depending on how one looks at the issue of awarding mega tenders. \nFirst of all, many local contractors lack both financial capacity and the expertise required to undertake big projects. Secondly, most lack the experience that would put them at an advantage compared to foreign firms. \nTherefore, it is important for local contractors and the engineers' bodies to understand that the government or private sector cannot award tenders to any firm for the mere fact that they are Rwandan; you either meet the laid-out requirements or you don't, no way around it. \nThings like having the required capacity, finances and professional staff to undertake the projects cannot be compromised.

Promoting local content, supporting homegrown professionals and entrepreneurs, are essential in growing a country's private sector and, by extension, the economy.
