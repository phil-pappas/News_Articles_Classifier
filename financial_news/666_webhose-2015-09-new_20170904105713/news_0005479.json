That’s a contrast to the futures market, where traders aren’t anticipating a BOE liftoff until late 2016 after the Fed stood pat on monetary policy last week. Higher interest rates tend to boost currencies because they enhance the allure of financial assets.\n“The process of policy normalization in the U.K. will start sooner than the market expects,” said Roberto Mialich, a Milan-based senior foreign-exchange strategist at UniCredit. “Sterling will remain on a relatively firm tone.”\nBritain’s currency has seesawed against the dollar this year as investors and traders struggled to pinpoint when officials led by BOE Governor Mark Carney would raise rates. The timing of the Fed’s first increase since 2006 is important as it may provide the BOE with the confidence to follow its U.S. counterpart following an extended period of exceptionally low rates.\nUniCredit has had a mixed track record in forecasting the pound this year. Like most other contributors to Bloomberg’s survey, it failed to predict sterling’s 5 percent decline versus the dollar in the first quarter, though it correctly forecast a second-quarter rally.\nBritain’s currency advanced to a seven-month high of $1.5930 in June, but has fallen since then as sluggish consumer spending and vanishing inflation damped investors’ confidence in an early rate increase. Those ups and downs have left sterling little changed this year at $1.5534 as of 11:09 a.m. in Singapore, while it’s up 7 percent versus the euro at 72.78 pence.\nUniCredit’s Mialich says the pound will strengthen against the dollar because higher U.S. borrowing costs are already factored into markets, while a boost to U.K. rates isn’t.\nGains would be a blow for hedge funds, which turned positive on the pound versus the dollar for the first time in almost a year in August, only to reverse that net position earlier this month, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington.\nPolitical Risks Speculators aren’t the only ones convinced the pound’s headed lower.\nFocusing only on “short-end differentials” is misguided, according to Hamish Pepper, a foreign-exchange strategist at Barclays Plc, the most bearish forecaster in Bloomberg’s survey and the world’s third-biggest currency trader.\nHe’s more concerned with “government-related risk,” including the new administration’s spending cuts and forthcoming referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.\n“Monetary policy itself isn’t everything,” Pepper said. “The U.K. will be firstly lagging the U.S. in terms of growth, inflation and ultimately monetary policy. But on top of all of that it will be facing this substantial tightening of fiscal policy at a time when there’s uncertainty about whether the U.K. will remain part of the EU.”\nMost Pessimistic Barclays predicts the pound will tumble to $1.43 by the end of the first quarter of 2016, the most pessimistic of 57 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At the other end of the spectrum, UniCredit’s prediction is 7 percent stronger than the $1.54 median forecast.\nThe Italian lender is less optimistic on the pound versus the euro, expecting it to remain little changed at 72 pence, compared with Barclays’s estimate of an appreciate to 67 pence, and the 69-pence median.\nForward contracts based on the sterling overnight index average, or Sonia, suggest that a full quarter-point increase to the BOE’s 0.5 percent official rate won’t come until November 2016. That compares with the August increase signaled before the Fed’s meeting ended Sept. 17.\nAs well as keeping U.S. rates at a record low, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues published an accompanying statement that referenced the turmoil in global markets and slow inflation as reasons for their decision.\nBOE Chief Economist Andy Haldane made similar arguments on Friday in a speech where he said the case for raising U.K. rates is \"some way from being made.\"\nTop Forecaster Ebury Partners Ltd., the most accurate euro-sterling forecaster in Bloomberg’s second-quarter rankings, says it’s considering raising its short-term estimates versus the dollar because the Fed’s rate decision won’t delay the BOE.\nAs of early September, the advisory firm forecast a drop to $1.49 and an advance to 67 pence per euro by the first quarter.\n“The Fed’s no-show in September should be good news for sterling in the immediate term,” said Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, chief risk officer at Ebury in New York. “Provided we continue to see a strong economic recovery in the U.K. -- particularly in the labor market -- a BOE rate hike in early-2016 is still most certainly on the cards.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:22:55.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
