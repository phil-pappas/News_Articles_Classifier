It will have implications, obviously. \n“You cannot consider the UK independent of its environment. If the UK is part of Europe, it’s a completely different situation than if it is not part of Europe.” \nSpeaking after last week’s investment announcement, Nissan Europe chairman Paul Willcox was forced to defend the company . He rebuffed questions suggesting that the car-maker had “its bluff called” and the new money going into Sunderland showed that it would have invested in the UK regardless of the forthcoming referendum on Britain’s position within the EU. \nMr Willcox said the Sunderland plant was a “beacon for global manufacturing and excellence for Nissan” with the 6,700 workers at the factory which has produced more than 8 million cars since opening in 1986 helping create one of the most efficient plants in the world. \nHe added: “The two things (investment decisions and the result of the referendum) are not completely linked, as we manage and judge our business on events that we understand. \n“Our position in terms of competitiveness is driven by not only the situation in Europe in terms of whether we are in or out of the EU but more importantly by the commitment of the people we have in the North East and the supply chain we have in the UK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:30:13.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
