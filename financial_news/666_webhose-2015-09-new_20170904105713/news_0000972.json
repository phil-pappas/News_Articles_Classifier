A mistimed move by the Fed could see the U.S. raising rates as the world economy slows, triggering a further global slowdown as investors readjust to the Fed’s move and perhaps pull capital from emerging markets.\nWhile careful not to personally criticize Yellen, who in 18 months as chair has put a premium on consensus and soliciting a wide set of views about the economy, there appears broad agreement that the Fed in recent months has added to the market instability that last week prompted a delay to a rate hike.\n“I don’t think we are stuck in an adverse loop with markets,” Lockhart said on Monday. But “uncertainty about the (Federal Open Market Committee’s) policy intentions probably added to the overall environment of uncertainty that precipitated the volatility in mid-August…I am in the camp that would like to see the committee continue to refine its communications approach, particularly in this period.”\nSOME DATA IS MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS\nThough the Fed says it is data dependent, it is not clear that each member views the same data with the same priority, or puts the same weight on the Fed’s twin employment and inflation goals. That could be fixed, Lockhart said, if the central bank developed a consensus “reaction function” to outline the conditions or triggers for a rate hike.\nBullard went a step further in an unusual televised appeal Monday asking former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and others to effectively stop making public arguments against a rate hike, and muddling the Fed’s discourse.\nThe confusion, coupled with Yellen’s cautious tone at a press conference last week, has left investors discounting a rate hike until next year – despite Fed forecasts that show 13 of the Fed’s 17 policymakers expect to raise rates this year.\nYellen, scheduled to speak on Thursday in Amherst, Massachusetts, may need to reclaim the message.\n“I would think she will try to clarify things, one way or the other, because I cannot possibly think they are unaware of the problem that they have,” said Roberto Perli, a former Fed official who is now partner at Cornerstone Macro.\nOn Thursday, the Fed cited risks from China and elsewhere and downward pressure on U.S. inflation from a strong dollar and weak commodities as reasons to hold off raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade.\nWhile the decision had near-unanimous backing, a handful of hawkish policymakers like Bullard did not have a formal vote on the FOMC, and comments over the weekend suggested a close call.\nUnderscoring the sometimes fractious structure of the U.S. central bank, seven of the 13 officials who recommend a tightening this year only want one rate hike, while six want two or more hikes, according to the forecasts.\n 22, 2015 7:58 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:57:54.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
