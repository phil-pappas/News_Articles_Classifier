That’s when the real-estate agent advocating for the seller also represents the buyer.\nCommon sense dictates this scenario can be detrimental to both parties. The buyer’s agent is supposed to help his or her client get a home for the lowest price; the seller’s agent is supposed to fetch the highest price. Advocating for both sides seems impossible, yet some consumers still end up in that scenario. \nA high percentage of those agents advertising on Zillow enjoyed more dual-agency transactions as a result, according to a recent report from Morgan Stanley. Specifically, it found that 60% of those real-estate agents who advertised as a “premier agent” on Zillow received a 30% increase in these dual-side deals. Financially, that means a big payday for the agent, who doesn’t have to split the commission with someone else — effectively doubling his or her pay.\niPhone 6s video review (3:15) The iPhone 6 was the almost-perfect smartphone. Does the 6s address the public's remaining complaints? \nThe Morgan Stanley report is based on a survey of 211 real-estate brokers and agents, located across five large metropolitan areas: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Dallas.\nAccording to Zillow’s Z, -0.37% website, the Premier Agent program is designed to bring agents more business. There is a cost to be a premier agent, which varies by market. That buys an agent placement of his or her contact information next to listings and home searches.\nZillow representatives point out that users see information for the listing agent and three other agents when they search for homes, and can look at customer reviews of agents on the site as well. “We believe that access to information creates a more efficient and ethical real-estate marketplace,” the company noted in a statement, in response to questions about the Morgan Stanley report.\nIn fact, the access to online information about property values could increase the number of consumers who are OK with dual agency over time, according to the Morgan Stanley report. If they’re confident from their own research that they’re getting a fair deal, they may not care if the agent is working on both sides of the fence. Buyer agents are actually uncommon in some international markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Spain, according to the report. \nOne other possible perk of dual agency: It’s possible an agent will take a lower commission if he or she is representing both sides, according to a Zillow buyer’s guide. \nBut the fact that there is so much information on Zillow — including information on home prices and community features — actually can work to confuse consumers, said Chris Whitehead, president of the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents. They perceive it as a site for information, but fail to realize it’s mainly a place where agents try and collect clients, he added.\n“Zillow, to the consumer, is a resource, but all it is is a lead-generation site for real-estate agents,” he said. “The real-estate industry has become an industry of transactions, not people. That’s what all the advertising out there is built toward — getting another transaction,” Whitehead said.\nHis advice: Unless you have extensive knowledge of real estate and the local market, it’s almost always a good idea to avoid dual agency. He also cautions being represented as a buyer by an agent who works within the same brokerage or team as the seller’s agent, since colleagues could be more apt to share sensitive information about the deal with each other.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T03:17:21.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
