Along with its stock price, Mattel's profits have collapsed in recent years, with net income nearly cut in half during 2014. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that bureaucracy at the company had stifled the creativity of its employees, with countless meetings and Power Point presentations slowing things down to a crawl. Mattel's sales declined in 2014, in part because the company has been simply unable to adapt to the shifting market for toys. \nHasbro, on the other hand, has been performing extremely well. Profits surged in 2014 as its toys were simply better matched with what customers wanted. Hasbro makes toys based on various popular franchises, like Transformers , Marvel , and Star Wars, and the company struck an exclusive deal to make Disney princess dolls starting next year, a move which ended a 20-year relationship that Disney had with Mattel. And unlike Mattel, Hasbro's profits easily cover its dividend. \nWhich is a better dividend stock? Mattel and Hasbro are stocks for two different kinds of investors. For those looking for a dividend that's relatively safe, Hasbro is by far the best bet. The company's earnings easily cover the dividend, and while the dividend will likely only grow as fast as earnings going forward, given that the payout ratio is approaching 60%, the chance of a dividend cut in the foreseeable future is slim. \nThe downside to Hasbro as a dividend stock is its low yield. Mattel has a far higher yield, but there's a chance that the company will be forced to cut its dividend if profitability doesn't improve, and expecting dividend growth of any kind over the next few years is likely unrealistic. However, if Mattel can turn things around, which I believe it has a very good chance of doing, investors can lock in a 6.6% dividend yield. \nNeither Mattel nor Hasbro is a dividend stock without compromise. Hasbro has a low yield and dividend growth that will likely be slow, while Mattel may cut its sky-high dividend at any time. Mattel is a high-risk, high-reward option, while Hasbro is a lower-risk, lower-reward alternative. For dividend investors who demand a reasonable yield, decent dividend growth, and a low chance of a dividend cut, neither Mattel nor Hasbro quite fits the bill. \nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.
