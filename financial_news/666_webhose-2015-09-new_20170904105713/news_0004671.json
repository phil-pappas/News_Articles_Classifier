According to BRW, 11 per cent of staff are awarded a kudos in an average week.\nA separate list for companies with under 100 employees saw creative advertising agency Universal McCann claim top spot, followed by healthcare company The Physio Co and IT firm Intuit Australia.\n“Employees like to know that they are working towards a goal and to trust that leadership has the skills and competency to take them there,” said Zrinka Lovrencic, managing director of Great Places to Work Australia .\n“Management’s ability to convey a clear view of where the organisation is going and how it is going to get there directly impacts employees’ confidence in the future of the business.”\nThe BRW Best Places to Work winners saw average revenue growth of 25 per cent over the last 12 months and added an additional $1.3 billion to the Australian economy.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359&h=Australia%26%238217%3Bs+best+place+to+work", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359&title=Australia%26%238217%3Bs+best+place+to+work", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359&title=Australia%26%238217%3Bs+best+place+to+work", "http://www.greatplacetowork.com.au/best-companies/best-places-to-work-in-australia", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Australia%26%238217%3Bs+best+place+to+work&c=SOFTWARE+company+Atlassian+has+taken+the+top+spot+in+BRW%26%238217%3Bs+annual+Best+Places+to+Work+list+for+the+second+year+in+a+row.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/atlassian-tops-brws-best-places-to-work-list-for-second-year-in-a-row/story-fnkgbb6w-1227509471071?sv=3c29b8cf4017ec26c8d01ee01130359"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:12:10.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
