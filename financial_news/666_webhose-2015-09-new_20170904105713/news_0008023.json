The company said British customers would be contacted soon to get their vehicles corrected. \nRupert Pontin, head of valuations at Glass's, said there was a \"great deal of concern\" over Volkswagen cars at auctions where the valuation conducts a lot of its price research. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is fair to say that there are also others who are less concerned and are essentially standing by the brand and its products,\" he added. \nNews (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) of the scandal broke at a time when prices were already under pressure from an excess supply of Volkswagen cars in Britain as the company sought to increase its market share, Pontin said. \nSome car-dealers in Britain say they have not felt the impact of the biggest business-related scandal in Volkswagen's 78-year history. \n\"I did panic,\" Paul Wood, sales manager at Birchwood Motor Centre, said. \"But I don't think, when it comes to used (cars), that people are really bothered because it's all down to price, and they've still got a good name in terms of reliability.\" \n\"There's a lot of media hype about this,\" said the general manager of another car-dealer who asked not to be identified. \"What the trader is thinking is that if VW are doing it, everybody else has probably been at it as well.\" (Reporting by Angus Berwick; editing by William Schomberg and Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:31:41.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
