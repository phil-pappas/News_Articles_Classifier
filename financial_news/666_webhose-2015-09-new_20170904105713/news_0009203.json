Share on twitter by Ben Potter AGL Energy has revived a debate about government support for the closure of old coal-fired power plants amid mounting global pressure to deal with climate change.\nAGL's chairman Jerry Maycock used the company's annual meeting in Melbourne to call for a \"coherent national plan\" to shift the country's electricity generation away from fossil fuels to clean energy.\nChief executive Andy Vesey said after Wednesday's meeting that AGL wanted \"market fundamentals\" and regulation to drive the shift and had \"never advocated\" paying owners of coal plants to close.\nBut Mr Vesey did not rule out seeking support to cover site remediation and asset impairment costs, which can be substantial enough to keep coal plants in the National Electricity Market even though it is over-supplied for much of the next decade.\nStop CSG in NSW Rally, the 100th week of protests, outside AGL offices in North Sydney. Peter Rae AGL's call came as the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, challenged fossil fuel energy companies to confront \"potentially huge\" losses from tougher rules to manage climate change, which threaten to leave assets represented by reserves of oil, coal and gas \"stranded\".\nBHP Billiton also said on Tuesday it could cope with climate change rules aimed at limiting temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius and still generate an average 20 per cent return on investment out as far as 2030.\nAGL has committed to work towards the goal of limiting temperature increases to 2 degrees, the level at which scientists say dangerous climate change could occur, as have Royal Dutch Shell and BP.\nGlobal momentum The moves reflect global momentum towards tougher rules on climate change being adopted at the Paris talks in December and were welcomed by Investor Group on Climate Change chief executive, Emma Herd, who said companies needed to spell out how they planned to manage the transition.\nTony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said: \"None of these people are doing this to save the planet. They are doing it to save their companies.\"\nBut the \"carbon bubble\" theory is rejected by many in the energy industry and \"fails to take account of the transformation of low-emissions coal technologies that is under way, especially in Asia, Brendan Pearson, chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said.\nNew Energy Minister Josh Freydenberg said \"there will be a major and continued role for coal in the world for decades to come\" and it will remain crucial to Australia's prosperity.\nMr Maycock told AGL shareholders government policies were needed to support the transition to clean energy and avoid \"immense and unaffordable cost impacts\" on consumers and the economy.\nAGL is committed it to ending fossil fuel generation by 2050 and to not buying more coal-fired plants or extending the life of its existing ones beyond rated capacity.\nMr Wood said AGL would have to protect existing cash flows while building the cash flows of the future â€“ which was hard to do.\nOrigin Energy managing director Grant King said there was no need to change policy, although the government would likely firm up later this year how its 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction targets could be met.\nMr King said the policy of mandating renewable energy was already \"phasing coal out of the system\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-09-30T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:59:56.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
