Trump, who is leading polls for the Republican presidential nomination, replied in a handwritten note that Abdul-Jabbar doesn’t “have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again!” The basketball great said Trump’s reply just underscores the point he was making: “Look behind the nasty invective and you find an assault on the Constitution in the effort to silence the press through intimidation.”\nTake a look at Trump’s note:\nYou knew when @kaj33 wrote that op-ed that Donald Trump wouldn't ignore it http://t.co/q58V1g80nZ pic.twitter.com/v0MER2GNDZ\n— SB Nation (@SBNation) September 2, 2015 Former Clinton aide likely to invoke Fifth Amendment: The New York Times reports a former aide to Hillary Clinton who helped set up the server that housed her private email account plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in response to congressional questions about Clinton’s email practices. Former aide Bryan Pagliano was subpoenaed to testify before a House committee, but a lawyer for Pagliano has told the panel his client will assert his right to remain silent. The subpoena was issued by the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was secretary of state is part of the panel’s inquiry.\nClinton prepares N.H. push: Hillary Clinton’s campaign is preparing to ramp up operations in New Hampshire to halt Bernie Sanders’ advance , Politico writes. The aim is to rescue a lead in a state many Democrats had thought would be an easy win for her. The next phase will start Saturday, with a “Women for Hillary” program in Portsmouth. It also includes new policy proposals relevant to New Hampshire voters.\nSanders aims at drug companies: The Fiscal Times reports Sanders is planning to introduce a bill next week in the Senate to allow Medicare officials to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors. The Vermont independent has vowed to step up his attack on what he calls the outrageous profits of pharmaceutical companies. Sanders’ legislation would also allow individuals, pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed Canadian pharmacies.\nSantorum does the “Full Grassley”: Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is the first 2016 presidential hopeful to do what’s known as the “Full Grassley” : visit all of Iowa’s 99 counties. The feat is named after Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who makes such trips annually, says NBC News. Santorum, a Republican, won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 and is attempting to invoke that victory as much as possible. This year, he’s polling in 13th place in Iowa, according to RealClearPolitics’ average.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/02/heres-how-donald-trump-responded-to-my-essay-about-him/", "http://t.co/v0MER2GNDZ", "http://t.co/q58V1g80nZ", "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/02/Sanders-Takes-Aim-Drug-Companies-Medicare-Drug-Costs-Soar", "https://twitter.com/SBNation/status/639201398874370048", "https://twitter.com/kaj33", "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/02/former-clinton-aide-to-invoke-fifth-amendment-in-response-to-congressional-questions-over-private-email-server/", "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rick-santorum-first-2016-hopeful-visit-99-iowa-counties-n420166", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2016-new-hampshire-lead-213296", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/02/kareem-abdul-jabbar-this-is-the-difference-between-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders/"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:07:09.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
