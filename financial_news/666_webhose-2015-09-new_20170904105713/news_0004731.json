Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Former Mirvac manager Adam Moore allegedly gave instructions to bill work done on the luxury family home of former construction union official , Dave Hanna, to a commercial Mirvac project, the inquiry into trade unions has been told.\nAppearing before the Royal Commission Into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Wednesday, Mathew McAllum said he was told by Mr Moore in April 2013 to arrange for tradespeople to work on the Cornubia house owned by Mr Hanna, the former national president of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.\nMr McAllum said they discussed how the costs of the tradespeople could be written off from Mirvac's Orion retail development at the Springfield shopping centre. Mr McAllum had been contracted to work on the centre.\n\"We did have a discussion about payment and being that the Orion project had some good savings, that could be funded out of Orion,\" he said.\nThe work included plumbing, electrical, air-conditioning, and interior work.\n'Bad feeling' Mr McAllum said he subsequently realised the house belonged to Mr Hanna and that he \"had a bad feeling\".\nHe admitted he deleted the name of Mr Hanna and his wife, Jenny, from the house plans.\n Mr Moore resigned from Mirvac in 2013 after an internal investigation into allegations he was running an \"off-the-books\" business using sub-contractors without the permission or knowledge of his bosses\nThe evidence came as the CFMEU launched legal action against the Australian Federal Police, claiming police attached to the royal commission conducted an unlawful raid on its Canberra offices last month.\nThe ACT Supreme Court on Thursday will hear the union bid for an urgent injunction designed to stop police examining the material until the case is heard.\nACT police executed a search warrant at the ACT offices of the CFMEU on August 25, seizing computer files and hardware.\nRaid 'unlawful' Dave Noonan, the national secretary of the CFMEU's construction division, said on Wednesday the union believed the raid was \"unnecessary and unlawful\".\nMr Noonan said the union had complied with a huge number of commission notices to produce documents.\n\"If the royal commission police taskforce wanted further material, the royal commission could have issued further notices rather than storming our office,\" he said.\n\"The police were at our office for nearly 13 hours and our staff assisted them by identifying documents and providing passwords and PINs.\n\"Yet despite all that, the police then obtained a second warrant to continue the search after 9pm on the basis that it was necessary 'to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of property'. We say that warrant was invalid because there was no evidence to justify that finding.\"\nHe said the raid and the \"charging of a union organiser Johnny Lomax with 'blackmail' for getting members higher wages through an EBA, are part of a co-ordinated campaign to use the police and criminal law against the union's legitimate and lawful industrial work on behalf of our members.\"\nPolice have also charged a former CFMEU organiser in the ACT, Halafihi \"Fihi\" Kivalu with blackmail for allegedly r receiving payments from building contractors.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-16T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:09:02.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
