Josh Robenstone Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby A fall in applications for visas that offer wealthy individuals – many from China – a route to permanent residency if they invest $5 million will have little impact on the demand for the apartments that are driving the housing construction boom , developers say.\nApplications for the Special Investor visa class have fallen since the start of July, when curbs limiting investment on residential property came into effect.\nIn the first six months of this year, Australia received 1108 applications for the visas – an average of 185 a month. The total since the start of July is just nine, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said.\nDemand from overseas investors, particularly from China, has powered the apartment-led construction boom, so there are concerns the new visa curbs and tighter controls on exporting currency from China could hit demand. Australia's four largest banks account for only 30 per cent of all apartment developments in the Melbourne CBD.\nDevelopers deny there has been any effect. \"We're not seeing any impact of SIVs in our customer base,\" said John Carfi, developer Mirvac's head of residential. \"They don't feature.\"\nWealthy individuals are buying houses in expensive suburbs like Melbourne's Toorak and Sydney's Point Piper, rather than off-the-plan apartments, Mr Carfi said.\nDeveloper Aqualand's general manager, Wayne Xiong, said curbs to Canada's now-closed similar visa program had not dented Chinese investment in apartments.\n\"When they cut their SIV program, total investments didn't drop,\" Mr Xiong said. \"Currency and immigration factors continue to dominate Chinese investments. If you cut all immigration, then that might affect apartment investments.\"\n The new rules are having an effect on sentiment. Grace Xie, a Melbourne-based immigration agent on a Victorian government-led SIV promotional tour, said this week there was still interest in the visa, but it was tempered by a wariness about the new rules.\n\"It's not as strong as before, but not bad,\" she said.\nApplications for the visas require state government sponsorship to make their application to federal authorities. Under the old rules, Victoria was getting an average 30 to 40 applications a month. This spiked to more than 50 in the run-up to the rule changes, a spokeswoman said. Since July, however, the state government has nominated just 22.\nThe rise before July was a reflection of the rush to get in ahead of the well-telegraphed changes. From July to December 2014, there were 436 SIV primary applications, less than half the number in the first six months of this year, the Immigration Department said.\nPart of the slowdown reflects the hangover following that rush, and the numbers to date cannot be regarded as a reliable indication, said David Chin, the managing director of financial services consultancy Basis Point. \"It's not a true reflection of market demand.\"\nWith reporting by Su-Lin Tan", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-17T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:05:06.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
