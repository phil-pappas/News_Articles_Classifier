While the labor market has strengthened, inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.\n\"After a waterfall decline like we had over a week ago, you can have violent moves both up and down. That's a little of what we're seeing now, as well as positioning in advance of not just the jobs number tomorrow, but a long weekend where we will be digesting the jobs number and whatever else we get over the weekend,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.38 points, or 0.14 percent, to 16,374.76, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 2.27 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,951.13.\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.48 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,733.50.\nU.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.\nMSCI's all-country stock index rose 0.5 percent, while the FTSEuroFirst leading index of 300 shares closed up 2.4 percent. Germany's DAX shot up 2.7 percent .\nEconomic data showing the U.S. trade deficit shrank in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly also helped U.S. stocks in early trading. Other reports showed activity in the global manufacturing and service sectors expanded in August at the same pace as in July, with both the U.S. and euro zone doing better than Asia.\nChina's stock markets, the root of much of the global volatility in recent weeks, were closed on Thursday for the start of a two-day holiday.\nThe euro fell, surrendering most of the solid gains it put up against the dollar since China devalued the yuan last month.\nDuring Draghi's news conference, the euro dropped 1.4 percent against the dollar to touch a two-week low of $1.1108. It was last off 0.90 percent at $1.1122 after earlier this week reaching a high of $1.1332 as investors spooked by the Chinese markets turmoil moved heavily into the euro and yen.\nOil prices inched higher in see-saw trade, following the gains in U.S. equities for a second day despite a weekly build in U.S. crude inventories.\nBrent's front-month contract, settled up 18 cents at $50.68 a barrel. At one point during the session it had risen above $52.\nU.S. crude's front-month contract gained 50 cents, settling at $46.75. It went above $48 earlier.\nU.S. BONDS RISE\nU.S. Treasuries prices rose after the dovish outlook from the ECB made U.S. government debt more attractive than European counterparts. But caution ahead of Friday's U.S. employment report limited gains.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 6/32 in price to yield 2.17 percent.
