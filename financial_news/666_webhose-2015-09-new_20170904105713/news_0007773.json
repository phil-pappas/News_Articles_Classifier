Photo: Vince Caligiuri\nRetailers Solomon Lew and Mark McInnes have forecast a rebound in consumer confidence but have warned consumers to prepare for \"sticker shock\" as prices rise sharply in stores and online because of the weaker Australian dollar.\n\"The dollar was $US1 about 18 months ago and today its US72¢. The only two actions [retailers] can take are to re-source the product or put prices up,\" Mr McInnes, the chief executive of Mr Lew's Premier Investments, said on Friday.\n\"Retailers in general – whether it's hardgoods like Harvey Norman, retailers like ourselves, department stores, it doesn't matter – once hedging policies in each company have run through retail prices will have to go up,\" Mr McInnes said.\nPremier opened almost two dozen Smiggle stores last year, taking total stores to 188, and has unveiled plans to open 40 each year in Britain. Photo: Adam McLean\n\"The good thing is we are fully hedged for the summer season, so it's not our intention to put our prices up this summer, whereas some of our major competitors have already put prices up 10 to 30 per cent because they weren't hedged,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"We're definitely not going to lead prices. We'll definitely be following others.\"\nDespite the impact of rising prices on household budgets, Mr Lew expects consumer sentiment to rebound following Malcolm Turnbull's election as Prime Minister and says the timing, three months before Christmas, could not have been better for retailers reliant on pre-Christmas spending.\nPeter Alexander sleepwear delivered double-digit growth in sales.\n\"I think consumer confidence is going to go up. It has been at a low and I think we can look forward to a very positive Christmas,\" Mr Lew said.\nStrengthen consumer confidence After succeeding in his campaign to convince the government to close the GST loophole on overseas online retail purchases worth less than $1000, Mr Lew urged Mr Turnbull to pursue tax reforms and the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and take whatever steps were necessary to strengthen consumer confidence.\n\"I'm sure with a stable government we should get that,\" he said.\nStrong sales and margin growth at Smiggle and sleepwear brand Peter Alexander underpinned a 20.7 per cent increase in Premier Investments' net profit to $88.1 million for the 12 months ending July, slightly below market consensus forecasts about $90 million.\nGroup sales rose 6.2 per cent to $961.9 million, as double-digit growth at Smiggle and Peter Alexander offset subdued growth at the established brands Just Jeans, Dotti, Portmans and Jacqui E.\nSales are set to crack $1 billion this year and net profit will exceed $100 million for the first time as the retailer presses ahead with aggressive global expansion plans for its fast-growing Smiggle stationery brand and builds online businesses in Australia and overseas.\nPremier opened almost two dozen Smiggle stores last year, taking total stores to 188, and has unveiled plans to open at least 50 a year over the next few years, including 40 each year in Britain.\n\"Smiggle UK will be a significant profit driver to the group over the next five years, with potential for 200 stores and sales in excess of $200 million,\" Mr Lew said.\nTesting the brand Smiggle is also moving into Malaysia and Hong Kong for the first time this year, after testing the brand successfully in Singapore, and plans to open 10 stores a year, or 50 within five years.\nFurther down the track, Mr McInnes believes there is scope to open Smiggle stores in other parts of Europe, after seeing strong demand from countries such as France and Germany on Smiggle's new British-based webstore.\n\"Smiggle is delivering on its potential as a truly unique global brand,\" Mr McInnes said. \"We remain confident in the size of the future opportunity available to Smiggle and our management capability to achieve it.\"\nPremier, one of few Australian retailers to open transactional websites overseas, has also forecast strong growth from its profitable online business. Online sales are expected to exceed $100 million, or 10 per cent of total sales, within five years, augmenting bricks-and-mortar sales.\n\"We are getting [online] orders from places we haven't even considered putting stores and that gives us greater confidence about some of the extra store opportunities we have,\" Mr McInnes said.\nMr Lew and Mr McInnes issued no profit guidance, saying sales and earnings would depend on Christmas trading, but analysts are forecasting net profit to increase 15 per cent in 2016 to $101 million, fuelled by strong sales growth at Smiggle.\n\"We're hoping for a fantastic Christmas but the job is to actually trade it,\" Mr McInnes said.\nShort of forecasts The result was one of the best among non-food retailers this season, but fell slightly short of consensus forecasts. Premier shares, which have risen 21 per cent in 2015, fell 1.5 per cent to $11.97.\n\"The company had good second-half sales momentum, but gross margin expansion was constrained by [the weaker Australian dollar] and rising costs,\" Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford said.\nPremier increased its final dividend from 20¢ to 21¢, taking the full-year payout, including a special dividend in the first half, to 51¢.\nMr Lew said the group, which is sitting on $282 million cash and a $208 million pool of franking credits, would consider further capital management initiatives and did not rule out acquisitions.\nMr Lew has long been considered a potential buyer of Myer, whose market value is half that of Premier Investments.\n\"There are opportunities of making acquisitions. There's all kinds of permutations you could look at, but at this point in time we're committed to grow the business,\" he said.\nComparable store sales rose 3.4 per cent across the group in the July half, an improvement on the 1.1 per cent growth in the first half, taking full-year same-store growth to 2.2 per cent.\nEarnings before interest and tax jumped 13.9 per cent to $105.7 million, exceeding forecasts about $102 million. Premier also booked a $12.8 million profit from its 27 per cent stake in appliance maker Breville.\nGross margins rose 103 points to 63.1 per cent, swelled by lower clothing tariffs, reduced discounting and more direct sourcing from overseas, and further gains are forecast this year despite the weaker dollar.\nHowever, costs of doing business rose sharply, as Premier opened 16 Smiggle stores in Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:07:27.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
