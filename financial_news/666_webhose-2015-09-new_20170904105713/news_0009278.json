This once proud club went broke and Smith stepped in, promising to deliver a model of good management that would be the envy of the code.\nWhen he still bothered to speak to me, Smith told me of a board structure that would blow all of Sydney away with its balance of financial expertise, rugby league knowledge and sound management practices.\nHe said, very proudly, this would only be topped by the appointment of a woman to the top job of chairman. She would be so great that all other clubs would soon be chasing down females from within their districts to sit on their boards.\nSURPRISE SUPPORT: Farah’s backing for embattled Tigers coach\nBATTLE OF THE WEST: Tigers secure Panthers official as new CEO\nWhat Smith created at the Tigers is now laid bare with a club on its knees, in much worse shape than when Smith moved in, and so fractured that fans are crying tears of regret, great sadness and anger at what has happened to a once great foundation club.\nThe events of the past fortnight are not just about poor NRL leadership, an insecure, but cunning, coach or a star player who polarises his team. They are about what can happen when amateurs with no experience in running a rugby league club are handed the keys to head office.\nSmith was beside himself with excitement when he told me about his brainwave. He was going to appoint a woman to chair the board to balance out the gender inequities at club board level.\nWhen Marina Go’s name was announced, it was with some regret that I informed Smith she had no rugby league experience or passion. Yes she has, he insisted, her husband and son love the Tigers. This would be funny if it wasn’t true.\nDave Smith promised to deliver a model of good management at Wests Tigers that would be the envy of the NRL. Source: News Corp Australia\nGo has a background in women’s magazines. She rarely attended league matches and even now when she does, she manages to alienate Tigers fans with clueless tweets about long queues at the grounds.\nLooking out at the kilometre-long line to get into Campbelltown one day this season, Go trumpeted the chaos at the front gate as a sign that the Tigers fans were passionate. She ignored the infrastructure and organisational issues that dogged game day and caused families to walk away from their team’s home game before they could get through the door.\nGo’s lack of understanding has seen Jason Taylor run rampant since his appointment as head coach. He told the board he needed three years before they would play finals. They nodded like circus ponies.\nHe told the players, after they had won several games against the odds, to ditch that style of attacking play and concentrate on defence. They lost so many games after that they are now wooden-spoon contenders.\nIn the absence of a chief executive (Smith didn’t think that appointment was urgent enough), Taylor then did the unthinkable. He told his star player, Origin vice-captain Robbie Farah to find a new club.\nHe knew the club was broke but never mind that minor detail. He was happy to get rid of Farah, and a threat to his leadership, even if it meant another million-dollar payout. Go gave Taylor the green light to create the chaos and the debt.\nTigers coach Jason Taylor told Robbie Farah to look for a new club. Picture: Gregg Porteous Source: News Corp Australia\nThe basic litmus test for board members has failed dismally — employee relations and contract handling. To push Farah out the door, without getting any value back, is one of the biggest blunders ever seen at a rugby league club.\nThe new CEO has left Penrith and will start in November. He should be starting Monday instead of taking a two-month break. That Smith did not see fit to appoint an actual working boss to the club again underlines his lack of experience.\nThe NRL oversees and administers three broke clubs — Titans, Knights and Tigers. The other two do all right because they have management in place that knows what they are doing (not appointed by Smith).\nThe Tigers are the model Smith banked on to deliver him a personal approval rating. The experiment has failed beyond dismally and once again Dave Smith is found wanting on fundamentals that affect the future of the NRL.\n Who’s to blame in Tigers’ horrow show", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/wests-tigers-secure-penrith-panthers-head-of-rugby-league-justin-pascoe-as-clubs-new-chief-executive/story-fni3gpz1-1227511693564", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/dave-smith-is-the-master-of-disaster-as-wests-tigers-mess-highlights/story-fni3fbgz-1227513093202", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/04/1227513/093176-606ff246-52cc-11e5-8ed8-28a481437915.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/robbie-farah-says-jason-taylor-is-a-great-coach-who-is-doing-a-great-job-at-wests-tigers/story-fni3gpz1-1227511650969", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/04/1227513/092842-bd93ea0c-52c9-11e5-8ed8-28a481437915.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:18:02.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
