Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Reserve Bank of Australia will need to cut the official cash rate to a record-low 1.5 per cent next year because the confidence boost from last week's leadership change and a lower dollar won't be enough to lower the jobless rate, ANZ Bank says.\nIn a dramatically downbeat assessment of the challenges facing the Prime Minister and Treasurer, ANZ economists warned of weaker global growth and a waning of the housing market.\nThis would mean the economy won't be expanding fast enough to generate a sustained decline in the 6.2 per cent jobless rate.\nReserve Bank board members, who have left the cash rate on hold at 2 per cent since May, will be forced further into uncharted territory with 0.25 of a percentage point cuts in February and May.\n\"With this backdrop, it is difficult to see how inroads can be made into an elevated unemployment rate,\" ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan said.\nMr Hogan said softer emerging market growth, particularly in China, and little prospect of a further strength in non-mining investment, meant there was even a risk that the jobless rate would worsen rather than improve over the next 12 to 24 months.\nHe said Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens' \"path of least regret suggests he will need to cut rates again\".\nThe bleak forecast – which implies the number of Australians out of work will continue to climb next year from about 800,000 – increases the looming budget squeeze on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his new Treasurer Scott Morrison.\n \"The prospect of looser fiscal policy to assist growth is negligible,\" Mr Hogan said, noting Mr Morrison's comment this week that government spending at over 26 per cent of gross domestic product was \"not something that we believe is sustainable\".\n\"His comments suggest the current trajectory for a tightening in fiscal policy through smaller underlying cash deficits each year for the next three remains firmly in place,\" Mr Hogan said.\nThe ANZ research, released on Thursday, also casts doubt on whether the lower dollar will continue to deliver additional stimulus to the economy, which is expanding at just over 2 per cent – well below the long-run average.\n\"Even with further expected falls in the Australian dollar, the impetus to overall growth from the currency is expected to diminish.\"\nCooler housing market Likewise, the growth spurt in dwelling construction, particularly across Sydney, will likely run out of puff, they argue. Simultaneously a cooler housing market in Sydney and Melbourne, especially if investor activity slows, \"would remove a clear hurdle for the bank to cut rates further\".\nFinally, the ANZ team questioned the durability of the confidence boost that has accompanied the removal of Tony Abbott as prime minister.\n\"While it is encouraging to see a strong lift in consumer confidence following the change in Australia's political leadership, it may not be enough to move the dial on the economy in the next 12 to 18 months,\" Mr Hogan said.\nANZ said the rebound was unlikely to turn into additional investment and jobs growth, and even if it does, it won't be enough to offset the effects of slower growth in property and emerging markets.\nMr Hogan urged the new team in Canberra to \"present a vision for Australia's economy\" and outline plans for a return to surplus.\n\"This takes time and may even come at the cost of growth in the short term. As we move into 2016, sub-par economic growth in the context of weaker property markets will leave the job of supporting activity, once again, to the RBA,\" he said.\n\"In our view, a modest downward adjustment to the cash rate will ensure stable unemployment and support economic activity over the medium term.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-24T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:07:02.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
