Apple was up 0.5 percent and was the biggest boost to the three major indexes.\nOil prices erased early gains with U.S. crude down as much as 3 percent after the impact of lower crude inventories was offset by large gasoline builds. Chevron was down 1.5 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500.\nScott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors said volatility was likely to continue until the third-quarter corporate earnings season starts.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, popularly known as the \"fear gauge\", was down 0.8 percent at 22.26, but remained above its long-term average of 20.\nFirst Niagara Financial was up 12.8 percent at $10.12 after Bloomberg reported the regional bank was exploring a sale.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,748 to 1,194. On the Nasdaq, 1,530 issues fell and 1,168.\nThe S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 35 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and 110 new lows.
