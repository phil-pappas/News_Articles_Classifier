Or halfway through writing a report you get distracted by a ringing telephone? Or you find you’re thinking about something that happened yesterday instead of focusing on this article?\nDeclining attention span\nIf you answered yes, you’re not alone. The latest research shows our attention is wandering for 47 per cent of our waking hours and our concentration span dropped from 13 seconds in 2009 to just eight seconds in 2013. This is one of the consequences of working in a fast-paced business environment where we face multiple demands at the same time. We respond by trying to solve them all at once by multi-tasking. However, instead of making us more efficient, studies have shown multi-tasking actually reduces our productivity by as much as 20-40 per cent. Further, we are more susceptible to making errors, it takes us longer to complete a task, and it increases stress.\nMindfulness training\nIn response many companies around the world, including high-profile corporates such as Google, Carlsberg, Apple, and Deutsche Bank, have implemented workplace mindfulness programs. Simply, mindfulness involves the intentional and non-judgemental focus of our attention on the moment. For an employee it means thinking only of the task at hand which results in greater productivity, more creativity, less stress and burnout, and improved team relations. Here are some ways to practise mindfulness in your workplace. With continued practice you will find it progressively easier to maintain your full attention for longer periods.\n1. Start your day with a mindful minute\nFor one minute solely focus on your breathing. Inhale through your nose for a count of five and then exhale from your mouth for a count of five. Let any intrusive thoughts fall away and return to your breathing. This is a great activity to help centre and relax yourself. Try it when you first wake up, on the train, or when you arrive at your office.\n2. Focus on what you can control\nIt has been said 85 per cent of things we worry about never end up happening. This adds up to a lot of needless stress and anxiety. It also means we are wasting valuable time better spent completing projects, solving problems, and enhancing team relations. Restrict your focus to things within your control.\n3. Single-task at every opportunity\nPractise single-tasking throughout the day whether driving to work, booting up your computer, walking through the office, or eating lunch. For example, when eating, chew food on both sides of your mouth, distinguish the individual ingredients by tastes and textures, smell the food, and completely finish swallowing the food you are eating before taking another mouthful.\n4. Mindfully listen to your co-workers\nListen carefully to what the person is saying to you, hear the words, watch their body movements, and feel their emotions. Most importantly, listen without judgment. As they are talking resist the urge to interrupt with your own opinions or comments. Focus on what they want, not on what you want — listen to understand.\n5. Listen to your stress responses\nYour thoughts determine your emotional reactions. So the next time you feel your heart racing, identify the thought that caused your stress response. Question your thought’s truthfulness: ‘What evidence is there for this thought?’ Question its usefulness, ‘Does this belief serve me or does it disempower me?’ Change your reaction by changing your thought.\n6. Embrace downtime moments\nResist the urge to use these moments ‘catching up’ with text messages or phone calls. Use these moments to relax and calm yourself. Practise mindful breathing or try mindful observation where you visually explore something outside the window such as a bird in the branches, the wind cattle-stealing leaves, or clouds skating across the sky.\n7. Express gratitude\nGratitude is one of the kings of happiness. It reminds us about what we have, instead of what we don’t have. Gratitude is also a great way to stay in the present as we are less likely to ruminate about the past or the future. Make a habit of thanking people you work with and letting them know how their efforts help you achieve your own goals.\n8. Help others\nThe best way to feel instantly happier is to help someone else. It releases chemicals associated with wellbeing leading to a Helper’s High. The act of kindness positively affects the helper and the receiver. Also, when you help someone else you are distracted from your own worries which help anchor your attention to the present.\nDr. Bruce Wells.
