Jeremy Yao Share on twitter by John McDuling The fact that Alex Turnbull is on Twitter has been widely reported , and will come as no surprise to finance geeks. That said, you will have to do a bit of sleuthing to find him on the social network now, because at some point over the past year or so he quietly changed his handle.\nIn March 2014, I reported that Turnbull jnr, who was working at the time for Goldman Sachs on a trading desk in Singapore, had inadvertently unmasked the man behind the infamous @GSElevator Twitter account, months before The New York Times claimed to reveal his true identity. The @GSElevator account purported to relay discussions from inside the elevators of the famed investment bank, where Turnbull worked at the time.\nMy story contained embedded tweets from a Twitter account with the handle @AlexBHTurnbull, which multiple investment banking and political sources confirmed belonged to Alex Turnbull.\nBut a quick glance at these stories today shows the Twitter handle has since been changed to @Nemo_Incognito (which based on my rudimentary Latin skills, seems to translate into something like \"a nobody in disguise\").\nHere's a screenshot from The Atlantic version which still initially loads like this.\nIt's not clear exactly when this change happened (for privacy reasons, Twitter cannot confirm). A search in Google, which caches many old tweets, also shows replies to what is now @Nemo_Incognito were originally directed at @AlexBHTurnbull. For example, take this conversation between prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreesen (another must-follow if you are interested in business and tech) and Turnbull.\n Fairfax Media has independently confirmed that the new handle belongs to Alex Turnbull. It is understood that the change was made to comply with Goldman Sachs policies.\nTurnbull left Goldman Sachs in mid 2014 to found his own hedge fund, Keshik Capital, which is based in Singapore and invests mainly publicly-traded corporate credit and equity securities issued by Asian companies. He featured in recent episode of Four Corners about Fortescue Metals and its CEO Andrew Twiggy Forrest.\nHe is yet to tweet about his father's ascension to the highest political office in Australia, but as the following screenshot shows, he did seem to find the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in the UK quite interesting.\nHere's hoping Turnbull continues to tweet. Finance Twitter is one of the best Twitter subcultures, and only a handful of prominent Australian investors, like Bronte Capital's John Hempton, participate in it.", "external_links": ["http://qz.com/183359/gselevators-true-identity-was-publicly-available-for-at-least-seven-months/", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/tweet.PNG", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/pmarcaturnbull.PNG", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-01/ex-goldman-banker-turnbull-said-to-plan-hedge-fund-correct-", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/the-true-identity-of-gselevator-has-been-known-since-at-least-july/284196/", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/AlexBHTurnbull.PNG", "http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2015/07/27/4279495.htm"], "published": "2015-09-16T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:10:30.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
