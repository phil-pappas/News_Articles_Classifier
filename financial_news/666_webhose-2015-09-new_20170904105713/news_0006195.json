As an entrepreneur, it's important to not only be passionate about what you're trying to achieve, but bring that passion to the menial tasks it takes to get there.\"\nDucere's partnership with the University of Canberra means students can now work towards bachelors degrees in applied entrepreneurship, applied social entrepreneurship, applied business in management and applied business in marketing.\nAdvertisement \"Our partnership with the University of Canberra is what allows us to develop programs that are world-class and internationally recognised,\" de Silva says. \"This partnership also sees us deliver a unique MBA program with innovation and leadership offered where students complete real industry projects with our industry partners including KPMG and the Department of Education.\"\nDucere taps the brains trust of a Global Leaders Faculty, which counts more than 250 successful people as members. Self-made billionaires, Fortune 500 chief executives and former heads of state have participated in bespoke interviews for Ducere, sharing stories and experiences to deliver important lessons to students.\n\"For students studying entrepreneurship, they get insight and advice from people who have been there and done that like the founders of Seek and Dave McClure, a super angel investor in Silicon Valley,\" de Silva says.\nPractical skills imparted to students include the finer points of delivering a pitch to investors or customers. \"It could be technically brilliant but if it's not delivered with passion, the result will never be as good,\" de Silva says.\nStudents are encouraged to challenge the norm and bring their own perspectives and interests into all of their assessment tasks. Rather than being told what they should focus on, de Silva says students are allowed to choose for themselves so all of their learning is relevant to them.\n\"Students also learn how to apply those things into real life so they become immediately useful,\" he says. \"Eight of the 24 units in our entrepreneurship degrees are spent applying what they've learnt towards developing their own venture or business. In our degrees, we bridge the gap between education and experience and we make sure students know how to apply everything they learn.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:02:00.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
