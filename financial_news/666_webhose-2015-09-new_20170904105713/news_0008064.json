Individuals who wind up selecting the wrong plan may not have budgeted for deductibles exceeding $1,000, putting themselves into jeopardy when they lack the savings to pay for it. \nSince open enrollment begins on November 1, it’s not too early for consumers to start researching plans and decide if it is more important that they pay less each month in premiums and face a higher deductible or spend more money now and have a lower deductible. Open enrollment ends on January 31, 2016, which means consumers are locked into a plan for a year and can only switch plans if they qualify for special enrollment .

Although 56% of people said they spend less than 30 minutes researching their benefits and 34% said they spend less than 15 minutes in a recent Aflac survey, this apathy means many consumers wind up regretting their decision. \n“People are reluctant to get deep into the weeds when it comes to healthcare, but a greater investment of time would be absolutely worthwhile,” said Matthew Owenby, chief human resources officer at Aflac, the Columbus, Ga.-based supplemental health insurance company.” The survey found that many people would rather complete tedious chores than research benefits with 38% who would rather clean out their email inbox, 23% would rather clean their toilet, 21% would rather pull weeds, 18% would rather do their taxes and 12% would rather have a dental cavity filled. \nWhile these reasons are amusing, they can have a distressing impact on budgets, because consumers could be “faced with additional out-of-pocket expenses down the road,” he said. “Unfortunately, not too many Americans take the time to read the fine print. In reality, it is always in consumers’ best interest to put in the time to make sure there aren’t any regrets, if and when a medical situation happens.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T23:08:15.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
