Alex Ellinghausen by Andrew Clark Malcolm Turnbull is now 60 years old. Thirty years ago, during his 30th birthday party, his onetime editor, Trevor Kennedy, told assembled guests: \"We're here to celebrate Malcolm's plans to become Prime Minister of the world.\"\nOn Monday night, it seemed Turnbull had dramatically advanced those plans – in Australia, anyway. But the question remains whether he has it within him to channel that searing ambition into becoming an effective, even visionary, Prime Minister of an Australia where the 'lucky country' sobriquet is fast passing its use-by date.\nMore specifically, has Turnbull changed enough to never again be the impulsive, self-centred individual impatient to take the levers of power?\nPut another way, has Turnbull gone through the sort of soul searching that Robert Menzies undertook from the time he was ignominiously pushed out of the Prime Ministership by his own Party in 1941, to leading the reconstituted, re-named Liberal Party back to electoral triumph at the polls eight years later.\n\"John Howard – after Menzies, the most successful politician in the Liberal Party's history - played a leading role in persuading Turnbull to stay on in Parliament suggests that at the back of many experienced Liberal minds was a possible scenario like the one currently unfolding,\" Andrew Clark writes. Jay Cronan For Turnbull, the time lapse since he so ignominiously lost the Liberal leadership is nearly six years. But the fact that former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard – after Menzies, the most successful politician in the Liberal Party's history - played a leading role in persuading him to stay on in Parliament suggests that at the back of many experienced Liberal minds was a possible scenario like the one currently unfolding.\nIn once again entertaining the idea of Turnbull becoming Prime Minister, the Liberals have taken one look at the polls, and apparently decided that retaining Tony Abbott in the top job would mount to a collective suicide pact.\nBut if they take on Turnbull, they have also decided to swallow deep reservations over his sometimes erratic early performance as Liberal leader, mistrust of his more moderate stance on issues ranging from the republic, to climate change and gay marriage, a wide circle of acquaintances \"on the other side\", and seething personal animosity towards him among some Liberal MPs.\nBut separating out these issues dilutes the one critical fact about Malcolm Turnbull. He is different. He is by nature a centrist, although the need to keep the Party's conservative ideologues inside the Liberal tent may obscure this fact in the next few months. He is not a political apparatchik or white bread politician. Above all he is interesting.\n \"Turnbull gone through the sort of soul searching that Robert Menzies undertook from the time he was ignominiously pushed out of the Prime Ministership by his own Party,\" writes Andrew Clark. SMH Turnbull's complexity can be partly explained by his background. His father Bruce was a successful, knock-about hotel broker and property owner. Bruce, who was extremely close to his son, was killed in a light plane accident in 1982 and is buried on a beautiful family property near Scone, NSW.\nTurnbull's mother was Coral Lansbury, the English literature academic and novelist. Among her works is The Grotto. Amazon, the net-based book retailer, describes it as a novel set in the 1920s spanning \"two worlds: Sicily with its sinister legends and ancient shrines, and Australia where nothing seems impossible for a young, intelligent girl\".\nWhat proved impossible in their marriage was domestic tranquility. They separated, but the influence of two strong, disparate characters remains in their son.\nA striking figure Malcolm Turnbull made a splash wherever he went at Oxford University, as a brash young journalist on The Bulletin, as Kerry Packer's company secretary and corporate counsel, as the man who orchestrated Packer's successful rebuttal of sensational allegations emerging from the Costigan royal commission, as lead lawyer in the defence of former UK intelligence officer Peter Wright against a failed British government attempt to suppress his book, as an investment banker and investor, initiating some spectacularly successful deals; and as the driving force behind the Australian Republican Movement.\nThe sense of difference is accentuated by his considerable wealth – according to some estimates, he is worth about $120 million – reflected in Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull's magnificent residence in Sydney's ultra-exclusive Point Piper.\nHe has made his own history and has an appealing streak of independence. But a key to understanding Turnbull's extraordinary rise are his close ties to the media empire of the later Kerry Packer. There, he formed associations with Trevor Kennedy, an early mentor and editor who later became an investment partner; with Sean Howard, another Packer editor who also became an investment partner; with Bruce McWilliam, a Packer lawyer who later worked with Turnbull in merchant banking, then for Rupert Murdoch in London; and with Packer himself.\nHis wife, Lucy, is an able lawyer who is also a philanthropist, author, onetime Lord Mayor of Sydney, and the key counsel to her husband. She is the other half of what is likely to emerge as the city's – indeed, the nation's - most powerful couple.\nMalcolm Turnbull himself is immersed in Sydney's business, political and arts circles, and has impressive contacts in New York, London, continental Europe and Russia. He can get former US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on the phone whenever he wants.\nBefore the end of the week it may be US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, or British Prime Minister David Cameron.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:11:05.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
