The figures give a rough gauge of how much Treasuries the authority may have sold to defend its currency last month.\nAnalysts from Barclays Plc and Societe Generale SA forecast the reserve decline may have tallied about $122 billion and $150 billion, respectively, which would represent the biggest monthly draw-down since at least 1996.\nInvestors are paying more attention to China’s use of its reserves -- about a third of which is in Treasuries -- since the shock devaluation of the yuan on Aug. 11. To stabilize the exchange rate following its currency shift, the central bank has bought yuan and sold dollars to support the yuan and stem outflows. That operation drains liquidity and puts a brake on economic growth.\n“The PBOC appeared to be heavily active in the spot market after the currency regime change on Aug. 11 in order to stabilize the yuan,” Wei Yao, a Paris-based China economist at Societe Generale, wrote in a research report Sept. 3. “We think that $1 trillion is the absolute maximum the PBOC can sell.”\nPolicy Decisions Excluding the effect of exchange-rate fluctuations, the PBOC may reduce reserves by as much as 14 percent from June to December, according to Barclays. To replenish liquidity, the central bank may lower the reserve requirement ratio for domestic financial institutions by 40 basis points a month, following the 50 basis-point reduction to 18 percent late last month, Barclays estimates.\n\"We do not believe the present policy is sustainable given the associated costs in terms of FX reserves depletion and liquidity imbalances,\" Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia Pacific currency strategy at Barclays in Singapore, wrote in a note Sept. 3.\nThe central bank started to report monthly reserve data in August, though there is no set schedule.\nChina, with $1.27 trillion of Treasuries as of June, is the biggest overseas holder. If the International Monetary Fund’s aggregation of international reserve assets is any guide, around two-thirds of the nation’s reserves are in dollars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:49:49.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
