Traders cited uncertainty over possible equity issuance and the outlook in China as fuelling short bets on the stock, which fell to an all-time low. \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) the China-exposed names, such as miners, we think have fallen too far. Much of the negative news is priced in as the PMI data was not a surprise and we were expecting a weak print,\" said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers. \nThe top riser was Ashtead, up 5 percent after posting a first-quarter profit rise helped by a rebound in U.S. construction markets. \n\"Progress in the quarter is thanks to strong execution and a strategy of geographical and sector diversification ... as well as a seasonal improvement in demand following a weather-impacted spring,\" Mike van Dulken, Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) of Research at Accendo Markets, said in a note. \nPharmaceutical firms Hikma and AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) were also among top risers, up 3.6 percent and 0.9 percent, benefiting from upgrades by Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and HSBC respectively. \nAmong mid-caps, the car parts to bikes retailer Halfords fell 10 percent after a recent boom in bicycle sales fell off sharply in its second quarter due to wet August weather and increased discounting in the market. \nEngineering company Diploma (LSE: DPLM.L - news ) was the second heaviest midcap loser, down 7.8 percent, as currency hedging contracts set to expire next year will be replaced by more expensive ones, hitting next financial year's operations. \nBritish online fashion retailer ASOS (LSE: ASC.L - news ) rebounded to trade up 3.9 percent after its founder, Nick Robertson, stepped down as chief executive after 15 years in which he transformed the internet minnow into a retail powerhouse.
