Prior to that, I was president of a small home building company in the north and northwest suburbs, building custom and spec homes as well as small commercial buildings. Since 1983, my real estate resale business has grown to encompass the city of Chicago, from the South Loop, north to Rogers Park and the north and northwest Suburbs, allowing me to become ‘Your City and Suburban Expert’. Prior to building homes, I was in the hotel business. I felt that the technical knowledge of building a home coupled with the customer service of the hotel industry was a perfect blend of what I needed to serve my clients in the real estate industry. I was also a single Dad at that time and the nature of the business allowed me some scheduling flexibility to be a part of my son's life while he was growing up,” Steve Heilig says.
