Announces Unitholder Approval of Proposal \nTORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Sept. 11, 2015) - Strathbridge Asset Management Inc. (the \"Manager\"), the manager of NDX Growth & Income Fund (the \"Fund\") (TSX:NGI.UN), is pleased to announce that unitholders of the Fund have approved a proposal to change the Fund's investment restrictions. As a result, the Fund will now have the flexibility to invest in any equity security included in the NASDAQ-100 Index(SM) instead of being required to invest at least 75% of its net assets in the top 20 highest yielding constituents of the Index. In addition, the Fund's investment restrictions have been changed to: (i) add a limitation on the extent to which the Fund's assets may be invested in the equity securities of any one issuer to 10% of net asset value; (ii) add the ability of the Fund to have short exposure for non-hedging purposes but only up to 10% of the Fund's net asset value; (iii) eliminate the limitation on the ability of the Fund to write cash covered put options on securities in which the Fund is permitted to invest; and (iv) amend the Fund's covered call option writing strategy so that the Fund is no longer limited to writing on a maximum of 33% of the portfolio. As a result the Manager will have greater flexibility to respond to changes in volatility in the market. The Manager believes these changes will provide an opportunity to generate better returns going forward. \nFinally, the Fund's fixed termination date of November 30, 2018 was eliminated so that the Fund now no longer has a fixed termination date. \nFor further information, please contact Investor Relations at 416.681.3966, toll free at 1.800.725.7172 or visit www.strathbridge.com .
