Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Cashed-up Caltex is eyeing a number of acquisitions, but it's hard to look much further than buying out its partner Woolworths from its petrol joint venture.\nOnly 1 per cent of Woolworths' earnings before interest and tax comes from the fuel business, though it is used to drive sales in the grocery businesss.\nIf the petrol division was spun off or sold, Woolworths may be able to retain supermarket bundle agreements with the new owner.\nAs the supermarket chain under new chairman Gordon Cairns reviews its operations, it could be perfect timing to consider a deal with Caltex.\nUBS analyst Cameron Hardie estimates Caltex has about $600 million up its sleeve to allocate to acquisitions and capital management initiatives while maintaining its BBB+ credit rating.\nOther targets for Caltex chief executive Julian Segal include BP's local retail business should the British major exit Australia, though the company isn't in divestment mode.\nElsewhere, private Chinese group Landbridge (perhaps best known in Australia for last year's $178 million takeover of Queensland coal-seam gas play WestSide Corp) has emerged as a bidder in the auction for the $300 million-plus Port of Darwin.\nThe sale of the port has been progressing slowly, but the Northern Territory government, which is being advised by Flagstaff Partners, is aiming to have the long-term lease signed and implemented by the end of the year.\n Interestingly, sources suggested at least one of Flinders Ports' backers may be weighing up a binding offer. The South Australian port dropped out of the auction last month as its shareholder group could not agree on price, but it's believed Infrastructure Capital Group, and potentially Equipsuper, are back in the mix.\nThe other two bidders are Deutsche Asset Wealth Management and the JPMorgan-advised Port of Brisbane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:14:27.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
