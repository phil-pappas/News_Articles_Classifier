Research has indicated that, when using a telecom/IT consultant, it takes 8-10 months to actually realize savings. Often, a company is required to switch vendors which could add extra time due to the quoting and implementation processes. Optelcon has addressed one concern by previously rolling out its rapid RFP. Optelcon is now introducing its new Benchmark and Optimization and Enterprise Rate Analysis systems to begin saving its clients money within 60 days without switching vendors.\n“We are very proud to be able to offer these new technologies to our clients. In most cases, a client can begin saving money within 60 days without changing vendors and with nothing more than an addendum to their existing contract. This model is unique in the industry, not only because of the short time-frame to savings, but also because clients are not required to change vendors,” says Bob Pommer, CEO and Founder of Optelcon.\nOptelcon’s new Benchmark and Optimization Systems works because of real time access to the best-in-class rates provided by vendors for similar sized companies. Optelcon works with your current vendor to secure these rates on your behalf. This saves you time and money because there are no lengthy RFP processes, minimized time to get a new contract through legal and NO implementation time, cost or headaches.\nThe Enterprise Rate Analysis takes two pieces of information and lets a customer know, with one phone call or e-mail, if their rates are competitive based upon similar sized companies. These quick results are 95% accurate with no accounts to set up, no bills to load and with 100% privacy.\nAbout Optelcon\nFounded in 2004 and based in Chicago, Optelcon is a global IT, telecom and mobility spend reduction firm that specializes in contract negotiations, benchmarking, optimization and life-cycle management.
