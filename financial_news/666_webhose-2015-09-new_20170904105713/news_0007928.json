Photo: Daniel Munoz\nANZ Banking Group has reassured the market its credit quality in Asia remains sound and it has the ability to reduce exposure in China quickly if economic conditions sour further.\nAt the B20 meeting in Turkey earlier in September, ANZ chief executive Mike Smith said representatives from China admitted \"process and execution\" errors were made with the faltering sharemarket and recent devaluation of the renminbi, but the B20 considered \"the hysteria that emanated around China's slowdown is very much overblown\".\nBefore a presentation to a CLSA conference in Hong Kong this week, ANZ released a 95-page slide pack on Monday afternoon, along with a statement declaring its China assets \"have a stronger average credit rating than ANZ's institutional assets in Australia and New Zealand\".\n\"China only accounts for about 3 per cent of [ANZ's] total outstandings as a group, which is very small,\" Mr Smith said.\nAdvertisement \"But the significance of that is that 88 per cent of our exposure to China is of a tenor of less than one year, which basically means that should there be issues, our ability to actually reduce our exposure is very straightforward.\n\"I am absolutely not worried about our China exposure. It's actually much higher quality than the rest of Asia, New Zealand or indeed Australia.\"\nWith the US Federal Reserve's decision due on Friday on whether to start raising interest rates, Mr Smith said delegates to the B20 believed the US economy was \"doing much better than was probably thought to be possible by now\" and \"there was a real consensus that the Fed needed to raise rates, just to take away the uncertainty, and certainly that was a message delivered quite strongly to the US\".\nï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:42:55.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
