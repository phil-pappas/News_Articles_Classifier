Be patient: “Generally it pays to wait until the last minute to buy a ticket as sellers are more willing to drop their price once the event gets closer,” says Cameron Papp, spokesman for StubHub. “However, this isn’t always the case. If a team starts doing well, demand will increase and ticket prices could rise.” \nAs an item with a firm expiration date, an NFL ticket tends to drop in price as sellers try to offload them. While StubHub's app sets a price alert that notifies customers as soon a seller hits the desired price point for a particular event, that isn't necessary in most cases. \n“While there may be less inventory to choose from, those tickets that do remain will most likely be at a discounted price,” says Chris Leyden, spokesman for SeatGeek. “In the case of the Chicago Bears last season, the average ticket resold for $249 three weeks out from a game, but just $195 three days before the game. That's a drop in price of 22%.” \nAs marquee matchups move along, the chances of getting a cheaper ticket only increase. In fact, as playoff races are decided and teams are eliminated, Chris Matcovich of TiqIQ notes that NFL resale prices drop on average 11.92% from the beginning to the season to the end.
