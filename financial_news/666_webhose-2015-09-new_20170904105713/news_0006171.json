This has been 100 per cent about workers' families and mental health,\" AMWU WA branch secretary Steve McCartney said. \n\"FIFO is no longer just a young man's game - we now have 60,000 FIFO workers in Western Australia, and many of them have husbands, wives and children.\" \nMr McCartney, who has been involved with campaigns since the 1980s to reduce rosters from 13 weeks on and one week off, said the win was a historic \"watershed deal\". @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Apple wants to guide news consumption AAP \nApple wants to become more central to the way people consume news.
