Julie Nelson, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts in Boston, says the conventional wisdom is wrong.\nMs. Nelson recently published peer-reviewed research that concludes not only that the appetite of men and women for financial risk is largely the same, but that much of the earlier data suggesting there were such differences has been misinterpreted.\n“Men and women tend to be much more similar in their responses to risk than the popular Mars-versus-Venus understanding would imply,” she states in her paper, “Are Women Really More Risk-Averse Than Men? A Re-Analysis of the Literature Using Expanded Methods.” The Journal of Economic Surveys published the paper in July.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Wealth Management Money and College: The Crucial Questions for Parents and Children More U.S. Students Look to College Abroad Why Peer Pressure May Not Help You Save More for Retirement When Millennials Move Back Home Mistakes Charitable Startups Make The study reanalyzed 35 scholarly works about risk and gender in economics, decision science and finance. In doing so, Ms. Nelson developed an “Index of Similarity,” which looks at what proportion of men and women showed the same types of risk behavior in those earlier studies. The re-examined works predominantly considered financial investment decision-making but also looked at decisions about lotteries, gambling and health.\nMs. Nelson’s findings suggest that men and women share much the same appetite for financial risk. The “overlap between male and female distributions…generally exceeded 80%,” her report says.\nBut it is precisely in interpreting such figures that things tend to go awry, she says. “It’s very dangerous to try to draw conclusions about individual people from these kinds of measures,” she says. For example, what does it mean, when measuring risk-taking, if the average score of women is 85% the average score of men? It doesn’t mean that a woman is, on average, 15% less risk-taking than a man, she says.\nYou could pair up all of the men and women in a sample and find that in every pair except one, the man and woman have exactly the same risk profile, for instance. But if the man in that one pair has taken a risk far greater than any other person in the sample, it can inflate the male mean and distort the entire picture.\nThe professor continues: Looking at the real distributions in the earlier studies, there were always 80% or more men and women with the same risk profile. Frequently it was 90% to 95%, she says. “The difference in mean can be and is often driven by a small group,” she says.\nMs. Nelson adds that while individual men and women aren’t all that different with regard to risk-taking, they do behave differently in groups.\nIn her paper, she cites a study published in the British Journal of Social Psychology in 2006 by Richard Ronay and Do-Yeong Kim which shows that when men take positions or make decisions as part of a group, they tend to adopt significantly more risky strategies than those taken by a control group. This effect wasn't observed with women in groups, Ms. Nelson notes.\nOne might ask, if men and women have similar appetites for risk individually, what explains men’s apparent penchant for greater risk-taking in groups? Her answer: Men in groups tend to show off. They egg one another on to display what she calls the “cultural norm of male daring.”\nPhoto: Vadym Drobot/iStock/Getty Images Ms. Nelson cites several authors who ponder a partly fanciful question: Would history be different if Wall Street had featured a “Lehman Sisters” instead of Lehman Brothers? The research suggests that women likely would have assumed more manageable levels of risk than those taken by Lehman Brothers, the investment bank whose collapse helped set in motion the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\nMr. Constable is a New York-based writer.
