XPO -2.38 % is turning its operating model in a different direction with the acquisition of Con-way Inc. CNW -1.80 % The $3 billion purchase announced late Wednesday is perhaps the splashiest, if not the largest in dollar value, that XPO has made in bulking up to what’s projected to be a $15 billion company this year. WSJ Logistics Report’s Brian Baskin and Loretta Chao write that the buy brings XPO the second-largest less-than-truckload carrier in the U.S., along with a truckload operation and the Menlo Logistics business . The deal puts XPO directly into the trucking business in the U.S. for the first time, a shift from the freight-broker model that Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs has focused on to create the company. It also runs counter to trends in the logistics sector that have favored asset-light companies. Jacobs has helped fuel that view with his acquisitions over the past five years, and now he’ll see whether XPO can be as successful with trucks in its portfolio.\nThe union representing United Parcel Service Inc. UPS -0.90 % pilots is stepping up pressure on the package giant as the critical holiday season approaches. The Independent Pilots Association is calling for a strike vote as the pilots and UPS enter their fifth year of contract negotiations . The WSJ’s Laura Stevens writes the vote tally would come Oct. 23, just as retailers and consumers are lining up for the late dash toward the holidays. A strike is unlikely, but UPS has plenty of reason to be concerned about a vote even if no walkout follows. The threat would come so close to the holiday season that it may push shippers to look toward FedEx Corp. FDX -1.13 % and other operators to hedge their bets. It’s not so easy for shippers to switch at the last minute: during a 16-day walkout by unionized UPS workers nearly 20 years ago, shippers had a hard time finding space with carriers if they weren’t long-time customers.\nNew sourcing decisions by McDonald’s Corp. MCD -1.39 % are likely to trigger big changes in food supply chains. The fast-food giant says it will start using eggs only from cage-free chickens in the U.S. and Canada over the next decade . The WSJ’s Julie Jargon and Lisa Beilfuss report that because of McDonald’s sheer scale—the company buys more than two billion eggs annually in the U.S.—the decision will be felt across the agriculture industry, adding to the impact of decisions by other companies to turn to cage-free providers for egg supplies. It also adds to the growing movement by food providers to overhaul supply chains in response to consumer concerns over food quality and practices by suppliers. Companies say they also are trying to be more open about where their food comes from, an effort that’s spurring greater use of technology and data in food supply chains that can be extremely complicated and very far from transparent.\nTRANSPORTATION ENLARGE Con-way Freight is the second-largest less-than-truckload carrier in the U.S., behind FedEx Freight. Photo: Con-way Inc. Concerns over coal are getting deeper at freight railroads. CSX Corp. CSX -0.68 % lowered its outlook for 2015 on Wednesday, and the WSJ’s Ezequiel Minaya said coal and other commodities are weighing heavily on earnings and on operations . The carrier estimates that revenue from domestic coal transport could by more than $400 million this year from 2014. The problems at CSX and other railroads highlight the impact that China’s economic slowdown is having around the globe. Prices for commodities including iron ore, copper and Brent oil are way down, and carload shipments are on a downward path. According to the Association of American Railroads, commodity carloads were down 4.1% for the year through Sept. 5, with the pace of the decline accelerating. CSX says its pricing is relatively strong, however, suggesting that the carrier is working overtime to match its capacity to demand.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ By having at least a minority component of assets in the business mix, we…get a bigger seat at the table with customers. ’\n—XPO Logistics Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs.\nIN OTHER NEWS Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
