Buyer's market A high profile block of 12 apartments and ground-floor commercial street frontages at 289 O'Sullivan Road, Bellevue Hill did not even get a look in with the only bid at $10 million by the seller.\nHowever, other properties such as the 16/7-11 Henderson Street in Bondi saw three potential buyers fight it out with one finally buying it at $1.6 million after it started at $1.4 million.\nBondi resident, Sarah Warn who missed out was not bothered. \"We were happy to wait. This isn't the only property,\" she said. \"It's also not worth that much.\"\nTimes are changing with buyers picky about houses in Point Piper Anthony Johnson The property last sold in 2010 for just over $1 million.\nBuyers continued to exercise their upper hand with 76-69 St Marks Road, Randwick barely taking off.\nThe property had one vendor's bid at $650,000 and the only bidder clinched the deal at $662,000 after much discussion with the vendor via the agent.\nBut buyers made an about turn and went after 1/459-461 Old South Head Road, Rose Bay with four parties frantically bidding. The sale started at $680,000 but ended at $860,000.\n\"The key to the sale was that we were selling a dream,\" marketing agent, Position Realty's Deborah Terley said.\n\"We did not expect the price for this deceased estate not sold since 1968. It needed plumbing, renovations, new carpets ... A renovated unit in the block had sold for about $830,000.\"\n\"But it had all the key factors, close to amenities, ferry, schools and it gave people an opportunity to turn it into their own.\"\n'Be where the market is' While buyers dictated the auction on Monday night, Ms Terley said house prices were not coming down.\n\"There might be about a 5 per cent downward adjustment but things vary depending on the property,\" she said.\n\"You have to be where the market is. If you go too high it's going to affect the marketing price point.\"\n\"Realistic prices are the way to go and how well a property will sell in this current market depends on the property itself and the marketing.\"\nOne of the last sales on Monday night - 294 Military Road, Dover Heights - reflected this trend.\nThe six-bedroom house had been on the market for 18 months at a price of over $4 million.\nAfter a revised vendor sale price of $3.5 million, three bidders went for the six-bedroom house with a family closing the deal at $3.75 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:05:45.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
