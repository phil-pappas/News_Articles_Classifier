It was well-known that his job was in jeopardy over the continuing two-party feud over Planned Parenthood funding. His resignation might prevent a government shutdown while maintaining current funding for Planned Parenthood. \n“It was my plan to only serve as Speaker until the end of last year, but I stayed on to provide continuity to the Republican Conference and the House,” Boehner said. “It is my view, however, that prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable damage to the institution. To that end, I will resign the Speakership and my seat in Congress on October 30.” \nHe continued by expressing his appreciation to the people of his district: “Today, my heart is full with gratitude for my family, my colleagues and the people of Ohio’s Eighth District. God bless this great country that has given me — the son of a bar owner from Cincinnati — the chance to serve.” \nRead: 5 Ways a Government Shutdown Over Obamacare Could Impact Your Savings How John Boehner Resignation Prevents Government Shutdown \nPrior to John Boehner’s resignation announcement, hardcore conservative members of his party were threatening to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, claiming the group was selling fetal parts. The White House has promised to veto any bill that defunds the non-profit organization that provides reproductive healthcare and affordable medical care to men, women and teenagers. If a funding bill isn’t passed in the next week, there could be a federal government shutdown on Oct. 1. \nBoehner isn’t planning to step down from his position until Oct. 30, which gives him plenty of time to make a deal on Planned Parenthood funding — and now that he doesn’t have to worry about getting fired, he can partner with Democrats. \n“He will be free to prevent a government shutdown, as he has said he wants to do, by doing what he’s done numerous times, and that’s to pass a bill with Pelosi’s help,” said analyst Omar Sharif at SG Americas Security. “After that, he can ride off into the sunset.” How a Government Shutdown Affects Your Finances \nThe last government shutdown started on Oct. 1, 2013 and lasted for 16 days because Congress couldn’t agree on a budget for the new fiscal year. Federal government employees were starting to fear a repeat this year was imminent. \nRoughly 800,000 federal employees were out of work without pay and the paychecks of more than one million others were delayed. Congress voted to give furloughed employees retroactive pay on day five of the government shutdown, but that did little to help their current financial state. Some members of Congress continued to cash their paychecks during this period, while others opted to give theirs up. \nNonessential departments and employees were furloughed, including those working at national parks, the National Zoo and NASA. If the shutdown would’ve continued through late October, millions of veterans and their families wouldn’t have received their benefits. By the time the government shutdown came to an end, it had cost the country $24 billion or $1.5 billion per day.
