Jesse Marlow A central 7-Eleven database obtained by Fairfax Media, which records thousands of interviews between store owners and head office regarding payroll compliance, shows the franchisee in question was suspected of underpaying staff.\n\"Anomalies have been found regarding number of hours and pay rates NOT MATCHING roster and time sheets for most employees,\" the review reads.\n\"[Franchisee] explained that he calculates how much each staff member should be paid per shift considering the different pay rates, and divides the total amount by the ordinary hourly rate to find the total number of hours!\"\n7-Eleven has been working to soothe franchisees in recent weeks as scores of store owners rushed to sell their franchises. The number of stores on the market now stands at 78 compared with fewer than 50 before the scandal broke.\nFairfax Media has obtained a copy of a letter sent by 7-Eleven to franchisees this week inviting store owners to a franchisee business update next month. The meetings will take place in Melbourne on October 7, and then in Rosehill in Sydney on October 8 and Brisbane on October 9.\n\"At this [meeting], Russ will open the meeting to announce changes that will be made to the commercial model, impacting both the agreement and the current profit share structure,\" the letter to franchisees reads.\nIn recent weeks franchisees have joined forces at town hall-style meetings in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to draw up a demand list for head office. Sources, who declined to be named for fear of losing their business, have told Fairfax Media that changing the profit share between head office and franchisees is at the top of the list.\nCurrently franchisees receive 43 per cent of gross profits excluding fuel sales, while 57 per cent of gross profit flows to head office. The franchisee sources say a 45/55 split would be fairer, along with other concessions.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:40:04.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
