Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Retail sales fell in July for the first time in 14 months, a sign the sharemarket turmoil might have made households more uncertain, and marking a weak start for the economy to the third quarter.\nSales dropped 0.1 per cent from June, when they rose 0.6 per cent, missing economist forecast for a 0.4 increase, the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed on Thursday.\nHousehold goods retailing led the decline with an outsized 1.9 per cent fall, after a sizeable 2.4 per cent increase the month before.\nThe rapid deterioration suggests consumers might have brought forward spending because of the government's $20,000 instant asset tax write off for small businesses.\nIn the May budget Prime Minister Tony Abbott coined the term \"Tony's tradies\" to describe the big winners, handing small businesses the ability to claim an unlimited number of tax deductions for buying cars and machinery valued at less than $20,000 each.\nIn July, however, electrical and electronic goods retailing fell by 3.3 per cent and hardware, building and garden supplies retailing dropped by 1.4 per cent.\nA separate ABS report showed Australia's trade deficit narrowed in July to $2.5 billion from 3.1 billion in June helped by a 2 per cent rise in exports.\nThe dollar fell after the news, down to US70.10¢ from around US70.40¢ just before the release.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-03T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:09:41.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
