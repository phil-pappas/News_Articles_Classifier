It is expected to grow to $5bn in annual premiums by 2018. \"Cyber Insurance remains a looming risk with steep under penetration in India,\" said Anuraag Sunder director PwC. \"As ITES, retail, healthcare and related sectors grow cyber insurance for suitable customer data protection become crucial.\" In 2010-11 India was the 10th most heavily cyber-attacked country in the world while in financial year 2014-15 it was second only to United States. General insurers provide coverage for cyber. Anecdotal data suggests that the number of cyber policies sold would be around 150, the report said. \"Insurers also need to continue to invest appropriately in their own cyber security - a business which can't protect itself can't expect policyholders to trust them to protect and advise them,\" Paul Delbridge, insurance partner at PwC. \"Given the huge volume of medical, financial and other sensitive information they hold, it is critical that insurers have closely monitored, highly effective cyber security frameworks in place.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:51:51.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
