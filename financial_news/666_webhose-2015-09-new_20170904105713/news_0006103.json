Share on twitter by David Ramli Singtel-Optus is increasing its data allowances on two high-end plans in readiness for the likely launch of Apple's iPhone 6s on September 9 in a move that analysts say will crank up pressure on Telstra to boost its offers.\nFrom Wednesday Optus will give customers who are on $100 a month contracts a 12-gigabyte download allowance and 400 minutes of overseas calls. Users spending $135 a month will also have their data caps raised to 20GB â€“ matching a similar offer to Vodafone Hutchison Australia's .\nThe move is likely to put more pressure on Telstra to launch plans with more generous data allowances in time for Apple's latest smartphone release in an effort to win over customers.\nApple's annual iPhone launches are popular enough to be a lightning rod for new customers and those signing new contracts. By comparison, Telstra mobile customers get 6GB of data for $95 a month and 10GB for $135 a month.\nOptus has been fighting to win over Telstra's lucrative mobile customers in an effort to boost profits and revenue. Its mobile marketing vice-president Ben White said its latest plans would be available until the end of December, which covers the crucial Christmas shopping period.\n\"There are lots of big exciting launches of new handsets across the year but this is obviously one of the bigger ones that we would spend a lot of time getting ready for,\" he said. \"I wouldn't necessarily say the changes we're announcing are specifically geared to this ... potential device launch.\n\"But we do see growing trends of data usage across our customers ... and the desire for more and more data in plans.\"\nThough Optus has mainly been targeting Telstra, Optus chief executive Allen Lew has specifically pointed to Vodafone Australia's new plans and products as being particularly competitive. But Mr White said his network was better, especially in regional areas.\n \"We think there are some big points of difference between us and Vodafone and frankly Telstra as well,\" he said. \"Now we have a national 4G network versus the 4G coverage for Vodafone, which obviously is a little more limited at this stage.\"\nVodafone Australia recently won funding from the federal government's regional black spot project to build 70 extra mobile towers for areas with little to no coverage.\nMr White also said there was no way to tell how much extra customers would have to pay to buy Apple's new iPhones without seeing an official release and price list. Mobile carriers typically charge an extra fee on top of monthly plans to help pay for new devices.\nMore perks Another factor that could force Australians to pay more for their smartphones is the fact that the Aussie dollar has fallen by more than 25 per cent in the past 12 months against the US dollar, which has hurt their buying power.\nCredit Suisse analyst Fraser McLeish said the Optus move to give more value was part of a trend by mobile providers to give customers more allowances and perks as part of their plans.\n\"It's a direct function of the increased competitive intensity in the mobile space,\" he said. \"We've seen a lot of promotions on handset prices but plan prices have been stable.\n\"We don't expect [Apple's new device] to be a huge driver in terms of additional handset sales.\"\nBut he said customers were showing a willingness to pay more in exchange for better data allowances, which in turn was helping lift telco revenues.\n\"The competitive intensity has stepped up and that's why we've seen Telstra react in the way it has and we expect [it] to remain intense going forward,\" Mr McLeish said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-government-announces-385m-to-build-499-mobile-base-stations-20150625-ghx8b2.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-08T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:08:59.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
