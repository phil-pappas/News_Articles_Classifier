So instead of simply hitting firms with the big stick of ever-higher carbon taxes and levies, we should be offering them the carrot of tax breaks to invest in advanced low carbon technologies.” \nGeorge Osborne , the Chancellor, has announced a review of the green tax landscape designed to simplify and streamline the regime. \nThe EEF, which represents more than 20,000 companies, is calling on the Government to reduce the overall burden of energy taxation by the end of this parliament. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also wants policymakers to scrap the carbon floor price , which doubled to £18.08 per tonne of CO2 this year. \nThe top-up carbon tax was intended to provide an incentive to invest in new wind farms and nuclear plants by making it more expensive to run coal and gas plants that emit carbon. The EEF estimated the levy would cost consumers £23bn between 2013 and 2020. However, it said just £6.5bn of this would feed through to investment in renewables. \nThe EEF also called on the Government to scrap the “overly-complex” Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) , an energy efficiency scheme that it said would cost businesses £900m this year alone but translate into just £334m of investment over the next decade. \nIt wants policymakers to introduce a new tax break that would allow companies to offset their climate change levy bill against investment in enegy efficiiency improvements. While the EEF estimated this could cost £1.5bn between 2016 and 2020, it claimed that a new incentive scheme could deliver ten times as much new green investment. \n“Government should use the energy taxation review as an opportunity to step back, and make some bold decisions that we believe can reduce energy costs as well as cutting back on carbon emissions, and improving the environment,” said Mr Raynes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T08:08:59.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
