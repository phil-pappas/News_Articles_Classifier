Those refugees will presumably come mostly from refugee havens on Syria's border – in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.\nActing with head and heart \"It's important that we act with our heads as well as with our hearts,\" Abbott said when responding to a question about why he had appeared to baulk initially at taking additional numbers.\n\"The responsibility of prime ministers, in particular, is to act in a measured and considered way, and I didn't want to rush into something before receiving advice.\"\nOfficials are recalling the resettlement globally of something like 500,000 Vietnamese boat people who had fled the communists in the years after the fall of Saigon in 1975.\nUnder the Fraser and Hawke governments, Australia took about 80,000 Vietnamese refugees in the 10 years after the war, many of them boat people.\nThe Syrian crisis in which some 11.5 million Syrians have been displaced, including more than 4 million outside the country represents an almost unimaginable challenge to refugee agencies and host governments.\nNo one is pretending that Australia's response will amount to much more than a \"drop in the bucket\", as one official put it, but it has proved a significantly larger drop than seemed in prospect at the weekend, judging by Abbott's initial response.\nA senior Cabinet minister told AFR Weekend the challenge for his colleagues was to persuade the Prime Minister that the greatest refugee crisis since World War II could not in any way be compared with the asylum seeker \"boat people\" issue.\nAbbott's advisers were telling him the same thing.\n\"We all get it,\" said one.\nIn such ways the barnacles encrusting a \"stop the boats\" mindset were scraped away.\nIn the end Abbott yielded to his better angels.\nBut not before he gave encouragement to the belief his political instincts leave much to be desired just a week out from the critical Canning by-election in Western Australia to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of Don Randall.\nAbbott appears to have gained some kudos in the eastern states from his refugee announcement, but whether this resonates in Canning is another matter.\nWhile there have been discordant voices in conservative ranks, the broad consensus within the Liberal and National parties is that Australia needed to be seen conspicuously to be doing its bit.\nIssue beyond politics \"This is an issue that goes beyond politics,\" Dan Tehan, member for Malcolm Fraser's old seat of Wannon, told the AFR Weekend.\nColleagues have expressed irritation with South Australian senator Cory Bernardi and with Liberal leader in the Senate, Eric Abetz over what are regarded as their insensitive remarks.\nBernardi's assertion that the drowned Syrian toddler, Aylan Kurdi, was not a legitimate refugee since he had been residing in Turkey after fleeing Syria several years ago occasioned outrage.\nAbetz's call for priority to be given to minorities, notably Christians was rebuffed by fellow Liberals. Baird, who is emerging as something of a conscience figure in the Liberal Party, said there should be no discrimination between persecuted Muslims or Christian.\nTalal Yassine, a business and Muslim community leader, who came to Australia as a 4-year old in 1977, from civil war-torn Lebanon, welcomes the government's refugee announcement, but he would like to see numbers doubled.\n\"It's not sufficient,\" Yassine said. \"It does not accord with Australia's grand traditions as a migrant country.\"\nGovernment officials may not concede the point, but almost certainly feeding into the decision to make a relatively generous downpayment on the refugee intake is sensitivity to criticism over Australia's refugee policies.\n'Inhumane policies' Last week's New York Times editorial savaging Abbott's stop the boats policies did not go overlooked in Canberra.\n\"His policies have been inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war,\" the Times said.\nOfficials decried the editorial, but there is no doubt on issues like refugees and climate change the Abbott government finds itself outside the Western mainstream, and has suffered reputational damage as a consequence.\nAmong other factors weighing in the government's political calculations will no doubt have been Labor's demand that Australia take 10,000 Syrian refugees. Abbott has trumped that figure, burnishing his tattered humanitarian credentials in the process.\nBut as the world surveys what is arguably its greatest challenge since the end of World War II when tens of millions of people were displaced, it is hard to predict where all this will end, and indeed, how a refugee tap might be turned off given the continued destabilisation of the Middle East, parts of Africa and South Asia.\nThese are the stark figures: Lebanon has 1.1 million registered refugees from Syria, but Lebanese officials put the overall number higher at 1.5 million.\nLebanon's population is 4.5 million. Therefore one in four people in the country are refugees on top of 500,000 Palestinians in refugee camps.\nJordan has 630,000 refugees registered by the UNHCR, but estimates put the number as high as 1.4 million, or about one in five of the population. This is a huge burden on tiny Jordan.\nTurkey is the other main refugee recipient. Something like 1.9 million Syrians have crossed the Syrian-Turkish border.\nIf the Syrian crisis was the only such crisis, it might be manageable – just. But it is far from the only cause of continuing instability and desperation among people worldwide seeking a better and more secure life away from war.\nYemen, for example, has turned into a humanitarian disaster. An estimated 1.5 million Yemenis have been forced from their homes by a protracted civil war. Almost half the country's population of 25 million is in need of food aid.\nFractured in two Further afield, instability in Libya where the country has effectively fractured in two is driving people to seek refugee elsewhere. Then there is the continuing outflow from war-torn Iraq and Afghanistan, bulging refugee camps in Pakistan and a refugee exodus from places like Eritrea.\nThe UNHCR estimates that the world is awash with as many as 60 million refugees.\nIn light of all of this there seems little doubt that 2015 will be known as the year of refugee.\nThe bad news is that conditions in places like Syria are set to deteriorate further unless the international community steps in to bring about a political settlement of a civil war that pits the ruling Bashar al-Assad regime against multiple jihadist groups, including Islamic state.\nThis is an extraordinarily complex conflict that may be beyond any form of resolution in which case Syria will be condemned to years more of civil conflict, and a continued refugee exodus.\nLikewise, neighbouring Iraq continues to teeter on the brink of an unravelling that would see large numbers of Iraqis seeking refuge elsewhere.\nAustralia's decision to extend its aerial bombing campaign into eastern Syria to attack Islamic State targets may well add to internal dislocation as civilian populations seek to avoid becoming \"human shields\".\nThe Syrian regime's ruthless use of barrel bombs that inflict horrendous civilian casualties in urban areas shows no sign of slackening, nor is there any indication that IS is being pushed back from its strongholds in eastern Syrian.\nAll this is a recipe for a continuing flood of refugees that will demand more than a piecemeal response.\nPhilip Orchard, senior lecturer in Peace and Conflict studies at Queensland University, advocates a comprehensive global program, including increased humanitarian assistance to the countries around Syria; safe processing centres in Turkey and in either Libya or Tunisia to process asylum claims; and a global resettlement program and provision for safe return for those denied claims.\nOne suggestion with merit is to create safe havens that would enable Syrians to remain within their country.\nWhat is clearly required is a much better co-ordinated global response, and in this a newly sensitised Australian government might play a more proactive role.\nTony Walker is the AFR's international editor and a former Middle East correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@tonywalker1"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:10:14.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
