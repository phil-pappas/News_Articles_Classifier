Getty Images by Max Mason Dominic White A legal pledge by Network Ten Holdings and Foxtel may be the price the two have to pay to get the competition watchdog over the line on their proposed tie-up, experts say.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last week outlined concerns around sports broadcast rights and Ten gaining an unfair advantage over its rivals Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media as a result of the pay television provider buying up to 15 per cent of the free-to-air network.\nIt also spelled out concerns about Ten's advertising sales being run by the Foxtel-Fox Sports joint venture Multi-Channel Network – with the metropolitan broadcaster taking a 24.99 per cent stake in the business.\nThe ACCC could still approve the deal without conditions, or it could oppose it.\nSome competition experts believe the ACCC is inviting Ten and Foxtel to come up with a solution rather than signalling it will block the deal.\n\"One solution is a court enforceable undertaking. Foxtel could undertake to ensure that no network is disadvantaged by its acquisition of sports rights,\" one competition expert told Fairfax Media.\n\"Essentially it could undertake that the number of games shown remains the same and the amount paid is the same fraction of the total payment for the rights.\"\nAnother sensitive point is advertising sales, Ten, the home of The Bachelor and The Project , could undertake to not appoint MCN its sole agent, added the source. That would not prevent MCN from providing significant input for the network's ad sales.\n The Australian Communications and Media Authority is also assessing whether the deal would breach current media control legislation, particularly the two-out-of-three rule, which stops any one person controlling more than two of a newspaper, commercial TV licence or radio licence in a major market.\n\"On the ownership and control side of the broadcasting services act, Illyria could undertake to the ACMA to divest its DMG radio interests,\" the competition expert said.\nllyria is Lachlan Murdoch's investment vehicle, which owns 100 per cent of Nova Entertainment (formerly called DMG). As co-chairman of Foxtel's co-owner News Corp Mr Murdoch is currently deemed to be both a controller of a radio licence and a newspaper.\nIf the ACMA deemed his stake to be linked to Foxtel's, he could also be viewed as a controller of Ten, although the ACMA's findings are not yet known.\n﻿ Another option could be for Lachlan Murdoch to sell his personal 8.5 per cent stake in Ten, which is also held by Illyria, experts added.\nIndustry sources have observed that this deal involves a minority stake in a public company and is a much different situation than a full acquisition of a competitor.\nSpokespeople for Illyria and Foxtel declined to comment. Ten referred back a statement made on September 14: \"Ten firmly considers that the objective evidence establishes that the proposed transactions will increase competition in the relevant markets.\"\nNorton Rose Fulbright partner Martyn Taylor said that Foxtel and Ten can give an 87B undertaking, which is essentially a voluntary undertaking which can be enforced by the ACCC in court if it is breached.\n\"[In] the Austar-Foxtel merger there were quite detailed undertakings given to the ACCC at that stage which involved a combination of behavioural undertakings, including access rights given the third parties to particular Foxtel channels,\" Mr Taylor said.\nLeading media buyers back the tie-up, saying it will improve competition in ad sales. The agencies have an interest in the MCN deal because MCN leads the way in programmatic advertising sales, which make it much more efficient for buyers of media to target specific audiences. They hope that Ten's rivals Nine and Seven would automate more of their systems to better compete with a combined MCN/Ten ad sales unit.\nMeanwhile, corporate competition law partner at McCullough Robertson John Kettle said the competition regulator should take a bespoke approach to sports rights as deals are struck with the various codes.\n\"If you have an issue about sporting rights, the way you deal with it is to regulate the auctions of the sporting rights themselves. So regulate the supply side, not the demand,\" Mr Kettle said.\n\"What you do is you identify that the sport federations have market power in relation to the supply of those rights, so what you do is regulate the packages.\"\nMr Kettle said an alignment of interests between Foxtel, Lachlan Murdoch any of the other major stakeholders in Ten, such as James Packer and Gina Rinehart is difficult to prove.\n\"There are shifting coalitions, or voting blocks, in Ten, which aren't mandated to vote in a certain way to favour Foxtel. So there's an inability to say that the transactions with which they're concerned will result in a permanent change in strategic approach or direction. [The ACCC are] not going to be able to show that.\"\nHe added: \"It's a minority interest by Foxtel, which gives them some leverage into the free-to-air market. But, Foxtel's own behaviour has shown that it's not beholden to it. Because Foxtel is going to do a deal with NRL, where the free-to-air component is already out to Channel Nine. Foxtel has done a deal for AFL with Channel Seven.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/accc-concerned-by-sports-rights-and-advertising-in-foxtelten-deal-20150914-gjm00t.html"], "published": "2015-09-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:05:59.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
