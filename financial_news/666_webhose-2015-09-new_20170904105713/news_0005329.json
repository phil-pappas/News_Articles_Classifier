The amount loaned to first-time buyers slid by 5pc on the year to £10.8bn. \nInstead, lending to buy-to-let investors increased by 18.6pc to £8.3bn, while remortgaging levels also increased by 10.5pc to £13.7bn, as homeowners rush to take advantage of cheap loans before interest rates go up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T06:55:28.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
