Steven Siewert Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Hatch Woolworths needs to spend an extra $200 million a year revamping its weary supermarkets if it wants revive its fortunes, one retail analyst says.\nWoolworths on Monday revealed it will spend $65 million over the next year fixing trolleys, patching holes in shop floors, and improving lighting and signs.\nThe supermarket will boost man hours by the equivalent of three extra full-time staff in each of its 950 stores in an effort to improving on-shelf availability, especially in fruit and vegetables and at checkouts.\nThe investment mirrors moves Coles made seven years ago that kick-started a massive turnaround, but Citi retail analyst Craig Woolford said it was not enough.\nWoolworths will spend $65 million over the next year improving customer service, but one analyst says it's not nearly enough. Steven Siewert \"Our view is they need to invest in more hours to really make a difference given the amount of staffing they've cut … substantially more,\" he said.\n\"They need to even just get the basics right around trolleys, signage and fixturing that consumers would expect at any supermarket in the modern age.\n\"They are fundamentals of retail.\"\nMr Woolford said Woolworths was spending about 2 per cent of sales in improving stores and needed to boost this to 2.5 per cent – an extra $200m to $250 million – if it wanted to help sales growth.\n \"These are investments the company needs to makes, rather than nice to do. Woolies store refurbishments have been tracking at an unsustainably low level over the past few years,\" he said.\nMr Woolford said the effectiveness of the refurbishments would depend on how quickly they were implemented and how committed the company was to them.\nPeter Harvey, CEO of architecture and retail layout firm Supermarket Design Australia, said customers expected a better shopping environment and would abandon stores that failed to deliver it.\n\"If you make the customer feel comfortable, not threatened, and you make the flow easy, that encourages people to spend… and I think the majors are trying to do that,\" he said.\n\"If you've got untidy, dirty, dank, dark stores were the fresh products are not displayed correctly, then you're going to lose customers to your competitors.\"\nMr Harvey said trends in supermarket layout and design were coming from Europe, and included lowering shelves from the Australian standard of 2.1 metres to 1.8 metres or lower so aisles did not feel like corridors.\n\"We're [also] trying to get as much of an interface between the arcade and the street front as possible to entice the customer in,\" he said.\nMr Harvey said that one independent IGA store in Melbourne he refitted as part of Metcash's Project Diamond refurbishment plan saw liquor sales double and general, deli and fresh food sales jump by more than 50 per cent.\n\"We believe, and the majors are coming over with this, that [design and layout] does affect the bottom line,\" he said.\nWhen Roy Morgan Research asked almost 2900 grocery buyers this year what factors were important when choosing a supermarket, 65 per cent said they wanted a supermarket that was clean and tidy.\nThat was more than the 57 per cent who wanted low prices. Half of those surveyed wanted a store that was well laid out and 52 per cent wanted clean and functional trolleys.\nMr Woolford said that after trying to compete on price, Australia's supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths needed to return their focus to customer service and comfort to compete with discount competitors.\n\"If they focus purely on price, and trying to deal with that the threat Aldi creates, then they'll become very one dimensional and shoppers looking for fresh produce, looking for branded items, looking for a better service experience will be disappointed,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/105822336186422025680", "https://twitter.com/pwhatch"], "published": "2015-09-22T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:39:59.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
