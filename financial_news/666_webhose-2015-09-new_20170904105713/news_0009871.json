We believe we have achieved that,\" he said. \nAlstom CEO Patrick Kron said that in addition to fulfilling the EU's wish to maintain competition, GE's commitments \"protect the interests of Alstom employees, shareholders and customers.\" \nGE also won regulatory clearance in the United States, but that was expected. \n\"We have had a very close and successful cooperation with the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice both as regards the investigation and the analysis of suitable remedies,\" Vestager told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. \nThe deal was first proposed a year ago but in a sign of the jitters it triggered in Brussels, the Commission twice delayed making a decision on whether to wave the buyout through. \nThe EU concerns centred primarily on possible distortions in the market for maintaining high-power gas turbines, used mainly in electricity generating plants. \nThis lucrative market is dominated by GE with a 50 percent stake, followed by Siemens of Germany, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Alstom and Ansaldo Energia of Italy. \nAfter initially putting up resistance, GE ultimately agreed to shed some maintenance service assets and patents to Ansaldo Energia. \nTurbine maintenance is a money maker for GE and at the heart of the potential $3 billion in synergies it hopes to make in the deal with Alstom. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has forecast that after the deal its profits will double from 2016 to 2018. \nGE has also promised the French government it will create a thousand jobs, among other commitments. \nThe US giant had insisted it would not make concessions that would render the deal less attractive, but in the end it has seemingly given in, although not without winning a slightly lowered the selling price from Alstom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:23:35.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
