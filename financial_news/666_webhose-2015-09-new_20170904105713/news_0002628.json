The German airlines division will cease to have its own board. \n\"We want to create the best possible conditions for growth for Eurowings,\" Spohr said. \nAlthough the duties have been reassigned, the group's five-member management board remains the same, with CEO Spohr in place, Simone Menne maintaining her finance role and Bettina Volkens heading personnel. \nThe contracts of Hohmeister and Volkens were also extended for five years, Lufthansa said. \nThe group's cargo, maintenance and catering divisions will continue to be managed separately, it said in a statement. \nLufthansa and Vereinigung Cockpit are due to resume talks on Thursday over pilots' early retirement benefits.
