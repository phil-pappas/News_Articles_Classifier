Aussie shoppers are forking out about $US113 ($A163.50) less than Californians to buy the tablet devices.\nPrices for the iPhone 6 Plus are also the fifth cheapest, based on a survey of Apple products on sale in more than 50 countries. \nCommSec's chief economist Craig James attributes the recent plunge by the Australian dollar for helping to keep a lid on prices of some of the most sought-after tech devices on the market. \n\"Last year the Aussie dollar was 86.6 US cents; today it is closer to US69.1 cents,\" he said. \n\"As a result, the cost of an iPad Air 2 has fallen in US dollar terms from $US536.30 to $US427.66.\" \nThe most expensive country to buy the same iPad was Argentina ($US1,500) while Malaysia was the cheapest ($US398.26). While the Aussie dollar has been tumbling, prices for the devices haven't surged in Australia.\nCommSec found that the local price for the iPad Air 2 16GB wi-fi model was $619, unchanged from last November. \nUsually when the Aussie dollar falls, the price of imported goods rises. \nHowever Mr James suggested that local retailers were having to contend with the same dilemma as Apple faces when currencies change - should they adjust local prices on their products or not? \n\"There is a range of influences that play a part in the decision, including a judgment about whether the currency change is likely to be permanent or temporary,\" Mr James said. \n\"The latest rumours suggest that local pricing of the new iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6S models won't change from the current models. \n\"If that is the case then Australian consumers would have little to complain about.\" \nApple is reportedly preparing to unveil its latest iPhone this week. \nCommSec's findings are based on its iPod index, which was launched in 2007 as a way of assessing how the same item was sold across the globe once taking into account exchange rates. \nARGENTINA MOST EXPENSIVE FOR IPADS WHILE AUST AMONG THE CHEAPEST \nMost expensive places to buy an iPad Air 2 \n1.
