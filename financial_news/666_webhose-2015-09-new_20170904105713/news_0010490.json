Joe Armao Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Which are worse: the Nazis who tried to wipe out the jews using concentration camps; or Islamic State, which uses public beheadings as a marketing tool?\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has an answer, and it has got in him trouble: Islamic State, which he insists on calling Daesh, for its Arabic acronym.\nMr Abbott, who has taken Australia into the war against Islamic State, said the Islamic organisation's pride in brutality made it worse than Hitler's Germany.\n\"The Nazis did terrible evil but they had sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it. These people boast about their evil. This is the extraordinary thing,\" he told Sydney radio host Alan Jones.\nWhen asked later if he should have been more careful about comparisons, Mr Abbott said he stood his ground although was \"not in the business of ranking evil\".\nExecutive Council of Australian Jewry president Robert Goot said the comments were \"injudicious and unfortunate\" .\nMr Abbott has a habit of invoking Nazi Germany. A year ago, on the same show, he explained that the Nazis' attempt to hide their concentration camps made them less bad than Islamic State.\n\"The atrocities that were committed by the Nazis, by the communists and others, they were ashamed of them, they tried to cover them up,\" he said. \"This mob, by contrast...they're advertising it on the internet for all to see.\"\n Nazi references nothing new\nIn March he called Opposition Leader Bill Shorten the \" Dr Goebbels of economic policy \". A month earlier he said there was a \"a holocaust of jobs in defence industries\" under Labor, in comments he was forced to withdraw in Parliament.\nThe Prime Minister has said Australia's approach to abortion and euthanasia was reminiscent of Nazism.\n\"There is a vast moral gulf which separates modern Australia from Nazi Germany. But can we be so sure that, under pressure over time, we will not slide down the same slippery slope. We only have to look at the abortion situation in this country,\" he told Parliament in 1995.\nThe comments directly contradict those of his potential leadership rival, Malcolm Turnbull, who has warned against overstating the threat from Islamic State.\n\"Now, just as it's important not to underestimate or be complacent about the national security threat from Daesh, it is equally important not to overestimate that threat.\n\"Daesh is not Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Stalin's Russia,\" he said.\nIn line with previous protests from federal Labor Jewish MPs , Victorian Labor MP Philip Dalidakis said it led him to doubt Mr Abbott's solidarity with the Jewish community .\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten distanced himself from the Prime Minister's remarks. \"I don't think I would equate it with World War II,\" he said.\nNazi Germany saw six million Jewish people murdered in systematic, state-sponsored persecution, while hundreds of thousands have died as radical Islamist militant group IS seized large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq.\nAustralian politicians of all stripes, however, have a tendency to bump into headline-making tyrant references.\nI n 2011 Labor MP Mark Dreyfus described Mr Abbott's campaign against the carbon tax as Goebbellian - just days after former Liberal MP, Sophie Mirabella, compared former Prime Minister Julia Gillard to Colonel Gaddafi .\nMr Abbott said the government is likely to decide whether to extend bombing of Islamic State into Syria next week.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/OP7BMO5xJJt/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/SPIEGELONLINE/status/578863579866132481", "http://www.smh.com.au/national/comparing-gillard-to-gaddafi-colourful-says-abbott-20110301-1bduf.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/tony-abbott-tries-his-colleagues-patience-with-yet-another-mistake-20150319-1m37gy.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/jewish-backlash-after-tony-abbott-says-islamic-state-terrorists-are-worse-than-the-nazis-20150903-gje2el.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nc&eid=socialn%3Atwi-13omn1677-edtrl-other%3Annn-17%2F02%2F2014-edtrs_socialshare-all-nnn-nnn-vars-o%26sa%3DD%26usg%3DALhdy28zsr6qiq", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-11/abbotts-tax-strategy-likened-to-nazi-propaganda/2661892", "https://twitter.com/philipdalidakis/status/639268546048978944", "https://vine.co/v/OV9jxuaKOWg/embed/simple"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:42:15.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
