The Galaxy Note 5 is the fifth iteration in the popular Galaxy Note series and was announced along with Galaxy S6 edge+ in New York last month.\nThe Galaxy Note 5 goes on sale in India on September 20 and will join Samsung’s other premium devices in India, the Galaxy S6, S6 edge and the newly launched S6 edge+.\nWith the new Note 5, Samsung has stuck to its premium pricing for flagship devices. Asim Warsi , Samsung India vice-president for marketing IT & mobile, reasons that Samsung sees its Note series as one of a kind in the market.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 5 goes on sale in India on September 20 and will join Samsung’s other premium devices in India, the Galaxy S6, S6 edge and the newly launched S6 edge+.\n“The Note portfolio, when we conceived it, was the first in that display size, first in productivity. On one part the market and other brands have picked up the big screen, but on the other hand with the S-Pen, we offer productivity and creativity capabilities to the consumers. So far, we’ve been alone in this segment and happily so. Apart from the Note portfolio there is no other device that comes close in aiding that productivity experience for consumers,” said Warsi. “Each consumer is looking at slightly different motivations of life through their devices. That segment is steadily growing and it’s not about the being cheapest price smartphone. It’s really about the kind of innovation or technology firsts kind of innovation that we are able to offer that helps us stand out,” he added. The Note features a 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 518ppi. The phone is powered by an octa-core Exynos 7420 processor with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM.\nSamsung revealed that the Galaxy Note 5 has features which were designed and implemented by the R&D team in India. Functions like Live Video Broadcast, Video Collage and Video Highlight were created by the India team.\nSamsung’s Galaxy Note series devices have been known for their large removable battery and expandable storage options, but Galaxy Note 5 drops the microSD card slot and is backed by a non-removable 3,000 mAh battery.\nThe Galaxy Note 5 supports wireless charging and quick charging technology. The 3000 mAh battery has been seen as disappointing since the Note series is known for its long battery life.\nWarsi, however, said that battery should not be a concern with the Note 5. “ Battery is about performance and not just the mAh number. We’ve amped our battery performance with the ultra-power saving mode, there’s also quick charging, wireless charging as well which helps with a better experience,” he said. The smartphone features a fingerprint scanner and will be available in Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titan colour variants from September 20.\n 12:24 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:05:15.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
