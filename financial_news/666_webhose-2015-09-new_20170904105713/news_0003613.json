It is for this reason that he is unable to see the ground realities across this wall made of arrogance of power”, Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said in a statement.\nSurjewala regretted that the Prime Minister is unable to see the rapid downslide in industry and trade as also abject misery suffered by farmers.\n“All-round distress cannot be seen across the castles built in thin air of rhetoric and self promotion by our Prime Minister”, he said.\nTaking a jibe at the social-media savvy Prime Minister, he said Modi is trying to make-believe that merely by typing the words ‘foodgrains’ in Google , foodgrain stocks of 265 million tons will be posted on Instagram.\n“Another Modi-make-believe is of posting photographs of lush crops on Facebook translating into cheap foodgrains for 130 crore Indians,” he added.\n“By hiding the scams of his own government like Modigate, Vyapam, PDS Scam, Bank Scam, Mining Scam, Chikki Scam, Tender Scam running into thousands of crores; Prime Minister cannot define honesty, transparency and accountability”, he said dismissing claims that there was no corruption in the NDA government.\nHe said the country has never witnessed a leader so in love with himself that he is “blind” to the national interest in his “insatiable quest to project himself as the benefactor of all good things.”\n 29, 2015 8:42 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:26:33.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
