Will Russell by Matthew Stevens Rio Tinto has reaffirmed a long-standing outlook for the volume and timing of peak steel in China and predicted that an iron ore market drifting into oversupply will soon need to find new production to meet emerging-market demand.\nAfter investing \"millions\" in a \"bottom-up interrogation\" of Rio Tinto's comparatively bullish expectation for peak demand in China, iron ore boss Andrew Harding now takes intimately detailed comfort in the investment case that inspired his $US15 billion growth story.\nHarding is Rio's iron ore boss and he is putting the finishing touches to a long-planned expansion that will make the Anglo-Australian's package of Pilbara infrastructure the world's biggest supplier into the global seaborne market.\nLike most in the iron ore game, Rio's base case has long been that Chinese steel production would top out at better than 1 billion tonnes annually at some point between 2025 and 2030, give or take a year or two.\nBut industry solidarity around this narrative was shattered last week by BHP Billiton . The Global Australian has trimmed its outlook and it now reckons China's steel output will peak at somewhere around 2025.\nInterestingly, the BHP view is that this is not all bad for underlying iron ore demand. Boss Andrew Mackenzie foreshadowed that raw steel output would sit at this lower plateau for much longer than BHP had previously anticipated because steel would be recycled more prudently than originally assessed.\nSo, rather perversely perhaps, the Mackenzie line is that this slightly weaker outlook translates into greater confidence in the stronger-for-longer view of iron ore demand.\nThe issue of China and peak iron ore and energy demand has been the subject of considerable debate for 18 months or so with economic eminences as grand as China savvy Professor Ross Garnaut warning that the miners were not properly reading the runes of Chinese demand, that peak-consumption had already passed for iron ore and coal, and that the only way from here is down.\n But, for all that gloom, Harding insists that Rio's million-dollar interrogation has more than sustained its original investment case and more cogently defined the detail that supports it.\nAnd if Rio is right, then a whole lot of people have got it wrong. Rio's reaffirmed outlook, for example, patently challenges the new China steel paradigm recently promoted by BlueScope boss Paul O'Malley, who is convinced that the Middle Kingdom's domestic demand has already peaked and is now in structural retreat. The way O'Malley sees his world, China is going to be exporting ever more tonnes of steel over the coming decades, leaving regional steel markets highly liquid and pricing structurally modest. As a result, BlueScope is contemplating becoming a processor of imported steel rather than a local steel maker.\nBut, at the most basic level, Rio's analysis implies that O'Malley has got the long-term trend wrong. Rio's confidence in the 1 billion tonnes outlook is based on historic trends in global markets, on more local and regional demand indicators, and on existing plans for steel industry transition from structural to consumer steel production.\nRio expects that China's net exports of basic steel will sit relatively steady over the next decade and beyond. But, over that same period, China's exports of valued-added finished steel goods will more than double.\n\"What we find,\" Harding said on Thursday, \"is that the most common difference between us and everyone else is that we assume that China will move up the value chain.\"\nAs O'Malley can tell you, just rolling, coating and painting steel takes a lot of energy. Turning it into ever more modern and competitive cars, trucks, washing machines and other more technically complicated machinery will take a whole lot more energy. If Rio has steel right, then exporters of the raw materials of electricity (coal and gas) have reason for renewed Chinese optimism.\nPrecedents for transformation The precedents for the transformation of China's steel are identified by Rio include the US, Germany, Japan and Korea. In each of those economies, a massive investment in steel capacity proved to be the cornerstone of a manufacturing base directed first at sating domestic demand and then pointed at global markets. That China will make a similar transformation remains accepted wisdom across the iron ore and steel sectors. Where there is increasing diversity of view is on the timing and quantum of the change ahead.\nBut, arguably, the biggest call made in Rio's latest iron ore outlook is that demand from the emerging markets of Asia will require significant levels of new supply over the decade ahead.\nBut before the need for gains, there will be pain. Rio says 110 million tonnes of low-cost production will enter the seaborne market this year. As a result, a balancing 120mt of existing supply will be squeezed out of the system by year's end by iron ore helter-skelter down the cost curve.\nSome 45mt of that will come out of China's domestic supply base, which will close the year at 280mt. The rest of the pain will be spread across iron ore's globe, with marginal operators in West Africa, Iran, Brazil and Australia losing their places in the market.\nImportantly, Rio reckons that a further 45mt remains at risk in a market looking to balance supply against slowing demand growth rates. But between 2016 and 2030 Rio anticipates global iron ore demand will rise by around 800mt to 3 billion tonnes annually by 2030 and that half this increase will be sated by growth of seaborne trade. As one analyst quietly sceptical of this outlook observed, to simply maintain market share at that level of demand, Rio would need to expand capacity to 480mtpa.\nWhether that is possible, only Rio could tell you. What is certain, though, is that the winners in any future race to generate new tonnes will be those sitting at the lowest point of the cost curve. And no miner sits lower on that curve than Rio, which is producing at $US15.10 a tonne and which has every intention of sustaining its cost leadership over BHP, Vale and Fortescue.\nThat is why we should expect Rio to continue to creep, as cost-efficiently as possible, well past the 350mt nameplate capacity that Harding will have under his charge by 2017. It is why we should expect BHP to de-bottleneck its way beyond its 290mtpa target and why Fortescue will make its way to the180mt capacity of its railway at some point over the next few years.\nThe Aurizon precedent\nThe window of IR opportunity opened by the Fair Work Commission's unexpected decision to allow rail operator Aurizon to terminate a set of enterprise agreements that had been in unproductive negotiation and dispute for two years remains firmly ajar. after an equally welcome Federal Court decision.\nOn Thursday, a full bench of the Federal Court dismissed the main rail union's appeal against an April ruling by FWC vice president Graeme Watson that resulted in termination of 12 agreements that bound Aurizon's employment of 5000 Queensland workers.\nThe effect of the termination was that those workers were temporarily covered by federal awards rather than a set of cushy legacy agreements that included contested bans on forced redundancies or relocations that made roster reorganisation barely possible and that delivered Aurizon employees free rail cards even though the company no longer owned the state's passenger network.\nWith those protections suddenly gone the unions rushed back into negotiation and new agreements were drawn up, recommended and accepted in union-backed ballots. After losing its appeal and, risibly, calling on the government to legislate closure of the Watson window, the rail union complained that those negotiations had been conducted for workers with \"a gun at their heads\".\nBut, as the FWC made plain in protecting Watson's decision, that was the point. The union's existing agreements with Aurizon expired on December 31, 2013. Negotiations to replace that agreement had been under way from April 2013. Industrial action had been routinely approved and taken by workers through 2014. Watson found that the Fair Work Act allowed for the termination of the previous agreement under these conditions and, further, that the public interest would not be failed by acceding to Aurizon's request for that to happen.\nPatently, this looms as a subtle game-changer for employers and unions stuck in protracted disputes. In reinforcing the legality of Watson's courage, the Federal Court has secured the potential for the exercise of similar levels of productive discretion by other commissioners faced with circumstances not at all unusual across a wide horizon of Australian industrial relations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:06:07.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
