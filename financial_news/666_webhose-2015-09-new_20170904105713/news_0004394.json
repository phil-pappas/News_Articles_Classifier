It had a working phone line and the previous owners had been long-term BT customers.\nSince the owners wanted to keep their number, the line was disconnected and we duly signed a new contract with BT a week or so after completion. BT missed the installation date and, after several weeks of chasing them up, we were finally advised that Openreach had “given away” our connection and was demanding nearly £10,000 to install a new line to the property.\nWe feel that this is unfair given that we bought the property with a working phone line (there is still a line coming into the house, and BT sockets in the house). When we complained to BT it said it was out of its hands and issued us with a final position letter.\nOpenreach doesn’t seem to have any direct complaints process; Ofcom says that Openreach is out of its remit; and Citizens Advice hasn’t been able to help. Meanwhile my vulnerable mother-in-law is staying there with no contact to the outside world (there is no mobile signal at the property). AP, Holme-next-the-Sea, Norfolk\n“Unfair” is an understatement. This outrageous behaviour on the part of BT and its sister company Openreach mirrors the recent case of a reader who was asked to pay £20,000 for a phone line in a house that had previously been connected. As in that situation, a system error is to blame. BT tells me that the address you provided in your online application didn’t match the address in its records, and so it assumed it was a new line.\nThis is an extraordinary bungle on several counts: the fact that BT only realised the mismatch when the Observer got involved; the fact that it washed its hands of your case without any proper investigation and the fact that it was deemed reasonable to charge £10,000 to fulfil its universal service obligation.\nAlthough householders can be held liable for line installation costs over £3,400, these charges tend to apply to properties remote from the telecoms network and are rarely levied.\nHappily, press office involvement causes a phone line to be installed without charge. As for Ofcom’s alleged claim that Openreach is outside its remit, that’s a red herring. It does regulate Openreach’s overall performance, but it can’t investigate individual complaints which have to be channelled through the customer’s service provider and a relevant mediation scheme.\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
