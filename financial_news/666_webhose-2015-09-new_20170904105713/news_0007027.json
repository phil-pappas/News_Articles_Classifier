Pimco managing directors as well as senior advisers including Bernanke and consultant Gene Sperling discussed trends for economies and markets over next 12 to 18 months.\nIvascyn's views are widely followed as he helps Pimco oversee assets that totaled more than $1.52 trillion as of June 30, mostly in fixed-income securities. Pimco is a unit of Munich-based Allianz SE.\nThe recent market turmoil, stemming from China's currency devaluation, has called into question the Fed's long-telegraphed plans to raise rates from near zero this year, possibly as soon as Thursday.\nAs of the end of August, the firm's $98.1 billion Pimco Total Return Fund had over 50 percent of its assets in mortgage-related assets and 19.19 percent in U.S.-government related securities. The fund also had 28.87 percent of its assets in emerging markets and 9.50 percent in investment-grade corporate credits and 5.40 percent in high-yield \"junk\" bonds.\nThe U.S.-government cagetory may include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.\nPimco Total Return fund's short-duration instruments - which are commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets - stood at negative 23.05 percent.\nIn having a so-called negative position in these cash equivalents and money-market securities, it is an indication of derivative use and short-term securities being put up as collateral as a way to boost leverage and increase the fund's holdings in bonds with longer maturities such as mortgage-backed securities, Treasuries and corporate bonds.
