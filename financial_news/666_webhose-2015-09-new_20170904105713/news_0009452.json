Morgan Securities LLC advised ComScore and Goldman Sachs & Co advised Rentrak.\nThe deal is expected to close by early 2016.\nComScore said it expects the deal to slightly hurt its adjusted earnings per share in 2016 and add to earnings in 2017.\n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Don Sebastian)\nComScore Rentrak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:43:45.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
