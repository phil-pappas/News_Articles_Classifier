Assets were $99.86 billion in January 2007, according to Morningstar data. \nInvestors have withdrawn record amounts of money since April 2013 because of erratic performance exacerbated by last year's departures by Gross and Mohamed El-Erian, the former chief executive officer of Pimco and Gross' heir apparent. \nThe Pimco Total Return Fund had cash withdrawals of $11.6 billion in January, though figures in recent months have reflected significant stabilization. Pimco Total Return has delivered returns of 0.72 percent so far this year, surpassing 85 percent of its category peers, Morningstar data show as of Aug. 31. \n\"We focus on investing client money using our time-tested strategy with the knowledge that it's risk-adjusted performance over the long term that ultimately matters to investors,\" said Scott Mather, lead manager of Pimco Total Return. \nThe Pimco Income Fund (PIMIX.O), overseen by Pimco Group Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn who succeeded Gross, continues to see huge investor appetite, posting $9.5 billion in inflows since the start of the year, according to Pimco's website. \nThe fund had assets under management of nearly $50 billion as of the end of August, Pimco said. \nIn the multisector bond category, the Pimco Income Fund is outperforming 97 percent of its category peers, posting returns of 2.72 percent as of the end of August. \nIvascyn told Reuters on Wednesday: \"Defensive positioning in corporate credit and targeted higher quality bond exposure have supported performance across both funds.\" \nPimco, which is a unit of Allianz SE (ALVG.DE), oversaw $1.52 trillion in assets under management as of June 30. \n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:12:03.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
