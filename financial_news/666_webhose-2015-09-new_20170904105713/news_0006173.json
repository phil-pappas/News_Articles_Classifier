The BoE will provide a second simultaneous release of its monetary policy decision and minutes from its rate-setting meeting, however after last month's 'Super Thursday' September's version will be a little less super as there will be no inflation report to accompany the two other announcements. \nHowever, any change to the 8-1 vote within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) ) vote will be read with interest. \nThe MPC is almost certain to keep keep interest rates unchanged at 0.50%, with worries about China, the ensuing financial market turmoil and oil price slippage meaning other committee members are unlikely to join Ian McCafferty in voting for a rate hike yet, with minutes expected to provide clues about committee thinking on the effects on the UK's inflation and growth outlook. \n\"While we expect colleagues Martin Weale and, potentially, Kristin Forbes to join [McCafferty] in the coming months, we do not expect them to do so in September,\" said HSBC . \"The news since last month has been mixed: while core inflation jumped and wage growth remained solid, allowing Mr McCafferty to stand by his position, the turmoil in markets and fears over global growth in late August are likely to prevent any of his fellow members changing their minds just yet.\" Other major macro news in the week includes revised Eurozone gross domestic prodcut (GDP) for the second quarter. \nThere are no particular reasons to expect the figure to be altered from the 0.3% quarterly gain shown by the provisional estimate, Capital Economics said, meaning the main interest in this second release will be in the breakdown of GDP by expenditure component. \nBut despite the better tone to the economic data coming out of the euro-zone in recent weeks, CE's Roger Bootle and Jonathan Loynes still expect growth to slow in the second half of the year as the twin tailwinds of the lower oil price and weaker euro fade, leading the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to follow up his hints and increase the pace of asset purchases soon. \nElsewhere, Chinese stock markets re-open on Monday after their long weekend, while trade data on Tuesday and inflation data on Thursday are \"potential catalysts for sharp market moves,\" warned Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) . \nwith US producer price inflation out on Friday following the important initial jobless claims report on Thursday. \nRetailers in focus Among UK corporates, it is a big week for investors in the retail sector, with several big trading updates and BRC (Shanghai: 600466.SS - news ) -KPMG retail sales data on Tuesday. \nAssociated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) , whose Primark chain is scheduled to open its first store in the USA in Boston, opens the week with its pre-close statement on Monday. Nomura said it suspected it might be surprised by the results due to good buying execution and weakness in the US dollar, with its forecast £12.9bn revenue, £1.0bn pre-tax profit and 97.9p earnings per share. UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said it expected the performance to be \"largely unchanged\" for the final quarter given the lacklustre summer and trading updates from sector peers. \nLater in the week, Sports Direct will provide a statement before its annual shareholder meeting, which as usual has the potential for some flashpoints. \nNext will publish interims having already reported first-half full price brand sales growth of 3.5% but Friday's BDO high street sales data knocked some of the optimism around the shares. Results will be judged against a consensus forecast of £19.bn revenue, £354m PBT and 183p EPS. \nHome Retail (Other OTC: HMRLF - news ) results on the same day come after management's previous flagging that this will be difficult half-year for Argos but that the second half should see an improved performance. Consensus is for £26m PBT. \nA busy day also sees Dixons Carphone (Other OTC: DSITF - news ) also announce first-quarter numbers, up against tough comparatives last year. Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) said it expected the group to report robust sales growth during Q1, with like-for-like sales growth of 3% including UK of 5%. \nMorrisons is also next among the big supermarket groups to publish half-year results. UBS recently upgraded the shares after its research found some early improvements under new CEO David Potts, but as he has been at the helm for six months \"the focus of the day is likely to be strategy over numbers\". \nHousebuilders on show Berkeley is just expected to deliver a brief trading statement, following the issue of detailed guidance along with its full year results in June, meaning the main focus will be on management's assessment of current market conditions and the strength of the forward order book. \nRedrow , from whence the market not so much as a whimper has been heard since interims in February, should offer much more chance for surprises. Broker Numis thinks there is \"a strong probability of results being ahead of consensus expectations given market conditions have remained robust over the past six months\". \nBarratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) will be reporting finals the following day, having in July flagged that PBT for the full year will be around £565m. Investors and analysts will be looking for an updated outlook. Numis said it will be hoping to hear more about the group's longer term targets for cash returns and the future shape of its balance sheet. \nMonday September 07 INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators (EU) (09:00) Philadelphia Fed Index (US) (15:00) FINALS Avation (LSE: AVAP.L - news ) , Dechra Pharmaceuticals (LSE: DPH.L - news ) , Green Reit (Other OTC: GREEF - news ) INTERIMS Brady (NYSE: BRC - news ) , MD Medical Group Investments GDR (Reg S), SimiGon Ltd (LSE: SIM.L - news ) .
