The question is: who are the right people to provide that literacy? I don't believe the banks are the right ones to be providing it when there is a vested interest in providing [it].\"\n\"A lot of us have a very innocent view of these accounts. In the past, it was all done by these state owned entities,\" he said. \"My personal view is this is an area ripe for reform.\"\nGovernment run bank accounts for primary and secondary school students were started in NSW in the 1880s. Commonwealth Bank took over in 1931 when it merged with the Government Savings Bank of NSW.\nCanstar lists six other lenders - mostly mutual banks as well as Bendigo Bank - that offer \"school banking\".\nFinancial adviser Scott Pape of Barefoot Investor told the inquiry he had misgivings about the school saving scheme.\"Dollarmites ... is a marketing program and a database.\"\nMr Dastyari asked whether the committee should recommend private institutions be banned from offering commissions to schools to sign up children to accounts and from providing financial education.\nMr Pape said: \"I do not believe that it is in the best interests of schools to be allowing banks to teach financial literacy and offering accounts to children â€“ it is the equivalent of having Ronald McDonald teaching kids about nutrition\".\nA spokeswoman for CBA said it is proud of Start Smart and separate School Banking program. She said the incentives offered to schools are to \"recognise their contribution to administering the program\".\n\"Our School Banking program has been teaching children lifelong money and saving skills for more than 80 years. The program is offered on an opt-in basis to both schools and parents,\" she said.\n\"StartSmart is a free financial educational program that provides engaging and interactive workshops, run by expert facilitators, to primary, secondary and VET students. Workshops cover age-appropriate concepts mapped to school curriculum.\"\nThe Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents mutual lenders like credit unions, said it \"welcomes debate about whether or not some financial literacy programs are more like marketing programs\".\n\"Currently, financial institutions are filling a gap in providing financial literacy programs targeted at young people,\" said a spokesman.\nA NSW Department of Education spokesman said: \"The program supports students' financial literacy and numeracy skills. The participation falls under the Department's policy and guidelines on schools' contact with businesses. This includes ensuring there is no endorsement of any product or service and the suitability of organisations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:19:51.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
