Written by: U-Jin Lee 09/29/15 - 8:40 PM EDT Tickers in this article: PAYX \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Paychex is scheduled to report its fiscal 2016 first-quarter earnings numbers before the market open Wednesday. Analysts are expecting the provider of payroll and other human resources services to report 51 cents in earnings on $717.52 million in revenue, a year-over-year increase. \nSome of the things that may boost its long-term growth strategy are joint ventures, acquisitions and product launches. Over the past few quarters, its payroll segment has seen a steady growth. On top of that, the small business market is also expected to see a greater employment growth. \nTheStreet's Jim Cramer said, \"Paychex reports tomorrow and you know what? This is really much more of a play on higher rates. If you think rates are going to go higher, they're going to make more money off the float. There are so many analysts who are negative on this because the Fed has kept rates at 0. This is a terrific play not on employment, which is pretty good, but on higher rates and I think higher rates are coming.\" More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:57:00.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
