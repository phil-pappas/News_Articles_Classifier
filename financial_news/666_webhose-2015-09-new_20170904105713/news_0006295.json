HBO won 14 awards during the 67th Emmy Awards, broadcast live Sunday on the Fox network from the Microsoft Theatre in downtown Los Angeles.\nCersei Lannister (Lena Heady) contemplates the fate of Emmy voters after Game of Thrones was snubbed in the costume and hair styling categories. supplied HBO maintained its dominance of the annual honours for the year's best TV, despite facing challenges from new players Amazon.com and Netflix, along with all of the rest of broadcast and cable. The network also returned to the winner's circle in the top category for the first time since 2007, when it won for the final season of The Sopranos , another big commercial hit.\n\"HBO, in their wisdom, paired a couple of novice producers with people of experience,\" said co-creator David Benioff. \"Thanks again HBO for believing in dragons.\"\nGame of Thrones won four awards on the night, the best showing at the Emmys for the popular series about warring families in the fictional land of Westeros. In past years, it earned a number of technical prizes but failed to win any of the top awards. Tracy Morgan presented the award, his first public appearance since he was injured in a car crash in June of last year.\nHBO took home all of its awards for three shows -- Veep , Game of Thrones and Olive Kitteridge . Olive Kitteridge , a four-hour miniseries based on the novel of the same name, was the most-lauded show of the night. Frances McDormand won an Emmy for her performance as the title character, a retired school teacher who suffers from depression, bereavement and jealousy.\n Veep , a parody of American politics adapted from a British satire, won four awards, including the top comedy prize. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won the lead actress Emmy for her performance as President Selina Meyer, her fourth consecutive win.\nThe series vied for top comedy prizes with Transparent , in which Jeffrey Tambor plays the patriarch of a Los Angeles family who reveals to his children that he has long felt he's a woman and is going to dress like one. Tambor and creator Jill Soloway delivered Amazon.com its first major Emmy awards.\nSoloway won the award for directing, one of 11 nominations the show received. Both Tambor and Soloway called out Amazon and advocated for transgender rights in their speeches.\n\"I'd like to dedicate my performance to the trans community,\" Tambor said. \"Thank you for your patience, thank you for your courage, thank you for your stories, thank you for your inspiration, thank you for letting us be part of the change.\"\nCommentary on transgender rights, sexism and ageism recurred throughout the evening, beginning with jokes in Samberg's opening monologue and culminating in Viola Davis' acceptance speech for her performance in How to Get Away with Murder . Davis is the first black woman to win the Emmy for best leading actress in a drama.\n\"The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone else is opportunity,\" Davis said during a speech in which she Quote: d activist Harriet Tubman. She went on to thank fellow black actresses Taraji Henson and Kerry Washington, as well as ABC executives Paul Lee and Ben Sherwood.\nAllison Janney won the only comedy Emmy that didn't go to Transparent or Veep , taking home an award for her supporting role in the CBS series Mom .\nThe Emmy was the seventh for Janney, who has garnered awards for The West Wing , Masters of Sex and now her second for Mom . That ties her with Ed Asner and Mary Tyler Moore for the most awards of any actor or actress in Emmy history.\nHBO headed into the show with 126 nominations, three times more than any other network. It aired three of the four shows with the most nominations, including Game of Thrones , which had already won eight prizes in technical categories before the telecast began.\nThe fantasy series led the Emmy nominations with 24 after completing its fifth season in June. The conclusion drew the show's largest audience ever at 8.1 million viewers. It's based on George Martin's book series A Song of Ice and Fire about noble families fighting for control of Westeros.\nThe annual Emmy awards show coincides with the debut of new and returning shows for major broadcast and cable companies and is a platform to promote their best hits and stars. Last year's telecast on NBC drew 15.6 million viewers.\nHBO's good fortune meant the end of a run for Modern Family , which has already won the Emmy five times for Walt Disney's ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:12:31.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
