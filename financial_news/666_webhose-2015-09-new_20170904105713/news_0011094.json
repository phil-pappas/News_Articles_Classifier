The scheme, which involved at least a dozen MPs, was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and could amount to a breach of parliamentary rules which specify electorate staff must not \"support the member's political or party duties\".\nThe Labor Party was able to fund 35 campaign organisers for its election campaign, based at the party headquarters. .\nLegislative Assembly Speaker Telmo Languiller and Legislative Council president Bruce Atkinson will decide if any action is necessary despite Mr Andrews claiming the use of staff on the campaign was above board.\nIn a heated question time, Mr Andrews was pressed by Opposition Leader Matthew Guy to explain if the scheme was within parliamentary guidelines.\nWhen asked by Mr Guy if the state's Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission would investigate, Mr Andrews said it was a matter for Parliament's presiding officers.\n\"Every member in this place should act within the rules,\" Mr Andrews said. \"There are rules of course and they've been followed at all times.\"\nEarlier in the day, he said he accepted responsibility for the scheme but the pooling of staff had occurred for decades. He said the unnamed MPs who leaked the story had not expressed concerns with him about the matter.\n Mr Andrews is yet to explain how it was within parliamentary rules but claimed both side of politics had done it before.\n\"I make no apology for a team of people â€“ a tiny number of whom were employed to support their member of parliament. They were vastly outnumbered by an army of volunteers who were not paid, working as hard as possible to get rid of one of the worst governments this state has ever seen,\" Mr Andrews said. \"This is just politics.\"\nThe Andrews Labor government has been under pressure from factions within and the latest allegations highlight dissent within the ranks.\nDumped minister Adem Somyurek, who was forced to resign when he was accused of bullying a staff member, said he expected the serious allegations to be investigated.\nUpon his resignation, Mr Somyurek took a swipe at the party's factions and said the bullying claims were part of factional \"pay-back\".\nMr Guy said the pooling arrangement of staff, which would make this scheme above board, ceased in 2006 under the previous Labor government. Mr Guy said it was only the Labor Party that used such an arrangement.\n\"The issue here today is about the Labor Party ... using electorate officers in campaigning roles outside of the parliamentary network, outside of the parliamentary system,\" Mr Guy said. \"That is improper. That is expressly forbidden.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:05:34.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
