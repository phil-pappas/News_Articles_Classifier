It said a Liberal government would not purchase the F-35 stealth fighter-bomber.\n\"Our (military) commitments will, among other things, ensure that the Royal Canadian Navy is able to operate as a blue water fleet well into the future,\" Trudeau said in a statement.\n\"By choosing to replace the existing CF-18s with a more affordable aircraft than the F-35s, we will be able to guarantee the delivery of current procurements for the navy.\"\nCanada's ruling Conservatives announced a deal in 2010 to buy 65 advanced F-35 jets, but abandoned the plan in 2012 after a probe found officials had deliberately downplayed the costs and risks of the deal.\nThe Conservative minister of veterans affairs, Erin O'Toole, said the Liberal Party was turning cutting the military into a political gimmick.\n\"By politicizing procurement projects and claiming to streamline spending, Mr. Trudeau is actually showing that giving our men and women in uniform the equipment they need is not a priority,\" he said in a statement.\nThe right-leaning Conservatives, who have ruled the country for nearly a decade, are in a tight three-way race with the center-left Liberals and New Democratic Party.
