Andrew Meares Much of this agitation was antagonistic towards Turnbull .\nThe Liberal conservative base can be expected to make its views known again, and so, too, no doubt, will members of the National Party who regard Turnbull with suspicion.\nDeputy Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has been making noises about re-negotiating the Coalition agreement. These are just noises at this stage like dogs barking in the night, but a seismic event like a leadership challenge will inevitably have its aftershocks – and potentially big ones.\nIf Turnbull was under any illusions about the sort of pushback he might expect from party traditionalists he need have listened no further than to former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett on Melbourne commercial radio.\n It would be understatement to describe Kennett's intervention as vitriolic in his assault on what he described as Turnbull's \"act of political bastardry\".\n\"I will never, ever vote for Malcolm Turnbull,\" Kennett said.\nThat will be a widespread sentiment in the Liberal Party, many of whose members regarded Turnbull as a closet leftist out of step with their conservative values.\nOn the other hand, a Turnbull leadership would address what has emerged as a lethal impediment to a conservative government's re-election.\nThat is the perception that Abbott has driven the government so far to the right that it does not represent mainstream values.\nNowhere – with the possible exception of South Australia – is despair over the Liberal Party's direction felt more deeply than in Victoria where the party was found by Robert Menzies in the dying days of World War II.\nVictorian Liberals have been in torturing themselves for months, fearing a wipeout at the polls. A few weeks ago Michael Kroger briefed senior figures in the Victorian branch about internal polling that pointed to the loss of at least half of the seats held in the southern state.\nEven the once blue-ribbon seat of Higgins would be in jeopardy with the sort of swings described by the internal polling.\nCriticism of Tony Abbott in Victoria among despairing Liberals is widespread and persistent. Turnbull might alienate conservatives, but he would cut a swathe through the middle ground. This is where elections are won and lost.\nRead next: Why Abbott may be out the top job faster than Rudd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:09:16.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
