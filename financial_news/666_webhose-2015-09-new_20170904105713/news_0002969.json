Travellers are being urged to understand the fees involved with using a credit card overseas. Source: News Limited\nIt is usually the only fee you will be hit with when making an in-store purchase so make sure you know what the conversion fees is as it will make a huge difference come the end of your holiday.\nYou can quickly rack up a lot of money in currency conversion costs without even realising.\nDOUBLE STING\nCanstar research analyst James Slack says some institutions split currency conversion fees into two fees.\nOne is the fee for converting one currency to another and another fee is charged simply for making a transaction overseas.\nForeign transaction fees are usually smaller than currency conversion fees — some institutions pass them onto customers while others don’t.\nCASH ADVANCES\nUsing your credit card to take out cash overseas is one of the most costly exercises you can do and Slack urges customers to steer clear of this option if possible.\n“It’s very expensive because you’ll be hit with both a fixed charge for using an ATM, for example $5, plus a currency conversion fee and another percentage charge for the cash advance fee,’’ he says.\n“On top of all that you’ll be charged interest as soon as you withdraw money from your credit card so we wouldn’t recommend using a credit card overseas.”\n@sophieelsworth\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68&h=Escaping+those+overseas+card+costs", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/travel#itm_t=story&itm_l=travel-credit-cards-elsworth", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68&title=Escaping+those+overseas+card+costs", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68&title=Escaping+those+overseas+card+costs", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68", "https://twitter.com/sophieelsworth", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/travel-credit-cards#itm_t=story&itm_l=travel-credit-card-elsworth", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Escaping+those+overseas+card+costs&c=TRAVELLERS+often+find+it+a+tough+task+to+escape+expensive+fees+when+using+their+credit+card+overseas.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/the-costs-of-using-your-credit-card-overseas/story-e6frfmcr-1227520620063?sv=651f1b4af134d39e2fe9acb57e2cff68"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T10:11:07.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
