The project was held back for four months due to procurement litigation against the Gulf-Centum Consortium that won the tender in September 2014. \nHowever, the management remains optimistic that they will beat the deadlines to commence operations of the plant that is expected to yield 1050 megawatts. \nThe plant comes at a difficult time for the coal industry, with more than 200 countries expected to reach agreements to reduce carbon emissions in December during the climate change conference in France. \nPart of the agreement is a proposal to tax carbon emissions, a policy that has hit the British coal industry after it doubled its carbon surcharge on power producers in April, triggering the lowest shipment of coal in two years. \nThe Paris talks would curb future carbon output for developing nations and mean absolute cuts for developed countries. However, the commitments would kick in starting in 2020, when current commitments will run out. \n\"If the taxes are approved, they might have an impact on our project but I cannot say for now how big an impact because we haven't researched it,\" Kurrent Technologies CEO Sanjay Gandhi said. \nMr Gandhi, however, sought to assure residents that the Lamu power plan would use clean technology to recycle up to 90 per cent of the expected wastes. \nThe plant will have the ability to reduce sulphur emissions by converting the gas to gypsum for making wall boards and will convert fly-ash into asphalt to be used as a binder during road construction.
