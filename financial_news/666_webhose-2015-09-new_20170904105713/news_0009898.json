Manfred Gottschalk Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Commodity prices have plunged below the lows reached during the depths of the post global financial crisis trade recessions of 2009, presenting fresh risks to Australia's precarious budget position.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's monthly commodity price index plunged 3.1 per cent in August from July, when it declined a revised 3.6 per cent.\nMost of the plunge was driven by tumbling prices of iron ore and oil, with other base metals and rural export prices also declining.\nFalling terms of trade - the ratio of export prices to import prices - undermine real net national income, which measures those proceeds of Australian production that actually accrue to domestic governments, companies and individuals.\nAustralia last year slipped into a technical \"income recession\" after two consecutive quarters of contraction by this measure.\nPlunging global commodity prices saw the terms of trade fall 3.4 per cent from the previous three months, widening the current account deficit to $19 billion from $13.5 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday .\nThe ABS will release national accounts at 11.30 on Wednesday and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect that GDP rose just 0.4 per cent in the quarter and 2.2 per cent over the year in what would be the weakest outcome in five quarters.\nForecasts range from zero to 0.6 per cent growth, with growth potentially helped by the small-business tax write-off in the last budget.\n The only good news from the commodity price index rout was the fact that in US dollar terms, the decline was limited to 1 per cent in August, after the value of the Australian dollar fell close to a six-year low.\nCrumbling commodity prices continue to send the index downwards from its 2011 peak, to be 20.9 per cent lower over the past year against a basket of major international currencies.\nAgainst the US dollar, it has shed 7.4 per cent over the past year, a period that included two official Reserve Bank interest rate cuts and a resurgent US dollar.\nStrong commodity prices between 2003 and 2011, aside from a temporary post-global financial crisis dip, helped sustain Australia's economy as the many of the world's advanced economies succumbed to recession.\nOfficial forecasters at Treasury have long anticipated falls in commodity prices from their boom-time highs but there is considerable debate about whether prices for key exports, such as iron ore and coal, could return to their long-run pre-2003 levels.\nIn a statement after Tuesday's Reserve Bank decision, policy makers said that commodity prices are \"much lower\" than a year ago, partly because of increased supply from Australian exporters or iron ore.\nThey also said that the Australian dollar continues to adjust to the \"significant declines in commodity prices,\" suggesting they expect further devaluation to occur.\nThe currency traded at US71.08¢c late on Tuesday, close to its lowest since April 2009. On Wednesday morning it had slipped further, to US70.24¢.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-02T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:12:36.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
