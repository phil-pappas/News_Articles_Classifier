We think so,\" Goodhart, Manoj Pradhan and Pratyancha Pardeshi argue in a study released last week. \"Just as a larger labor force pushed real wages lower and inequality much higher in the advanced economies, a smaller labor force will inevitably lead to rising wages, a larger share of income for labor and a decline in inequality.\"\nWorld population growth, now about 1.25 percent annually, will fall to 0.75 percent globally and near zero in the developed world by 2040, according to United Nations projections. Not only is the supply of untapped easily integrated labor in places like China drying up, but the aging of the west will put local pressures on wage supply, as it implies a booming need for healthcare workers.\nMost economists agree interest rates have been driven down by past demographic trends, as western workers were unable to negotiate wage gains, and due to very high savings rates in China and other developing nations. It also gave western companies less incentive to invest, as the use of more or cheaper labor promised better returns.\nNegative demographics should in theory lower growth and reduce savings - as the old consume their assets - and investment. The Goodhart paper argues that savings will fall faster than investment, driving up interest rates.\nIt is fair to note that the Morgan Stanley analysis rests on some assumptions that may not hold. Firstly, that developed countries will respond to demographic developments by maintaining social safety nets and pension provisions, moves that require the political will to tax and spend. Secondly, there is the unknowable issue of technology. While the argument is that companies will respond to scarce, more expensive workers by investing in labor-saving technology it is unclear which force will be more powerful.\nFALLING INEQUALITY, FALLING ASSET PRICES?\nMany economists have argued that a demographic slowdown will be bad for asset prices, in part because there will be fewer natural buyers saving for old age and more natural sellers funding their lives in retirement.\nAdd in rising interest rates and wages to this scenario and the damage to major asset classes could be substantial. One of the arguments for current elevated equity prices is that corporations now enjoy high profit margins. These, however, will be eaten away in part by rising wages, resulting in lower profits. Companies may have some success in holding down wages through investment, but this will tend to drive interest rates higher. Add in slower overall economic growth and it will be a more difficult environment for companies.\nAs interest rates have a powerful effect on the future value of expected earnings, it is fair to expect equities to trade at a reduced premium as a result of the demographic slowdown.\nThe impact of rising natural interest rates also poses a problem for government bonds, which lose value as rates rise.\nToby Nangle, head of multi-asset allocation at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, has argued along similar lines to Goodhart and concluded that government bonds may lose their allure, and the central place they hold in the construction of most portfolios. ( here )\nGiven that many government bonds already yield precious little, the losses investors suffer as interest rates rise will be particularly painful. The old idea that bonds \"balance\" out the risk of equities or other assets over market cycles may not hold, leading investors to look elsewhere. That, of course, would exacerbate the rise in market interest rates.\nThe last 35 years have been great for capital and lousy for labor, at least in the developed world. The next 15 may be quite the reverse. (At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.
