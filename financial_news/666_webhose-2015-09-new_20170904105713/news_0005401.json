Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray China will launch a nation-wide emissions trading scheme in 2017 covering its worst polluting industries, as part of a joint effort with the United States to tackle climate change and ramp up pressure on countries, like Australia, to strengthen commitments.\nThe move by China to fast-track the introduction of a carbon market has raised hopes of a breakthrough at the United Nations climate talks in Paris later this year.\nIt comes at an awkward time for new Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who has been a supporter of emissions trading schemes in the past but pledged to stick to the Abbott government's climate policy after taking over the leadership last week.\nThe move by China is also more bad news for the Australian coal industry, which is already suffering from low prices due to declining demand in China and the sluggish world economy.\nPresident Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Whitehouse on Thursday evening. Xi's announcement is due on Friday, marking a shift in the relationship between the two countries. Manuel Balce Ceneta Coal consumption in China declined for the first time in 15 years during 2014, falling 0.67 per cent. The country is Australia's biggest coal customer.\nImports have been the hardest hit, falling 31 per cent over the first eight months of the year, as Beijing blocks shipments on quality grounds in an effort to prop up its local industry.\nEven with slowdown China still burns half the world's coal and is the world's largest polluter.\n\"This [the emissions trading scheme] might encourage the Australian government to take more action on carbon reduction policies,\" said Wang Zhenyu, a scholar linked to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \"Climate change requires a joint effort from all countries.\"\n Brendan Pearson, chief of the Minerals Council of Australia said Australian coal producers could still benefit from the emissions trading scheme as China would require higher quality coal. \"Australia has large deposits of high-energy, low ash coal suitable for use in advanced coal generation technologies,\" he said.\nPresident Xi Jinping and his American counterpart Barack Obama are set to announce the upgraded commitment on Friday, according to reports by journalists from both countries who have been briefed on the plan.\nThe so-called \"cap and trade\" scheme, under which the government places a \"cap\" on annual pollution and then allows companies to trade permits to pollute, would begin in 2017.\nThe Chinese media have reported it will cover key sectors of the economy including power generation, iron and steel, chemicals and cement and is aimed at halting the growth in China's emissions by 2030.\nThat commitment for peak emissions was made as part of an historic agreement struck between China and the US in November last year.\nHunt doubts Chinese plan Environment Minister Greg Hunt was quick to raise doubts about the Chinese plan on Friday.\n\"I'd be very interested to know what percentage of permits are given away for free; it's 99 to 100 per cent for the pilot schemes, and that may well be the case here,\" he told Sky News.\n\"A quarter of the world's emissions are coming from China and that is set to increase by 150 per cent from 2005 to 2030. If China takes action to reduce emissions that's good but it's up to each country to work out how they do it.\"\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten seized on the news to point out Labor's climate policy was now similar to that being adopted by China and US.\n\"Labor is going in lock step â€¦ with the rest of the world,\" he said. \"Why is Malcolm Turnbull the only person who is chasing after Tony Abbott's discredited schemes? The tide is turning on real action on climate change.\"\nChina has already established seven pilot emission reduction schemes in places like Shanghai and Beijing but they have been plagued by transparency concerns and a lack of enforcement.\nQi Ye director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Centre for Public Policy warned against making assumptions based on the pilot schemes as they were for testing only and not a reflection of what the final scheme might look like.\n\"I would not extrapolate the practices of the pilots to predict what will happen with the nation-wide scheme,\" he said.\nMr Qi, one of China's leading advisers on energy policy, said the new plan was \"significant\".\n\"The carbon market is a good way of introducing a market mechanism but it needs to be considered alongside other measures including carbon taxation.\"\nUnder last year's agreement between China and the US, Beijing pledged to generate 20 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\nMr Obama committed to reducing US emissions by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025.\nClimate change policy is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise fractious relationship between the world's two super powers. They are currently locked in bitter disagreements over cyber-security, Beijing's crackdown on human rights lawyers and the Chinese government's island-building in the South China Sea.\nChina and the US will take their upgraded pledges to the UN climate talks in Paris this December, where an attempt will be made to negotiate a binding global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nMr Obama said last week he was \"cautiously optimistic\" on the outcome.\n\"We're now in a position for the first time to have all countries recognise their responsibilities to tackle the problem,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine.\nAustralia has pledged to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, through its policy of \"direct action.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:15:13.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
