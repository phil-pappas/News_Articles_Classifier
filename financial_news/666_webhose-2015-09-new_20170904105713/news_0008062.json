REUTERS/Mike Blake (Reuters) - Upscale food market operator Whole Foods Market Inc said it would cut about 1,500 jobs, or about 1.6 percent of its workforce, over the next eight weeks.\nThe cuts are aimed at reducing costs as the company invests in technology upgrades, Whole Foods said in a filing. ( http://1.usa.gov/1KOdoMG )\nThe affected positions were mainly in stores, but \"back of house\" positions that were not customer facing, the company said in an email to Reuters.\nWhole Foods said it would offer employees options including transition pay, severance, or allow them to apply for other jobs.\nThe job cuts come as the retailer is working to shed its \"Whole Paycheck\" nickname and its reputation for high prices. Whole Foods said in May that it would launch a new chain of smaller, more value-focused shops next year.\nThe company, which dominates the natural and organic grocery category, faces increasing competition from specialty and mainstream retailers.\nThe New York's Department of Consumer Affairs said in June it was investigating Whole Foods after finding that the company charged too much for some prepackaged foods at nine of its New York City stores.\nThe company's shares were down 0.5 percent at $30.96 in low volumes in premarket trading on Monday.\n\n(This story corrects to \"June\" from \"July\" in paragraph 7)\n\n(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr and Savio D'Souza)\nConsumer Discretionary Whole Foods", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:36:57.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
