Photo: Bloomberg\nRod Sims has given the Murdochs' latest Australian media land grab an \"amber\" light, as it's known in the inner circles of the legal trade.\nIn July the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman put the family on notice over Foxtel's push for 15 per cent of Ten Network Holdings, the loss-making free-to-air television network behind The Bachelor and MasterChef .\nNow Sims has gone a step further, spelling out his concerns explicitly in a typically frank statement of issues on the deal, which will reshape Australian media if he decides to give it the nod.\nAt least Rupert Murdoch's role at News Corp remains clear. Photo: Christopher Pearce\nA \"red light\" statement would have said the deal caused concern about a substantial lessening of competition.\nAdvertisement Instead it's an \"amber\", which means the ACCC is concerned that the deal \"may\" substantially lessen competition – in both the sports rights and the advertising markets.\nFoxtel – owned by News Corp and Telstra – and Ten must now persuade Sims otherwise.\nRod Sims is well aware that the country's leading sports codes have locked up free-to-air rights deals until 2022. Photo: Getty Images\nThe fast-moving nature of the media market – with younger players such as Netflix, Apple TV and YouTube stealing eyeballs – means it's one of the most complex probes ever for the ACCC.\nThe fact that Foxtel is taking 15 per cent of Ten, rather than buying it outright (which it can't do under the broadcasting rules anyway) adds to the considerable nuance.\nSims has pushed his enquiry out until October 22 while he tackles concerns that the deal will result in \"an alignment of interests\" between Foxtel and Ten.\nDespite The Bachelor 's success, Ten has struggles to pull a profit.\nThe regulator warns that the deal could favour Ten in the bidding for sports content against other free-to-air television providers and reduce or \"even eliminate\" competition between Foxtel and Ten for the supply of advertising services.\nFree-to-air locked up Sims is well aware that the country's leading sports codes, the NRL and the AFL, have locked up free-to-air rights deals until 2022 with Ten's larger rivals Nine and Seven respectively (with Ten thus far officially left out).\nBut he notes that Foxtel is keen to get its hands on other sports events currently on the anti-siphoning list of games guaranteed for free-to-air TV and notes rivals' concerns that the proposed team-up could allow Foxtel and Ten to game the list.\nTen's advertising sales tie up with Foxtel comes under the spotlight too.\nCommercial strategy 101 will tell you that it's a much more reliable market when you're up against two competitors (the Seven and Nine networks) rather than three. Advertisers, warns Sims, may have to pay more as a result.\nThe juicy bit is on page 9 where the ACCC warns that it may view Lachlan Murdoch's 8.52 per cent stake in Ten (through his private investment vehicle Illyria) as aligned with the interests of News and Foxtel, potentially making it \"in effect the largest shareholding block in Ten\".\nThe regulator is also looking at \"the fact that Lachlan was previously interim chief executive officer of Ten, chairman of Ten and a member of the Ten board, and has significant experience and reputation in the media industry.\"\nJames Packer's 8.5 per cent stake in Ten has been drawn into the enquiry too. The ACCC notes that Lachlan (through Illyria) previously had an agreement Packer – that ran from November 2010 to March 2014 – to act in concert when voting their shares in Ten.\nProbe deepens The Australian Communications and Media Authority is doing its own probe into whether the deal will breach cross media-ownership laws.\nSims is even looking at the Murdochs' powerful position in television production through 21st Century Fox's 50 per cent stake in Endemol Shine, the newly merged company behind Big Brother and MasterChef . It's unlikely to be a deal breaker.\nBy the time he's done, the ACCC will have spent more than a third of the year considering a deal that will only cost Foxtel $77 million.\nWith fellow amber gambler Ten, the pay TV giant has until September 28 to lodge its next set of confidential submissions.\nThey still have wriggle room to get the deal across the line.\nBut even if they succeed, it seems likely that there will at least be some undertakings imposed in order to satisfy some of the multiple concerns raised by their opponents, which include Fairfax Media, owner of The Australian Financial Review and BusinessDay .", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/murdoch_media_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T10:50:13.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
