CHRISTOPHER GREGORY by Angus Grigg For decades when visiting New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, American presidents have stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria.\nThe hotel, which occupies a full city block, is a grand monument to American power and an \"official\" city landmark alongside the Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building.\nBut Barack Obama won't be staying there later this month for UN Leaders' Week, as the Waldorf is now owned by China's Anbang Insurance.\nIt highlights the level of mistrust between the world's two super powers, made worse by the White House's eagerness to broadcast Obama's change of residence.\nHe's now staying at the Korean-owned Palace Hotel, a move which has formed part of the sniping ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's first state visit to the United States, which begins on Tuesday.\nFor months, in the lead up to the visit, both sides have been seeking to undermine the other in the search for advantage.\nIt's hard to call a winner, but the antics make a mockery of the so called \"mutual trust\" and \"friendship\" built up in this new \"great power relationship\".\n\"The most surprising thing about the lead up to this visit is that the Chinese have not moderated their behaviour,\" says Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University. \"Usually you would expect them to do this.\"\n White is referring to China's island building activities in the South China Sea. Despite saying substantive works had been completed in July, the Chinese have spent the summer laying the foundations for a third airstrip in the disputed territory.\nAs White points out, it's hardly a conciliatory gesture ahead of a major summit.\nThe Chinese construction at Mischief Reef was reported by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) earlier this week.\nZhang Jian, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Canberra who specialises in China security issues, said the disclosure may have been an attempt by some to elevate the issue during Xi's visit.\nBut still, he thinks it will be a secondary topic.\n\"For the US-China relationship, the key issues are likely to be cyber security and China's economic slowdown. The main agenda is focused on the bilateral investment treaty,\" says Zhang.\n\"The South China Sea issue will be discussed but it is highly unlikely they can make any progress there.\"\nOn cyber security the US is pushing for China to moderate its behaviour, after accusing Beijing of stealing the personal information of more than 20 million Americans.\nThe data was stolen over an 18 months period from the Office of Personnel Management and is said to include sensitive biometric and security information.\nIn the lead up to Xi's visit there has been talk of sanctions, as the US viewed the data breach as so vast that a normal response was not adequate.\nSelective leaks have also mentioned a retaliatory cyber attack on China, including efforts to disable the Great Fire Wall, which allows the Communist Party the maintain control over the internet. Sanctions or a cyber attack have not eventuated, but the US is still talking tough.\n\"This is not just a matter of us being mildly upset, but is something that will put significant strains on a bilateral relationship if not resolved and that we are prepared to take some countervailing actions,\" Obama told a business lobby group on Tuesday.\nChina has said it is willing to at least consider \"co-operating\" on the setting of international cyber-security standards. But that's about the only concession made ahead of the visit.\nIndeed, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said Xi would be speaking \"frankly\" to the US President in a further sign that Beijing believes it is the equal of Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:48:29.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
