Obtaining startup finance is seldom easy or straightforward, regardless of whether or not you are born in a particular country. However, as the report points out, migrant entrepreneurs – and particularly those relatively new to the country - tend to lack the credit history or business track record that might make it easier to secure a loan, a grant or equity investment.\nAnd this matters. Business started by migrant entrepreneurs are punching above their weight when it comes to contributing to the prosperity of the UK. Witness another report, published last year by the Centre for Entrepreneurs and DueDil. According to that study, nearly have a million people from a total of 155 countries have settled in Britain and launched new businesses. What's more around 17.2% of the migrant community have launched businesses compared to just 10.4% of indigenous Britons.\nAnd when you look at the UK's emergence as Europe's tech hub, few would deny that London's success in particular is based not only on the pool of local talent but also on the capital's ability to attract skilled and ambitious people from all over the world. Spend any time in the shared workspaces and campuses of London's Tech City district and it quickly becomes apparent that new ideas, business models and technologies are being generated in a genuinely multi-national and multicultural environment,\nUnfamiliar Territory\nBut no one should underestimate the the difficulties of setting up and running a business in an unfamiliar territory.\nThink of this way. When a UK business is considering either exporting , or setting up a marketing or production operation in another country, success depends on taking the time to fully understand the market. Who are the customers? Who are the competitors? Who are the the potential partners (agents, distributors, advisors, etc) and how do they operate?How does the business and customer culture differ? And for a business setting up overseas – rather than simply selling to customers in the new market – there are also questions about employment laws and practices, worker expectations and the wider regulatory environment. As if that isn't enough, the funding eco-system is likely to be different as well, and that in turn requires even more research. The same kinds of challenges apply equally to entrepreneurs arriving in the UK.\nThe Need For Support\nThe UK government is keen to attract overseas Entrepreneurs – particularly those running early stage technology companies – and the agency charged with promoting both exports and inward investment, UKTI, is there to provide practical help. That said, this help is largely aimed at entrepreneurs seeking to relocate to Britain rather than migrants who begin putting together businesses once they arrive.\nFor businesses with growth potential, incubators and accelerators are playing an increasingly important role helping entrepreneurs match product to market. And that's where the organisation behind this latest study aims to carve out a niche.\nFounded by Rafael dos Santos , This Foreigner Can is a non-profit organisation running a a Migrant Business Accelerator, which provides both funding and mentoring for foreign entrepreneurs as they seek to get to grips with the UK. “I have first-hand experience of the obstacles a migrant has to go through to set up their own business in the UK, and I wanted to use my knowledge to help others get their feet on the ground,” says dos Santos. “Money isn’t the only thing you need as a migrant entrepreneur, you also need to understand a whole host of other things, which will contribute to whether your business thrives or not.”\nIt's a point well made. Migrant entrepreneurs are already playing a hugely important role in Britain's startup economy, but they do face more challenges than their native counterparts. Some will undoubtedly benefit from additional support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:22:20.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
