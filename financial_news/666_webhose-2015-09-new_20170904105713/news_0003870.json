Exports were up a small 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, helped by stronger sales of U.S.-made autos and machinery, while imports declined 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. \nSo far this year, the deficit is running 3.6 percent above last year’s level, reflecting weaker export sales. The concern is that U.S. growth will be hurt by further declines in exports, reflecting a stronger dollar and overseas weakness in nations such as China. \nSal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, predicted that trade will be a drag on economic growth over the next year as the strong dollar cuts into exports and boosts demand for imports by making foreign goods cheaper for U.S. consumers. \nThe July trade report showed that America’s deficit with China rose 0.4 percent in July to $31.6 billion, the highest level in nine months. So far this year, the U.S. deficit with China is running 8.5 percent higher than last year, and is on track to record another annual record. America’s trade gap with China is the largest with any country.
