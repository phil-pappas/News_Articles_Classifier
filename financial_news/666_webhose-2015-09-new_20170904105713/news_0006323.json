Louie Douvis by Phillip Coorey Jared Lynch The stand-off over the China-Australia free trade agreement has become front and central in the Canning byelection with Bill Shorten warning locals their jobs were at risk while former prime minster John Howard accused the Labor leader of recklessly opposing the national interest.\nFederal Labor does not oppose the FTA but is demanding the government enshrine in law safeguards which would mandate that Chinese companies must seek Australians before importing their own labour. The opposition argues the agreement has been watered down to make this requirement discretionary.\nMr Howard, who began the negotiations with China over the FTA when he was prime minster last decade, used his visit to Canning on Thursday to berate Mr Shorten as being beholden to militant unions.\nHe said China was the nation's biggest trading partner, had kept Australia afloat during the global financial crisis and the FTA, negotiated by Andrew Robb, had secured \"unheard of access to agriculture, this huge market we never dreamt of before\".\nBill Shorten says he wants to see jobs for Australians. Chris Hopkins \"The Chinese, if we muck around with this, will go away,\" he said.\nMessage urged Mr Howard said it was inexplicable that Labor figures \"left right and centre are literally falling over themselves\" to back the agreement but Mr Shorten was beholden to the CFMEU. He urged Canning voters to send Mr Shorten a message.\nMr Shorten, also campaigning in Canning, said the safeguards Labor was demanding were small but \"near enough's not good enough\".\n \"When did Parliament and politics under Mr Abbott's Liberals become so toxic that Labor can't propose sensible changes and we just get shouted down by some in the media and by the conservatives?\" he said.\n\"We don't accept that for projects over $150 million there should be no requirement to have labour market testing.\n\"If there's a project which is $150 million-plus in Western Australia, say a hotel or a construction development, I want to see Western Australian riggers and dogmen get jobs, I want to see Western Australian carpenters, labourers and mechanics and designers and drafts people get those jobs.\"\nCanning has between 5000 and 10,000 fly-in-fly-out mining workers, many of whom face uncertainty as the boom comes to an end.\nLegislation for the deal will be put to Parliament in about October.\nDairy stands to lose $20m The dairy industry, one of the biggest winners from the FTA, warned it was set to lose at least $20 million in expected tariff cuts if the FTA was not implemented by Christmas.\nAustralian Dairy Farmers president Noel Campbell said the deal would create jobs, adding 600-700 to the dairy industry in its first year, as well as longer term growth.\nHe said the opportunities through tariff reductions took five to 10 years to be realised and dairy businesses would adapt.\n\"There are jobs not only in primary production but also in processing, and that happens mainly in rural communities because dairy is a perishable product that needs to be processed close to its source,\" Mr Campbell said.\n\"China gives farmers access to a growing market â€“ only one province would huge.\"\nMr Campbell said there was limited growth in the domestic market, which is mature. He said Japan, which is a big importer of Australian dairy products, was the same.\nDairy farmers are facing a season of possibly no milk price increases amid global volatility on dairy markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:42:30.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
