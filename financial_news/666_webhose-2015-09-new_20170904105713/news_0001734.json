It wasn’t just Australia, it was all across the region,” Mr McCarthy said. Japan’s Nikkei index gave up 2 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 2.3 per cent.\nAt home, the materials sector led the bourse lower, joined by energy stocks after oil prices soured. Miner South32 was down 5.7 per cent, while parent BHP Billiton shed 4.4 per cent.\nMr McCarthy said while 5000 was a “nice round number”, it wasn’t a key resistance level.\n Bourse hits skids as engine groans", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/chinese-manufacturing-slowdown-pushes-asx-200-below-5000-points/story-fnihsps3-1227541029490"], "published": "2015-09-24T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:37:18.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
