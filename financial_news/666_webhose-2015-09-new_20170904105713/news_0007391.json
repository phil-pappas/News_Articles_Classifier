A management roadshow for the 4-for-65 rights issue begins Monday and will run through Sept. 30, the terms show.\nPhilip Morris, which currently owns 98.18 percent of the Indonesian unit, will then offer 264.2 million shares from its entitlement to other investors through a placement, the terms show. The deal will help Sampoerna, which has a market value of $23.2 billion, meet Indonesian listing rules requiring companies to have at least a 7.5 percent free float by January next year.\nA $1.4 billion deal would be the country’s largest rights offering, surpassing the $1.3 billion raised in 2011 by Indonesian lender PT Bank Mandiri, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sampoerna will use some of the rights offering proceeds to repay working capital facilities, the terms show.\nThe company aims to price the sale on Oct. 1 and will begin trading ex-rights on Oct. 20, the terms show. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are joint global coordinators of the offering, while Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and PT Mandiri Sekuritas are joint bookrunners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:02:37.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
