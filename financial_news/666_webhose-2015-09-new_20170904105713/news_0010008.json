They have 12 months to sell the properties under the amnesty that we have provided until the ends of November,\" Mr Hockey said.\n\"So we are getting on with the job of enforcing the laws. There has been no enforcement and no successful order for at least the last 20 years. But we have taken this decision to ensure that there is integrity in the foreign investment regime and that those people who unlawfully hold Australian residential real estate are caught.\"\nThe Tax Office, which is in charge of enforcing the laws, said in June that it had 195 investigations underway .\nMultinational tax crackdown The treasurer also announced legislation to tighten the tax laws to stop multinationals illegally shifting profits offshore. The measures are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue.\n\"The laws will apply to over 1,000 multinationals operating in Australia that have a global turnover of more than a billion dollars,\" Mr Hockey said.\n \"I understand a number of multinationals have already come forward to identify profits previously unseen in relation to their activities in Australia. And are prepared to restructure their businesses to pay their fair share of tax in Australia.\"\nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:09:12.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
