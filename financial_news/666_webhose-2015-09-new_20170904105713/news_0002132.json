It has since grown to include 237 stores in 20 countries. American Apparel APP, +2.95% had sales of $387 million in 2007, the year it went public. Its shares peaked at $16.80 on Dec. 12 of that year.\nNow the executive team is working to keep the company afloat. In the second quarter of 2015, American Apparel reported a loss of $19.4 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $16.2 million, or 9 cents per share, for the same period in 2014. Net sales decreased 17.2% to $134.4 million from $162.4 million the previous year.\nThe company reported $11.2 million in cash but has an interest payment of about $13.9 million due on Oct. 15.\nAn American Apparel spokeswoman declined to comment further on the company’s financial situation or turnaround plan.\nOver a few short years, American Apparel shed its trendy and successful image to find itself on the brink of disaster. Charney faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment, reports of outrageous behavior that included “wandering around his factory in his underpants” and a suspension in June 2014 amid more accusations of his breaking company policies.\nHe fought to retain his position, rallying supporters and discussing changes to the leadership. But in December 2014, Charney was officially ousted. Paula Schneider assumed the role of CEO in January 2015, agreeing to a $600,000 annual salary .\nIntentionally and otherwise, American Apparel has attracted attention for its racy advertising, which frequently featured young women (many of them amateur models ) in highly sexualized poses. It also faces serious problems on the operational front.\nSales peaked in 2013 at $633.9 million, but the company posted a net loss of $106.3 million that year as margins narrowed. The company has had negative cash flow since 2013. As early as July 2014 , there were signs that American Apparel would not be able to meet its financial obligations.\nLegal fees, meanwhile, have increased. They totaled $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2015, up from $1.4 million for the same period last year. American Apparel faces about 20 lawsuits from Charney and his associates alone.\nWhen the company announced its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 17, it admitted it was not in compliance with the terms of a loan from Capital One. That same day, the company announced an agreement with creditors for a $90 million infusion that would avert default on loan payments. But with long-term debt of $234.9 million, American Apparel remains under threat of bankruptcy.\n“Based upon the trends occurring in our operations since June 30, 2015 and through the date of this release, together with our current expectations and projections for the next four fiscal quarters, we believe that we may not have sufficient liquidity necessary to sustain operations for the next twelve months,” American Apparel said in its earnings announcement . “These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we may be able to continue as a going concern.”\nAs part of a plan to achieve $30 million in cost savings over the course of 18 months, the company announced it would close underperforming stores. It aims to rebrand itself as “socially conscious,” attempting to appeal to millennials while doing away with its racy advertising.\nThere is doubt, however, about its ability to right the ship. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the retailer to Caa3 from Caa2 days before the second-quarter earnings announcement, pushing it deep into junk territory.\n“American Apparel’s Caa3 Corporate Family Rating highlights the company’s fragile liquidity, as well as its unsustainable capital structure at present levels of operating performance,” Moody’s said in a note. “Given the significant liquidity, operating, and governance issues that continue, an upgrade in the near term is unlikely.”\nAmerican Apparel’s stock hit its lowest level ever — 10 cents a share — on Aug. 12 and is currently trading at 17 cents.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-apparel-considering-buyout-offer-1419257757/?mod=mktw", "http://investors.americanapparel.net/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=920676", "http://nypost.com/2015/03/24/american-apparel-wants-models-not-instagram-hoes-in-ads/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-apparel-agrees-to-90-million-asset-based-infusion-1439848106", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/gNzQKikAVwx", "http://investors.americanapparel.net/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=927937"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:16:17.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
