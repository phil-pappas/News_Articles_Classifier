WKO serves six impoverished and socially isolated counties with a high number of children and pregnant women, and seeks to foster positive change by addressing the lack of health and developmental programs available in these communities. WKO focuses primarily on at-risk groups, including families suffering from long term poverty, families with histories of abuse and neglect, and pregnant or parenting teens.\n“The work done by Whole Kids Outreach is close to our heart here at American Insurance Agencies, and we’re looking to our fellow community members to help us make a difference,” says John Larson, owner and manager of American Insurance Agencies. “There are many families who could use a helping hand in these difficult times, and we’re inviting everyone we know to join us in offering one.”\nLarson and his team are actively contacting fellow residents, business associates, clients, and friends in an effort to advocate for the importance of the work done by Whole Kids Outreach and to gather donations that will be used to fund their efforts.\nIn addition to assisting Whole Kids Outreach, American Insurance Agencies has reached out to several other local charities over the last few months, and plans to help even more local charities as time goes by, at the rate of one new charity every 30-60 days.\nReaders who are interested in helping American Insurance Agencies as they support the efforts of Whole Kids Outreach are encouraged to visit the American Insurance website and make a direct donation to the cause from this page: http://www.americaninsurancepro.net/Helping-Underprivileged-Children-and-Families-in-Missouri-_18_community_cause .
