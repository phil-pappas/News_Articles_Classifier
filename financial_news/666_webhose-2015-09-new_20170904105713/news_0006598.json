Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen ascended to arguably the most powerful policy position in the world in part because supporters insisted she could best communicate the central bank's dual mandate of high employment and sustainable growth. Regardless of your opinion on Yellen & co.'s decision today not to raise rates -- there is no question the Fed's jumbled communication created much uncertainty ahead of today's decision. ADVERTISEMENT Critics say central bank policymakers have grossly underestimated the public's frustration and anger since the 2008 collapse. And policymakers' messages on how the Fed plans to navigate the unchartered waters ahead comes as grassroots groups on both the left and the right take aim at the bank.\nIt's not just Republicans attacking the Fed. Outside the Washington bank, dozens of liberal protestors ascended onto the sidewalk denouncing the Fed. One protestor held a sign quoting Pope Francis on income inequality; another with a sign: \"Do Black Lives Matter to the Fed?\" \n-- Reuters : \"The Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero on Thursday, raising questions over how it will ever manage to lift them off the floor and how effectively it will communicate plans to do so. Only just over half economists polled have predicted such an outcome, a rare occurrence, and a sign of just how hard it has become to read the Fed these days. Prior to the rate decision, Fed Chair Janet Yellen had not spoken in almost two months. Two of her closest allies had spoken late last month but delivered seemingly contradictory messages just days apart. \n\"The issue appears to be how Yellen manages the rate setting body. Like her predecessor Ben Bernanke she listens to others before speaking at the open markets committee and she appears to value forming consensus, shown by the fact that there was just one dissent in Thursday's vote. The language used by the Fed is aimed at giving it a high degree of flexibility when it comes to rate decisions. That may now be a weakness when it comes to communicating where the Fed is in situations in which it might need to pivot in response to developments such as the recent market turmoil in China and beyond, possibly leading to continued volatility in financial markets.\" http://reut.rs/1OAgwAw \n-- YELLEN: CONGRESS PLAYED NO ROLE IN DECISION. The Hill's Pete Schroeder: The Federal Reserve considers a lot of factors when setting interest rates, but a potential government shutdown is not one of them. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the central bank's Thursday decision to hold off on raising interest rates was not driven in the least by a potential shutdown of the federal government caused by a fiscal standoff in Congress. \"It played absolutely no role in our decision,\" she told reporters. \"To me, that's Congress's job.\" \nTHIS IS OVERNIGHT FINANCE, what a week, wonks.

Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) is pressing fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) to reveal his \"strategy for success\" as he risks a government shutdown in an attempt to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood. In a letter to Cruz on Thursday, Ayotte demanded to know why the firebrand Texas senator -- and presidential candidate -- is so strongly pushing legislation that the party can't pass. http://bit.ly/1KtziYF \nHOUSE GOP LEADERS: WE'LL GET BLAMED FOR SHUTDOWN. Rebecca Shabad and Peter Sullivan: \"House GOP leaders are trying to convince their rank and file it would be a bad move to risk a government shutdown over blocking funding for Planned Parenthood.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made the announcement after meeting at the White House with Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to plot their strategy on the spending talks... \n\"'The three of us agree that we want a short-term CR,' Reid told reporters after the 90-minute huddle in the Oval Office. 'We want to make sure the riders are off that, we want to make sure the government will be running.'
