Two analysts expected a 25 basis point hike after Mexico said it could even move first in a bid to defend the peso.\nMexican policymakers, in their last meeting in late July, increased dollar sales to support the peso and said they were ready to raise rates ahead of the Fed if currency weakness threatened inflation expectations or financial stability.\nThe peso has hit successive lows this year on concerns that higher U.S. rates will sap demand for riskier assets. However, so far foreign holdings of Mexican peso bonds have held around record highs while inflation has fallen to an all-time low.\nThe peso currency has pulled back from a record low of 17.31 per dollar hit last month to trade around 16.60 per dollar in the wake of the Fed's decision.\nThat gives Mexican policymakers room to leave Mexican borrowing costs steady to help the economy gain steam, analysts said. Last month, the government cut growth estimates for this year to around 2.4 percent due to falling oil output and patchy exports to the United States.\nThe majority of analysts polled now see a 25 basis point hike by Mexico in December. The central bank is due to issue its policy statement at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Monday.
