It is a gap that is expected to get much worse over the next 10 years. READ MORE: Calls for wealthy migrant investors to put more into local start-ups \nThe two organisations believe the idea would be a win-win for the start-ups and for migrants. It would provide much needed investment capital and create better links between migrants and local communities. \nThe Icehouse says that since 2009 around 1500 wealthy migrants have applied to live in New Zealand. Another 300 applications are pending, The 1800 migrants will bring investment funds totalling around $4 billion. \nAmong the categories is one called \"Investor Plus\". These are people who have to invest $10 million in New Zealand for three years. \nAnother category, \"investor\", requires the migrants to invest $1.5 million for four years. They must also have three years business experience and they must be under 65 years old. \nBut an analysis has found that around 80 percent of the money is being invested in bank bonds and deposits. \nThat is understandable from the investors' perspective. It is a safe low-risk investment. But does it do much to support fledgling companies? \nThe Icehouse's chief executive Andy Hamilton does not believe so. \n\"This has very little economic impact and ultimate benefit for New Zealand.\" \nHe would like to see at least 10 percent of the funds of wealthy migrants put into the start-up sector. \n\"Our work has led us to conclude that only around half of the capital needed by young companies is likely to be available for investment. \n\"An untapped source of capital are wealthy migrants who want to live in New Zealand. Other countries require these migrants to commit a portion of their investment to growth opportunities.\" \nKPMG is proposing that as much as 20 percent of high wealth migrants' investment funds could be put into the start-up sectors. \nIt calculates that New Zealand businesses will require more than $420 billion in capital by 2025. But there will be a shortfall of $115 billion. \n\"There is evidence that start-up and early stage New Zealand businesses are likely to face the most severe funding constraints, compared to their established peers. \n\"Investor migrants have the potential to provide a vibrant pool of capital, which can be a part contribution to addressing both of these issues.\" \nIt has three main proposals that it thinks could help to turn things around. \n1. Fast tracking investor visa processing if investments are made into active investments. \n2. Require active investments after a one year transitional period. \n3. Compulsory investment making a certain proportion of the investment into at-risk investments, and relax other requirements such as physical presence and English. \nHere is my talk with Paul Henry about the idea. US interest rates \nThursday morning in New Zealand could be a volatile time on world markets. \nAt 6am the US Federal Reserve is going to announce whether it is lifting its key interest rate from near zero. The Federal Funds rate currently sits at between zero and 0.25 percent. \nThere has not been a hike in the rate since the Global Financial Crisis. A lift in rates is a 50 - 50 call. Nobody is quite sure what the Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will do. \nA rate hike would be an endorsement of the growing recovery in the US. But it could also spark volatility. That's why it is so hard to predict what the Fed will do. \nA lift in rates would see a rise in the value of the US dollar because investors would pour money into the US attracted by the higher yields that are on offer. That would see the Kiwi dollar lose ground. \nIt could also give the New Zealand Reserve Bank some breathing room to avoid having to cut the official cash rate again in five weeks' time, thanks to the weakening New Zealand dollar. A weakening New Zealand dollar would add to the cost of imported goods, adding to the cost of living. That would help New Zealand move closer towards the Reserve Bank's target inflation rate of 2 percent (it is currently 1 percent ). \nA weaker Kiwi dollar would also give New Zealand exporters a hand. \nBut a US rate hike could see some volatile moves on global markets. \nIt would add to the borrowing costs for many American and businesses and it could see world share markets fall, as investors pull money out of stocks as they seek the \"safety\" of interest-paying bonds. \nRight now, the average US thirty year mortgage charges a 3.8 percent interest rate. That's down from 4.3 percent a year ago. \nThe average US savings account is paying 0.44 percent. The dollar \nThe New Zealand dollar is sitting at 63.19 US cents this morning, almost unchanged from just under 63 cents on Friday morning. \nThe Kiwi is trading at 89.14 Australian cents, compared to 89.08 on Friday. \nIt is 40.93 British pence, compared to 40.83. \nThe Kiwi is 76.13 Yen and 55.69 Euro cents. The markets \nWall Street rose 102 points on Friday US time, or 0.62 percent. \nThat meant it finished the week 2 percent higher, which made for its best week since March. \nThe European markets lost gorund however. \nThe London FTSE slipped 0.62 percent on Friday, Germany's DAX fell 0.85 percent and France CAC40 lost 1.04 percent. \nChina's Shanghai Composite made a very narrow gain, up 0.08 percent. \nBut Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.19 percent. Commodities \nWest Texas crude oil fell US$1.29 to $44.63. \nBrent is trading at $48.14. \nGold hit a one month low, sitting at US$1103 per ounce. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T04:51:25.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
