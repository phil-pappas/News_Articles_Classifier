It is not too late for them to do so while the furnaces are still burning. \n\"GMB will do all in our power to press the case for Government to act and to protect out members and their families.\" \nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said: \"We had begun to fear the worst over the past few days and this will be devastating news for our members and their families. We will be seeking an urgent meeting with the company to understand the detail of this announcement. We will also be putting in place support for our members in the days and weeks ahead. \n\"Steel making on Teesside must have a future and our fight to save our steel will continue.\" \nBusiness Minister Anna Soubry blamed economic conditions, including the price of steel halving within the last 12 months. \nShe said: \"Despite everyone's recent efforts to help SSI this is very sad news and a big blow for the workforce and their families. They are the priority and, with SSI's difficulties being no secret, why I had already asked Amanda Skelton, chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, to chair a local taskforce to help support workers and the local economy. I also have concerns about reports that local contractors have gone unpaid. \n\"I hope that SSI's announcement that they are mothballing the furnace gives some hope that steelmaking could be restarted on Teesside in the future.\" NORTH NEWS & PICTURES LTD Middlesbrough fans protested in favour of Redcar's steel plant SSI have played fast and loose with us for weeks and months. Anna Turley \nRedcar's Labour MP Anna Turley accused SSI of playing \"fast and loose\" with the plant's future. \nMs Turley said: \"It’s absolutely heartbreaking, it's devastating. It's a huge number of jobs, it's a huge number of livelihoods, but it is more than that to our community. \n\"Redcar was built on steelmaking, Teesside was built on steelmaking. It's about generations of people that have worked in that blast furnace and fought so hard, not just in the last few days but in the last few weeks, months, years, to keep steelmaking alive. It's just been allowed to fizzle out. \n\"SSI have played fast and loose with us for weeks and months. \n\"They cannot be allowed to run the asset into the ground.\" \nThe campaign to keep the steel works alive spread into the local community, with Middlesbrough fans holding up 'Save Our Steel' placards at this weekend's game against Leeds United.
