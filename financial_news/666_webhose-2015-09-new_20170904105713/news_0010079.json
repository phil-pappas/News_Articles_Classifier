(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rebounded on Wednesday, recovering some of their losses from a day earlier. Investors remain on edge after the latest market plunge, which was triggered by more signs of slowing growth in China. Oil prices continued to swing sharply. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 155 points, or 1 percent, to 16,214 as of 3:19 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,932 and the Nasdaq composite gained 65 points, or 1.4 percent, to 4,701. \nThe gains follow a volatile Tuesday on Wall Street, where the Dow fell 470 points in a heavy trading. \nTHE QUOTE: \"Investors should expect more volatility to come in this market,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott. \"The market needs to work through this correction, and that could take weeks, or maybe months.\" \nCHINA TRADING: China remains in focus across financial markets. The Shanghai composite index opened more than 4 percent lower, but turned positive by midday and eventually ended the day down only 0.2 percent. The volatile trading led some analysts to suspect Beijing was intervening to support share prices before a two-day holiday. \nJOBS, JOBS, JOBS: A private survey showed that U.S. businesses added jobs at a steady pace last month, with construction and manufacturing showing solid gains. The payroll processor ADP said businesses added 190,000 jobs last month, up from 177,000 in July, but below a six-month high set in June of 231,000. \nThe ADP report comes two days before Friday's August jobs report. Economists are forecasting that U.S. employers created 220,000 jobs in August, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent. \nIt will be the last jobs report Federal Reserve policymakers have before their next policy meeting later this month. Some economists expect the Fed to raise interest rates for the first time in close to a decade after the meeting. \nBIG REFUND: H&R Block jumped $2.32, or 7 percent, to $35.28, the biggest gain in the S&P 500 index. The tax preparation company posted a smaller-than-expected loss and announced a $3.5 billion stock buyback program. \nASIAN AND EUROPE SCORECARD: Tracking Chinese shares, Asian benchmarks swung between gains and losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 1.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.4 percent. \nEurope closed modestly higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, France's CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent. \nENERGY: Oil ended a choppy day higher after an Energy Department report showed a decline in fuel supplies, which suggests rising demand. The price of oil climbed despite a surprise increase in supplies of crude. U.S. crude rose 84 cents to close at $46.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, rose 94 cents to close at $50.50 a barrel in London. \nIn other futures trading on the NYMEX: \n— Wholesale gasoline rose 2.9 cents to close at $1.425 a gallon. \n— Heating oil rose 3.1 cents to close at $1.609 a gallon. \n— Natural gas fell 5.4 cents to close at $2.648 per 1,000 cubic feet. \nBONDS AND CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up to 2.19 percent from 2.15 percent on Tuesday. \nThe euro was 0.5 percent lower at $1.1239, a day ahead of the European Central Bank's latest policy meeting. The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 120 yen. \nMETALS: The price of gold edged down $6.20 to $1,133.60 an ounce, silver slipped five cents to $14.66 an ounce and copper rose three cents to $2.33 a pound. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T23:50:54.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
