Ruia and Ravi S. Ruia and their company Essar Teleholding, the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld their trial by the Special CBI court trying 2G scam cases, rejecting their plea that they should instead be tried by a magisterial court.   \"Dismissed their plea and their writ petition,\" said apex court bench of Chief Justice H.L. Dattu, Justice A.K. Sikri and Justice Rohinton F. Nariman in their judgement on Tuesday.   The Essar and Ruias had moved the Supreme Court contending that since they have been charged for cheating under section 420 of IPC and for conspiracy under section 120 B of IPC, therefore they can only be tried by the magisterial court and not by the special CBI court trying cases of the offences punishable under the provisions of prevention of corruption act.
