Financials are a little bit better. 'Will they, or won't they' this week? That's going to be the dominant theme more than anything else,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada.\n\"It looks to us that the markets in next few months will be increasingly volatile, and that volatility will chase a lot of investors to the sidelines.\"\nSuncor Energy Inc was among the bigger drags on the index, falling 1.1 percent to C$33.70. The overall energy group retreated 1 percent, in step with lower crude prices.\nBombardier Inc, which had soared some 58 percent last week after Reuters reported the company rejected an offer by Beijing Infrastructure to acquire a majority or full stake in its rail unit, gave back 10.8 percent to C$1.66 and was another top decliner. The industrials group retreated 0.7 percent.\nAt 11:17 a.m. ET (1517 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index fell 42.94 points, or 0.32 percent, to 13,418.53. Of the index's 10 main groups eight were in negative territory.\nVolatility in commodity prices due to worries over the Chinese economy, currency swings, economic data, inflation and deflation, also added to the market's recent uncertainties.\n\"Until some of these things fall into place, the market will remain volatile,\" said Ing. \"There's been a change in the dynamics, and the market's got to absorb these potentially negative influences.\"\nOther areas weighing on the market included consumer discretionary stocks, which retreated 0.8 percent.\nPartially tempering some of the losses was a 0.2 by financial stocks, which made up half of the top 10 most influential gainers.\nBank of Montreal was up 0.8 percent at C$69.50.\nStronger gold miners also tempered some of the losses within the overall materials group, which was down 0.5 percent. Goldcorp Inc advanced 2.4 percent to C$17.16.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the TSX by 158 to 84, for a 1.88-to-1 ratio on the downside.
