Left behind with no customer support or information on software. Team members at Halfpricesoft.com have never left a customer behind! Our highest priority to Quickbooks customers using ezCheckprinting and virtual printer combo is to ensure that help is always available for the software updates, features, or for problem solving. “Quickbooks customers are never left behind when updates or new features are added to ezCheckprinting and virtual printer combo.” said Dr. Ge, founder of Halfpricesoft.com.\nOnce installed, the Virtual Printer allows customers to export check information from Quicken or QuickBooks and the Virtual Printer software converts the data for use by ezCheckPrinting and the check is printed automatically.
