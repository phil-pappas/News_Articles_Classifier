Announcing his departure as chairman on Tuesday morning, the Board of diversified industrial Bradken noted he'd performed \"ably\" in the job and showed \"sound leadership\". Not an adverb in sight! After 11 years in the job, what does a man have to do for a \"very\" or even an \"extremely\"?!\nGreiner assumed the chair in 2004 when the company was floated by private equity firm CHAMP, of which he was, and remains, deputy chairman. Then the share price was (notwithstanding a severe downturn in mining and related services) $2.40; today it closed at $1.00.\nRemember that in April, Greiner rejected the (second) takeover bid of (CHAMP competitor) Pacific Equity Partners. When PEP put the offer of $2.50 per share to the chairman, he rejected it on the spot. He and the Board knew the view of shareholders (a scattered bunch –there were no substantials on the register), which was that any offer needed to start with a '3'.\nNext, Greiner's mob CHAMP (alongside Sigdo Koppers) rolled in requesting due diligence, and got an exclusive 60-day look up Bradken's skirt, advised by Rothschild – whose Australian advisory board is chaired by… Nick Greiner.\nChile's Sigdo Kippers terminated its joint Bradken bid with CHAMP in April. Liam Driver Sadly though, and yet again, satisfactory terms of union could not be reached. Funny how a good look at this prize asset repeatedly leaves it stranded on the altar.\nGreiner naturally absented himself from every single part of the CHAMP/SK approach to Bradken, so we are pains to point out that his conflict of interest was never in play. Nevertheless, joining the dots is still fun sport. And keeps us all honest, right?\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:03:13.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
