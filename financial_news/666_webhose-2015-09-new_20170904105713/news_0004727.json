There is a drastic change in consumer behaviour and how people are using their mobile devices on-the-move, as part of increasingly busy lifestyles. Customers' expectations about their bank have also changed; they want to manage all their banking offerings on the go. \nPromotions and deals offered by banks have been in the market for a reasonable amount of time. However, customers were not able to use it to its full extent. Locating and tracking deals was a tedious job. Even when you buy a deal, redeeming it using paper coupons would be cumbersome. Similarly tracking and recalling which discount privileges were available at which location was also a hassle. \nThe new RHB Lifestyle mobile app changes the way customers manage and redeem their coupons and deals offered by the bank. Using this innovative app, RHB customers can purchase coupons online and redeem them by scanning the merchant's QR code using their smartphone. RHB customers can also take advantage of deals and privileges using the innovative augmented reality feature to locate nearby deals, ATMs or RHB branches and share deals and coupons instantly via social media. App users can also send and receive gifts between them. The app is available for all RHB bank customers. The bank plans to add online coupon redemption and push notifications in its next release and credit card redemption in the near future. \nAccording to World Bank, Malaysia, with 140 per cent mobile penetration, is leading Indonesia, Thailand and even United States. There are more than 10 million smartphone users in Malaysia. \nRohan Krishnalingam, Group Chief Operations Officer, RHB Banking Group said, \"The app was made possible through the dedication and commitment of the team involved. At RHB, we are passionate about delivering memorable experiences for our customers. Through our commitment to continuously enhancing our customer service experience based on the ever changing needs and demands, we will continue to remain innovative to anticipate and deliver expectations.\" \nSandeep Bagaria, CEO of Tagit said, \"We are very pleased to receive this award with RHB. It was a very collaborative effort between the teams as partners with the aim of delivering a tremendous customer experience and the award is recognition of that. Forward looking banks like RHB are increasingly using mobile technologies to significantly enhance customer engagement and Tagit is privileged to work with them as a strategic digital partner.\" \nCompany logo http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/3653 \nAbout Tagit Tagit is a leading digital solution provider to some of the world's largest banks and enterprises across the globe.
