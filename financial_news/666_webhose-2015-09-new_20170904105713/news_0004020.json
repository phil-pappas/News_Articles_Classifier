Meanwhile, standard SUV sales have climbed to 1.1 million, up 9.2% since the same time in 2012. Even minivans , however, have witness a nearly 14% decline within the last year as they struggle to get to the 400,000-vehicle mark. \nAmid all of this, there's nary a mention of the venerable station wagon. Basically just elongated versions of an automaker's sedan, station wagons started out as modified wood-paneled trucks in the 1930s before eventually shifting to all-steel car bodies in the 1950s. The Ford Country Squire, the Oldsmobile Vista cruiser, the original Chrysler Town & Country and even the Buick Roadmaster held their grip on U.S. families from the 1960s until just around 1984, when Chrysler began producing the first minivans.
