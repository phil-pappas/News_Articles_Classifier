Getty Images Share on twitter by Philip Baker There's a school of thought on some trading desks this week that the sell-off in global sharemarkets is being fuelled by traders focusing on technical levels and charts rather than the economic fundamentals.\nThey argue that the threat of a major slowdown in China's economy is hardly new information, when everyone has also known for quite some time the Federal Reserve is looking to hike interest rates .\nNo, they say, it's all to do with traders sitting at a computer following what their model tells them about tops, bottoms, shoulders, Fibonacci relationships and Elliott wave theory.\nThere is also a fair amount of mob psychology that no doubt dictates short-term market trends.\nWith confidence levels so low it can also be a good time to prey on the fear factor.\nBut once you have a savage sell-off, like the 1000-point drop in the Dow Jones from a week ago, and then a sharp rebound, the charts dictate there is a gap that needs to be filled and so traders are betting that the selling isn't over just yet.\nAnother sign for these technical traders was the narrow rally driving Wall Street earlier this year and a blowout in credit spreads that implied the good times were coming to an end.\nThat may all be true but the basic fundamentals aren't looking good either.\n Take the latest set of national accounts , which showed one of the major reasons the local economy grew at all in the three months to June was spending by the federal government.\nThat seems unlikely to be repeated as the government looks to rein in the budget deficit.\nThe other talking point was the weakest gain in nominal growth since 1961-62.\nAt 1.8 per cent for the 2015 financial year, it was even weaker than what it was in the previous recession in 1991-92, according to Commonwealth Bank's senior economist Michael Workman.\nAs Workman notes, the nominal economy is the \"one we live and pay taxes in\".\nIt all brings rate cuts back on the agenda, and this in turn will help push the Australian dollar lower but it's questionable how effective any rate cut will be now they are so low any way.\nBT Financial Group chief economist Chris Caton said it was always tempting to dismiss GDP figures as \"yesterday's news\", but he also points out \"it is the nation's comprehensive report card\".\nAnd the latest report does show the economy is \"struggling to find new sources of growth to replace the boom in mining capex and in resource prices. There was, sadly, little sign of that replacement growth in today's news\" Caton added.\nIf the economy is struggling then it makes life tough for companies, and if profits are harder to come by then, by definition, the sharemarket should also struggle.\nBut as famed investor Peter Lynch once said: \"If you spend 13 minutes a year trying to predict the economy, you've wasted 10 minutes.\"\nStill, Australia is more exposed to the Chinese economy than any other developed economy, and this is why all sectors of the economy are so worried.\nSo if China does hold the key, what can investors expect?\nStephen Green, the Hong Kong-based economist at Capital Group, reckons during the next decade, it would be reasonable to expect an average annual rate of growth for China of about 7 per cent, in line with the current target.\nHe thinks the growth rate now is probably closer to 3-4 per cent, but any talk of a 2-3 per cent rate during the next few years is \"overly bearish\".\nLike many experts, he is sceptical about the current growth rate target of 7 per cent, which the Chinese government says is being met.\n\"The past two years have been tough. Growth is clearly slowing,\" said Green.\nBut he thinks economic activity will improve slightly during the next six months, compared with the first half of 2015.\n\"Overall, China remains a relatively low-income economy compared to more-developed countries. There is still a lot of catch-up growth that should be relatively easy to achieve,\" said Green.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-09-02T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:07:21.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
