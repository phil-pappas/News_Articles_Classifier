PUBLISHED: 13:36, Fri, Sep 25, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:47, Fri, Sep 25, 2015 GETTY The FTSE was trading up on September 25 \nThe FTSE 100 soared by 2.59 per cent by early afternoon to hover at 6115 after closing deep in the red yesterday. \nChair of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen last night made notably upbeat comments in which she played down the risks of China's slowing economy. \nShe also said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is on track to hike interest rates in 2015. \nThe news provides investors with a degree of certainty with an October or December increase on the cards, and stock markets have reacted favourably to the news. \nHowever, experts have warned the sentiment could change if news from China takes another turn for the worst. \nIn Europe the car sector is also showing signs of recovery after being hammered by the Volkswagen scandal this week, with premier stock markets in Germany and France both on the up this morning. \nAlastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: \"Traders have decided enough is enough and the attractions of cheap European automotive shares outweigh the risks. \"Renault, BMW & Peugeot are all up by more than 4.5 per cent this morning while even Volkswagen has bounced by almost 2 per cent in the first hour of trading. \"It will be interesting to see how long this perception of cheap investment opportunity has greater traction than the unlimited liability of regulatory and litigious costs.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:33:21.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
