Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo rose 1.32 and Sydney added 1.42 percent. Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei were closed for public holidays. \n- Glencore collapses - \nLondon's top faller was mining giant Glencore, whose share price collapsed by almost a fifth after a gloomy broker warning. \nGlencore shares nosedived 19.26 percent to 78.50 pence after Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) warned about the impact of low commodity prices on the group. \nThe company is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand for raw materials. \n\"The challenging environment for mining companies leads us to the question of how much value will be left for equity holders if commodity prices do not improve,\" Investec said in a research note to clients. \n\"If major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) could evaporate.\" \nEarlier this month, Glencore had raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt slashing plan. \nIn Monday morning deals in London Anglo American stock dived 6.20 percent to 576.60 pence. \nOn the upside in London, shares in brewer SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) jumped 3.21 percent to 3,703 pence on reports that Belgian-Brazilian giant AB InBev was set to launch a formal takeover bid. \n- Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) stops Alaskan exploration - \nRoyal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) saw its \"B\" shares drop 0.58 percent to 1,548 pence after the Anglo-Dutch energy giant halted its exploration in Alaska. \nShell said in a statement that its Burger J well in the Chukchi Sea, off the northwest coast of Alaska, had failed to find sufficient amounts of oil and gas. \nThe Anglo-Dutch group began drilling there in July, two months after US President Barack Obama approved Arctic drilling, despite fervent opposition from environmentalists. \nShell, which is also slashing its headcount by 6,500 this year owing to sliding oil prices, described its decision to pull out of Alaska as \"disappointing\" and warned it would take a major financial hit. \nVodafone stock slumped four percent to 208.95 pence after it abandoned talks about an exchange of assets with US pay-TV giant Liberty Global (NasdaqGS: LBTYA - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:43:26.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
