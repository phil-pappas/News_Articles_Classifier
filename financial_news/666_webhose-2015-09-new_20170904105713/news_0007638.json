ADVERTISEMENT The findings come from a working group established by Puerto Rico to help find a path forward through its dire fiscal situation. The commonwealth has been unable to keep up with all its debt payments, and has said it cannot pay off the billions of dollars it currently owes.\nThe fiscal plan laid out by the working group would establish a control board to navigate the island through a host of spending cuts and tax changes. But to get the commonwealth back on good fiscal standing, the group said it needs help from Congress. \nThe report found that Puerto Rico is facing a $27 billion shortfall between fiscal 2016 and 2020 without any changes. And even if the commonwealth adopts all the panel’s recommendations, it warned that the island will still need to save billions more to close the shortfall by renegotiating the terms of its debt with creditors. \nCurrently, Puerto Rico has no clear way to restructure its debt, since the commonwealth is not covered by Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, which applies to U.S. states. \nPuerto Rico’s governor has pushed Congress to change the code to include Puerto Rico, but has been met by resistance from some GOP lawmakers and investors in Puerto Rican debt. The working group pushed for some legal path for restructuring the island’s debt in an orderly fashion. \nPuerto Rico’s economic woes have been driven in large part by demographics, as its population has shrunk and gotten older. A significant number of its population has moved away from the island, often seeking work on the United States mainland. \nThe study said that just 40 percent of Puerto Rico’s population is currently employed or looking for work, compared to 63 percent in the U.S. And the commonwealth’s population has fallen by 6.7 percent over the last eight years, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the U.S. \nTo regain its economic footing, the report said Congress should make a number of legal changes to give Puerto Rico a leg up. For example, it said lawmakers should give Puerto Rico a 10-year waiver from future minimum wage increases for younger workers to promote hiring, and establish a tax credit aimed at boosting economic activity in the commonwealth. \nThe report also pushed for Congress to waive the $300 million limit on annual Medicaid spending currently applied to Puerto Rico, which is a cap not set on states. \nWhile looking to Congress for a helping hand, the report also made a number of tough recommendations for the commonwealth to take on its own, include a shrinking of the government work force and cuts to other public sector subsidies. The report also recommended Puerto Rico pursue a cut to the corporate tax rate to invite business investment, and further work in public-private partnerships to relieve the government’s load for some services.
