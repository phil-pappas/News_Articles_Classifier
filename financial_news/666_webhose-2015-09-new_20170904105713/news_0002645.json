Poor processing and management are major factors, resulting in losses worth up to US$2-$5 billion each year. These losses also have an important gender dimension: women are often mostly involved in fish processing and marketing. This further weakens the economic and nutritional value of fish at household, community, and regional levels. \nIn the Barotse floodplain, Zambia and the Lake Chilwa basin, Malawi, such issues have resulted in substantial economic losses, reduced fish nutrient content, and unfair distribution of benefits among women and men. Both areas depend heavily on fish for income, food, and nutrition. However, they differ in fish value chain structure, post-harvest technologies, and social and cultural contexts, offering strong opportunities for lesson learning and sharing. \nThe research \nWorking with fishing communities in Barotse and Lake Chilwa, and other partners, the project is analyzing fish value chains, including the differing roles of men and women, to understand how losses occur in fish volume, nutrient content, and economic value. \nThe research team is developing and piloting interventions to reduce these losses, while also addressing issues connected to gender and power. These interventions include improved processing methods, such as paraboiling, solar drying, and kilning. Gender training and behaviour change communication activities will address the gender and social relations in the fisheries value chain. Working with policymakers, the team aims to increase recognition of the importance of fish production and gender equality in national and regional policies. \nCreating local markets \nTypically, fish processors in the area preserve their fish through sun-drying or smoking, and small quantities of fish are sold fresh. However, the processing results in the fish becoming very brittle, and easily damaged during transportation. They can also become infested by blowfly, which lay their eggs on the drying fish; in time these hatch into maggots, again destroying the quality and value of the fish. \nThere is no local market for salted fish in Barotse because people are unaware of the methods for desalting the fish in order to make it palatable. To address this, one of the groups involved in the project and traders based in local markets are creating awareness of desalting methods in order to develop the local market, and thereby provide a new outlet for fishermen and processors in the area. \nOne option is to develop packaging for salted fish products which includes desalting instructions; another is to hold demonstrations and taste tests in local markets, as well as raising awareness through radio broadcasts. Another group is investigating the use of solar tents made from plastic sheeting. These have the advantage of protecting the fish from dust and flies during the drying process and speeding up the time for fish to dry. \nAbout Cultivate Africa’s Future Fund (CultiAF) \nCultivate Africa’s Future Fund (CultiAF) is a CA$15 million joint program of the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and Canada’s International Development Research Centre.
