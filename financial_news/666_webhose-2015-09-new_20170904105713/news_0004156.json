The reason for the change is the acquisition by Flamm Walton of The Lamm Group, a group of lawyers presently in Center City, Philadelphia. Flamm Walton is a general business practice firm. The Lamm Group is a creditors’ rights and corporate practice of five lawyers. The combined firm is now 18.Walter Flamm, Chairman of the Firm, said, “the addition of Tony Lamm and his group gives us much greater depth in the corporate area and provides new bankruptcy expertise that we need. Tony’s relationship with the banks in this area is stronger than any lawyer we have seen, and his reputation for service is impeccable.” Lamm has been in the business of protecting lenders for over 30 years. Lamm said, “we wanted to gain the additional momentum and size of Wally’s firm and we could use the seasoned trial lawyers to handle our litigation. This is a great addition to our practice.”The additional name is that of Tom Heimbach, who has been a shareholder in the Firm since 2007. Flamm said “Tom’s name has long deserved to be on the Firm Marquee. He graciously deferred that opportunity when we changed our name in 2010 because we thought that the trend in law firm names was to be shorter, not longer. However, when we brought Tony aboard, it was imperative that his name be added. That disposed of the “short name” idea and Tom gets his name where it should have been all along.” Heimbach heads the Firm’s Lehigh Valley office at 4905 W. Tilghman Street, in Allentown. The Firm handles the labor and employment work for many of the municipalities in the Lehigh Valley and Northeast Pennsylvania, in addition to many large private employers, like St. Luke’s Health System and PPL (now Talen), as well as a large portion of the construction industry. Heimbach said, “with the addition of Tony’s group we now have more ability to offer a broader range of services to our clients. With our very strong labor capabilities, we offer a full range of services to employers that most other law firms do not have.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T06:25:19.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
