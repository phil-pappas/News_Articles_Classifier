Posted: Wednesday, September 23, 2015 9:01 am | Updated: 3:32 am, Thu Sep 24, 2015. Career in Sales Can Satisfy an Entrepreneurial Spirit NewsUSA@NewsUSA.com (NewsUSA) The Bay City Tribune \n( NewsUSA ) - On average, over 533,000 new businesses were started each month in 2014. Clearly, the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, but many Americans are still hesitant to become their own boss. While there are many avenues Americans can take to pursue passions and gain control of their career, one often overlooked possibility is being an independent sales agent. \nIndependent sales agents have the benefit of being able to work autonomously while still being a part of an established organization. Not to mention, these positions usually offer growth potential for income and career advancement. Though there are benefits to this type of work, it is still important for those considering this path to do their own due diligence to ensure that they find the right organization to support. \nAccording to Aflac , the leading provider of voluntary insurance at the work site with more than 74,000 independent sales agents in the U.S., here are some things to look for as you conduct your job search: \n1. Financially strong companies and industry leaders: Just as a house needs a strong foundation, it is helpful to build a career with a strong, stable organization. Working for a company that offers positive brand recognition and trust provides credibility that could otherwise take a lot of time to develop. \n2. Hands-on training and mentorship opportunities: Having the right support and resources is essential for success. When companies offer training and mentorship programs, it means they are invested in their employees. \n3. Recognition awards and bonus programs: There is nothing better than working for a company that celebrates individual achievements. Recognition and bonus programs are two ways to know that hard work will be appreciated and contribute to career advancement. \n4. Future market potential: Selling a product or service people want and need is a must for career advancement, but so is the future market potential. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the job outlook for Insurance Sales Agents is growing at a 10-percent rate from 2012-2022. A market that is growing, or has growth potential, can help ensure your lasting success. \nWith these tips in mind, entrepreneurial job seekers should be on their way to having the freedom to balance work and personal life and set individual goals. For an independent sales agent, there is virtually no limit to what can be achieved. \nLearn more about Aflac's independent sales agent opportunities at www.aflac.com/agents .
