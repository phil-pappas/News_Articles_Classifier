It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's 100 percent of their professional activity,\" lawyer David Dokhan told France Inter radio, adding that his clients had \"no pay slip\" and \"no social protection.\" \nJustice Minister Christiane Taubira \"is keen to act on this issue,\" a ministry spokesman told AFP, adding that an \"action plan\" had already been drawn up, which includes the rapid recruitment of 45 interpreters. \nA ruling is expected early next year to clarify the status of casual hirees and there will be a \"gradual\" move towards payment of social security contributions, he added. \nFrance is wrestling with the dilemma of how to reduce government spending and curb its budget deficit yet maintain its lavish social safety net. \nCutting down on waste and tackling tax avoidance have become big subjects of debate. \nThe changes will have a high cost for state coffers, as well as for ministerial workers whose earnings have been 30 percent higher because of the avoided deductions, according to the report. \nThe increased cost may also discourage recruitment of casual workers, the document said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:33:40.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
