The sector was given a shot in the arm at the March Budget when the Chancellor announced much-needed tax breaks for the oil and gas sector . Manufacturing output fell by 0.5pc in the year to July. \nThe data were released just a day after a report by Oil and Gas UK warned that private investment in the North Sea was forecast to slump by up to £4bn per year through to the end of 2018 as operators slash costs to adapt to lower prices (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:05:39.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
