Photographer Enri Canaj notes that conditions for him are very hard as he has lost his right foot. He started this journey alone. His dream is to reach Germany. At this stage, he has reached Idomeni, Greece. Enri Canaj by Geoff Kitney Enri Canaj says there is only one way to describe the situation on the Greek islands where he has witnessed the arrival of countless numbers of small boats, so dangerously overcrowded that the people on board can't even carry water to quench their thirst during their journey from Turkey.\n\"It's just horrible,\" he says.\nBut he says that there is also just one way to describe the reactions of the people when they scramble ashore at the end of their journeys.\n\"You can really feel the relief they feel when they get out of the boats,\" Canaj says.\nAthens-based Enri Canaj who has been taking photographs of the refugees as they arrive in Greece and trek through the countryside. Enri Canaj \"The first thing they do is thank God. Then they ask for water.\"\nCanaj is an Athens-based freelance photographer who has been an eyewitness to the largest movement of refugees in Europe since the Second World War.\nCanaj has just been to the island of Metiliny, one of the closest to Turkey, and to Mytilene​, the picture-perfect main town on the Island of Lesbos​, where 1000 people are arriving daily.\n\"The situation there is very critical,\" he said.\n \"While I was there, 25 boats reached the coast. Each boat carried between 50 to 60 people. They paid $1000 each to travel from Turkey. But if people pay more money they get on better ships and a smuggler to pilot it, and with these ships the journey is only 20-25 minutes.\n\"Seventy to 80 per cent are from Syria but there are also people from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\"From Syria to Greece, the journey takes at least one month. The toughest time of their journey is crossing the mountains between Iran and Turkey. But I talked to three men who told me their journey from Somalia lasted six months.\"\nTough conditions He said the people from Syria don't have any other choice but to try to escape the war and reaching Europe meant to escape.\n\"Also people from other countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, they are escaping from hard political, social situations too. No job, no services, conflicts, no hope for the future make them leave their countries.\"\nCanaj said that the conditions for the people once they leave their boats and start their journey into Europe are very tough.\n\"The temperatures are very high, even in the morning. When they reach the coast they have to walk about 10 kilometres to reach the first bus station. There are no services for the people, apart the refugee camp which has horrible conditions.\n\"The people coming from Syria I talked to said that many families were separated during their journey escaping Syria. So you could see mothers alone with their children. Their biggest hope is to all be together and reach west Europe.\n\"All want to leave as soon as possible. They want to go to Germany and the Scandinavian countries. But they have to go through Macedonia, and Serbia and Hungary.\n\"I am afraid that in some of the countries they will go through something bad will happen from the police authorities. You can feel their aggression towards the people.\"\nCanaj said he was afraid the situation would get worse and more people would come. Just this day that we talk, he said, 2500 people have arrived on Lesvos. \"But you can't send these people back because they don't have anywhere to go, especially the Syrian people,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/assylum_gallery_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:06:12.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
