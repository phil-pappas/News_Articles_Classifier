Photo: Bloomberg\nThe Federal Reserve just rescued gold from its doldrums.\nThe central bank's decision on Thursday to leave US interest rates unchanged is fuelling debate over the strength of the American economy. That's good news for gold bulls, who have suffered through more than two years of declining prices. The metal climbed to the highest in almost two weeks on renewed demand for a haven.\n\"Interest rates remaining unchanged is a short-term positive for gold, because gold feeds on uncertainty,\" said Christopher Kelly, the New York-based chief executive officer of SDKA International, which trades commodities.\nTrading volume was languishing before this week's Fed meeting, and prices had dropped to near one-month lows. Investors have snubbed precious metals as job growth boosted speculation that the Fed was ready to lift rates, even as inflation remained below the central bank's target. Spot gold declined 5.5 per cent this year as of Wednesday. Higher rates hurt bullion because the commodity doesn't pay interest, unlike some competing assets.\nAdvertisement Gold for immediate delivery climbed 0.9 per cent to $US1130 an ounce at 2.52pm New York time. Prices touched $US1131.72, the highest since September 4.\nThe Fed's resistance to raising rates can \"undermine confidence\" in the economy, Paul Sacks, a portfolio manager at Aurum Options Strategies in New York, said in a telephone interview before the policy statement was released. \"That's bearish for the U.S. dollar, and that's bullish everything denominated in dollars, including gold.\"\nIt's been a tough two years for investors in gold, which first fell into a bear market in April 2013. More than $US52 billion has been wiped since then from the value of global exchange-traded products, or securities that are physically backed by bullion and linked to the price of the metal. Gains in the US job market are showing that the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates and cutting demand for the metal as a haven.\nGold surged 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as central banks increased money supply on an unprecedented scale, spurring concern that inflation would quicken. As of Wednesday, the metal had tumbled more than 40 per cent from a record $US1921.17 reached in 2011 after some investors lost faith in bullion as a store of value.\nThe Fed repeated that it will raise rates when it has seen \"some further improvement in the labour market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium term\", Thursday's policy statement showed.\n\"We can all see the Fed moving at some point,\" Kelly of SDKA said. \"The bottom line is US monetary policy holds more downside risks than upside risks for gold in 2015 and early 2016.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T22:42:58.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
