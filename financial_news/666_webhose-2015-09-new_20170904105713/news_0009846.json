The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.6 percent. \nEasyJet was up 6.3 percent, hitting its highest level since May, after the airline raised its full-year profit outlook to forecast growth of up to 21 percent. \nFollowing a bruising worldwide sell-off last week, UK and European equities are in recovery mode with investors betting monetary policy will stay lower for longer. The FTSE 100 is currently trading at a discount to euro-zone stocks. \n\"EasyJet's numbers were good, this is a good market rebound,\" said Mark Ward, head of execution trading at Sanlam Securities in London. \"Overall sentiment is a bit better today.\" \nMorrison Supermarkets was up 4.8 percent after a report in the Telegraph newspaper signalled South African billionaire Christo Wiese, who recently bought Virgin Active and New Look, is now training his sights on Britain's struggling supermarket industry. \nBattered miners Glencore and Anglo American staged a rebound, rising around 4 percent, even after Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Glencore to 'negative' from 'stable'. \n(Reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by Catherine Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:19:07.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
