One of the officials who backed the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates near zero last week says he’s willing to lift them this year.\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, in a speech Monday, said there were a number of factors that led to “uncertainty” — the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the drop in Chinese stock prices, the reports of slowing in the Chinese economy, the weakness in other emerging-market economies, and the likelihood that the dollar’s strength would weigh on exports and inflation, as well as the renewed decline of oil prices.\n“It’s too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock to the economy or just a nervous spasm in the markets,” he said.\n“I put most of [last week’s] decision weight on prudent risk management around recent and current market volatility. As things settle down, I will be ready for the first policy move on the path to a more normal interest-rate environment. I am confident the much-used phrase ‘later this year’ is still operative,” he said.\nLockhart is now the fourth member of the Fed to speak after the decision. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said “most likely” the right time to start lifting interest rates will arrive this year.\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker explained why he dissented in favor of higher interest rates, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he would have done the same thing if he had a vote, which he will not until 2016.\nMarkets are pricing in just a 14% chance of a rate hike in October.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:33:18.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
