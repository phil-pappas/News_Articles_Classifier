In December last year trading volumes were just 947 lots and open interest just 5,431 lots. \nThen premiums imploded early this year. \nThe CME front-month Midwest premium collapsed from 24.12 cents per lb at the end of January to 8.39 cents at the end of June, not least because the LME had announced a series of ever more stringent warehousing rules, in effect killing off the queue model. \nNot entirely surprisingly, that premium slump was a shot in the arm for the CME premium contract. \nMore surprising, though, is the fact that the subsequent stabilisation of the premium, currently trading at 7.19 cents per pound, has been accompanied by still rising volumes and open interest. \nVolumes in August were 4,555 lots, bringing the year-to-date total to 25,787 lots. Open interest reached a new record high of 19,335 lots, or 483,375 tonnes, at the end of the month. \nPREMIUM COMPETITION \nSo you can see why CME is now looking to replicate that success in Europe, this time linking its product to Metal Bulletin's assessment of the European duty-unpaid premium. \nIt is also stealing a march on the LME, which has itself committed to four new aluminium premium contracts, aimed at exactly the same disgruntled user base as those of CME. \nThe LME contracts, one for the U.S., one for Europe, one for East Asia and one for South-Eastern Asia, are only scheduled to go live on Nov. 23. \nThe CME's version will start trading on Sept 21. \nThe key difference between the two is the fact that while CME's are cash-settled, the LME's are physically settled, allowing delivery of metal in locations without queues, which really means all but two, Detroit and the Dutch port of Vlissingen. \nTo be fair to the LME, the exchange would probably have liked to launch its premium contracts a lot sooner but got bogged down in a legal challenge from Russian producer RUSAL (HKSE: 0486-OL.HK - news ) over its proposed solution to killing off the queues, a prerequisite for formulating the physical delivery options for the premium contracts. \nBut the long and the short of it is that by the end of this year European aluminium players will have two premium contracts to trade. \nHEARTLAND \nMoreover, the CME's latest proposition is symbolically significant. It is taking its competition with the LME into the latter's heartland. \nIf European manufacturers and producers hedge at all, they are likely to be doing so on the LME, with its multiple good delivery points scattered across the region. \nIt is an open secret that the only entities to vote against the HKEx purchase of the LME were German industrial users, who liked the LME just the way it was. \nBut CME has already thrown down a marker of its ambitions to grab a larger slice of the metals trading pie with both its physically-delivered \"all-in\" aluminium contract, launched last year, and a new zinc contract, launched in June 2015. \nThe former is still struggling to build momentum with open interest last month of just 122 lots although low usage does not mean no usage. \nThose volume and open interest figures only tell half the story. Stock movements tell the other half. CME aluminium warehouses have taken in 29,500 tonnes and loaded out 15,400 tonnes of metal so far this year. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) that sort of delivery activity, of course, is dwarfed by that on the LME and many sceptics will hear the echo from that failed COMEX aluminium contract. \nUnless that is, CME is able to tap a new seam of potential users, those who either haven't ever used the LME or those who would like to but are too small to clear the high credit bar for opening an LME account. \nThat might be one reason for the U.S. premium contract's relative success, given a large number of smaller manufacturers in the Midwest who have never hedged their aluminium exposure before and were unlikely to do so on the LME. \nWhich raises the interesting question of whether there are similar players in the European region who might be drawn to the CME's more vanilla trading model. \nTime (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) , as they say, will tell. \nFor now the LME still enjoys a near monopoly on pricing outside of China, barring North American copper. What's changed, though, is the fact that monopoly is no longer undisputed.
