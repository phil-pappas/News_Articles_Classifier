That gives them an unfair advantage and could threaten the stability of the country's financial system, Masrani said.\nMeanwhile, CIBC CEO Victor Dodig has said that reports about technology companies snatching market share away from the banks are overblown.\n\"Will clients move in droves to these new technology platforms to do their lending? I don't think so. It won't happen that quickly,\" Dodig said in an interview following his speech to the Empire Club of Canada in June.\nRoji Oommen, managing director of financial services at CenturyLink, says mammoth institutions like banks tend to be slow to adapt to change.\n\"They're very good at very carefully deploying technology, very slowly and risk adversely, over a multi-year program,\" Oommen said.\n\"In the mobile space, you need to be able to move much quicker. Your customers are being spoiled by Google and Apple and the like, and the expectation is that you need to adapt very quickly.\"\nOommen said that if banks don't improve their online user experience, their ability to sell consumer credit products, car loans and mortgages may become diminished.\n\"To improve customer lifetime profitability, the art of cross-sell is really important,\" Oommen said. \"The risk is that they will be relegated to a segment of the industry where they're handling savings and chequing accounts, which is the low margin stuff.\"\n— Follow @alexposadzki on Twitter.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T03:50:52.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
