Photo: Andrew Meares\nJust over a week ago I rose in the Senate to ask the Coalition government why they weren't acting to stop larger companies, such as the supermarket duopoly, from abusing their market power to hurt small businesses and agricultural producers. I wanted to know what was taking the government so long to accept the recommendation of their own review into competition policy, carried out by Professor Harper, to amend section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act and bring in an 'effects test'.\nAn 'effects test' would allow the ACCC to better distinguish between fair and unfair competition and would stop supermarkets from using their overwhelming market power to further erode competition.\nThe government appears to be crabwalking away from their support for an 'effects test'.\nI asked a simple question of the Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann (who was representing the Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson). I asked him to update the Senate on when his Cabinet was going to bring forward legislation for the Parliament to consider.\nWe are ready to sit down with the government to talk about bringing in sensible measures to protect small businesses. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nI asked him because the Greens have long campaigned for an 'effects test'. We included it as part of a comprehensive small business and competition policy we released at the last election. And if the government was to bring forward decent legislation that supported our position, the Greens would examine it, and if it is up to scratch, we would support it.\nAdvertisement The Small Business Minister had previously said that he was drawing up plans for an effects test because it is in the \"national interest\" and because anti-competitive conduct is \"detrimental to our economy\". Unfortunately the government doesn't seem to be backing this position because when I asked the minister representing him in the Senate, it took a while to get to an answer. In fact rather than leaping at the opportunity to speak about backing small businesses, the minister had to spend some time searching through his notes to check what the current position of the government actually was.\nWhen he did get around to answering, the best he could come up with was, \"That is still subject to very careful consideration by the government to ensure that we make the right decision about the best way forward. As I have indicated in my primary answer, when the government is in a position to make an announcement we will do so.\"\nGreens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. Photo: Andrew Meares\nIn the last three years of me asking Senator Cormann questions during Question Time, I have never seen him tap dance on a question like he did on this occasion.\nThe Greens are showing themselves to be the leading party in promoting the interests of small business over large business. The larger businesses like the supermarket duopoly, Coles and Woolworths, don't just wield an excessive amount of power in the marketplace; they also wield enormous power in the halls of Parliament through their lobbyists. The government appears to be crabwalking away from its support for an 'effects test' while Labor opposes one (despite a rumoured significant disagreement in their party room over this). The duopoly seems to be just as effective at reducing the competition of ideas, as they are in reducing competition among retailers.\nWe shouldn't meekly accept the supermarkets crowding out competition in the marketplace. Our competition laws are what protects us from an American-style society where every caf√© is a Starbucks and every clothing chain is a Walmart. The Australian public strongly believes there is not enough competition in the supermarket sector and they support tougher competition laws that could address abuses of market power. Farmers support this, small businesses like delis and bakeries and butchers support this, even consumer groups like Choice support this.\nIllustration: Kerrie Leishman.\nI don't think an 'effects test' will fix everything but it is a good positive step to redress the imbalance. The Greens will keep fighting against the market power of the supermarket duopoly. We are ready to sit down with the government to talk about bringing in sensible measures to protect small businesses and producers from the excessive powers of big corporations. But from what we have heard from the Finance Minister, I won't be holding my breath.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:43:47.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
