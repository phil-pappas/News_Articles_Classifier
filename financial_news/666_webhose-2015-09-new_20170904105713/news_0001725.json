For the second quarter, same-store sales, a measure of a retailer's health, were down 2% at Gap as a whole. That trend continued in August, during which same store sales again declined 2%. \nThe one exception in Gap's lineup is Old Navy , which posted positive comparable-store sales, likely because shoppers are attracted to the cheaper prices. But for the Gap banner, comparable-store sales were down 6% in the second quarter and 8% in August. At Banana Republic, same-store sales were off 4% in the second quarter, while in August they were down 11%. \nFor Gap, the fix won't be easy. It will require a re-imagining of at least some of its banners, not only in terms of the goods sold, but also the look and feel of the stores under those brands, particularly at Gap and Banana Republic where sales have suffered. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nThe problem is that for too many years -- in this case since about the 1990s -- Gap basically sold the same style of clothing, perhaps tweaked slightly, at each of its brands, only at different price points. It was difficult to tell the difference between a pair of jeans or a T-shirt sold at Old Navy or Gap, or a pair of khakis at Banana Republic versus the Gap. \nInitially, Gap was able to get away with this tactic. But the decline of the traditional enclosed mall, the increase in competition from fast fashion and off-price retailers like TJX' ( TJX ) T.J. Maxx, and more importantly, the Internet, which has helped to transform consumers into Internet-savvy shoppers, have all undermined the conglomerate's business model. \nThe Internet in particular, as one industry executive lamented, has clued shoppers into what things are really going for. So, selling jeans for one price at Old Navy and a similar pair at another price at Gap is easy to detect with a simple Google search. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:11:45.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
