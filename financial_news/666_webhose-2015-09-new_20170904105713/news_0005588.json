Courtesy Custer \nAn accelerator focused on the Internet of Things market has selected startups to participate in its first three-month program. \nInaugural cohort \nSeamless, an accelerator program by Start Garden and based at Start Garden , named last week its of eight startups, which each represent different segments in the market of connecting the physical and digital words together: \nAlsentis, Holland : foundational touch recognition technology operational in any environment \nCosign, New York : direct retail on social networks for everyday consumers \nFriendly, San Ramon, Calif. : coordinated, managed triage healthcare over IP \nHaas, Chicago : globally connected acoustic technology for early detection of emergency vehicles \nHoana, Honolulu : smart, connected hospital bed technology \nNoBot, London : drone robotics technology to be used for service-based industries \nScanalytics, Milwaukee : intelligent floor sensors to monitor foot traffic, analyze consumer behavior and report actionable insights \nTractouch Mobile, Jacksonville, Fla. : embedded Bluetooth Low Energy Vibration Platform with patent pending vibration technologies to transform mobile notifications \nMike Morin, director of Seamless, said the IoT market will become the interface for the cross-section of what matters to a person and where they are. \n“Life is the handoff of people between different environments: home, work, retail, transportation,” Morin said. “Business is not just about the products, but rather how the products solves problems and connects users to a solution.” \nEarly stage entrepreneurs with developed products in the IoT market space seeking new opportunities were eligible to apply to participate in Seamless’ first cohort. \nAfter two rounds of interviews, eight companies were selected from hundreds of applicants from around the world. \nAccelerator program \nThe inaugural cohort accepted in the Seamless accelerator program received $20,000 in seed funding and will have access to more than $400,000 in pro-bono services from a network of resource partners. \nThe services range from financial investment, strategic consulting and mentorship from more than 75 vendors and advisors. \nDuring the three months, each startup will work closely with major enterprises and advisors to build, test and validate the technology, market and business model. \nThe accelerator program is supported by six public and private Seamless Coalition partners: Amway, Steelcase, Meijer, Start Garden, Faurecia, Spectrum Health and Priority Health. \nSeamless said the coalition partners will also have the opportunity to work with emerging technologies and businesses. \nAt least two corporate partners from the Seamless Coalition were required to sponsor a startup for it to participate in the program. \nEnterprise and startups \nDana Lowell, director of advanced business development at Faurecia’s Holland-based xWorks Innovation Center, said the company’s participation in Seamless allows Faurecia to significantly increase the ability to introduce cutting-edge innovations into the automotive industry and connect people’s lives. \n“Innovation is in Faurecia’s DNA and working with startups alongside other enterprises leads to cross-pollination of big ideas in unlikely or unusual applications,” Lowell said. \nJack Thorogood, co-founder and CEO of NoBot, said the U.K.-based startup needed to have a strong presence in the U.S. and a location that had a strong heritage of design, technology and manufacturing. \n“We believe that spot is in Grand Rapids,” Thorogood said. “We are bringing the NoBot prototype into Seamless with the expectation of partnering with Faurecia and others in the consortium to create a ubiquitous technology that makes humans more effective at their work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:33:15.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
