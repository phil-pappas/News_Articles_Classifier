ABC by Tony Walker Malcolm Turnbull hardly needs media training. He has spent his life in the media, one way and another. More perhaps than any other politician he would know what the media giveth it can also taketh away.\nAs Treasurer-in-waiting Scott Morrison found on Ray Hadley's radio show on Friday, Turnbull would be wise not to take for granted his ease of communication with the media – or to believe his own propaganda.\nWriting in The Age at the weekend, advertising man Harold Mitchell had some good advice for the political class when he observed that politicians should never lose sight of scarcity value and authenticity.\n\"Our current leaders seem to want to respond to every microphone and television light like a moth to a flame,\" Mitchell said.\nHandling 2GB talkback host Ray Hadley and his ilk will be a challenging aspect of Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership. The new PM certainly has a tendency to flutter towards the TV cameras.\nNot least of Turnbull's challenges will be managing relations with the right-wing media whose support Tony Abbott counted on to the point where certain shock jocks and newspaper columnists became an arm of the government's propaganda machine.\nTurnbull would be doing himself and his government a favour if he managed his media relationships with greater finesse.\nHe would not need reminding of this, but the blandishments of those who claim to be on \"your side\" can be seductive, especially when you find yourself under siege.\n Abbott encouraged – and was not helped by – an over-the-top campaign against an alleged ABC-Fairfax axis.\nConservative politicians may have valid criticisms of both the ABC and Fairfax, but if the aim of any government is to occupy as much of the middle ground as possible alienating sections of the mainstream media would not seem to be the wisest course.\nAs he surveyed coverage of his bloodless coup last Monday, Turnbull cannot have failed to notice the outraged reaction among the lions of the right-wing media.\nHell had no fury like radio commentators and newspaper columnists scorned, and certainly not those who might have believed they occupied the former prime minister's inner – and as it happened – rapidly shrinking circle.\nOn Sydney radio broadcaster Alan Jones referred to Turnbull as \"Judas\". This was mild compared with fellow broadcaster Ray Hadley who called Turnbull an \"elitist snob\".\nHerald Sun blogger Andrew Bolt was \"appalled\", or at least his readers were.\nJones's lament recalls a robust exchange with Turnbull a year ago in which the two jousted over a dinner held in Canberra involving Clive Palmer and Liberal Party identity Tom Harley.\nJones accused Turnbull of being a troublemaker and told him \"you have no hope of being leader, you've got to get that into your head\".\nTurnbull could be said to have ignored this advice.\nThe new Prime Minister will also be faced with a similar challenge to all his predecessors: how to deal with Rupert Murdoch?\nTurnbull and Murdoch have a difficult relationship. In recent weeks the newspaper proprietor has made no secret of his preference for Abbott, but he is, if nothing else, a pragmatist.\nAs Communications Minister Turnbull had sought to introduce media reforms that would have disadvantaged Foxtel. Murdoch was not pleased, accusing Turnbull of serving the interests of the Nine network.\nThose reforms were shelved. Whether they will be revived now Turnbull is Prime Minister remains to be seen, but in the meantime one of the more intriguing national stories will be how Turnbull manages relations with a news behemoth – and with sulking right-wing commentators.\nHe should remain his own man.\nTony Walker is the AFR's International Editor.
