The report, \"Best Practices for Effective Relocation to Brazil: Guide for Mobility Managers,\" points out that Brazil has seen a large influx of assignment volume in recent years. But, the list of country-specific challenges that companies and their employees must overcome for success there, are noteworthy. According to Cartus, the Top 3 Challenges in Brazil are:\n1. Regulatory issues and government bureaucracy\n2. Security\n3. Cost Control \n\"Regulatory issues can affect timelines for employees relocating to Brazil in a number of key areas, such as visas and shipment of household goods,\" says David Pascoe, Senior Vice President, Client Services at Cartus. \"It's critical for Human Resources and relocation managers to understand the do's and don'ts as this region continues to grow in importance.\" \nIn addition, a successful job transfer to Brazil can hinge on a number of complex cultural issues, and intercultural training plays a key role in helping reduce costly assignment failures.\nCaio Leal, head of Cartus' Brazil office in São Paulo, offers these best practices and intercultural tips for an effective relocation assignment to Brazil:\n4 Intercultural Keys to Success in Brazil\nUnderstand the value of personal relationships. Socializing and displaying an interest in colleagues' family and personal life is seen as a sign of respect and interest, and establishing this kind of personal rapport is key to successful interactions in Brazil.\n\nBe patient. Brazilians' sense of time differs from many Western business cultures; business meetings can start late and include much social conversation as opposed to focusing simply on getting to the point, and negotiations can be lengthy and protracted—mainly because the society is hierarchical, and it may take some time to get the issue at hand in front of the authorized decision-maker.\n\nFormal etiquette and appearance are customary. Dress, table manners, and general etiquette are important in Brazil and typically signal a person's social status. Dress and comportment are more formal than in some Western locations, such as the U.S., and appearing \"too casual\" can have negative repercussions.\n\n\"Face\" is key. Avoid confrontations, criticism, or even questions that can cause someone to appear to \"lose face.\" Indirect communication is often a better approach. The Best Practices for Effective Relocation to Brazil report is the second in a series from Cartus. The company's next report will focus on best practices in Africa.\n\n\nAbout Cartus\nCartus provides trusted guidance to organizations of all types and sizes that require global relocation solutions.
