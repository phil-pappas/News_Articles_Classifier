Beijing's massive money reserves (it is still the largest holder foreign holder of US government debt) currently stand at a healthy $3.6 trillion. For more than two decades, the world's second largest economy has built up a war chest of foreign currency assets to act as a buffer against global headwinds. But the decision on August 11, to tweak its exchange rate regime and engineer the largest single devaluation of the renminbi in 21 years, has bought the question of reserve depletion into sharp relief. Global currency wars: China's devaluation is a peace offering After abandoning its peg with the US dollar in favour of a \"managed float\", authorities have been forced to intervene on a massive scale to prop up the renminbi . This botched devaluation has seen China burn through reserves at an unprecedented pace this summer. Reserves fell by $93.9bn in August, the biggest monthly fall on record and the largest in percentage terms since May 2012. The drain is set to continue for at least the rest of the year. China is gradually shifting towards a more flexible exchange rate but is not yet willing to countenance a significantly weaker renminbi. Where do the reserves come from? According to analysis from UBS, nearly 70pc of China's reserve accumulation between 2005 and 2014 came from the country's mammoth current account surpluses. Total reserves peaked at $4 trillion in August 2014 and have been on a steady decline ever since (see chart above). As for the composition, UBS note that nearly two-thirds (62pc) are held in US dollar assets, with around $1.27 trillion in US treasury bonds. 'Quantitative tightening' In order to defend the value of the renminbi, China has shifted from becoming a net buyer, to a net seller of dollar assets. This has sparked concern that Beijing's actions are having an asphyxiating affect on global credit and liquidity conditions. This phenomena - dubbed \"quantitative tightening\" - is seen as particularly worrying at a time when China can no longer play its role as the driver of global economic prosperity and when the Federal Reserve is finally poised to start normalising monetary policy. Reserve depletion has also been coupled with record levels of capital outflows in the wake of the currency regime shift. Outflows hit an unprecedented $142bn in August, as \"hot money\" has fled the country and ordinary Chinese pull their money out of the financial system to escape the clutches of state capital controls. Is it time to worry? Amid all the market doom around China's prospects, economists remain sanguine and think fears of a dwindling war chest are probably overdone. At $3.6 trillion, Beijing's bumper reserves are enough to continue stabilising the currency as well as covering 20 months of imports of goods and services. All of this at a time when the country is still running a current account surplus of more than $300bn a year, says Tao Wang at UBS. Others note that Beijing's concerted reserve accumulation was designed to tackle exactly the sort of headwinds currently facing the country. Thus it sould hardly come as a shock that the Poliburo is now deploying them for that very purpose. \"The reserves are not useful for anything except to manage the renminbi, so China may as well use them to keep its exchange rate stable in this time of volatility,\" says Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute. Authorities also have plenty of other tools in their armour to fight off tighter monetary conditions. A 1pc cut to the country's main policy tool - the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) - would unleash 1.2-1.3 trillion of renminbi liquidity into the economy, notes Ms Tao. The RRR currently stands at 17.5pc, giving the central bank plenty of room to manoeuvre in order to offset futher liquidity squeezes. As for the impact of China's growth on the rest of the world, the \"QT\" theory, for all its intuitive appeal, has yet to materalise in the form of rising bond yields and higher debt costs in the developed world. China and other emerging markets may now be offoading their foreign currency assets in a bid to manage their respective exchange rates, but these actions are not destined to drive up bond prices, note economists. \"When central banks other than the Federal Reserve sell the dollars they have obtained from selling US Treasurys, those dollars remain circulating within the financial system - and could even end up reinvested in US Treasurys,\" note Fitch Ratings. This recycling process should then mitigate the impact of emerging market central bank actions. Thus for all the valid concerns about the real state of Chinese growth, its opaque market mechanisms, and the actions of a panicked and discredited Politburo, the implications of its shrinking war chest should not yet raise alarm bells for the world.
