Mike Newbould, the managing director, remains a minority shareholder and becomes interim chief executive. \nFormer investor Business Growth Fund (BGF), which acquired 20pc of York Mailing for £10m in 2013, has partially exited the business. This is the first exit for the £2.5bn fund , which is backed by Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , HSBC, Lloyds, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) . \n“This is a milestone for us,” said Stephen Welton, chief executive of BGF. “We’ve invested in over 100 companies and this is the first cash exit. \n“This deal shows that businesses don’t have a finite life, they go on, they change. We’re excited that the first phase with York Mailing has been very successful, and we’ve made a good return, but the business is now even stronger and the next tier of management have the opportunity to put their stamp on it, and we’re still involved.” \nBGF’s investment allowed York Mailing to buy new equipment to increase profitability, and to make a strategic acquisition. Turnover has since increased from £65m to £101m, and the company is forecasting 10pc growth this financial year and a 30pc increase in profit before tax and other considerations. \nYork Mailing is now the largest supplier of printed materials to the UK retail industry, producing catalogues for Boden and The White Company, direct mail for Sainsbury’s Clubcard holders and leaflets for all the major supermarkets. \nMr Ingram said that by allowing senior management to receive equity in the business, this growth trajectory was assured. “It’s a good way of ensuring that the business will progress at a good rate,” he said. “We’re delighted to be supporting their ambitions.” \n“BGF was an unproven concept and there was a lot of scepticism when we launched,” said Mr Welton. “Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , We’ve invested £600m, and we’re seeing exits, and good returns, we can prove the model is working.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:57:25.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
