Have to remain watchful.”\nRating agency Icra’s senior economist Aditi Nayar said the improvement in CAD will bolster the rupee if there is a drop in sentiments related to emerging market currencies once the US Federal Reserve hikes rates.\nShe added: “Lower CAD largely reflects the lower net outflow of primary income. The benefit of the steep reduction in crude prices was offset by higher imports of other items and a decline in exports.”\nThe central bank further said that higher net earnings through services and lower outflow on account of primary income, which includes profit, dividend and interest, also aided in the narrowing of the current account gap.\nThere was a “marginal drop” in private transfer receipts, which primarily includes remittances by the diaspora, to USD 16.2 billion, for the reporting period, the RBI said.\nThe net foreign direct investment inflows were up at USD 10.2 billion for the April-June period, as against USD 7.9 billion for the year-ago period, the central bank said.\nThe portfolio flows stood at a negative USD 2.3 billion for the period as against inflows of USD 12.4 billion a year ago, the RBI said, adding that this was almost entirely in the debt segment.\nThe NRI deposits more than doubled to USD 5.9 billion on a year-on-year basis, it said.\nNet loans availed by banks witnessed an inflow of USD 5.4 billion, mainly on account of a fall in foreign currency assets held abroad by banks, the RBI said.\nFirst Published on September 11, 2015 7:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:09:22.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
