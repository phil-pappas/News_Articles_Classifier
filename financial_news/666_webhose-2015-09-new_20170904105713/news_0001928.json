( MainStreet ) â€“ Back in April, we told you that craft beer would be unrecognizable by 2020 . That process has begun, whether the industry is ready for it or not. \nWithin the last month alone, the SABMiller and MolsonCoors joint venture MillerCoors bought two-year-old San Diego brewery Saint Archer. Prior to that, it hadn't made an acquisition since buying Crispin Cider in 2012 and hadn't bought a craft brewer since picking up Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company in 1988 -- before MillerCoors and before SABMiller, when Miller Brewing Company stood alone in Milwaukee. \nIn a far larger deal, Heineken NV took a 50% stake in Petaluma, Calif., brewer Lagunitas. The 22-year-old brewer produced 600,000 barrels last year, making it the eleventh-largest brewery in the country and the sixth largest craft brewer, according to the Brewers Association craft beer industry group. Lagunitas had opened a new brewery in Chicago and planned a second brewery in California, but the influx of Heineken cash was only surprising because of founder Tony Magee's previous criticism of other acquired brewers.
