With these seven centres, we hope to recycle at least 80 kg of gold jewellery. Our objective is to recycle 200 kg by next fiscal year end,\" Muthoot Fincorp executive director Thomas Muthoot told PTI.\nAs per the World Gold Council , gold recycling is very low in the country with about a paltry 0.5 per cent of total stock of gold of around 22,000 tonne recycled annually.\nKeyur Shah , chief executive of Muthoot Precious Metals , an arm of Muthoot Fincorp, said most of the 45 kg of recycling has been done at the Coimbatore centre, which was set up six months ago.\nThe Chennai and Delhi centres are just two months old.\nOn an average, each customer brings in 40 grams of jewellery, he added.\nShah said the company does not refine gold bars but gets its done through Infinium Precious Resources, a Mumbai-based bullion refiner. They also have a tie-up for technical training.\nExplaining the rationale, Muthoot said, the Gold Points recycle gold jewellery into bars at a nominal cost and the entire process is transparent.\nUnorganised players, who dominate the market, deduct 10-15 per cent of the weight as processing charges and don't disclose the buy-back price, while Gold Points charge only a flat 2 per cent of the jewellery as processing fee and return or buy-back hallmark purity gold bars (99.6 per cent purity).\nHe, however, was quick to add that the company does not certify the purity as it is not permitted to do so.\nMuthoot said the company has applied for certification permission to the government and an answer is awaited.\nHe said if the government wants to make this scheme successful, it has to take private players into confidence as the 350 BIS-authorised hallmarking centres cannot take the load if the scheme becomes a success.\nShah said that around 2,000 tonnes of gold jewellery is recycled in the country annually, out of the 2,50,000 tonnes non-fungible gold. But all this recycling is done by the unorganised players.\nAiming to monetise a portion of the idling 22,000 tonnes gold jewellery, government has launched a monetisation scheme offering tax-free treatment to any such bullion deposits provided they are hallmarked and anyone can open a gold savings account in a bank for a minimum period of one year and earn tax-free interest in either cash or gold units.\nThough the plan is ambitious, industry isn't enthused as the draft gold monetisation scheme lacks finer details.\nMuthoot Fincorp is the first organised player to enter the gold recycling business which is expected to cut down the gold imports and reduce the current account deficit.\nGold Points will buy scrap, old and used gold items directly from customers and reprocess, refine and supply refined bars.\n\"Gold recycling is the most crucial element to keep the supply-demand balance. But it has been falling to lower levels across the world. Statistics show that it fell to 26 per cent of total global gold supply in 2014 from 42 per cent in 2009. Being the largest gold importer, recycling is highly decisive to save forex reserves,\" Shah said.\nChirag Mehta, a fund manager at Quantum AMC, had in a note said that though there were several gold monetisation schemes in the past, none were successful due to low interest rates and the mandated higher quantity of 500 grams.\nAnother negative, Mehta had said, was the liberty given to banks to set interest rate as they can now lease gold for as low as 1 per cent or even less as the lease rates are linked to prevailing global gold prices.\nIf the banks can get gold to lease at such lower rates there's little incentive for them to offer higher rates, Mehta had said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:47:07.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
