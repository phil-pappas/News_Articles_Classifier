Arcade games seller Playnation bought by Dutch rival By Marion Dakers | Telegraph – 1 hour 44 minutes ago 0.00 \nRuncorn-based firm sells penny slot machines and toy crane games \nPlaynation, whose arcade games can be found lighting up motorway service stations and holiday parks across the country, is being taken over by a larger Dutch rival two years after a management buyout. \nThe Runcorn-based Playnation supplies slot machines, air hockey tables and toy cranes to 1,700 sites including Luton Airport and every Welcome Break service station. \nAfter bringing in the Pets at Home (LSE: PETS.L - news ) founder Anthony Preston as chairman , the firm also added pet tag engraving machines to its repertoire. Several small acquisitions have also helped the company expand since the buyout. \nThe firm split off from Inspired Gaming in 2013 but can trace its roots back to the leisure conglomerate Bass, a part of Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) that owned 3,000 pubs and restaurants and Gala Coral. \nPalatine Private Equity backed a management buyout two years ago but is now close to agreeing to sell to Novomatic, one of the world’s biggest gaming companies. \n“Since our investment in Playnation we have seen the business achieve exceptional growth in the family entertainment sector, capitalising on the buoyant market conditions,\" said Beth Houghton, investment director at Palatine Private Equity. \n\"With the business now at a point in its growth cycle where an international buyer can take it onto the next stage, Novomatic is the perfect strategic partner to help achieve Playnation’s long-term objectives.\" \nThe size of the deal has not been announced, but Palatine has made a return worth 2.5 times its original investment. \nNovomatic will gain entry to more family entertainment venues through the acquisition. Playnation’s 20,000 gaming machines can be found everywhere from Pontins and Butlins holiday parks to Welcome Break and Moto service stations. \nThe Dutch firm recently posted half-year revenues of €988m. Playnation is a smaller venture, reporting revenues of £32m and pre-tax profits of £2.6m in the year to March 2014, according to its most recent accounts. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) employs more than 800 people, primarily in jobs selling, installing and maintaining the machines. \nThe deal is the latest move in the British leisure market after the merger of Park Resorts and Parkdean earlier this month and The Original Bowling Company’s M&A-driven expansion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:45:51.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
