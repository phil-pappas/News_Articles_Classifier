McEwan plans to return capital to shareholders from early 2017, using funds generated from asset disposals as the bank focuses on U.K. and Irish consumer lending.\nMcEwan said RBS could follow American International Group Inc., which bought shares to help cut the U.S. government’s stake after requiring a bailout in 2008. The U.K. owns 72.9 percent of RBS.\n“You’ve seen very good examples of that in the marketplace,” McEwan said. “AIG did the same, where the government sold out, and that worked very successfully for all parties.”\nRBS shares gained as much as 1.9 percent as other major U.K. lenders declined. The stock was up 0.6 percent to 311.3 pence at 10:45 a.m. in London trading for a loss of 21 percent this year.\nThe CEO said RBS is on-course to reduce costs by about 850 million pounds in 2015. That would exceed a target given in July by 50 million pounds because of the bank levy, according to McEwan. The bank is “on-track to deliver” all of its targets and is making “great progress” reducing assets, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:33:45.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
