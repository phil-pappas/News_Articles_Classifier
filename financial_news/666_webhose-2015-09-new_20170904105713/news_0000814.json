Apple customers report devices crashing on iOS 9 update Facebook woos journalist with news gathering tool 'Signal' Microblogging website Twitter on Tuesday said it was launching a new feature called Highlights on the Android platform.\nThe new feature, which will support over 35 languages, will enable users to see a summary of Twitter activities based on their earlier set preferences and relevance in turn saving time and effort to go through the whole timeline or jump from one page to the other.\n“While your home timeline is a great place to browse and engage with Tweets, we know it can be challenging to find the time to get through everything you’d like to see. No matter how much time you spend with Twitter, we want you to get the most out of using it,” Volodymyr Zhabiuk, senior software engineer at Twitter, wrote in a blog post.\n“To create your Highlights, we look at things like the accounts and conversations that are popular among people you follow, tweets from people you’re closely tied to, topics and events that are trending in your area or within your network, and people that are popular or trending among people you follow,” he explained.\nThe users will get a notification as soon as the Highlights are ready via phone.\n“We’re rolling out this experience on Android first and will consider bringing Highlights to other platforms in the future,” Zhabiuk added.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 9:29 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T12:08:35.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
