McDonald's takes reservations in Sweden AFP â€“ 6 minutes ago View Photo \n\nFast-food giant McDonald's may be slowing down, with the hamburger chain starting to take reservations and providing table service at dinner time in a revolutionary experiment in Sweden. \nThe Scandinavian country is the first place the US hamburger king is testing this new way of serving customers. \nMcDonald's has 36,000 restaurants worldwide, but the testing of reserved dining is taking place in just 31 Swedish outlets for a week starting Friday. \nBurger lovers can book a table online at a Swedish website that offers that service for many restaurants -- in many price ranges -- around the country. The McDonald's customer will have to order at least two items from the menu for one to four people. \nThe home of the Big Mac is testing reservations and table service in a country that has been a difficult market.

There is no longer a difference between table service restaurants and fast-food restaurants, and McDonald's has joined this movement,\" he added. \nMcDonald's in its statement did not specify the goals of the experiment in table dining, but it has launched a major publicity campaign to let Swedes know they make a reservation to dine on their Big Mac and fries (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:47:27.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
