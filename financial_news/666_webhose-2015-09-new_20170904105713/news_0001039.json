Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Business has urged Malcolm Turnbull and his new Employment Minister Michaelia Cash to aggressively advocate for workplace relations policy changes in the lead up to the next election, accusing the Tony Abbott-led Coalition of being too timid in pushing for industrial relations reform.\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willoxâ€‹ will call on the Prime Minister and Senator Cash to \"change tack\" from the Coalition's \"modest\" workplace agenda and seek to get voter support for wide changes to the Fair Work Act after the next federal election.\nMr Willox said the government should back the recommendations of the Productivity Commission's workplace relations framework inquiry and the Royal Commission on Trade Union Governance and Corruption which are both due at the end of the year.\n\"It is crucial that the government does not take the easy way out in an election year and rule out all the significant changes that would benefit employers,\" he said.\nMr Willox said the government should support the Productivity Commission's recommendations to cut Sunday penalty rates in select industries, expand individual flexibility arrangements, introduce enterprise contracts and change unfair dismissal laws.\nWhile these changes would not be introduced until after the election, he said the government should move now to implement changes recommended by the Harper review into competition policy.\nHe said a bill backing recommendations to impose higher penalties for secondary boycotts and changes to sections 45E and 45EA of the Competition and Consumer Act should be introduced into parliament.\nThe government should also get involved in test cases before the Fair Work Commission and the courts.\n \"It is very important that Prime Minister Turnbull and Employment Minister Cash get on the front foot and play a leading role in the community debate about what legislative changes would be worthwhile to deliver a workplace relations system which is consistent with the needs of 21st century workplaces.\n\"There is about 12 months to go before the federal election is due and we cannot afford another wasted year. This year should be used to deliver some worthwhile workplace relations changes, through legislative amendments and several other means, whilst educating the community about why more comprehensive, structural changes need to be implemented during the next term of government.\"\nMr Willox said unions would have the incentive to keep going with \"their repetitious WorkChoices slogans, like some kind of a tiresome parrot, for so long as the federal government responds by being intimidated into taking a back seat in the community debate\".\nACTU president Ged Kearney said on Monday that the peak union body would seek a meeting with Senator Cash to discuss a range of policies including protection of jobs, rights at work, and penalty rates.\n\"We urge the new cabinet under Malcolm Turnbull to act to protect jobs and by extension drive down what has become a stubbornly high unemployment rate,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:49:30.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
