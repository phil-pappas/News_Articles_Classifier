CNN has partnered with Pivit to bring you a political prediction market and that data indicates the last debate produced a seismic shift in the odds.”\nThe new feature isn’t a poll, but rather something of a political predictions stock market fueled by CNN’s audience.\nPivit is a Web and mobile application created by the founders of Intrade, the event-based service that shuttered trading in 2013. Unlike Intrade, which closed after acknowledging financial irregularities , Pivit users aren’t wagering money — just the prestige that comes with topping a leaderboard.\nPivit asks players whether they think a candidate’s chances at winning will go up or down. At the start of the debate, for example, Pivit’s market gave Donald Trump 20% odds of winning the Republican nomination. By the end of the debate, that fell to 12%. Marco Rubio swung from 9% to 15%, while Ben Carson dropped from 19% to 15%. Bettors that guessed ups and downs correctly accumulated points.\nUsers can also guess the odds of other political events, like whether Vice President Joe Biden will announce a Democratic run or whether the Republicans will retain a Senate majority.\nCo-founder Greg DePetris said that Pivit, a product of Binary Event Network Inc., is essentially an options market simplified for mass use. The result is a marketplace that creates a “real-time measure of public sentiment.” Mr. DePetris said that while money can be an incentive for trading — as it was for Intrade — Pivit users are just “super interested in the topics.”\n“It’s FiveThirtyEight with a public component,” said CNN Politics and CNN Money Vice President Ed O’Keefe, referring to Nate Silver’s well-known statistical analysis site, which is owned by ESPN.\nCNN may eventually offer prizes, such as inviting the top three players to the next debate, Mr. O’Keefe said.\nPivit users sign up with their Facebook or Twitter account or an email address. Mr. DePetris said Pivit may in the future parse user data to determine the demographic and geographic makeup of people betting on a certain outcome, but that “everything will be aggregated and anonymized.”\nCNN gave Pivit a test drive during the 2014 midterm election in a handful of races and decided to use the service through the 2016 contest. No money is changing hands, CNN said, but the news network gets Pivit’s technology while Pivit receives the marketing value that comes with CNN’s brand name.\nThe deal comes as traditional TV companies invest in new ways to draw in users to their digital platforms. CNN promoted Pivit heavily though its social media accounts last night.\nAn average of 22.9 million people tuned in for the debate , according to early estimates from Nielsen given to CNN.\nMr. O’Keefe said CNN may use Pivit differently in the future, such as guessing on whether legislative deals will pass. CNN declined to comment on how many users Pivit had during the debate.\nThe network is also selling sponsorships for the predictions market. Transportation company Norfolk Southern is the current sponsor for six weeks, but Mr. O’Keefe said other sponsors may join on down the road.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/predict", "http://www.snappytv.com/tc/823388"], "published": "2015-09-18T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:12:38.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
