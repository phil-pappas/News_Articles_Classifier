It also uses ports in other neighbours Ghana and Togo.\n\"We have invested around €30m to acquire trains, including six received today,\" Lionel Labarre, director of Bollore Africa Logistics, said on Wednesday.\n\"We are still waiting for nine locomotives that will add to the 20 that are already in service,\" he said, adding that Bollore would also develop the station in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s main city.\nTrains take about 36 hours to do the 1,260km journey between Abidjan and Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, and carriages are often packed with people, trade goods and animals being carried to market.\nBilateral trade between Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast hit 290-billion Central African francs ($495m) in 2014, up from 165-billion in 2011, Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said at a ceremony to mark the arrival of the six new engines.\nMost of the trade runs via rail and road links. Cargo traffic between the two countries stood at 610,000-tonnes last year, up from 402,000-tonnes in 2011, Mr Duncan said.\nDeveloping the rail line is a strategic priority for Ivory Coast and a tool for regional integration, said Mr Duncan, adding that the country was aiming for 2-million passengers a year in the next few years up from 300,000 now.\nBollore has operated the Ivory Coast-Burkina Faso railway since 1995 and has recently been awarded a concession for a rail link between Niger, Benin and Togo.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:29:45.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
