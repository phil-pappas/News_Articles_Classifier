Germany's DAX hit a record high of 12,390.75 points in April but is now some 24 percent below those levels.\nThe DAX and other world stock markets have lost ground in the past few months partly due to signs of a slowdown in China, which has also hit the commodity sector as China is a major consumer of metals and oil.\nThe prolonged fall in metals prices has been one of the reasons behind Glencore's stock market slump.\nU.S. bank Citigroup said Glencore should even consider going private via a management buyout if the market pounding continued, and kept a \"buy\" rating on Glencore shares.\nThe STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index was the biggest sectoral faller, dropping 1.6 percent after U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech stocks fell overnight.\nThe U.S. biotech sector was hit after U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Monday attacked \"massive\" price increases of two heart drugs from Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\nIn Europe, British healthcare group Shire was down by 3.8 percent while Switzerland's BB Biotech retreated 2.6 percent.\n\"The momentum is to the downside for those biotech stocks,\" said Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities.\nBuilding supplier Wolseley fell 12 percent after lowering its second half revenue growth forecast, saying it expected markets in North America and Britain to remain challenging.\nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by Tom Heneghan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:24:54.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
