US private-sector employment gains accelerated slightly last month, ADP revealed. Employers added 190,000 jobs in August, while July's was revised down to 177,000 from a prior estimate of 185,000. Analysts had expected a reading of 200,000. \n\"We are certainly still in a place where bad news is seen as good news owing to the impact it has upon rate hike expectations,\" said IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) analyst Joshua Mahony. \"I expect a September rate hike to be highly unlikely given the Chinese economic slowdown and subsequent market volatility.\" Separately, US factory orders climbed 0.4% in July to mark the second consecutive month of growth, according to figures released by the Commerce Department. July's gain was short of the 0.9% hike analysts had expected. June's figures were upwardly revised to show a 2.2% increase compared with the 1.8% rise that was initially reported. \nBack on home soil, the purchasing managers' index for UK construction climbed to 57.3 last month from 57.1 in July, missing forecasts for a reading of 57.5m, Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) /CIPS revealed. However, it remained comfortably above the 50 level that signals expansion in the sector. \n\"The construction sector picked itself up a little more this month as overall activity stepped up,\" said David Noble, chief executive of CIPS. \"Housing remained the strongest driver of growth in addition some reported new impetus in the commercial sector.\" Among companies, industrial equipment rental firm Ashtead was the standout gainer after it posted better-than-expected first quarter pre-tax profits of Â£155m, up 23%, driven by solid revenue growth in the US and UK. \nHikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) was up after Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) lifted its price target on the stock to 2,760p from 2,050p.The bank said Hikma has transformed its US exposure and long-term visibility through the $2.65bn acquisition of US specialty generics company Roxane. \nSatellite telecoms group Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) continued to rally following the successful launch into orbit of its I-5 F3 Global Xpress satellite. \nChip maker ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) jumped after JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'underweight' and kept its price target at 850p. \nAstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) also got a boost from a broker note, as HSBC lifted its stance on the pharmaceuticals giant to 'buy' from 'hold' on share price weakness and ahead of oncology news flow. \nBritish Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group advanced after announcing that its offer for Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) is closed and it now controls 98.05% of the Irish carrier On the downside, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) slid as metals prices declined across the board with the exception of tin, while BP and Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) dropped amid extreme volatility in oil markets. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,062.67 +0.66% FTSE 100 6,083.31 +0.41% FTSE 250 16,885.73 +0.27% FTSE 100 - Risers Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 988.00p +7.74% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK) 2,322.00p +4.36% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 998.50p +3.31% 3i Group (III) 472.70p +2.94% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 542.50p +2.75% Mondi (MNDI) 1,455.00p +2.68% Coca-Cola HBC AG (CDI) (CCH) 1,314.00p +2.58% ITV (ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) ) 245.10p +2.55% Intu Properties (Other OTC: CCRGF - news ) (INTU (Swiss: OXIGTU.SW - news ) ) 322.80p +2.48% Capita (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) 1,225.00p +2.42% FTSE 100 - Fallers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 122.80p -8.02% Randgold Resources Ltd.
