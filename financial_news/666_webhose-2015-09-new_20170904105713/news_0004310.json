( GRZ.V ) ( GDRZF ) (“Gold Reserve” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce an agreement in principle with its largest noteholders representing 88% of its currently outstanding convertible notes (“Modified Notes”) to issue up to US $12.3 million of new convertible notes (“New Notes”) due December 31, 2018 and modify, amend and extend the maturity date of its US $44 million outstanding principal and accrued interest amount of previously modified notes (“Old Notes”) from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2018. The terms are binding subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval and negotiation and entry into definitive documents. The Company will issue the US $12.3 million New Notes with an original issue discount of 2.5% of the principal amount and will also issue New Notes representing 2.5% of the principal and interest amount to the current holders of the Modified Notes being extended as a restructuring fee. \nThe New Notes and the Modified Notes (as amended from the date of closing) (collectively the “Notes”) will bear interest at a rate of 11% per year, which interest will be paid in kind quarterly and will accrue and be payable in cash at maturity. The Notes will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into 333.33 of Class A common shares per US $1,000 (equivalent to a conversion price of US $3.00 per common share, an 11% premium to the current price) at any time upon prior written notice to the Company. \nThe Notes will be senior obligations of the Company, secured by all assets of the Company and subject to certain other terms including restrictions regarding the pledging of assets and incurrence of certain capital expenditures or additional indebtedness without consent of noteholders; and participation rights in future equity or debt financing. The transaction is expected to be completed in September 2015. \nDoug Belanger, President, stated, “We appreciate the continued support of our shareholders and noteholders during the arbitration and now the collection process. Extending the maturity of the notes and raising additional funds will allow the Company to aggressively pursue the collection process through to its full conclusion.” \nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable U.S. federal securities laws and state Gold Reserve's and its management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions for the future including without limitation statements with respect to the proposed issuance of the New Notes, modification of the Old Notes, and the arbitration proceedings.
