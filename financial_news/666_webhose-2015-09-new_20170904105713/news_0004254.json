According to Sky News , Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) has in recent weeks accelerated plans to offload a portfolio including Blossom Hill and Piat d'Or, with Australian wine producer Treasury Wine Estates in the frame to acquire the brands. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited sources as saying that a deal could be announced by Diageo in October, although they warned that a transaction had not yet been signed with Treasury and that it could still fall through. \nSince the company began sounding out potential bidders earlier in the year, several other parties have expressed interest in buying the business. \nA Diageo spokesman told Sky News on Wednesday: \"Wine is a small part of our business but it plays an important role. \n\"We have no other comment to make.\" At 1208 BST, Diageo shares were up 2.7% at 1,763.51p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:15:04.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
