Clint Hughes Share on twitter by John Stensholt Fox Sports will this week launch a new app featuring some live coverage, video news, fixtures and scores across all sports, in a move it says will cut into the audiences of fast-growing official websites of major sports like the AFL and NRL.\nThe app will offer a live stream of the Fox Sports News channel for free, which packages game highlights and breaking news items. It will also integrate live statistics and analysis into live digital coverage of matches, and enable fans of sports including English Premier League and A-League soccer and rugby union to watch full match replays via the app.\nThe app will not include live streaming of either the AFL and NRL, as the digital rights for both are currently held by Telstra.\nFox Sports chief executive Patrick Delany said the app, which will be available later in the week on both Apple and Android platforms and via the Apple Watch, would show as many clips and highlights as possible during live matches.\nFans of The Wallabies and other rugby union teams will be able to watch games through the new app. Getty Images The ability to watch match replays via the app, will also head off potential competition with sports wanting to sell replays to fast-growing streaming video on demand (SVOD) companies such as Netflix and Apple TV.\nAttacking digital rivals \"This is designed to take on afl.com, nrl.com and other general sports sites like The Roar,\" Mr Delany said.\n\"When it comes to the live matches we will still push people towards Foxtel and the Foxtel Go app. But we are utilising our power in video, where we have 15 people cutting up video already, and our journalism capabilities, where have have already hired more people to provide content to our website.\"\n Existing subscribers to Foxtel and News Corp digital subscribers will have free access to the entire app (Fox Sports is wholly owned by News Corp), with premium content also available for $4.99 per week for other customers on a Fox Sports digital pass.\nContent by News Corp journalists is already available on the Fox Sports website, which will now also be on the app, along with highlights of popular overseas sports such as the English Premier League, motorsport like Formula 1 and MotoGP, tennis and golf.\nMr Delany said it would incorporate seven separate apps Fox Sports had previously developed for individual sports.\n\"When we had a look we found there's 7.5 million sports fans in Australia and a lot of them actually follow three to four sports closely, not just one. So this is to cater for that. There will 14 sports and 214 [sporting] competitions covered by this app.\"\nThe app has been developed by French company Netco Sports, owned by broadcasting facilities and services provider Euro Media Group, and will incorporate statistics provided by Fox's wholly-owned Sport by Numbers.\nUsers will also be able to personalise the app according to the way they like to follow particular sports and sporting teams by customising the layout to suit their preferences. Delany said users will also get alerts depending on score changes, whether games are close or if favourite players are involved.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-09-14T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:02:22.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
