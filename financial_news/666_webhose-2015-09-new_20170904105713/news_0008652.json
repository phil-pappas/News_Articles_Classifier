The strip, once known for its glittering nightclub scene has seen a wave of residential development after strict new licensing laws were introduced by the state government several years ago.\nCentennial Property Group a low-profile Sydney-based group, saw the property as an attractive investment, especially given the predicted jump in population growth in the area.\nThe sale was managed by CBRE's Nicholas Heaton and Xavier Rahmeâ€‹ on behalf of a private investor, The Bayswater Road property, which was sold to Centennial post-auction includes three shops and 27 studio apartments and will show an initial yield of about 5.5 per cent.\n\"The changing demographic in King Cross and surrounding areas due to the lock-out laws has resulted in more buyers actively looking to invest in the area,\" Mr Heaton said.\nPremium possible for blocks \"This is the fourth block of apartments we have sold in as many months with more in the pipeline. Traditionally sold down individually, vendors are choosing to sell apartment blocks in one line and are now achieving retail prices, if not a premium.\"\nCentennial could also strata-title the block and sell the units individually at some time in the future.\n Earlier this month Ramsay Property Group bought an apartment building in Annandale, with 74 units, for $37 million through CBRE.\nThe results are prompting more owners to sell. Mr Heaton said CBRE is now marketing a block of eight apartments in Campsie and 10 apartments in Petersham that are drawing similar interest from buyers wanting to be a part of Sydney's rental and capital growth story.\nCentennial tends to look for assets with value-add opportunity. Last year it bought the North Sydney office building, 132 Arthur Street, from Valad Property Group for $37 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:12:28.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
