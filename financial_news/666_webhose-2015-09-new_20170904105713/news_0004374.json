Other field partners are Suncor Energy Inc and Britain's BG Group, which is being bought by Royal Dutch Shell.\nLast year, production averaged about 154,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to UK government data. So far this year, average output has come up to about 168,000 bpd thanks in part to fewer outages, the sources said.\n\"Production has been pretty stable all year,\" said an industry source. \"The field is doing well.\"\nBuzzard pumps less than 0.2 percent of daily world oil supply but it is the largest field contributing to Forties blend, the most important of the four North Sea crude grades underpinning the Brent benchmark.\nThis location, at the centre of the benchmark used to price two thirds of he world's oil, gives the field a bigger impact on pricing than its size would otherwise justify.\nIn 2014, Reuters reported on at least six unplanned shutdowns or production glitches at Buzzard. So far this year, only one outage has been reported and a planned shutdown is scheduled for October.\nMore reliable output is helping lead to more stable exports of Forties crude blend, in contrast to 2014 when cargoes often faced delays in their loading dates.\nNexen in early 2014 said it was targeting improved reliability at Buzzard and detailed steps it had taken in order to achieve this, such as improving the information available to workers in the field's control room.\nThe company declined to comment on Buzzard's performance on Tuesday.
