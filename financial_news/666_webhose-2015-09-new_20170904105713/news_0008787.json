Andrew Meares by John Kerin Prime Minister Tony Abbott has rebuffed calls from Pacific Island leaders for Australia to adopt a tougher stance on climate change and ban new coal mines to help avoid catastrophic changes in sea levels.\nLeaders of some of the tiny Pacific nations speaking before the Pacific Islands Forum in Port Moresby, which started on Thursday, said limiting the effects of climate changes was vital to their survival, with one suggesting Australia could be ejected from the forum if it did not take a tougher stance.\n\"I think they [Australia] need to come to the party. If they are really are our friends then they should be looking out for our future as well,\" Kiribati's President Anote Tong told the ABC.\n\"What we are talking about is survival, it's not about economic development,\" he said.\nPacific Island leaders are keen for Mr Abbott to ban new coal mines, with Mr Tong warning Australia could be expelled from the forum if it did not take a tougher stand.\nKiribati has a population of 110,000 living on 33 low-lying islands and is vulnerable to rising sea levels.\nThe Alliance of Small Ocean States, which includes Tuvalu and Palau, also called for a tougher stance from Australia, while remaining realistic about its chances of getting Australia to ban new coal mines.\n\"We're simply seeking for the rights of small island states to survive,\" Tuvalu's Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga, who chairs the organisation, said.\n But Mr Abbott said before the forum that Australia supported \"internationally agreed targets\".\n\"We will more than achieve a 13 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2020 and we have pledged a 26-28 per cent cut by 2030,\" he said.\n\"Unlike some other countries, which make pledges but don't deliver, Australia does deliver when we make a pledge.\"\nAustralia's pledge was comparable to those of other developed countries, Mr Abbott said.\nAustralia's pledge to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent is ninth out of 11 developed countries, ahead of Japan but comparable to New Zealand and Canada, which have pledged a 30 per cent reduction.\n\"I've got a very good story to tell on climate change to the Pacific Islands Forum and I think Pacific leaders will be reassured by the seriousness with which Australia is approaching this issue,\" Mr Abbott said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:53:13.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
