Other Events. \nOn September 16, 2015, a derivative complaint, Risik vs. ARRIS Group, Inc. et al., was filed against ARRIS Group, Inc. (as nominal defendant) and each of the Company's directors and certain executive officers in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, No. 15A -09713-8. In general, the complaint alleges that the Board's approval of the reimbursement of the directors and officers of excise tax in connection with the Company's agreement to acquire Pace plc and the related formation of a new holding company in the United Kingdom violated the Board's fiduciary duties. The complaint requests damages, the disgorgement or avoidance of various payments and other relief. The Company does not believe that the complaint has merit and expects the defendants to vigorously defend it. \nThe disclosure of this matter is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed to mean that the Company believes the events described herein to be material. \nNo Offer or Solicitation \nThis Report is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or an invitation to subscribe for, purchase or exchange any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale, issuance, exchange or transfer of the securities referred to in this document in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. \nImportant Additional Information Regarding the Pace Transaction Filed With the SEC \nIn connection with the proposed acquisition of Pace, it is expected that the shares of ARRIS International (\"New ARRIS\") to be issued by New ARRIS to Pace shareholders under the scheme will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. In connection with the issuance of New ARRIS shares to ARRIS stockholders pursuant to the merger that forms a part of the transaction, New ARRIS has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that contains a prospectus of New ARRIS as well as a proxy statement of ARRIS relating to the merger that forms a part of the combination, which we refer to together as the Form S-4/Proxy Statement. \nINVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE FORM S-4/PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSACTION, THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSACTION. Those documents, if and when filed, as well as ARRIS' and New ARRIS' other public filings with the SEC may be obtained without charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and at ARRIS' website at http://ir.arris.com. Security holders and other interested parties will also be able to obtain, without charge, a copy of the Form S-4/Proxy Statement and other relevant documents by directing a request by mail to ARRIS Investor Relations, 3871 Lakefield Drive, Suwanee, GA 30024 or at http://ir.arris.com. Security holders may also read and copy any reports, statements and other information filed with the SEC at the SEC public reference room at 100 F Street N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at (800) 732-0330 or visit the SEC's website for further information on its public reference room. Participants in the Solicitation \nARRIS, its directors and certain of its executive officers may be considered participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Form S-4/Proxy Statement. Information about the directors and executive officers of ARRIS is set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2015, and its proxy statement for its 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 9, 2015. Other information regarding potential participants in the proxy solicitations and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is contained in the Form S-4/Proxy Statement. \nPace and New ARRIS are each organized under the laws of England and Wales. Some of the officers and directors of Pace and New ARRIS are residents of countries other than the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to sue Pace, New ARRIS or such persons in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Pace, New ARRIS and their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court or for investors to enforce against them the judgments of US courts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T13:48:38.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
