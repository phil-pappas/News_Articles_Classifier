Sites and services like SoFi, CommonBond, Earnest and Avant have been evolving at incredibly quick clips, announcing new funding rounds, expanding into new markets and reaching new valuation milestones . In his April letter to shareholders, JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon acknowledged this explosion, warning, \"Silicon Valley is coming.\" And now, in the latest sign that alternative lending is going mainstream, marketplace lender Prosper just announced that it has acquired BillGuard for $30 million -- a deal that marks the first time an alternative lender is merging with a personal finance service in quite this way.Prosper Marketplace, a peer-to-peer lender that has funded more than $4 billion in personal loans, announced Thursday that it will acquire BillGuard, a spending-and-credit-tracking app, for $30 million. BillGuard works by letting its users track their spending, monitor their credit, set up fraud alerts and, via crowd-sourced data, flag unauthorized charges; it says that it has helped its 1.3 million users flag more than $70 million in unauthorized charges since its inception in 2010.For Prosper, the acquisition provides an opportunity to provide customers with more than just a personal loan.\"To say that this has been on my mind is an understatement,\" Prosper CEO Aaron Vermut said in a phone interview with FORBES. He explained that in most cases, Prosper customers have very little interaction with the Prosper platform -- beyond checking their balance and making payments -- once they've received their Prosper loan. BillGuard users, meanwhile, log into the app three to four times a week. This statistic, and the personal-finance engagement it implies, was attractive to Prosper.\"I’ve long wanted to have a strategy for more deeply engaging with our customers in a way the engenders good feelings and trust,\" Vermut said. \"As we’ve gone through and revamped this company, our mission as a business is to enhance the financial well being of consumers.\"Engagement certainly won't be the only benefit. By nature of acquiring a service that has information on users' bank accounts, credit cards and spending patterns, Prosper will be able to bolster its underwriting process with even more data. And, theoretically, if Prosper users begin to check the BillGuard app three or four times a week, they'll be more on top of their finances and a little less likely to default on their loan. (Prosper has 12.2% default rate assumption on the loans it has for sale; Vermut said that while he and his fellow executives \"hypothesize and hope\" that the BillGuard incorporation will improve Prosper's default rates, it's an \"ancillary benefit and not a driving factor\" behind the acquisition.)For its part, BillGuard seems nothing short of ecstatic to become a part of Prosper.\" Five years in the making, this is THE perfect marriage for both companies,\" BillGuard founder and CEO Yaron Samid said in a blog post titled Live Long, BillGuard and Prosper! \" This is the culmination of BillGuard’s founding mission to empower consumers to control, protect and do more with their money.\" There have been other acquisitions in the fintech space as a whole, many of which have married the old guard of finance with the up-and-comers. In August, investment manager BlackRock acquired robo-adviser FutureAdvisor for an undisclosed amount of money; earlier in the year, Capital One acquired budgeting tool Level Money and Northwestern Mutual acquired financial planning site LearnVest . Prosper's acquisition is the first time \"new\" is marrying \"new\" in this space, and Vermut expects that this is just the start of fintech mergers to come.\"I don’t think it’ll be the last,\" he said. \"Platforms like ours have increased at a pretty nice scale, and there’s going to be increasing opportunities to buy or build capabilities that they haven't engaged in until now.\" Related from Forbes: [gallery2012]", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1416265/000156459015006861/prosper-10q_20150630.htm#ITEM_3_DEFAULTS_UPON_SENIOR_SECURITIES_", "http://blog.billguard.com/2015/09/billguard-and-prosper/", "https://www.avant.com/press_release/release_2014_8_21"], "published": "2015-09-25T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:26:15.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
