This largest local online Blood community in the world is being used for Blood platelets as demand has soared in the last couple of months due to the rise of Dengue cases in Delhi/NCR. The circle has consistently been assisting with needs every day. Caregivers can seek blood donors near the location of hospital or nursing home and find assistance within a couple of hours. The LocalCircles members or their families can also post the need in their colony/sector circles and find assistance from within the neighborhood. Many critical cases where platelet count has dipped below 10,000 have been responded to within minutes by the members of the community. The community for blood donors started exactly two years ago in association with Rotary Blood Bank. It is being used extensively by community members and as Dengue is reaching an epidemic proportion we need people to know that help is at hand. The need for a Dengue victim cannot be easily met through the network of family and friends. But on LocalCircles, it is heartening to see people, unknown to each other, assisting each other and Dengue patients across Delhi/NCR and responding to such Blood needs within a few minutes to a few hours. All citizens of Delhi/NCR who may need Blood assistance or anyone who believes in the cause of saving lives can join the circle through the direct link: http://tinyurl.com/Find-Blood-DelhiNCR via their computer or phone web browser. Alternatively, citizens can download the LocalCircles mobile app (Android and iOS) or visit http://www.localcircles.com from their smartphone/tablet and use the invitation code: BLOOD when signing up. Once a member, seeking Blood Assistance can be done with a Regular or Emergency post based on the nature of the Blood need. Citizens can also post their requirement for blood in areas they live in or where the dengue patient is hospitalized. Sometimes it is difficult to find donors in hospitals or areas where the patient is hospitalized in and friends and family are not enough. Therefore the community can help in these times of distress.
