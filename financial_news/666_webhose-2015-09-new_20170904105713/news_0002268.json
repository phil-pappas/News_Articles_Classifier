It is the first product of its kind in Europe.\nEuroBonus is the premier loyalty and frequent flyer program in the Nordic countries, where members accumulate points with flights, hotel stays, car rentals and even everyday purchases. The points are redeemed at either SAS or a wide selection of participating merchant partners ranging from other airlines, car rental chains, hotels, restaurants, resorts and more.\nThe new Travel Cash feature of the award-winning loyalty program will allow members to easily load their own money on a prepaid account, and use their membership card anywhere MasterCard debit cards are accepted, including ATMs worldwide, and earn EuroBonus points while shopping. Additionally, members will be able to convert funds loaded on the card, in real time via web and mobile application, into 11 available currencies. Other notable features include access to a virtual card, and MasterCard® Contactless PayPass service for faster payments.\n“We are proud to continue our efforts to make life easier and delivering more value and convenience for our 4 million members, and this product reinforces our commitment to do so before, during, and after their journey, said Nils Lindhe, Head of SAS EuroBonus”.\nSAS selected Rêv as its product development and payments processing partner, to handle program management, utilizing Rêv’s proprietary multi-currency processing platform and global experience with similar products. Rêv has successfully launched multi-currency payment programs around the world, with leading partners such as Air New Zealand, Virgin Australia, and Etihad Airways.\n“We are looking forward to helping SAS develop a deeper relationship with their members by expanding their membership value further,” said Bertrand Sosa, President, Rêv Worldwide.\nThe new prepaid MasterCard side of the new EuroBonus membership card is issued in partnership with Catella Bank, S.A., a European leader in prepaid card issuance services and a principal member of MasterCard Worldwide.\n“Our collaboration with SAS and Rêv on this new product represents a great opportunity for us to deliver and lead with a truly innovative solution for a large customer base of a great partner”, said Tord Topsholm, Managing Director of Catella Bank.\nThe program is expected to complete a full rollout this year, available to SAS members located in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
