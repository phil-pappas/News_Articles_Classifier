Analysts had expected a draw of 533,000 barrels. \nWhile noting the stock draw, Energy Aspects said: \"But imports are likely to jump in the coming weeks as a narrower WTI-Brent spread incentivises waterborne barrels.\" \nIt added a 462,000-barrel fall in the crude stocks of Cushing, a delivery hub for U.S. crude futures, indicated \"the pace of stock draws is likely to ease as autumn maintenance kicks in.\" \nGasoline stocks, meanwhile, rose 1.4 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for an 819,000-barrel gain. \nThe build in motor fuel in the world's largest oil consumer after the end of its summer driving season raised new concerns about high product stocks during autumn months. \nAnd longer-term, many analysts still see a continuing supply surplus weighing on the market. \n\"Despite early signs of a cutback in U.S. shale production, the underlying supply and demand fundamentals remain weak for both Brent and WTI. This, alongside uncertainties surrounding China and the broader health of the global economy, is capping any recovery in prices,\" said BMI Research, part of the Fitch ratings agency. \nBMI added that it was holding to below-consensus forecasts for both key crude benchmarks for the next two years. \n\"Major supply additions in West Africa, North America, the North Sea and the Middle East will continue to outpace the growth in demand, contributing to a rising overhang of crude in the market,\" BMI said. \nA planned shutdown of Britain's North Sea Buzzard oilfield, has been reset to November from October, its operator Nexen said, contributing to a more immediate outlook for ample supplies. The field is the biggest contributor to the Forties oil stream, which has the largest volume of the four North Sea crudes used in the Brent benchmark. \n(Reporting by Meeyoung Cho; Editing by Tom Hogue and Subhranshu Sahu)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:00:05.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
