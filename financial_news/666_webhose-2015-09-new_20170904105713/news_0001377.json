Getty Images Share on twitter by Patrick Commins The Auckland harbour bridge was completed in 1959. A mere 10 years later work was under way to make it wider. The bridge was \"literally too small from the very first day it was opened,\" note analysts at research firm Bernstein.\nThe point of this little bit of trivia is not to take a dig at our Kiwi cousins (although with the Rugby World Cup in full swing we should be taking every opportunity while we still can), but to highlight the fact that building infrastructure on a \"just-in-time\" basis – that is, to satisfy immediate rather than future needs – is a mistake, and it's not one Chinese policymakers can be accused of.\nInstead, China this century has invested lavishly to build masses of infrastructure today to accommodate tomorrow's demand. The issue is clear: if they built the right things in the right places to provide the springboard to the next phase of consumer-led growth, then officials in Beijing look like geniuses and paying off the mountains of money borrowed to build all those bridges, railways and airports will be a doddle.\nIf, on the other hand, they built the wrong stuff in the wrong places, or too much of that borrowed money got gambled away in Macau or frittered away in the boutiques and real estate agencies of London, then a faltering Chinese economy risks being lumped with a mountain of unserviceable debt.\nNone of this is new. Through all the recent China-related panic it remains the \"core controversy\" within China today, the Bernstein analysts say, as it has been for a number of years. The trouble is all the recent headlines of sharemarket crashes and currency devaluations have spooked investors (and, apparently the US Federal Reserve) and led them to focus almost exclusively on the decline of the \"old economy\", and ignore the emergence of the new.\nBetter measure And declining it is. The famous \"Li Keqiang index\" is named after the Prime Minister who, at a state dinner in 2007, reportedly told the US ambassador that a combination of loan growth, electricity generation and rail freight usage data was a far more reliable way to measure economic growth, at least in one specific industrial region, than the widely distrusted official GDP numbers. The Li Keqiang index suggests that the country has been in recession for most of 2014, and is only just now emerging into growth.\nThere is no shortage of numbers to worry the China sceptic. For example, 200,000 excavators were sold in China in 2010, and 11,000 bulldozers. Last year sales for both bits of construction machinery were at most half those levels.\n All of which hasn't been great news for cement makers such as Anhui Conch Cement, says Joseph Lai, who runs Platinum Asset Management's Asia fund.\nAnhui Conch has increased its cement producing capacity from about 75 million tonnes in 2006 to 250 million tonnes today. Unfortunately, that heavy investment in supply is now running into lagging demand from a new, less resource-hungry economy. Cement prices have gone from around 350 yuan ($78) a tonne or so at their peak in 2011, to around 210 yuan now – a decline of around 40 per cent. The Hong Kong-listed stock in Anhui, which has actually been one of the better performing businesses in the industry, has gone from fetching over $HK40 (about $7) at its peak in 2011 to around $HK23 now.\nBut how much does Anhui Conch's experience tell us about China's economic reality today? Not a lot, the Bernstein analysts would argue. They estimate 80 per cent of the country's economic growth in the first half of this year came from the services sector – a sector that makes up half of the country's GDP. You don't transport services on a freight train, the sector requires a fifth of the energy of the industrial part of the economy, and is less capital intensive and therefore less likely to require debt financing. So how would the Li Keqiang index capture growth in the services industry? It wouldn't.\nMore optimistic story Instead, the Bernstein analysts prefer to look at things like airline passenger numbers, auto sales, movie box office sales and residential property prices. The story those data tell is more optimistic. Box office sales are growing at an annual rate of 40 per cent. Airline passenger numbers are growing at a rate of around 10 per cent. Car sales are weaker, but property prices are on the improve. A year ago prices were lower in all 70 cities surveyed. At the beginning of the year that number was 49, but in July only 29 of those cities recorded falling house prices.\nChina Mobile is a company that illustrates this growth in the consumer-led corners of the economy. While Anhui Conch is battening down the hatches, the country's biggest mobile network operator is picking up 20 million new 4G subscribers every month. That's equivalent to the entire population of Australia – every month.\nLai's fund has a big position in the telco giant, which is listed in Hong Kong and is ploughing tens of billions of dollars into building a 4G network across the country. New 4G customers use four of five times as much data as on the old, unreliable and slow 3G network, says Lai, meaning they are much more lucrative for China Mobile. About 200 million of the telco's 820 million customers have already converted to 4G from 3G, and the majority will move over in the next couple of years, says Lai. \"A huge group of middle-income consumers is lapping this up,\" he says. Faster, more reliable mobile data services is also enabling for the country's internet businesses, such as ecommerce firm JD.com and social network Tencent, to expand their businesses at an increasing rate.\nHow much do movie theatre ticket sales, airline passengers numbers or new 4G subscribers really tell you about the Chinese economy? Not everything, but they are the metrics you would be wise to keep an eye on. If they take a sharp turn for the worse, then they would be \"telling you something extraordinarily negative\" about the Chinese economy and would be \"an early warning system\" that the Chinese story really is going off the tracks, say the Bernstein analysts. At the moment, though, \"they look pretty strong\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-09-25T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:10:07.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
