And I don’t mean to get rid of all loans, which can be leveraged for good, but instead the fastest way to ensure your assets are greater than your liabilities?There’s plenty of advice out there, but it’s not always right for the business owner. Because becoming debt-free is not about lowering your interest rates, or paying off high-interest loans first or cutting back on lifestyle expenses so you can chop away at debt.Instead it’s about strategically managing risk and cash flow as you consistently pay down debt without guilt or sacrifice.Unfortunately, in an effort to get out of debt, too many business owners make critical mistakes that increase their risk and slow down the process.Here’s the fastest, safest, and most sustainable way to become debt-free: 1. Build Savings First It doesn’t make any sense to start paying extra on loans until you have at least three months of income, and ideally six months, in a liquid savings account. This creates safety.If you have no cash reserves, what happens when you pay down your loans but then experience an unexpected cash flow crunch? You simply increase your loan balances again or even worse, miss payments and hurt your credit score, therefore getting charged more for future loans.If you are wondering where this money might come from, don’t worry. Details are to follow. 2. Restructure Your Loans You can restructure your loans by rolling short-term, high-interest loans into long-term, low-interest, tax-deductible loans.The goal here is to minimize your payments and maximize your cash flow.For example, if you have enough home equity, you can refinance your mortgage--which is a tax deductible loan--and roll as much of your non-deductible loans (credit cards, auto, etc.) into it as possible.This will typically lower your minimum monthly debt payment, and the tax deduction will also increase your cash flow. Then you can attack your remaining debt strategically, using your increased cash flow to eliminate one loan at a time. 3. The Secret Sauce: Cash Flow Index Here’s where the rubber hits the road. After minimizing your payments and maximizing your cash flow, you’re now prepared to focus on one loan at a time until you’re completely debt-free.Most financial advisors and pundits will tell you to pay off your loans with the highest interest rates first. My advice is to ignore the interest rate and use our Cash Flow Index to determine which debt to pay off first.To determine your Cash Flow Index for each loan, divide the loan balance by the minimum payment. Whichever loan has the lowest number is the one you should pay off first.For example:Home Loan Balance: $228,000Interest Rate: 7%Monthly Payment: $1,665 Cash Flow Index: 137 ($228,000 ÷ $1,665)Auto Loan Balance: $16,500Interest Rate: 8%Monthly Payment: $450 Cash Flow Index: 37Credit Card Balance: $13,000Interest Rate: 12%Monthly Payment: $260 Cash Flow Index: 50In this example, it seems to make sense to pay off the credit card first because it has the highest interest rate. But the Cash Flow Index reveals that the auto loan should be paid off first.By paying off the auto loan first, you free up more monthly cash, which can then be applied toward the credit card balance. And then you can pay off both loans faster than if you started with the credit card.The trick is to pay off debt that gives you the greatest cash flow with the least investment. 4. Be Cautious About Locking Money Into an Asset Paying extra money to your mortgage can sometimes make sense when you’re financially stable, but other times it’s just locking money into the asset.Remember, this strategy isn’t just about paying off debt faster and saving money on interest--it’s also about reducing your risk.A good rule here is to only put extra money into loans where your minimum payment goes down as your balance goes down. Otherwise, you’re worsening your Cash Flow Index with every payment. It doesn’t give you immediate benefit, and it increases your risk by reducing your liquidity.A better move is to save the money that you would have paid on the loan balance in a separate account. Then let it accumulate and earn interest until you have enough to pay off the loan in full. 5. Get to the Roots Without a fundamental change in consciousness regarding debt, none of these strategies will work long-term.For lasting results, identify and solve the root causes of debt, rather than hacking at the byproducts (interest and bondage).Before you employ the techniques above, ask the following questions:\nWhy did I incur each of my debts? What was the purpose? Was my desire to consume or to produce? t When I’ve incurred debt, how did I justify it? t Do I seek consolation in material things? If so, what could replace the feelings I receive from borrowing to purchase material things? t Was my debt caused by investments that were actually more like gambling—putting money into things I didn’t understand and couldn’t control? If so, what can I learn from this and how can I be wiser in the future? Getting-- and staying --out of debt requires a fundamental shift.A simple guide moving forward: Do not borrow to consume. Use cash for luxuries and only borrow for productive assets and resources or necessities.To recap, debt elimination isn’t simply a matter of prioritizing the order in which you should pay off loans. It’s not just about saving money on interest.The wise and sustainable way to become debt-free is to reduce your risk and create more safety while minimizing payments and maximizing cash flow. Not only will you become debt-free more quickly, but you’ll also enjoy peace of mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:01:15.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
