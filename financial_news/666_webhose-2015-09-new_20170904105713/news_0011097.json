Share on twitter by Karen Maley After the gut-wrenching ride they've endured for the past month, investors enjoyed a much-deserved respite at the end of the week as the Chinese share market closed on Thursday and Friday in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nBut pundits are warning investor woes are far from over, and recommend they keep a close watch on the five main risks for the global economy, any one of which has the potential to trigger a fresh share market rout.\n1. China The health of the world's second-largest economy continues to be a concern, with many economists predicting China's growth rate this year will be closer to 4 per cent than the official 7 per cent target.\nChina may keep some investors up at night, especially as they've been so focused on their recent military parade. Ng Han Guan The steep decline in the Chinese share market, now down about 40 per cent from its June 12 peak, is likely to weigh on economic activity by making it more difficult and more expensive for privately owned companies to raise capital. There's also a risk that rising corporate bankruptcies could lead to an increase in problem loans for Chinese banks, causing them to cut back on lending.\nIn addition, China is a key player in global trade, being the world's largest exporter and close to the biggest importer. China is also the major trading partner for many countries in Asia and Latin America. Weaker Chinese demand has already pushed the prices of many commodities – such as copper, iron ore and oil – close to multiyear lows, creating problems for big commodity producers such as Australia, Russia, Brazil and Chile.\n2. Rising US interest rates Some analysts, however, believe that China fears are overblown and that the possibility of the US Fedeal Reserve raising rates this month represents a far greater threat to markets.\n Fed chair Janet Yellen has expressed a desire to raise US rates, which have been close to zero since December 2008, this year, and her deputy, Stanley Fisher, did not rule out a rate increase at the FOMC's September 16-17 meeting, despite the turmoil in global markets in the past few weeks.\nBut many analysts believe the US central bank is ignoring the growing threat to the US job market as a result of waning demand. This risk was highlighted when, in response to the steep drop in the oil price, Texas-based ConocoPhillips​ this week said it would cut about 10 per cent of its global workforce, with most of the job losses occurring in North America. Schlumberger​, the giant US oilfield services provider, has already announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year.\n3. Growing risk of deflation The risk of deflation has risen as a result of China's move to devalue the yuan and the sharp drop in commodity prices.\nThe fall in the value of the yuan – and many experts believe that the Chinese currency is likely to decline much further – makes Chinese goods cheaper in global markets, putting pressure on China's competitors to push their currencies lower to retain market share.\nThis cascading price deflation translates into falling sales revenue and shrinking profit margins for companies around the world. Typically, companies respond to dwindling profits by cutting jobs and cancelling new investment.\nMeanwhile, falling commodity prices, particularly the steep oil price drop, is pushing inflation even lower in the US and Europe. On Thursday, Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, warned the eurozone's inflation rate could slip into negative territory in coming months.\n4. Lack of liquidity in global markets Some analysts are troubled that the extreme levels of volatility displayed by financial markets in the past few weeks points to a deeper underlying problem.\nThey note that retail investors appear to be particularly risk-averse, rushing to pull their money out of equity mutual funds whenever the market dips sharply.\nWhat's more, they argue that liquidity in many key markets has shrunk as major global banks have scaled back their trading activities, under pressure from mounting regulation and the need to shrink their bloated balance sheets.\nAt the same time, the increasing market dominance of electronic high-frequency traders has tended to exaggerate market volatility. As traditional investors retreat, the battle-ground has been left to computers pitting algorithm against algorithm, which exacerbates price swings.\n5. Central banks running out of ammunition The world's major central banks can no longer rely on cutting interest rates to boost economic growth, because they've already reduced rates close to zero.\nAs a result, central banks such as the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, are running massive bond-buying programs that drive their currencies lower and stimulate export sales. But such policies only offer a temporary respite, and do nothing to solve the problem of weak global demand.\nWhat's more, by pushing their key interest rates close to zero, the world's major central banks have already inflated the value of financial assets. And with global growth and corporate profit margins under pressure, some analysts worry that companies will struggle to justify their lofty share prices.\nUS billionaire Bill Gross, often dubbed the \"bond guru\", this week warned that the world's bleak growth prospects mean that \"equity market capital gains and future returns are likely to be limited, if not downward sloping.\"\nHe advised that, despite the scanty returns, \"cash, or better yet near cash, such as one to two year corporate bonds are my best idea of appropriate risks/reward investments.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-04T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:02:57.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
