Harrison Saragossi by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Real estate group Stockland is expected to set in motion a selldown of a half-stake in its $1 billion retirement business before Christmas.\nSources told Street Talk Macquarie Capital has been drafted in to provide preliminary advice. While discussions are still in the early stages, it is understood Stockland is at this stage looking at selling 50 per cent of the business, rather than spinning it off entirely.\nLike its fellow residential developers Mirvac and Lendlease, Stockland now faces the question of how it extracts value for investors if the market accepts Sydney's housing boom has come to an end. The listed real estate trusts are struggling to compete with Asian developers on price when it comes to inner-city locations given their return hurdles.\nMany shareholders have already rushed for the exit. Since the end of June, Stockland securities have fallen 6 per cent, Mirvac 7 per cent and Lendlease nearly 15 per cent, making them among the worst performers in the sector for the quarter.\nMirvac is also assessing its options.\nStreet Talk can also reveal Mirvac has shopped around stakes in its retail and residential units to Asian groups over the last couple of months. Its play for the Investa management platform is also a bid to boost its wholesale funds management business.\nBut aged care is an increasingly attractive institutional investment. A selldown of the aged care business is another option to create value for Lendlease. The real estate group, whose shares have plummeted back to below $13, could do an in specie distribution and let the market re-rate the business, sources suggested.\nElsewhere, and as revealed by Street Talk Online, Deutsche Bank was on Wednesday night bidding for 10 per cent of OZ Minerals at $3.55 on behalf of a financial buyer.\n Sources pointed to Denham Capital Management, South32 or an Asian buyer.\nOZ shares closed 1.5 per cent higher at $3.31 on Wednesday.\nFinally, Greenhill's equity capital markets specialist Jason Valmadre has decided to leave investment banking after 20 years and pursue other interests.\nValmadre joined Greenhill in 2013, based in Sydney.\nBefore joining Greenhill, he spent 13 years at RBS [where he was head of ECM] and its predecessor firms in Sydney and London and prior to that, was with Bankers Trust.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:09:41.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
