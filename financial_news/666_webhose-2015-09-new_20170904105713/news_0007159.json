Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Misa Han Uber drivers in Sydney are facing suspension of their vehicles as part of the NSW Roads and Maritime Services crackdown on illegal ride-sharing.\nThe agency is issuing suspension notices against registered owners of vehicles found to be operating a privately registered vehicle for business purposes.\nIt has confirmed 40 drivers have been issued with suspension notices and thousands of dollars in fines have been issued to drivers offering illegal ride-sharing activities.\nThe suspensions will take effect from midnight on September 30 and will be in place for three months.\nAn Uber driver who drives a suspended vehicle after October 1 can face a $637 fine for each offence, or around $2200 if the case is heard in court.\nRMS will continue with further registration suspensions in the coming months.\nOne Sydney Uber driver, who declined to be identified, said he was not deterred by the compliance activities of the RMS and he would continue to drive his Uber car full time.\n\"It's ludicrous. I bought my car, I've registered my car, I've got insurance. The idea you can't give a ride to a passenger who has agreed to pay is so jarring, so removed,\" he said.\n \"It's like a dictatorship, it's embarassing. I'm going to drive twice as much just to protest.\"\nUber said the ride-sharing company was looking into legal options to reverse the decision to issue suspension notices.\n\"We are shocked that the Roads and Maritime Services did not appear to show these drivers any due process and we are reviewing the legal options to reverse this decision,\" an Uber spokeswoman.\n\"The people of Sydney are choosing Uber in their hundreds of thousands and we look forward to seeing the government recognise this by putting sensible ride-sharing regulations in place as quickly as possible.\"\nThe NSW Taxi Council said it \"welcomes the announcement by RMS that it will enforce the law to crack down on illegal ride-sharing. The Taxi Industry meanwhile will continue to focus on safe, reliable transport and good customer service.\"\nIn July, the NSW government has been forced to drop charges against 24 UberX drivers in Sydney due to \"evidentiary issues\" .\nIn Brisbane, Uber drivers have been fined more than $1.7 million in the past 12 months . It is understood Uber pays fines for its drivers in Brisbane. Uber has not confirmed whether it will do the same in relation to Sydney Uber drivers who face fines or suspension notices.\nMeanwhile in Melbourne, Uber suffered a blow last week after losing a legal bid to have criminal charges against its drivers dropped out . The test case on the app's legality will proceed to trial on October 9.\nUber drivers in Melbourne can face fines of up to $7500.\nAn independent taskforce established by the NSW government is examining the ride sharing industry and Uber could be legalised in NSW as soon as next year . The taskforce is due to report back by the end of October.\nRecent survey by consumer group Choice of 56 trips across Sydney found Uber drivers provided better services than taxis. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has also praised the ride-sharing app for being part of the \"agile\" economy.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/uberx-rides-are-safe-says-choice-busting-the-taxi-council-claims-20150923-gjswf9.html", "https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/uber-has-revolutionised-transport-in-australia-but-will-taxpayers-get-anything-in-return-20150924-gju1kb.html", "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/uber-fined-17-million-by-queensland-20150624-ghwugz.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/charges-dropped-against-uberx-drivers-but-government-warns-of-campaign-to-come-20150730-ginzq5.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:57:41.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
