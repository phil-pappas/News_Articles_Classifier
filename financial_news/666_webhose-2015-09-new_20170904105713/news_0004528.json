The median forecast of 10 experts showed the rupee at 66.10 per dollar a month down the line. In fact two respondents said the rupee could even touch 66.50/dollar. \nThe recent appreciation in the rupee has been due to US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its meeting held last week.\n\nThe market is factoring in a 25 basis points cut by the Reserve bank of India (RBI) in its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review to be announced next week due to which the rupee could strengthen further from current levels. But expects believe the appreciation will be temporary. \n“I do not think RBI will be comfortable seeing the rupee beyond 65.50 due to competitiveness issues. The rupee will gradually start weakening. The rupee will start converging with the weakness of other emerging market currencies,” said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst, Kotak Securities.  \nIn August China had resorted to competitive devaluation of the yuan as a result of which the rupee had weakened by 3.65% in August. However, since the start of this month the rupee has appreciated by 1.11%. Monday the rupee ended at 65.74 compared with previous close of 65.67 per dollar. \nAt the end of the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) earlier this month, the interest rate hike was delayed due to factors like low inflation, an uncertain global outlook for growth and financial market turmoil. The interest rates there have stayed near zero since late-2008.\n\nHowever, many experts feel the delay in rate hike continued to bother the domestic markets and it is anticipated that once the US Fed starts hiking interest rates, initially there will be outflows from emerging markets and India will not be an exception.  \n“Rupee continues to stay under pressure from bullish undertone of the dollar against major and emerging markets currencies with risk of sudden shift of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) flows, from net inflows to outflows given the downside risks on both equity and bond markets in the short term for rest of 2015 and the current fiscal,” said J Moses Harding, Group CEO, liability and treasury management, Srei Infrastructure Finance. \nAccording to Harding the correction from 66.60-66.85 to 65.50-65.65 is in order adjusting for the excessive rupee weakness from 63.35 in quick time.\n\n“The short term outlook from combination of domestic and external cues favour dollar/rupee near term consolidation at 65/65.50-67 with bias into higher end on good importer demand against risk of temporary exit by FIIs,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:56:55.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
