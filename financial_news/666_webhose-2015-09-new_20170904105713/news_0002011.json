Our goal is to not only promote awareness about the patient safety issues in Germany but to empower clinicians that attend with the tools they need to improve patient safety in their organization quickly.” According to the World Health Organization, there are an estimated 750,000 medical errors in Europe every year. In Germany, the data demonstrates that there are over 19,000 preventable patient deaths each year. This year’s focus for the Symposium is perioperative setting. The sessions will review best practices for all three phases of surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. The presenters will start by laying a theoretical human factors framework for attendees and will bridge the gap from this background and scientific research to hands-on tools for everyday use that people can use while actually giving care to patients. Inspired by the World Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit, we will end this symposium by asking attendees to write down their intentions after leaving the meeting to see how they plan to implement a change for improved patient safety. “Preventable patient deaths take 3 million lives per year around the world,” said Joe Kiani, Founder of the Patient Safety Movement Foundation. “It’s an issue that affects every person in every country. Heidelberg University Hospital is one of the leading medical centers in Europe. We are excited to work with their talented team in empowering clinicians in Europe to eradicate medical errors.” This year’s Symposium presenters include Dr. Georg Breuer, University Hospital Erlangen, Dr. Maria Ines Cartes, Hannover Medical School, Prof. Dr. Ulrich M. Gassner, University of Augsburg, Prof. Dr. Tanja Manser, Institute for Patient Safety, University of Bonn, Prof. Dr. Rainer Rohrig, University of Oldenburg, and Prof. Dr. Markus Weigand, University Hospital Heidelberg. Heidelberg University Hospital and Medical Faculty: Internationally recognized patient care, research, and teaching. Heidelberg University Hospital is one of the largest and most prestigious medical centers in Germany. The Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University belongs to the internationally most renowned biomedical research institutions in Europe. Both institutions have the common goal of developing new therapies and implementing them rapidly for patients. With about 12,600 employees, training and qualification is an important issue. Every year, around 66,000 patients are treated on a fully or partially inpatient basis and over 1,000,000 patients have been treated on an outpatient basis in more than 50 clinics and departments with 1,900 beds. Currently, about 3,500 future physicians are studying in Heidelberg; the reform Heidelberg Curriculum Medicinale (HeiCuMed) is one of the top medical training programs in Germany.
