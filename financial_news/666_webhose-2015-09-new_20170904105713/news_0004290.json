Photo: Supplied\nAMP Capital's Global Direct Property Fund has sold Liberty Square, a core office building in the Boston CBD, for $US28.25 million ($40.26m). The sum was well above the December 2012 purchase price of $US17.6 million. The property, which has been used for the filming of the new Ghostbusters movie, is an 11-storey B Grade office building. AMP Capital Global Direct fund manager Tim Falletâ€‹ said the deal came at a time of renewed demand for core office investments in the US and the cash raised would be recycled into other top-tier secondary US markets identified as being poised for growth.\nSurf's up for Life Property Group\nA private developer, Life Property Group, is investing $5.5 million in the integrated Belrose Austlink Business Park in Sydney's northern beaches precinct.
