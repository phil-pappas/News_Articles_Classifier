Having enough money for retirement , covering college costs, stashing enough cash away for long-term care -- all, and more, are issues that can keep average Americans up at night. The financial news and advice website GoBankingRates.com has broken the money \"scare factor\" down into a list of the financial issues that are both the biggest frights, and the biggest priorities, for U.S. adults. As part of the site's 2015 Life + Money survey, here are some of the most troubling financial factors keeping U.S. consumers pacing the floor at 3 A.M. - Always living paycheck to paycheck is the No. 1 financial fear of Americans today, followed by living in debt \"forever.\" - 20% of people say their biggest money challenge is \"sticking to a budget.\" - 20% of Americans say \"planning for retirement is their primary financial focus.\" - More women than men say their \"number one\" thought is money. - Men are more afraid than women of \"losing money in the stock market, losing their jobs and not being able to retire.\" - Women are \"more fearful\" of always living paycheck to paycheck than men (25% vs. 18%). - Planning for retirement is \"more of a financial challenge for men than it is for women \"(20% vs. 17%). An interesting takeaway from that study, and from conversations the MainStreet recently had with other financial industry professionals, is that fear actually extends out over the long term, with retirement and long-term medical care huge, anxiety-provoking issues among U.S. adults. \"The biggest fears I see include having to rely on your kids to support you in your old age and having to live in a dirty, dark nursing home,\" says Laurie Itkin, a San Diego, Cal.-based financial advisor and founder of the financial advice website The Options Lady. \"You'd also have to include losing everything in a divorce, and having to sell your home at a loss because you need the money.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:13:08.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
