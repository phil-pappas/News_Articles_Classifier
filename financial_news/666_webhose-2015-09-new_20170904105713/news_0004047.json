Insurers that guarantee $2.5 billion of the utility’s debt balked at extending the talks. The forbearance keeps negotiations outside of court.\nBondholders agreed to extend the forbearance contract to Oct. 1, while fuel-line lenders pushed the expiration deadline to Sept. 25. The agreement was set to expire late Friday night. Prepa will continue negotiations with its bond insurers even without a forbearance agreement, Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said in a statement Saturday.\n“We are making progress and will continue working towards a consensual resolution that benefits Prepa and all of its stakeholders,” Donahue said in the statement.\nThe Electric Power Authority, bondholders, banks and insurers have repeatedly extended the agreement, which was first signed in August 2014.\nAssured Guaranty Ltd. declined to extend that accord beyond Friday. MBIA Inc. dropped out of the forbearance earlier this month. An MBIA unit that insures Prepa debt filed a petition Thursday to the island’s energy commission, asking it to temporarily add at least 4.2 cents per kilowatt hour to the agency’s base electricity rate so Prepa can repay its bonds, according to a copy of the request provided by the commission.\nThe expiration may imperil the tentative agreement that Prepa and some of its bondholders reached on Sept. 1 that would require investors to take losses of about 15 percent in a debt exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T19:37:46.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
