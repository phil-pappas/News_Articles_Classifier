Photo: James Alcock\nBy 2031, an estimated 30.5 million people will be living in Australia and our capital cities will be contributing $1.6 trillion to our economy.\nThese projected figures by Infrastructure Australia will result in the vast majority of the extra 6 million people living in our cities and still wanting to commute by car.\nIn fact, the Australian Infrastructure Audit report states that \"car travel times are expected to increase by at least 20 per cent in the most congested corridors. In some cases, travel times could more than double between 2011 and 2031\".\nSo, if driving is going to be that difficult, can you imagine trying to find a park?\nAdvertisement Divvy Parking may be your answer. The platform enables you to find previously hidden parking spaces in the CBD – for a monthly fee.\n\"Through Divvy's partnerships with major commercial property groups like DEXUS Group, GPT and Knight Frank, drivers can find and access off-street parking that is affordable and convenient for them,\" Nick Austin, CEO and founder of Divvy Parking, says.\n\"Divvy currently offers monthly bookings but is close to rolling out industry first mobile access technology that will let people book and access secure short term parking with ease through their smartphone.\"\nInfrastructure Australia has warned that congestion in Sydney could cost Australia $53 billion by 2031 and while the greater population in Australia's cities can't do without their cars, there is no point driving into the CBD unless you have somewhere to park.\n\"Those rare spaces that can be found are usually limited to one or two hours, and current daily car park rates can set you back as much as a parking fine,\" Austin says. \"Creating an improved parking solution at the destination can actually reduce congestion by up to 30 per cent.\n\"The spaces we have available on Divvy were previously under-utilised by their owners – be they commercial property owners or building managers.\n\"We have worked closely with these firms to help them get a booking and marketing platform that makes their lives incredibly easy, reduces their admin costs and improves the yield of otherwise dead assets.\"\nAnother solution might be the option of DriveMyCar, a car rental service, which Chris Noone started five years ago.\n\"DriveMyCar is not your traditional car rental company,\" Noone says. \"We are an online peer-to-peer marketplace connecting car owners looking to earn some extra money by renting out their car, with drivers who are no longer prepared to pay high car rental costs and want more choice.\n\"It is completely free for owners to list their car and free for both owners and renters to register with DriveMyCar.\"\nAccording to Noone, thousands of cars are under-utilised in Australia with 35% of Sydney households having two cars. He says that people often want to rent cars from one week onwards.\nBut there is a catch.\n\"Normal car insurance does not cover cars that are used for rental purposes, that's why it's risky to rent a car through Gumtree and the like,\" Noone says. \"DriveMyCar holds a motor fleet policy that covers cars for damage and theft during rental.\"\nBut he is very confident that the model will work.\n\"We have over 400 vehicles available, nearly 15,000 registered users, $4.4 million paid out to car owners through nearly 5000 bookings,\" he says. \"DriveMyCar is rapidly becoming the no fuss, go-to platform for everyday Aussies, travellers and businesses to rent cars, without being ripped off.\n\"The cost of insurance is included in the advertised listing price, not lumped on as a hidden extra and the insurance excess is lower than many traditional car rental firms.\n\"Cars are up to 62 per cent cheaper than other car rental firms because DriveMyCar doesn't own the fleet of cars available – it's tapping into the thousands of cars around Australia that aren't being used.\"\nEarlier this year Ford developed a parking app, the parking spotter, to bring to the market.\nDeveloped with Georgia Tech, the app leverages driver-assisted sensors that most Ford vehicles already have, including sonar and radar, by putting them to work for everybody.\nThe sensors search for open parking spaces while the driver looks around for spots in the city, and shares the information with a cloud database that other drivers can access.\nThe system makes it easier for a driver to locate an open spot, reserve it and navigate the space. It also reduces fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.\nBy while all these innovations are helpful, they still don't address the key issues of addressing Australia's infrastructure issues and the urgency required in fixing our transport problems.\nWith demand for public transport in the capital cities (measured by passenger kilometres travelled) set to rise by 55 per cent in Sydney, 121 per cent in Melbourne and an average of 89 per cent across all capital cities, unless peak period passenger loads are managed and capacity is increased, commuters in all capital cities will see more services experiencing \"crush loadings\", where peak demand exceeds capacity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:15:08.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
