Their decision to hold on to these funds earlier this year nearly crippled the economy. \nThe donor partners had raised some concerns with the management of the economy then. \nThey maintained that, unless Ghana signs up to an IMF program, about 1 billion dollars that government was expecting over the next 18 months, to support infrastructural projects in the budget will not be released. \nThe decision by the partners to now release the funds, could also encourage other private firms and multinationals, who hitherto were not prepared to bring in their capital because of similar concerns about the economy. \nThe move will bring about the confidence in the economy that government was looking forward to, and as well, improve the amount of dollars in circulation, which could go a long way to help stabilize the Ghana cedi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:46:42.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
