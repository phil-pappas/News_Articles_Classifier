Is a dogmatic devotion to out-dated financial theories destroying trillions of dollars of wealth we will need to fund our retirements?\nThese are some of the questions pondered at The Thinking Ahead Group, which resides within global asset consultant Towers Watson. While they might seem like big-picture distractions for fund managers focused on the next set of numbers, the group's founder, Tim Hodgson, believes they are critical for the industry.\nOne of the biggest problems Hodgson sees in the investment industry is an emphasis of \"comparing\" over \"compounding\". That includes Australian super funds , which are fixated on outperforming their peers rather than investing with a long-term focus.\n\"It's a bit like [fictional town] Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average – it's nonsense. This becomes dangerous and self-referential,\" Hodgson told Fairfax Media.\n\"The industry is delivering a short-term product of relative returns and it's all about having a diversified portfolio for this point of time – whether it's a quarter or a year.\n\"But your super member needs someone to get them through decades of short-term periods, so the game is not about diversification [at a point in time] but time diversification and improving the geometric growth rate of the portfolio. The industry is not set up to do that in any way, shape or form.\"\nThe \"mental switch\" that Hodgson is advocating is a change in emphasis from \"arithmetic returns\", stressed in text books, in favour of \"geometric returns\" that account better for the impact of volatility and compounding over the long run.\nDetriment of the saver The debate might be confined to actuaries and wonks but it matters most for real people who are relying on the savings serving their needs best when they retire. The cost of chasing performance adds up and compounds, to the detriment of the saver. Then there's the issue of investing optimally during the draw-down phase, an issue facing many savers in the developed world but one in which there is little preparedness.\nThese issues show that while there are trillions of dollars at stake, for all its brainpower the investment profession still has much to learn about the process of wealth creation, particularly on the enormous scale that is required.\nHodgson has devoted considerable time to the age-old question as to whether the world will be able to save what is needed to fund its retirement, a topic he explored in a paper \"The Impossibility of Pensions\".\nThis is going to be a stretch but one of the limitations is whether there will be enough available assets to generate the returns the world needs.\n\"Is the supply of positive [returning] investments infinite or is the supply of positive returning assets finite? Can China just add another airport to soak up the capital and will it produce a positive return? In my view, there are some airports that will cost you money.\"\nHodgson is fearful of an investment equivalent of Keynes' paradox of thrift, which broadly states that if there is too much saving, the lack of spending reduces economic activity. A similar force applies as more money is invested for retirement.\n\"If those assets don't exist – ie, the world is trying to save too much money – you will bid the price of assets up and reduce the returns, so you have to save more.\"\nLess capital is required This is compounded by the reality that we appear to be in a phase of economic growth where less capital is required than before, and one where large piles of money are concentrated in the hands of a few larger institutions. That has led Hodgson to ponder the role of sharemarkets that were created to attract capital from many, but at a time when capital is abundant and concentrated could become redundant.\n\"If someone wants to raise capital they can go either straight to the large funds – only make five phone calls – or go through the massive expense of a public listing. The whole capital structure of the economy has changed. So are stock markets still fit for purpose?\"\nHowever, the challenge for savers is that they need capital-intensive projects to generate returns. Perhaps in the future we can invest trillions in a space elevator or hyper travel tubes?\n\"But as you raise the ante to deploy capital, it needs to be profitable, otherwise the capital is destroyed.\"\nThat is one of Hodgson's hobby horses – the differentiation between primary investing, where savers provide the capital \"to build new factories or buy robots\", and secondary investing, such as buying shares, where the capital was raised months or years ago and is merely being exchanged.\n\"Most of our industry is about shuffling ownership rights, not channelling capital from owners to users.\n\"If it's right that you have monthly deductions [from our salaries into our pension funds] and there isn't demand to build new factories or robots, this money gets plonked in the financial assets, bidding up their price.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:04:43.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
