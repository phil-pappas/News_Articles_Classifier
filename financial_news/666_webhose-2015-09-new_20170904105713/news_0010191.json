The Institute for Supply Management's PMI slid closer to contraction in August, falling to 51.1, the year's low, from 52.7 in July. \nAnalysts said the global crude oversupply remains a drag on prices, despite the sharp rebound in the past three days. \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) though US production has started to fall, June production was still up 7.1 percent over a year ago,\" said Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets. \n\"In the near term, there is likely to be little or no relief on either the supply or demand fronts,\" said business consultancy IHS (NYSE: IHS - news ) . \n\"In particular, the oversupply problem could take a long time to correct.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:22:19.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
