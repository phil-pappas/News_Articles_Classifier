The balance thresholds and the period of time an account needs to have been inactive varies from fund to fund.\nThe planned changes will allow super fund administrators to consolidate these inactive ERF accounts they hold into the active superannuation accounts of members without the need to contact them first and gain their consent.\nAdvertisement \"This is a very positive and sensible change that will help unify accounts and reduce the leakage to fees that comes from unintentionally running multiple accounts,\" Industry Super Australia chief executive David Whiteley said.\nAustralians had $4.9 billion sitting in 4 million accounts with the country's nine eligible rollover funds, the latest available data released in 2013 showed.\nThe changes also reflect that members increasingly prefer to contact their fund by email or other online interactions, rather than the traditional methods of post or phone.\n\"It's good to see more focus on lost and unclaimed superannuation, which has proved a persistent issue for both funds and members,\" Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) chief executive Tom Garcia said.\n\"AIST particularly welcomes measures that recognise the impact that technology is having on member engagement through emails and websites.\"\nIt is hoped the changes will lead to fewer accounts being classified as \"lost\".\nCurrently if an account with a balance of less than $2000 has been inactive for more than 12 months it is classified as \"lost\" and is transferred to the Australian Taxation Office, where it is preserved on behalf of the member but typically earns very little.\nAustralians have about $15 billion in 6 million lost super accounts.\nSeparately, a related reform is set to lift the balance at which an inactive account is moved to lost super from $2000 to $4000.\nA Treasury consultation on the latest proposed changes launched on Tuesday will close on October 20. The new rules are due to take effect from June 30, 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:45:43.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
