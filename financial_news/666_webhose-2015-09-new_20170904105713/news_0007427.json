Hands, 56, is working with Credit Suisse Group AG on the effort, the people said.\nNo existing investor would be obligated to exit the fund, nor would any\nincoming backer be obliged to commit capital to any subsequent Terra Firma\nfund, should a liquidity option be offered, one person said. No final decisions have been made and the buyout firm may decide not to proceed with the process, the person said.\nThe firm is one of several to look at using the secondaries market to explore ways of either raising new capital or extending the time it can hold investments. JC Flowers & Co. and Doughty Hanson & Co. have each hired Credit Suisse in the past 12 months to examine the feasibility of a fund restructuring, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe third Terra Firma pool, which closed on 5.3 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in 2007, contained part of the buyout firm’s investment in music publisher EMI Group Ltd., which resulted in a 1.7 billion pound ($2.6 billion) loss when lender Citigroup Inc. seized control of the company in 2011. As a result the fund is still valued at less than 70 percent of investors’ original commitments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nDeal by Deal Hands, who said in July that he had postponed plans to raise a traditional private-equity fund in favor of deal-by-deal investments with selected co-investors, is nevertheless looking to raise both new buyout and infrastructure pools, said the people familiar with the firm’s plans. Terra Firma hasn’t yet done any transactions under the deal-by-deal model.\nThe firm named Justin King, former chief executive officer of U.K. grocer Sainsbury Plc, as vice chairman and head of portfolio businesses earlier this month.\nFund III, in which Hands and fellow staff invested 400 million euros, contains stakes in companies including Four Seasons Health Care Group and Wyevale Garden Centres, according to the company’s website.\nSpokesmen for Terra Firma and Credit Suisse declined to comment.", "external_links": ["https://www.terrafirma.com/investment/four-seasons-health-care.411.html\\", "https://www.terrafirma.com/communications/news/terra-firma/news-article/items/terra-firma-appoints-justin-king-as-vice-chairman-and-head-of-portfolio-businesses.html\\"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:55:27.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
