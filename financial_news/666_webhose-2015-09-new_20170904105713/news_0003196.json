The layoffs come as the company is implementing a roughly 50 per cent drop in mining, stacking and crushing rates at the mine, in which Freeport owns a 51 per cent stake and Chilean state-owned copper giant Codelco has the remaining 49 per cent interest. The FTC copper workers' federation slammed the layoffs as \"unilateral and arbitrary\". \"This business conduct ... is incompatible with the inclusive, virtuous and socially responsible behaviour that should prevail as an ethical imperative among all operators in the mining industry,\" the FTC said on its website. In remarks to Bio Bio radio, the president of the El Abra mine's San Lorenzo union, Oscar Arnes, blasted the layoffs as \"unjustified\" and criticized the government for failing to respond to the dismissals. Arizona-based Freeport is the world's second-largest copper producer after Codelco.
