The comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen further left investors speculating whether a rate increase will be on the horizon in 2015 or if the calendar will turn to 2016 before the tightening cycle starts.\n“Markets wanted clarity (hike or stick) but the accompanying message is ‘clearly’ not what was expected. The decision to raise rates (Dec, Jan, later?) is no longer dependent on U.S. data alone. What is going on round the world is equally, in fact more important, given last night’s reasoning,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, in a note Friday morning.\nThe clouded rate outlook spooked investors in the U.S. ahead of the close on Thursday and has also triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment in Europe on Friday.\nHere are some of the most significant market reactions:\nStoxx_fed European stock markets dropped straight at the open and the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, -1.81% was midday down 1.8% at 354.67. If it closes with such a loss, it’ll be the largest one-day percentage slide since early September, according to FactSet data.\n“Leaving U.S. interest rates unchanged would normally be enough to see markets cheer at the prospect of cheap money for longer, but heightened concerns about external factors such as China, market volatility and deflation derailing a stateside recovery has resulted in an understandably cautious stance being adopted,” said van Dulken from Accendo Markets.\nBut every cloud has a silver lining. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report Friday morning that European equity markets are good value, “having discounted much of the bad news out of China and EM.”\n“We would therefore see any initial negative reaction to this move as a buying opportunity,” they added.\nThe euro euro_fed With the Fed holding off on raising interest rates, the short-term attractiveness of the dollar also diminished. That sent the greenback lower against almost all other major currencies, with the euro EURUSD, -0.0787% being one of the major beneficiaries. The shared currency traded at $1.1445, a level not seen since late August, and up from $1.1437 late Thursday in New York and $1.1292 late Wednesday.\n“The outlook suggests a move now towards the top of the old range which comes in around $1.1465, however there is little reason at the moment why the move could not continue towards the spike high of $1.1711,” said Richard Perry, market analyst at Hantec Markets, in a note.\nIt’s only six months ago that the euro slipped close to parity with the dollar after the European Central Bank launched its €1.1 trillion ($1.26 trillion) quantitative-easing program.\nGerman bunds With its dovish statement, the Fed fueled concerns about global growth, highlighting that “recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat.” This triggered a flight to safety, which helped prop up German government bonds. Gold GCZ5, +2.00% — another haven asset — also rallied, rising 1.7% to $1,135.60.
