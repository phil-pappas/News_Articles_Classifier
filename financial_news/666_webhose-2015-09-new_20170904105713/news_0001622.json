Yesterday the mining stock plummeted by 30pc after broker Investec warned its equity value could “evaporate”. \nMike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, said: “The negative opening call comes after yesterday’s 2-3pc losses in Europe and the US spilled over into Asia overnight, where the retreat was even sharper as resources-focused names suffered from the ‘Glencore rout’ and intensification of widespread commodity price concerns from a slowing China and global supply glut.” \nMeanwhile, Wolseley became the biggest casualty on the FTSE after it lowered its outlook for revenue growth . The company said it expects industrial markets in North America to remain challenging. * Excitement bubbles up on formal bid chatter for SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) \nEuropean shares also tumbled into negative territory for a second day, with the CAC in Paris off by 1.5pc and the German DAX 1.4pc lower. \nOvernight, Asian shares plunged to three-and-a-half year lows dragged down by sharp losses on Wall Street and continued concerns about weak data from China. \nThe Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.2pc, while Japan’s Nikkei ended the session 4pc lower. \nMr van Dulken said: “Chinese stocks are facing their worst quarter since 1998 amid a commodities sell-off and growth uncertainty for the world’s second largest economy.” * Global markets head into most dangerous month of the year on a wing and a prayer In the US, stock markets fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Index off by 1.9pc, while the S&P 500 hit a one-month low, down 2.6pc. \nHowever, on Monday, New York Fed president William Dudley signalled that the US central bank remained on track for an interest rate rise by the end of the year. \n“With global markets increasingly fragile amid loudening cries of equity over-valuations, irresponsible borrowing and a looming catastrophe, perhaps higher interest rates are what’s needed to take things down a peg or two,” Mr van Dulken concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:48:27.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
