Adam McLean Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Top 10 industry fund First State Super is divesting its socially responsible funds from all companies that source more than 20 per cent of their operating revenue from the production, sale and distribution of coal, oil and gas.\nThe new screen applies to its socially responsible fund (SRI) with up to $200 million held in Australian equities, and could apply it to its second SRI fund, which has about $300 million in global equities, by December. Member\nThe decision, announced to members late on Wednesday, is a win for the divestment campaign.\nFirst State Super's chief investment officer, Richard Brandweiner, told Fairfax Media that the move was part of the fund's risk management strategy, and \"was not in response to lobbying pressure\".\nBut divestment campaigners says First State Super has bowed to pressure from members, driven by the Victorian state branch.\nFirst State Super was also looking to \"proactively invest in renewable energy\", and assessing how to deal with climate change risk across its $52 billion portfolio, Mr Brandweiner said.\n\"We've been working for the past 12 to 18 months on trying to build a better understanding of the implications of climate change and fossil fuels across our portfolios and the implications of climate change on company earnings into the future,\" he said.\n\"A lot of this pre-dates any contact we've had from various lobby groups. It's about resilience, not about screening.\"\n The fund's management has been talking to investors in its two SRI funds, which are \"very well supported\" and house $500 million between them.\n\"We are increasingly of the view that the options (the SRIs) should reflect the expectations of the members. It was not in response to particular lobbying pressure, it was based on our belief of what members who choose a socially responsible fund would be looking for.\"\nIn a letter to members, First State Super said the move would \"exclude companies that source more than 20 per cent of their operating revenues from the production, sale and distribution of fossil fuels, including thermal and coking coal, oil, natural gas, transmission or transportation for the purpose of exporting and/or non-household use (e.g. power generation)\".\nThe fund also said it would also exclude companies that explore and or develop fossil fuel reserves, or have a substantial involvement in coal seam gas fracking.\nIsaac Astill, a divestment campaigner at 350.org says the campaign was driven by members working in the health sector, particularly nurses and doctors.\n\"Members were concerned about the adverse health affects of coal and coal seam gas,\" Mr Astill said. \"Coal dust is particularly damaging.\"\n\"It was a grassroots push.\"\nNewcastle, home of the world's biggest coal port, became Australia's seventh council to shun fossil fuels late last month. Earlier this year, the University of Sydney, with the country's largest educational portfolio at $1.4 billion, said it was divesting from companies with heavy carbon emissions.\nCity of Melbourne, Albury City Council and Mount Alexander council, in the Victorian goldfields region, will also review whether to divest or pull money from institutions, including the big four banks, that fund fossil fuels projects.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-09-10T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:04:36.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
