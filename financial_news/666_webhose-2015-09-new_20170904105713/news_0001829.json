Thirty-year bonds gained 26/32 in price to \nyield 2.95 percent, down from 2.99 percent. \nThe yield curve also flattened as investors prepared for a \npossible rate increase. The gap (NYSE: GPS - news ) between five-year note and \n30-year bond yields flattened to 142 basis points \nfrom 144 basis points on Thursday. \n\"Investors are trying to get into flattening trades because \ntheir perception is that if the Fed doesn't tighten next week \nthey will tighten sometime this year,\" said di Galoma. \nThe completion of heavy new issuance of Treasury and \ncorporate debt also helped bonds rally, although a number of \ncompanies are still expected to sell new debt on Friday. \nThe government sold $58 billion in new coupon-bearing supply \nthis week, while investment-grade companies have sold more than \n$50 billion in high-grade debt so far this week. \nData on Friday showed that U.S. producer prices were flat in \nAugust, pointing to benign inflation pressures that could weigh \non the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates \nnext week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:40:52.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
