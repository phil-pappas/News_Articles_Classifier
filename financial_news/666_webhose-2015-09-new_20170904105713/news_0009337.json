The stocks together contributed a hefty 92 negative points to the Nikkei, accounting for about a third of the index's losses.\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank had set the tone for foreign exchange majors by affirming its readiness to provide the euro zone with another dose of stimulus.\nTraders also said that investors were also wary ahead of the key U.S. jobs report later in the day as markets continued to size up data to gauge when the Federal Reserve would start raising interest rates.\nExporters were mostly lower, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 2.5 percent and Panasonic Corp dropping 3.9 percent.\nBanks also lost ground, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropping 2.6 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 3.1 percent.\nThe underlying sentiment in the market remained fragile, traders said, noting persistent worries about the Chinese economy.\nIn the last week, net selling of Japanese cash and futures stocks by foreign investors hit a record high as they shunned riskier assets on worries that a China-led slowdown could hurt global growth.\nThe broader Topix and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 both dropped 1.7 percent.
