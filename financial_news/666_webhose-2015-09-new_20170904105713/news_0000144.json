Photo: Pablo Veiga\nIn an increasingly crowded fitness market, a physician and a personal trainer have joined forces to run an enterprise.\nWe take a holistic approach but are biased towards strength training.\nJoe Pemberton Jonathan Gordon and Joe Pemberton started Aeonics when they saw a gap in the market.\n\"Many popular training methods are not necessarily healthy as they try and fit each unique individual into a generic program, and many health professionals do not necessarily understand fitness and exercise as they don't have training in it,\" Pemberton says.\nAdvertisement \"We have carved out a niche at the intersection of health and fitness, by combining our expertise in fitness with clinical knowledge in health.\"\nGordon, who grew up in Canada, and Pemberton have known each other for years. As they moved on in their careers, they witnessed others suffering from lifestyle-related illnesses.\n\"We knew the status quo was ineffective as spending on health and fitness is currently at record levels, but levels of diabetes, obesity and heart disease continue to rise,\" says Pemberton, who previously owned Joey's Fitness in Sydney. \"A different approach was needed so we put our heads together and came up with Aeonics.\"\nPemberton says their philosophy is all about training for life. \"This means we train for the purpose of making our lives better. We take a holistic approach but are biased towards strength training.\"\nBusiness Review Australia forecast that the fitness industry in Australia is anticipated to be worth more than $1.5 billion in 2016.\nAccording to Fitness Australia, there are more than 25,840 registered professionals, more than 1540 registered fitness businesses and almost 1850 sole trading businesses in the country.\nSydney-based Aeonics' business model focuses around six-month programs for which clients can pay in full or by the month. Within those realms, they can do one, two, three or four one-on-one coaching sessions a week and the prices vary based on that. After a six-month program, clients can continue training for a monthly payment.\nPemberton says they are aiming for 100 per cent revenue growth each year.\n\"Our most important KPI is the number of sessions per week,\" he says.\nTheir first challenge in setting up the business was obtaining enough capital to get the idea off the ground. Pemberton says it cost them about $100,000 to set up. \"We were lucky enough to have extremely supportive family and friends who believed in our idea and were willing to back us financially.\n\"Once we were set up with a fully fitted premises, we needed clients. Being such a niche product meant that we needed to be very targeted in our marketing. We found word of mouth and referrals from health professionals were the best options.\"\nAs demand increases and they develop their human capital, Aeonics would love to expand its business across the country.\n\"As far as we know nobody else is doing a medically inspired strength program like what we are,\" Pemberton says of competitors. \"We are quite unique in that regard. The combination of a personal trainer and a doctor is hard to replicate, and I haven't seen it replicated.\"\nOne of their high-profile clients is elite swimmer James Magnussen.\n\"The principles we implement with a frail 90-year-old are exactly the same as we would with an Olympic athlete. The thing that changes is the implementation and scaling of the volume and intensity of their training.\n\"James is chasing performance out of the very limits of human capability.\" Other clients may just want to feel a bit better and get a bit stronger.\nThamsin Dunn, master coach of fitness and first aid at the Australian Institute of Fitness, says science plays a large role in personal training. \"A lot of personal trainers might not realise it, but all of the information that they were taught in the early days and all of their respective guidelines that they follow come from basic exercise science principles,\" she says.\nThe medical knowledge that has filtered into personal training has come through the exercise science that we've learnt, Dunn says. \"Now personal training is becoming commonplace for people who suffer from specific conditions and really strictly most of the Australian population falls into one of those specific conditions. So they either have a chronic disease or they are in the pre-disease state.\"\nDunn says not enough medical knowledge has filtered into personal training. \"I think personal training tends to see itself more aligned with the sport and recreation industries rather than allied health and there isn't a free flow of information between both.\"\nShe says over the last two to three years, the biggest fitness trend to emerge is small group training. \"Small groups are a lot more affordable and particularly in places like Sydney personal training can be anywhere upwards of $100 an hour.\n\"People can go along to a small group class and get a really nice personalised service for $10-$20.\"\nAdelaide-based Dunn says the scope is excellent for budding entrepreneurs. \"Where a lot of entrepreneurs in the fitness industry go wrong is they don't understand that fitness is very fickle, and the trends change about every two years.\n\"An entrepreneur needs to have built into their business model almost a rebranding and a re-identification of their business and their product every couple of years to make sure they stay relevant.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:53:58.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
