They also accused the NAPSAS handlers of deception as the hands-on experience in power companies they promised didn't happen. \nIn a reaction, NAPTIN's spokesman, Lawal Umar Muhammad said the institute only handled the training aspect of the programme and not the payment of trainees. He said the payment and other financial matters was strictly the responsibility of the ministry of power. \nWhile Mrs. Williams, Coordinator of the scheme could not be physically reached, her mobile line too has since refused to connect in our efforts to get her side of the story. \nBut the ministry responding to Daily Trust said the claims from the trainees are not factual. Its spokesman, Timothy Oyedeji said the amount approved was N1,323,200,000 an approximate figure of N1.3billion which he said was not fully released due to 'budgetary constraints'. \n\"Even at that, the approved sum is a far cry from the alleged N3.6 billion purported embezzled by the Ministry of Power officials,\" Oyedeji noted. \nIn the breakdown, the ministry said it paid in full for the training design module cost to NAPTIN and the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) while N340million was released for the nation-wide exercise. \nThe ministry said those who attended lectures and wrote the final examination were captured in the Audit trail and \"are getting paid as money has now been made available to the Ministry. Already quite a substantial number of trainees have been paid or about to be paid as the exercise is an on-going one.\" \nOyedeji said 675 of the trainees have been engaged in the Generation, Transmission and Distribution value chain, dismissing report that no trainee has been engaged.
