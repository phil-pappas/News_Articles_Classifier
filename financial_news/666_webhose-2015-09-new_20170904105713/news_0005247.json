Warming needs to be limited to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels to avoid the most devastating consequences in the form of droughts and rising sea levels, scientists say.\n\"Even if this goal is not fully reached, every step in this direction is better than no result at all,\" said Peter Hoeppe, head of Geo Risks Research at reinsurer Munich Re.\nIn the meantime, there must be increasing focus on preventive measures such as flood defenses that can help dampen the rise in insurance premiums in the medium to long term, Hoeppe said.\nInsurers and Group of Seven industrialised countries are working to expand the availability of insurance to an additional 400 million people in developing countries considered at high risk.\n\"Climate change is happening, no question,\" said XL Group's Chief Executive, Mike McGavick.\n\"Insurers and reinsurers have to be at the forefront of transferring that risk,\" McGavick said.
