Share on twitter by Robert Harley Australia's Real Estate Investment Trusts delivered solid results last month with no surprises, reasonable growth, and more increases in earnings and distribution to come.\nBut they were smashed. Worse, the pain has continued into September with the top 17 stocks dropping a further 1.4 per cent in the past two days.\nSo is there a problem beyond the global rout on equities? Are the REITs being repriced because of fears of a slowdown in global growth, or conversely because of the coming rise in US rates? Or simply because commercial property has just run too hard?\nNot according to the analysts I spoke with. For them, the micro is good. It is the global macro that is tossing the REITs around.\nCLSA analyst, Sholto Maconochieâ€‹, said the A-REITs looked fine with average earnings growth this expected to be 5 to 6 per cent, with low gearing around 30 per cent and with an average sector yield of around 5.4 per cent.\n\"The REITs are still a good place to be,\" he says. \"What is [weighing] the sector down are the macro issues and the weaker China. It is sentiment driven.\"\nChris Reich, a principal of CBRE Clarion Securities, one of the world's largest investors in global REITS says that despite the the market's nervousness of what rising US interest rates and/or recent events in China will mean for short-term stock performance, CBRE Clarion remains \"constructive\" on the prospects for global real estate securities.\n\"Economic growth is modestly expanding in most developed markets around the globe, while generally low levels of new construction suggest that owners of existing properties should continue to enjoy improved pricing power,\" he says\n \"The spreads between cap rates and 10-year sovereign bond yields remain at wide levels, which suggests that there is plenty of 'cushion' to absorb some further increase in bond yields.\n\"Demand for real estate remains high from various pools of capital, including institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and listed property companies.\n\"With listed property companies trading at a discount to private market values and M&A activity heating up, listed real estate looks attractive.\"\nClarion expects low double-digit total returns over the next twelve months, supported by 3-4 per cent dividend yields and 6-7 per cent earnings growth.\n\"The risks to our outlook are more macro in nature, rather than real estate specific, such as a hard landing in China and the implications that may have for global economic growth; however, that is not our base case as we believe that China has ample tools at its disposal to help manage its economic trajectory.\"\nPreference for exposure to retail In Australia, Clarion's preference is for stocks with exposure to improving retail sales, cap rate compression, and/or M&A potential.\nKim Wright, the global real estate strategist for UBS, says the looming rise in rates by the US Federal Reserve is \"not necessarily\" a negative catalyst for the REIT markets.\n\"Looking at the last Fed rate hike cycle of 2004-06, the listed real estate universe, corrected 15 per cent going into the first rate hike, then performed very well, outperforming equities through the balance of the rate hike cycle,\" she says.\n\"How the listed real estate universe performs around the Fed rate hike will depend more on how 10-year treasury yields react to the Fed rate hikes,\" she says. \"Listed real estate performance is currently move sensitive (or correlated) to movements in 10-year treasury yields than we would normally be.\"\nWright says that the best performance in periods of Fed rate hikes comes from stocks with the strongest earnings growth.\n\"We remain overweight the UK and Continental Europe. In the case of the UK REITs, we are seeing very strong Net Asset Value growth from rental growth and value-creation through their development pipelines. In fact many of the London focused UK REITs delivered more than 20 per cent NAV growth. We expect another 10-14 per cent uplift in NAV from current development pipelines. \"\nrharley@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-09-02T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:09:58.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
