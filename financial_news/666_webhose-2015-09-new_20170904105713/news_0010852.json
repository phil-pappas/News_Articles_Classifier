Once you’ve got a high net-worth, it’s not that hard to build more wealth. It’s not a given, but it’s way easier than when you’re getting started. It’s for this reason that the most important investments you’ll ever make in your life all happen early on. \nI should point out, though, that not all investments are financial. Everything you choose to do with your time is an allocation of resources that you’re making, even if that resource is nothing more than time. Time is a really powerful thing. \nIf you’ve got a good body and mind, you can do a lot with your time. So considering all of this, here are my three most important investments that you’ll ever make in your life. Learning . The ability to learn and teach yourself is perhaps to most important lesson that you can acquire during your education. Some people don’t even learn this in a school setting. I didn’t. I was smart enough, but I was a pretty unremarkable student. I always liked learning, just about stuff that mattered to me, which wasn’t school. Eventually, I started to learn the value of knowledge, and started acquiring it for its own sake. So to me, this is the most fundamental investment that a person can make in their future. It’s taking interest the world, and wanting to understand it, be a part of it. It’s an interest that gives way to a whole host of healthy living tactics. Finance . Finance was one of those school subjects I didn’t care at all about when I was a teenager. But when I got a little older, got married, bought a house, it became necessary for me to take responsibility for my money, or else tread financial water for the rest of my life. I had to learn how to eliminate debt and start investing. I started some early Forex investments , then grew into retirement investment like mutual funds and an IRA. So this is the second most important investment. It’s a conscious decision that you act upon to take money and put it into places where it will grow. Debt. This is the inverse of #2. At some point I had to decide to stop living in debt. This is the only way to make savings and investments pay off. So I invested all of my extra income into debt reduction measures, and within a couple of years I had no more debt at all. If you’re in debt, this is the most important investment you can make right now, for your time and money. \nIf you do these things, you’ll have a lot of beneficial investments to make in your life. It takes a while, but all of these smart investments start to pay off in ways that you notice in your life, long before you become out-and-out wealthy. \nYou’ll start to notice that you don’t have to worry about bills, you’ll be able to spend more time on stuff you enjoy, and you’ll worry less about the future. But all of those good things are built upon a few first investments that grow to build the life you want. \nFiled Under: Investing http://hellosuckers.net/ Jenna Lloyd \nI would say that I’m already beginning my investment journey by researching how to manage my money more effectively – it’s time well spent! \nI hear a lot about Forex investments, perhaps this is a good place to start? drkgood \nYes, yes, and yes! I always say that the best investment you can ever make is in yourself. The education gap is driving the income gap deeper all the time. We should strive to always work on learning something new.
