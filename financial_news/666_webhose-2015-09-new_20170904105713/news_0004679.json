More comprehensive payrolls data is due on Friday.\nInvestors fear that reduced consumption from China will exacerbate a fall in oil prices and keep consumer price growth muted, putting pressure on the ECB to expand its 1 trillion euro asset purchase programme targeted to end next September. The central bank is expected to cut its inflation forecasts at Thursday's policy meeting.\nA measure of long-term market inflation expectations watched closely by the ECB fell to 1.69 percent on Wednesday from 1.74 percent on Tuesday, retreating further from the ECB inflation target of just below 2 percent.\nSome said the ECB may also flag an extension to its bond-buying quantitative easing (QE) programme beyond its scheduled end date in September 2016 to try and reassure investors of its commitment to its inflation target.\n\"I don't expect there to be any substantial change in policy, but you might at a pinch see some kind of changing to the wording of the QE programme,\" said Ben May, lead euro zone economist at Oxford Economics.\n\"The ECB might drop the reference to September 2016 and perhaps hint it might be more open-ended.\"\nGerman 10-year yields, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, were 2 basis points down at 0.79 percent, retreating from a two-week high of 0.82 percent hit on Monday after oil prices rallied 8 percent before reversing course. Yields on other top-rated bonds were down a similar amount.\nFED CONUNDRUM\nWith U.S. employment data missing forecasts on Wednesday, investors are awaiting Friday's non-farm payrolls data to try to determine whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its policy meeting towards the end of the month.\nThe prospects for a September U.S. rate rise have been clouded by the recent rout in Chinese markets and slide in oil prices, which has dampened inflation expectations globally.\n\"Our house view is that the Fed stays at the sidelines until December,\" said Rabobank senior rate strategist Richard McGuire.\n\"I see the risks tilted toward a later rather than a sooner move given the risk the disinflationary forces emanating from emerging markets are likely to remain a thorn in developed world central banks' (side) for some time to come,\" he told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.\nThe firmer tone in fixed income and a recent rise supported demand at a German auction of 3.1 billion euros of five-year paper.\nPortugal also sold 3 billion euros of a new seven-year bond via syndication, with orders topping 5 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters markets information service IFR.\nPortugal 10-year yields were down 6 bps on the day at 2.69 percent with Italian and Spanish equivalents down 1 bps at 1.99 percent and 2.13 percent , respectively.
