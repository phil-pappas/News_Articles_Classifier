Photo: Robert Bayer 123RF\nFor obvious reasons, I'm not qualified to write about menopause from personal experience. Neither am I brave enough to write about it anecdotally. So this week's article, on the ways in which it affects women at work, will instead rely on three studies, each of which has been conducted over the past year.\nLet's begin with the most recent, an analysis published a few months ago in Climacteric, an academic journal released by the International Menopause Society. The researchers reviewed all the research conducted to date on the impact of menopause on working women. Attempting such a task wasn't as herculean as you might think since, for some reason, this area hasn't received much scholarly attention so far.\nThis neglect is especially peculiar when you consider several factors. First, women now constitute about half the workforce. Second, they're staying there longer, thanks in part to the ever-extending date of retirement. And third, many more are returning to work after doing the stereotypical duty of raising the kids.\nAnyway, what the researchers discovered was that approximately 50 per cent of menopausal women find it a struggle to deal with the consequences of their \"hormonal chaos\" while at the same time performing well in their job.\nAdvertisement For example, many are prone to hot flashes, which are deemed stressful and embarrassing when they occur while delivering a presentation or participating in a meeting. Then there's the tiredness, depression, headaches, mood changes, anxiety, lower self esteem, memory lapses, aches and pains and diminished concentration, all of which are apparently characteristic of menopausal women and are made worse by the additional pressures imposed by a demanding career.\nSome of those pressures are environmental. The analysis pointed the finger most prominently at high office temperatures, poor ventilation, inadequate bathroom facilities and poor access to drinking water.\nSimilar findings were reported this time last year by La Trobe Business School and Monash University. Their study of 839 women found the more frequently they experienced menopausal symptoms, the more likely they were to be disengaged at work, dissatisfied with their job and on the verge of resigning.\nFor a lucky few, the combination of work and menopause was a positive experience. Some saw it as liberating: \"I can't be f***ed pleasing people so much anymore,\" said one respondent. Others saw it as a time of self-reflection, an opportunity to ponder their choices in life. \"My career was going up,\" remarked a post-menopausal participant on the coincidence of her menopause and a promotion she'd desired.\nMany more, however, used words such as 'invisible' to describe the stigma with which they were freshly associated. This stemmed from the unfortunate double whammy of being both female and older in age. They were suddenly overlooked and ignored. \"It's more a disappearing of women,\" said one respondent who reflected on the declining presence of senior females in her workplace.\nThat's why, when the participants were asked if formal policies on menopause would be a good move, a majority emphatically said 'no' because that would further marginalise women and give their detractors one more reason to put up barriers. Better recommendations included:\nFlexibility to work on days when symptoms are not so severe. Autonomy to reschedule meetings and manage their own time. Support networks through which female employees can connect. Information packs for colleagues. Training for managers. Adaptable workspaces and the availability of desk fans. A move away from overly sedentary work methods. And one more suggestion, this one from the third and final study I wanted to share with you, released last year by the University of North Carolina. The finding was a simple one. Basically, the online discussion board seems to be \"the best way\" for menopausal women to access support because it provides a safe, accessible and anonymous space on which to share workplace challenges.\nSo, on that note, over to youâ€¦\nWhat are your experiences of menopause and work?
