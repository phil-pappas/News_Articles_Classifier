PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Sep 20, 2015 GETTY If you spend between £100 and £30,000 the card issuer is equally liable for any losses \nFood poisoning, dodgy hotels, ill health, accidents, dirty swimming pools, delayed flights and theft can cast a long shadow over what should have been one of the highlights of the year. If your summer getaway was a five-star travel disaster, you may be able to seek financial redress from your tour operator, travel agent, airline, insurer or even your credit card issuer. One problem Brits face when travelling abroad is that we really do not like making a scene. Bob Atkinson at TravelSupermarket.com says: “We are far more likely to put up with bad food or service than risk ruining the holiday mood by taking action.”Complaints are easier to resolve if you act on the spot, he says, by calmly reporting any problems with your flight, hotel or the food. It helps if you have booked a package holiday, as you can talk to your local rep or tour operator, who should be keen to sort out any problems. Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief at personal finance website Money.co.uk, says you should turn technology to your advantage by taking photos or videos of problems such as filthy facilities.

Be prepared to pursue your case in the UK, by making a full complaint to your travel company within 28 days. “Putting your complaint in writing or sending an email with attached photos gives your travel agent or tour operator less wriggle room,” says Maundrell. “Avoid ranting but stick to the facts. Include details such as the date and time of your complaint, the names of people you spoke to, and receipts for any extras you had to pay for.” \nMost reputable companies should have a dispute resolution process, but do not let them fob you off with, for instance, discounts on your next booking. Maundrell says: “You are protected by clear rights that mean you may be able to get compensation and reimbursement for any additional costs that you have incurred.” Swap phone numbers and email addresses with any other aggrieved tourists to back up your case Hannah Maundrell of Money.co.uk \nIf you booked via a travel company or tour operator then check whether it is registered with the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) or Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO), which offer arbitration schemes for unresolved complaints. GET COVER The growing number of Britons who book DIY holidays after searching for flights and hotels online have far less protection, but you can give yourself greater cover if you book using your credit card. If you spend between £100 and £30,000 the card issuer is equally liable for any losses under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. So if your budget airline or hotel went bust, you may be able to claim compensation. However, this does not apply to debit card purchases. If you have travel insurance, check whether you can claim for any problems on that. \nKevin Pratt, insurance expert at MoneySupermarket.com, says: “You can claim for cancellation, emergency medical treatment and lost or stolen possessions.” \nHowever, your travel insurance will not cover everything. “Many policies do not cover extreme sports automatically and most insurers will query claims that arise after excessive alcohol consumption,” he adds. Again, you should try to claim within 28 days of any incident, and provide local police reports in cases of theft or robbery.
