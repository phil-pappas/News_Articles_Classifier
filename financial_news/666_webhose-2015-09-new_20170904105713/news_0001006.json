Louise Kennerley by Marianna Papadakis Law students are so desperate to gain their first break into the field they are increasingly competing for unpaid internships offered by \"predatory\" law firms and organisations that exploit students as \"slave labour\".\nOr is it simply that the relationship between employers and employees has shifted culturally with students being far less willing these days to do the yard hards of free work experience that many were expected to do, and did so unquestioningly, 10 years to 20 years ago.\n'Predatory' business practices According to a submission by the Australian Law Students' Association to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the workplace relations framework, \"predatory or exploitative\" business practices targeting \"desperate\" law students has evolved from a contraction in employment in the legal sector amidst a rise in the intake of students at law schools in the past decade.\nALSA vice-president Marie Iskander said more students were willing or under pressure to accept unpaid work including paralegal and administrative roles at mid-to-large Australian legal firms that would previously have been offered as paid employment.\n\"There are more students who are so desperate they are willing to pay for their own position,\" Ms Iskander said.\n\"It's getting to a point where those who can afford to do unpaid work on top of their studies are favoured when others who support themselves and don't have the economic means to do unpaid work are disadvantaged.\"\nA report by Ernst & Young last December, commissioned by The College of Law, found there were around 8300 new graduates a year of which around 6250 or 75 per cent went on to seek admission to the profession.\n Culture of entitlement Managing principal at People + Culture Strategies, Joydeep Hor said graduates, regardless of how talented they were, were far less giving of their time and energy and far more demanding in terms of what they expected these days, even if it came at the price of long term career prospects or career progression.\nA move towards a culture of entitlement in the past decade changed the relationship between employers and employees, he said. There was less loyalty because people often did not come to any job for more than a few years.\n\"Self-interest dominates,\" Mr Hor said.\n\"Most of us entering the work force a decade ago would not have battered an eye lid at doing work experience and 20 years ago people would have rightly thought employers had more leverage in the employment relationship.\"\nBut Mr Hor said he did not advocate employers failing to comply with legal or ethical obligations.\n\"Where a firm is not deriving any profit or revenue from having someone on board and are providing experience for those people, that's a different proposition,\" he said.\n\"If firms are looking to charge people out at ridiculous amounts for their time, but not willing to pay anything for it, that's tipping a balance too much in their favour in terms of what they are deriving by way of returns.\"\n'Slavery' Marque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley said arguments rationalising the practice of work experiences were no different from those that would justify importing domestic servants into Australia and paying them starvation wages, or just giving them food and board.\n\"We used to actually call that slavery. It's one of the rare areas where the law accurately aligns with basic morality,\" he said.\nMr Bradley said arguments concerning the oversupply of graduates versus less demand in terms of available jobs were specious.\n\"Say we said yes it's ok to give law students their practical legal training on an unpaid basis so they can get qualified? Then what? They go from unemployed law graduates to unemployed lawyers,\" he said.\n\"Same rationale would then justify continuing to give them 'work experience' without pay, indefinitely.\"\nGeneral admin Around 66 per cent of 106 students who were surveyed by ALSA had undertaken unpaid work experience, with some describing it as \"slave labour\" and the majority saying it had not helped them to gain a paid position.\nThe submission to the Productivity Commission cited a Victorian firm which recently advertised for two law students to join as long-term volunteers doing receptionist and general administrative duties.\nOne respondent to ALSA's survey said: \"I spent more time doing filing and office work than valuable networking. After nearly six months they still did not offer me paid work, or even travel subsidies.\"\nAnother South Adelaide company now under investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman, Adlawgroup, offered students two year placements at a cost of $22,000.", "external_links": ["http://www.scribd.com/doc/281723171/ALSA-Submission-to-Productivity-Commission", "https://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/gds/GDS-COL-2014.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-23T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:07:29.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
