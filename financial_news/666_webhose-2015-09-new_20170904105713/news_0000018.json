Andrew Meares by Alan Mitchell When Malcolm Turnbull and his new ministry emerge from the haze of victory, all the old problems will be waiting: the budget deficit, the Senate, tax reform and the need for renewed microeconomic reform to boost productivity.\nAustralia must have fiscal and other microeconomic reform if it wants to maintain solidly rising living standards and a strong social safety net. But, unlike John Howard, Turnbull will not have the booming revenues to compensate the losers from reform.\nHe will need all his persuasive powers and the ruthlessness to burn his own \"rusted-on\" supporters who, unlike the Abbott battlers, have nowhere else to go.\nThe challenge facing Turnbull is entirely political. There is no real disagreement about the basics of what must be done, at least among the experts who crowded into two summits – one on tax reform sponsored by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG, and the other on competition policy – in Sydney on Tuesday.\nFor Turnbull, the reform options are fairly limited: they are tax, industrial relations and competition policy.\nFortunately Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey have prepared the way. In the case of tax, the premiers appear to have softened to the idea that they must raise more of the money they spend, support an expanded GST or both.\nEquity argument crucial However, as the ACTU president, Ged Kearney, argued at the tax summit, the discussion over equity will be crucial to selling tax reform to voters.\n A proposal by the economist Saul Eslake – that the federal government also broaden the personal income tax base – might appeal to both Kearney and the new prime minister. That would be a case of Turnbull burning his own supporters but, in return, they would get lower personal income tax rates and a cut in company profits tax.\nCompetition policy reform so far has been very largely ignored in the political debate, but it will be crucial to reining in the budget deficit and boosting productivity growth.\nOnce, competition policy reform meant cutting tariffs and privatising government monopolies such as Telstra and the electricity generators. Now it holds the key to budget reform.\nAbbott tried to cut the budget back into surplus in a surprise post-election attack on government spending, but ran into a hostile Senate. Now Turnbull must genuinely reform the budget by finding better and more selective ways to provide government services.\nThat is where Ian Harper's competition policy review comes in.\nLight on 'deep specifics' The Harper committee's report is light on what Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris calls the \"deep specifics\" of public spending reform.\nBut, as Harris told the competition policy summit, the value of the Harper report lies in the directions it proposes for change – particularly the application of competition principles-based thinking to areas such as health and other human services, roads and urban planning.\nHarper argues for a \"presumption of choice\" in human services to put users in control of the services they access and to drive service providers to become more responsive to individual requirements.\nThis is a broad approach. It could be, for example, about competitive markets in the provision of public healthcare, as proposed by the Bennett inquiry for the Rudd government, or it could be the partial conversion of traditional road taxes into user-pays road charges, as suggested by Harper.\nThis is a route to reform and productivity growth in the still largely unreformed general government sector. And the potential gains are very large, not least because of the amount of spending involved.\nFor example, governments are preparing to spend billions of dollars more on public infrastructure, yet it is difficult to know what additional infrastructure we need if we don't first properly charge for the use of the infrastructure we already have.\nBureaucratic netherworld But, before anything can happen, the Harper report first needs to be rescued from the bureaucratic netherworld to which it is in the process of being assigned.\nAs Harris says, a commonwealth-state process is central to any meaningful reform.\nThe Council of Australian Governments has met since the report was finalised, and the Harper report was noted. But that's all.\n\"It is rare to recover bureaucratically from the fate of being noted by COAG,\" Harris says.\nIndeed, probably only Turnbull can save it, and he would be foolish not to.\nAlan Mitchell is The Australian Financial Review 's economics editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:42:43.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
