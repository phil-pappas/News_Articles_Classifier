Karl Hilzinger by Jeremy Chunn Most individuals struggle to explain how they might trade off theoretical reward with the chance of loss. Intuitive choices are often found to be the wrong ones. It's just too hard to engage the brain.\nWhen a client faces a financial adviser, however, a \"risk profile\" questionnaire is pulled out of the bottom drawer with the expectation it will reveal the unknown. But the profiling exercise between adviser and client is \"broken\", says Professor Shachar Kariv, chair of the economics department at University of California Berkeley and chief scientist at global decision science firm Capital Preferences. How broken? \"Suppose a doctor would operate on you based on how you tell the doctor you feel,\" he says. \"It's broken to that level.\"\nKariv has developed a scoring system which applies mathematical rigour to deliver \"revealed preferences\", from which a client's \"indifference curve\" can be plotted.\nThe indifference curve plots the expected return for a defined level of risk, and the relationship is curved because there is a point at which we just won't push our luck any more. In portfolio theory, the perfect mix of assets is the point where your indifference curve meets the portfolio which gets the best returns for the lowest risk.\nShachar Kariv has developed a scoring system which applies mathematical rigour to deliver \"revealed preferences\", from which a client's \"indifference curve\" can be plotted. Supplied In the realm of economics there are three trade-offs in life: risk versus return (the trade-off plotted in the indifference curve); today versus tomorrow, and; self versus others. Decisions about retirement savings involve all three trade-offs.\nTrivial We solve these trade-offs, Kariv says, by having preferences. \"And without knowing these preferences there is no way for me to give you financial advice.\" Understanding these preferences is not trivial, however. The way it is generally approached, using a \"risk profile\" questionnaire, is about as good as licking your index finger and sticking it in the air, Kariv reckons.\nThere is no mathematical model for writing a risk assessment questionnaire, says Kariv, and so any data produced is subjective. \"Usually the surveys will put you on some scale between zero and 10 and tell you that you are six.\" But without a rigorous methodology who can argue the correct score is not seven? Or five? \"Not to mention that surveys are also very tedious,\" he says. \"When you give someone questions about something they cannot articulate, it's annoying.\"\n Instead, it is an individual's actions that reveal the truth. Kariv's model asks respondents to make decisions by choosing points on a series of trade-off lines. \"And from this we can recover your preferences.\" What was theoretical becomes measurable.\nThe experiment requires 15 rounds of game play and attributes six \"preference scores\": economic rationality, risk tolerance, loss aversion, ambiguity aversion, present bias and preferred return.\nAfter testing thousands of subjects in the United States the method found people do not become more risk averse as they age, they become more loss averse. Also, a score one standard deviation from the mean upwards in economic rationality is associated with between 15 and 19 per cent more household wealth.\nThe ideal consumer described in economics textbooks, or Homo economicus , is rare on this earth, Kariv says. \"[If the test scores show] you are too far from Homo economicus then you don't have economic preferences, so we need to take the other measures with a grain of salt.\"\nBrainwashing There are a few surprises. A respondent who displayed infinite risk aversion would have an indifference curve that hugged the vertical axis, where risk is zero. \"There is no curve; he is infinitely risk-averse,\" says Kariv, who was in Australia last week to present his research to the financial adviser groups, banks and super funds.\nAnother respondent's decision appears like a shotgun blast of apparently random points that, to Kariv, actually illustrates a consumer who maximises \"what we call log Van Neumann Morgenstern expected utility, which is basically the normative thing for people to do. If I gave this experiment to one of my PhD students this is what I would expect him to do after I had brainwashed him for a long time.\"\nOn the topic of brainwashing, a portfolio doesn't only reflect the investor's preferences but also the adviser's influence. With Kariv's model, that shouldn't happen. If client and adviser are both tested, they will be matched for the best probability of success.\nHe says the method of profiling preferences is being used by Google to construct optimal teams, so members are not too identical, not too opposed, but just different enough to complement each other.\n\"Sometimes social capital is more than the sum of the parts of the human capital and sometimes it's less,\" he says. \"When you match an adviser and a client you need to think there is a good match between their preferences.\"\nCapital Preferences is discussing the profiling approach with firms in the US, United Kingdom and Germany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:52:39.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
