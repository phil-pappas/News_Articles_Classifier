Details can be found at http://www.sbrefunds.com/dallas\n\"The JOBS Act passing has changed the marketplace. The explosion of the ’hidden asset class’ has left it wide open to opportunity,\" said Fairway America’s CEO Matt Burk. \"We're excited to have a number of talented fund managers present at the SBRE Investment Summit in Dallas. These presenters are well versed in alternative investments in the real estate sector, and we're delighted to have them provide education on their opportunities to the high net worth accredited investors in attendance,\" he said. “It'll be one of our best events yet!\"\nWhen presenter Greg Hughes was asked about his participation at the Summit, he replied “I don’t know of any other place, seminar or event that puts qualified presenters and accredited investors together all in one place better than a Fairway America SBRE Summit. As a presenter in their last two summits, we find it to be without an equal for us to get in front of investors compared to all the others we have participated in. Plus it is a good time for everyone involved, including spouses, who are so often left out.”\nFairway America has hosted two events attracting fund managers and high net worth investors, who come to educate themselves, network, and to hear about new alternative investment opportunities. “The quality of the people who put it on (Fairway) and the quality of the content and participants is unrivaled.
