CEFC has said it intends to increase its stake in Travel Service to 49.92% over the next few months.\n“The authorized capital of Travel Service will be significantly strengthened as well,” the airline said. “Current shareholders of Travel Service will remain majority owners of the company. CEFC is a strong financial and strategic partner for us that will allow further intensive development of our firm with the potential of making Travel Service into a very strong air carrier in Central and East Europe.”\nTravel Service operates scheduled services under the SmartWings brand, as well as charter and ACMI flights under its own name, with subsidiaries in Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. It operates 32 Boeing 737-800s, two 737-700s, a single 737-900ER and six Airbus A320-200s. It also operates business jet flights with three Cessna Citation 680 Sovereigns. In 2014 the airline carried 5.45 million passengers.\nIt is a major shareholder in the national carrier, Czech Airlines .\nCEFC’s investment is the latest in a series of recent Chinese deals, which have seen Chinese companies taking stakes in France’s Toulouse-Blagnac and Spain’s Ciudad Real airports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:26:00.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
