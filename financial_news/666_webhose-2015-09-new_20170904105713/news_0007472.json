Teleflex Incorporated ( TFX - Get Report ) \nRating: Buy, A+ \nMarket Cap: $5.5 billion \nYear-to-date return: 14.1% \nTeleflex Incorporated designs, develops, manufactures, and supplies single-use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide.\nTheStreet Ratings team rates TELEFLEX INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\"We rate TELEFLEX INC (TFX) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.\"\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nCompared to its closing price of one year ago, TFX's share price has jumped by 26.62%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Turning to the future, naturally, any stock can fall in a major bear market. However, in almost any other environment, the stock should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed nice gains in the past year. TELEFLEX INC's earnings per share declined by 10.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, TELEFLEX INC increased its bottom line by earning $4.09 versus $3.46 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($6.22 versus $4.09). The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.58, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Although the company had a strong debt-to-equity ratio, its quick ratio of 0.92 is somewhat weak and could be cause for future problems. The gross profit margin for TELEFLEX INC is rather high; currently it is at 57.40%. Regardless of TFX's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 9.85% trails the industry average. The revenue fell significantly faster than the industry average of 34.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 3.4%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.

To add to this, CSL has a quick ratio of 1.70, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. The stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Looking ahead, unless broad bear market conditions prevail, we still see more upside potential for this stock, despite the fact that it has already risen over the past year. CARLISLE COS INC has improved earnings per share by 24.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that this trend should continue.

Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 4.9%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

To add to this, BR has a quick ratio of 1.51, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. Investors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company's shares by a sharp 29.27% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index.
