Imagine giving the last person a phone first. Photo: Daniel Munoz\nThe early bird gets the worm, they say â€“ an adage long-despised by the chronically late.\nBut latecomers may now be able to take heart from a research paper published by two economists at the University of Southern Denmark , which proposes to turn the accepted wisdom of first-come, first-served on its head.\nIn a paper titled The curse of the first-in-first-out queue discipline, economists Trine Tornoe Platz and Lars Peter Osterdal argue that the best method of serving a queue is to serve the last person first.\n\"So the last shall be first and the first last.\" Earthquake victims queue for aid in Nepal this year.

Serving the latest arrival first encourages people to arrive at a slower rate, thereby minimising the wait time and producing a more efficient queue. If people arrive at a slower rate than they are served, everyone is served immediately.\nIt's a neat idea, Queensland University of Technology behavioural economist Benno Torgler says, but there's more to life - and economics - than efficiency.\n\"As with many things in life, you have efficiency and you have fairness.\"\nFirst, you would need some sort of system to stop people from continually reallocating themselves to the end of the queue, he says.\nAnd while waiting may not be seen as efficient, it can have unforeseen benefits, Professor Torgler says. For example, people in queues often find other things to do, like making phone calls, checking their email or talking to people around them.\nWaiting also teaches people other skills that benefit society, such as patience and persistence, he says.\n\"Waiting is seen as an effort. You see what happens when someone tries to jump the queue ... People get angry.\n\"It teaches a lesson that you have to put in effort to be successful at life.\"\nIt's also not clear that \"last-come, first-served\" model doesn't introduce other inefficiencies, such as the energy wasted in always having to look around to see who has arrived, Professor Torgler says.\nBut perhaps most importantly, there are good reasons the first-come, first-served model has long prevailed, particularly that it's seen as fair and predictable, he says.\nIn other words, good luck convincing people turning things on their heads would make the better system.\n\"It's good to talk about new ways of doing things, but I'm not entirely convinced that [last-come, first-served] will survive the test of time,\" he says.\nWe may just have to wait and see.", "external_links": ["http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/torgler", "http://findresearcher.sdu.dk/portal/en/person/lpro", "http://findresearcher.sdu.dk/portal/en/person/tto", "http://www.sdu.dk/en/"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:58:43.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
