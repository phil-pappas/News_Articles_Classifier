Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Ben Potter An innovation economist from one of the world's most innovative countries - Israel - has some stark messages for Australia.\nFirst, no country has sustained long term prosperity of the back of resources. Human capital and innovation are the source of all long term economic success.\nSecond, governments can't pick winners or \"growth\" industries or instil entrepreneurial culture in universities. They should fund, and step back.\nThird, Australia should be concerned that it has fallen behind Israel in patent filings, Nasdaq listings and government procurement of technology.\nFourth, don't be a \"paradise\" - like Australia. It makes it more difficult to instil the necessary \"urgency\" in young people.\nFifth, military service can instil the required sense of urgency by thrusting great responsibility onto young people.\nManuel Trajtenberg, a Zionist Union member of the Knesset and professor at Tel Aviv University, told a conference he was unimpressed by Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas's list six \"areas of support\".\n\"He may be right but you know what, he may be wrong. How does he or anyone else know what are going to be the industries of growth in the future?\" Professor Trajtenberg told the Australian Davos Connection Future Summit in Melbourne.\n \"Nobody knows. The market knows - the market at large. But it's not that you can ask the market. So the way to do it is to respond to market signals and not pick winners. You are passive in that sense. Don't try to be hyperactive.\"\nHarsh message The message is confronting for Australia, where the collapse of the mining boom has shrunk incomes and governments are seeking alternative sources of growth.\nThe Victorian government has set up a $200 million Future Industries Fund to support \"high growth, high value industries\" critical to Victoria's future. Urged on by big business, the federal government crowned five \"growth centres\" with $225 million in the May budget.\nBut there are only three common fields: medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, energy, and agriculture. Victoria also favours transport, defence and construction technology, education and professions. The federal government favours advanced manufacturing and mining technology.\nIsrael's economy is ony a quarter the size of Australia's, but it is one of the most innovative in the world. The tiny nation came ninth in global patent filings in 2014, against 15th for Australia, and has the world's highest rate of start-ups relative to economic weight. It had almost as many Nasdaq listings as the entire European Union (67 versus 84) and more than 13 times Australia's five listings.\nProfessor Trajtenberg said there was not a single case since the industrial revolution of a long term major economic success that relied on anything else \"but human capital and innovation - that's axiomatic\".\nCountries should use their \"gift\" smartly, he said otherwise it would cause complacency.\nHe said governments had a problem with innovation because it is \"inherently dynamic\" and governments are \"static\".\nThe Israeli government had seeded the venture capital industry in the 1970s with a seven year sunset clause but succeeded in three years and got out of the way - \"the best thing typically you can do as a government\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-09-28T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:03:40.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
