Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nSAN FRANCISCO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S plus on Wednesday, the latest iteration of its lucrative smartphone that offers 3D touch, a display technology that responds differently depending on how hard users press their screens. \nThe new phones, which will come in four metal finishes, will also come with an improved, 12 megapixel camera. Apple also said the new iPhone will record 4K video. \nApple relies heavily on the sale of its flagship iPhones, which drove nearly two-thirds of the company's revenue in the most recent quarter. \n(Reporting by Julia Love and Noel Randewich; Editing by Christian Plumb) Information Technology", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:23:20.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
