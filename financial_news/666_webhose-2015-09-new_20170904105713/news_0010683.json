We estimate the overall cost to be Rs 16,000 crore (USD 2.5 billion or 0.1 per cent of GDP) in FY16,” HSBC said in a research note.\nAs per the global brokerage firm, the existing defence pension bill is likely to go up by Rs 10,000 crore, while arrears totalling Rs 12,000 crore will be paid over two years.\n“In sum, we estimate the fiscal implication to be Rs 16,000 crore in Fiscal year 2015-16,” HSBC Chief India Economist Pranjul Bhandari said.\nMeanwhile, other pressures on the fiscal front are also mounting. The government recently announced capital infusion of Rs 70,000 crore over the next four years including Rs 25,000 crore in the current fiscal. The disinvestment department’s mammoth target of Rs 69,500 crore, on the other hand, is unlikely to be met.\n“The disinvestment receipts target of Rs 69,500 crore looked rather rich. Even in the previous year, FY15, the government budgeted for Rs 63,400 crore but ended the year with about half of that,” Bhandari added.\nHowever, factors like lower than expected subsidy bill, additional non-tax revenues like RBI and PSU dividends are likely to offset some pressures on the fiscal front.\nThe deciding factor on whether the fiscal deficit target of 3.9 per cent of GDP is easily met is likely to rest on tax revenue growth.\n“All said, while it’s too soon to declare that the fiscal target will be missed, pressures are mounting and it is time to monitor closely,” HSBC said.\nOROP no threat to fiscal arithmetic: Govt\nThe government today ruled out the additional financial burden of Rs 8,000-10,000 crore on account of OROP scheme hurting the fiscal consolidation programme, saying there was “space” to absorb it.\n“We have the fiscal space to be able to absorb this without having any impact of the fiscal deficit target, which is 3.9 per cent. So, we have taken that into account as we have prepared the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme,” Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said.\nThe government had last week announced that it will implement OROP under which a uniform pension would be given to armed forces personnel retiring at the same rank with the same length of service. The scheme would be implemented from July 1, 2014.\nFunding the OROP, the Minister said, was never a consideration, but the government took time in finalising the scheme as it wanted it to be “equitable and not half-baked”.\nSinha said the actual payout in arrears for implementation of the scheme from July 1, 2014, as well as the recurring burden are being worked out. For the current year, the outgo is estimated at Rs 8,000-10,000 crore, he said.\n“We are estimating that cost would be between Rs 8,000-10,000 crore at present and it would increase further in future… It is a recurring number. The Rs 8,000-10,000 crore is in this fiscal and there are of course arrears which have to be paid,” he said.\nAs per the OROP scheme announced by the government, the pension for defence personnel would be revised every five years.\nThe arrears would be paid in four half-yearly instalments. However, all widows, including war widows, will be paid in one instalment.\n“We have taken into account what adjustment will be necessary in the Budget to be able to both apply one rank one pension which we have promised to our brave servicemen while at the same time maintaining our fiscal discipline and fiscal target that we have already outlined,” he said.\nSinha said there are estimated 6.5 lakh war widows and over 27 lakh ex-defence personnel who will benefit from the OROP scheme.\n“We have sufficient ability to be able to find fiscal space for that… As of now, we are quite confident we will be able to find that fiscal space,” Sinha said.\nIn the current fiscal, the government aims to restrict fiscal deficit at 3.9 per cent of GDP. As per the fiscal consolidation road map, the fiscal deficit is to be brought down to 3 per cent of GDP by 2017-18.\nFirst Published on September 07, 2015 4:49 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:15:14.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
