Operations at the mine's solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW) plants will not be affected during the transition period, the company said.\n\"Implementing this reduction in the operating rate at El Abra reduces operating costs and near-term capital requirements, and provides a longer mine life for its existing Sulfolix ore reserves with a better opportunity to sell its copper production into an anticipated improved copper market in the future,\" Freeport said in a statement.\nEarlier this week, a Chilean union that represents copper mine workers rejected the drastic job cuts and said it was considering action.
