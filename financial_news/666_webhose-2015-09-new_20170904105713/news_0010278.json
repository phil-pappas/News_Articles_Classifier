It is an achievement to be celebrated,\" he said. \n\"It is pretty clear that the economy is in reasonable shape certainly in better shape than most other so-called advanced economies.\" \nAMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said June quarter GDP might have shrunk were it not for a surge in government spending and a rise in investment in Western Australia. \nHowever he added that the detraction from growth from weaker exports and flat inventories is not likely to be repeated, which should allow growth to bounce back to around 0.5 per cent in the September quarter. \n\"What is concerning is that the outlook for non-mining investment remains weak,\" Dr Oliver said. \n\"Ongoing sub-par growth is likely to drive the RBA to cut rates again and the Australian dollar is on its way to around 60 US cents.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Google refines logo AAP \nGoogle is refining its famous logo as it prepares to become a part of a new holding company called Alphabet.
