Indeed, the whole thing is such a joke that I don’t know why I’m writing about it at all. What’s proposed is beyond parody. \nThe new Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, set out his agenda for the economy in a piece for the Guardian a month ago, and laughable it was too. The best way of characterising it is as a kind of latter day, Dave Spart rant. \nYou’ll be relieved to know, however, that Mr McDonnell is not a deficit denier. In fact, he believes “deficit denial is a non-starter for anyone to have any economic credibility with the electorate”. \nBut instead of closing the deficit by cutting spending, he proposes to do it by raising taxes, targeted at the rich and business. In pursuit of this goal he’s discovered an astonishing £93bn of tax “subsidies” to business which he proposes to abolish. Simples. \nAt a stroke, the deficit is made to vanish. I’m kicking myself for not thinking of this. All along it was staring us in the face, but somehow or other, we all came to miss it. \nAs I say, it’s scarcely worth attempting to counter this kind of cloud cuckoo land economics, for it is an agenda that will never be implemented. What Mr McDonnell proposes goes way beyond what Francois Hollande tried to do in France. There is no chance of any of this ever reaching the statute books. \nPolitically, however, there are profound implications. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) acknowledging tribal loyalties, which continue to run deep in British politics, it’s hard to believe the natural constituency for nonsense like this - and obviously there is one - is more than 20pc of the vote. \nLike Syriza in Greece, Mr Corbyn and his backers must either retreat from the extremes they have articulated, or eventually the party will split and in a re-run of what happened in 1981, an exodus will occur. In such circumstances, the Lib Dems might even make a come back. \nEven the greatest of political parties can wither and die, and when they do, it tends to be quickly. Hard to believe now, but the Liberal Party was once utterly dominant in UK politics. In its attempt to make itself relevant to the modern world, the left has gone back to basics, and in doing so consigned itself to likely oblivion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:30:50.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
