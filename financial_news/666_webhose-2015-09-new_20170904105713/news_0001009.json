It has proven hard to explain exactly why ultraluminous X-ray sources are so bright, however.\nSome astronomers suspect that they are intermediate-mass black holes actively drawing in matter, producing massive amounts of friction and X-ray radiation in the process.\nAgainst this backdrop of haphazard X-ray fireworks created by NGC1313X-1, researchers identified two repeating flares, each flashing at an unusually steady frequency.\nOne flashed about 27.6 times per minute and the other about 17.4 times per minute. Comparing these two rates yields a nearly perfect 3:2 ratio.\nLead author Dheeraj Pasham, a postdoctoral associate at the Joint Space-Science Institute, a research partnership between UMD’s Departments of Astronomy and Physics and NASA Goddard, and his colleagues also found this 3:2 ratio in M82X-1, the black hole they identified in August 2014, although the overall frequency of flashing was much higher in M82X-1.\nAlthough astronomers are not yet sure what causes these steady flashes, the presence of a clockwork 3:2 ratio appears to be a common feature of stellar mass black holes and possibly intermediate-mass black holes as well.\nThe flashes are most likely caused by activity close to the black hole, where extreme gravity keeps all surrounding matter on a very tight leash, Pasham said.\nThe study is published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n 22, 2015 1:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:15:57.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
