Jessica Shapiro by Marianna Papadakis A company associated with the head of Liberty Financial, Sherman Ma will be forced to repay a $23 million debt to Macquarie Bank after resisting the repayment through more than five years in litigation.\nThe bank successfully pursued the company, Luxembourg-based Juno Holdings S.a.r.l , over the debt through the Netherlands courts, where a judgment for $16 million plus interest was handed down in Macquarie's favour in 2010.\nAfter Juno's appeals were exhausted in the Netherlands by 2013, Macquarie had to continue its battle to be repaid through the Australian courts, by seeking to have the Netherlands ruling enforced here.\nNSW Supreme Court Justice Robert McDougall accepted on Thursday that Macquarie was entitled to receive repayment in accordance with the rulings handed down in the Netherlands.\n\"The simple fact is that, as the parties accepted, the primary judgment fixes, conclusively, their rights in respect of the early repayment that Macquarie demanded of Juno, Justice McDougall said.\nBut Justice McDougall rejected Macquarie's claim for compound interest that could have brought the amount owed up to $25 million.\nInstead interest was to be calculated on a simple basis from March 27, 2008, up until the date of payment.\nA spokesman for Mr Ma and Liberty Financial said Liberty Financial was not part of proceedings and the judgment had no affect on its daily operations.\n The dispute erupted from Juno's failure to repay the bank $US11.5 million ($16.3 million) that was lent to the company via a note agreement and a strategic alliance in 2004.\nThe deal, Macquarie claimed, was to set up Liberty Financial for a potential float that was abandoned when the global financial crisis hit.\nLiberty Financial itself was a subsidiary of Juno until a restructure in 2013, after the judgment was handed down in the Netherlands. Liberty is now under a different arm within the group.\nMacquarie Bank argued the effect of restructure was to strip assets from Juno, whose sole holdings in Australia included patents for financial applications.\nMacquarie Bank obtained a temporary freeze on the company in June to prevent any further dealings with its assets.\nIn another twist, midway through court proceedings in July, another company linked to the group and Mr Ma, Australian-based company Minerva Technology launched a separate law suit against Juno over its alleged failure to pay licensing fees under an agreement between the two companies from April 2010.\nMinerva claimed the license fees payments had stopped after a court in Curacao ruled in that month the agreement between Minerva and Juno should be annulled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:07:34.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
