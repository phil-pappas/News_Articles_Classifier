Over half the properties were passed in last week.\" \niLender chief executive Jeff Royle says he's pleased to be seeing the clearance rates fall, saying the increasing prices couldn't have continued. \n\"You can't sustain 20 percent price rises, which Auckland has done over the last year in most suburbs. It's quite dangerous.\" \nBarfoot's August sales dropped for the first time in six months, showing the average residential prices to $821,079. \nReal Estate Institute numbers showed median sale prices barely moving from the past month, sitting at $740,000. \nKiri Barfoot, a director of Barfoot's, said clearance rates last Tuesday's city south auction had a 58 percent clearance rate, while the city eastern auction on Wednesday had 57 percent sold, with the average across Auckland around 60 percent. \nLast year, that figure would have been closer to 90 percent on a good day, she said. \nHowever, she said this was likely to be more of a \"minor adjustment\" in the market. \nAuckland houses were still popular and being driven by strong migration numbers, low interest rates and strong demand for few houses, she said. \nWarmer weather and the Christmas season normally increase prices and volume. 3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T05:21:05.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
