I am in my 60s and they are in their 20s and 30s and it is great to have something we are united to do,” Mr Collins says.\nHe says Murdoch is essentially employed full time in the business with plans to open a shopfront in South Yarra this month. They have weekly meetings and Tyson and Lachlan contribute about half a day a week.\n“I would love to see them, in a year, all working full time in the business.”\nThe family attended cosmetic showcase Cosmoprof in Italy late last year and Mr Collins says they believe there is a gap in the market for men’s skincare products.\nHe says representatives from 30 to 40 countries have expressed their interest.\nThey’ve sent samples to the United Arab Emirates, India and Ukraine. But, Mr Collins, says they felt they needed to consolidate the local operation before casting the net.\nThey have set up an online presence, working hard to tap into social media and are talking to some big retailers about stocking Black Leopard.\nMr Collins says they are working their way through a five-year business plan. The range has 13 face, hair and body products, priced from $15 to $60.\nclaire.heaney@news.com.au\nGoing For Growth is a Herald Sun series presented in partnership with NAB, championing Australian business success stories\n Family success more than skin deep", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/melbourne-family-eyeing-globe-with-mens-grooming-range-black-leopard/story-fni0dcne-1227506911355"], "published": "2015-09-01T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:40:49.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
