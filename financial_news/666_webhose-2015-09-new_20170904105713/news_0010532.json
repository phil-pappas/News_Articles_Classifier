Growth picked up to a 3 percent year-on-year expansion in the second quarter.\nBrazil's economy is Latin America's biggest and its sharp downturn is contributing to fears that emerging markets will cripple global growth.\nThe impact could be particularly acute in small neighbors such as Peru, where Brazilian construction and mining companies have invested billions in recent years.\nA vast corruption inquiry into engineering firms that has paralyzed public works in Brazil has already affected Peru.\nIn response to Brazil's investigation, Peru's attorney general launched a probe into potential bribery on a transcontinental highway built by Brazilian companies.\nOne of the Brazilian builders on the project, Odebrecht SA , is investing at least $5 billion in a natural gas pipeline in Peru and billions more in highways, tunnels and canals.
