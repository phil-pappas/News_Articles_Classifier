The number of Redfin customers touring homes held steady from July to August, but fewer people made offers to buy.

Although newly listed homes increased 10 percent in August, it still wasn’t enough to meet demand. The result was 0.3 percent fewer homes for sale overall compared to the same time last year. With too few homes to choose from, house hunters are touring more to find one they like and can afford. Buyers today would rather keep searching than overpay for a home. Sellers are beginning to come to terms with this mindset and some have started lowering their prices.
