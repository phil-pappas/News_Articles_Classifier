Growth is seen at 2.9 percent in 2015, well below the government's target of 4 percent.\nOutput grew 1.3 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonal and calendar-adjusted basis, the Turkish Statistics Institute said. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 2.5 percent in the first quarter, revised figures showed, up from an initially reported 2.3 percent.\nThere was also a better-than-expected performance by the current account, which showed a deficit of $3.15 billion in July, less than a poll forecast of $3.5 billion.\nThe lira, which hit a record low of 3.0620 to the dollar overnight, remained near that level and was fetching 3.0430 at 1140 GMT.\nThe currency has been hammered this year by an inconclusive election result and an upsurge in violence between Kurdish militants and security forces since July have unsettled investors.\nAfter the AK Party failed to win a single-party majority in June, Turks are now set to go to the polls for a snap election on Nov.1, although according to recent opinion polls, it appears the AKP might face a similar result.
