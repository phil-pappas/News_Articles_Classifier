Getty Images Share on twitter by Angus Grigg As an exercise in hardening regional attitudes against it, China was 100 per cent successful on Thursday.\nPutting aside the irony of goose-stepping soldiers celebrating the end of fascism, Beijing's giant military parade looks to have been a spectacular miscalculation.\nSo over-blown was the display of military might that \"scary\" was the word most observes found to describe the occasion on social media.\nThe good news is such a parade is mainly for domestic consumption, but that does not mean China's neighbours are not suitably concerned.\nA new survey from the Pew Research Centre shows that in Vietnam 91 per cent of respondents are worried about territorial disputes with Beijing. In Japan and the Philippines the figure is 83 per cent.\nEven in Australia which has no disputed territory with Beijing, 63 per cent of people say they are worried about China's increasingly assertive behaviour.\nSuch hardening attitudes are sure to undermine decades of soft diplomacy by Beijing across region and won't help its efforts to invest a greater amount of capital offshore.\nBut from a strategic position Beijing's aggression has played perfectly into the hands of the US, as even old foes like Vietnam move closer to Washington.\n Certainly in Australia the attitude towards Beijing has hardened in recent months, if we are to believe the utterances from top public servants.\nIn June the head of the Prime Minister's Department, Michael Thawley, dismissed the idea of China taking a global leadership role.\n\"China won't help you produce a solution,\" he said. \"China will get in the way or get out of the way.\"\nHis boss, Prime Minister Tony Abbott was far blunter, reportedly saying Australia's relationship with China was driven by \"fear and greed\".\nThe fear part is due to China's increasingly aggressive behaviour in the East and South China Seas, as it seeks to forcefully push its territorial interests.\nThursday's parading of \"carrier killer\" missiles and strategic nuclear weapons is just part of this continuing pattern of aggression.\nNot that we should overlook the primary purpose of the parade, which was to bolster the image of Chinese President Xi Jinping at home.\n\"My friends in Beijing say the parade is like the crowning of China's new Emperor,\" says Willy Lam, an expert in elite Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\"For in China a leader does not become a strongman until he is seen on TV receiving salutes from the People's Liberation Army.\"\nSuch is the importance of Thursday's parade that a national holiday was even declared, after blanket coverage of preparations all summer via the state media.\nAnti-Japanese films have been running on repeat and every acceptance from a foreign leader has been trumpeted by the news media.\nSchools have also been the target of China's propaganda masters. Headmasters across the country were known to have spoken extensively about the importance of the parade as they opened the new school year this week.\nAt the same time teachers were instructed to send text messages to parents reminding them to watch the parade with their children during Thursday's holiday.\nFor Lam, Xi has no choice but to stoke the flames of nationalism.\n\"Since the death of Communism the only two pillars of legitimacy for the regime have been economic growth and nationalism,\" he says. \"As we all know the economy is not doing so well, which just leaves nationalism.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:03:20.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
