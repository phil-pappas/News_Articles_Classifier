Dave Tacon by Lisa Murray Lucy Gao During Shanghai's morning rush hour, Uber driver Jack Chen is busy.\nBefore going to his day job in the administrative office of a medical clinic, he madly ferries people to their work places in his Audi A4, receiving more than double the fare paid by the customer. That's because Uber pays him a subsidy of 110 per cent.\nFor some of his friends, who are working for Uber full-time and can clock up a minimum of 50 orders a week, the subsidy jumps to 130 per cent.\nThis is how the San Francisco-based ride hailing company is attempting to buy market share in China, where it is facing what some analysts believe will be a fight to the death with local player Didi Kuaidi.\nUber chief executive Travis Kalanick has pledged to spend more than a billion US dollars this year on the company's China expansion. Since June, the two companies have raised more than $US4 billion between them as they lower fares and pay extra bonuses, burning through cash to compete for drivers and customers.\n\"The reason I chose to work for Uber over Didi was because my friends told me Uber pays the highest subsidies,\" says Chen as he drives around downtown Shanghai, with a red Chairman Mao pendant rattling on his dashboard and a pair of Ray Ban aviators hanging down from the sun shade.\nIn it for the money The 34-year-old has been working for Uber for three months and is generally happy although he says he will stop driving if the subsidies are significantly reduced.\nBoth Uber and Didi Kuaidi are spending up big to win market share. Didi Kuaidi reported a net loss of over half a billion US dollars in the first five months of the year. iStock Both Uber and Didi Kuaidi are spending up big to win market share. Didi Kuaidi reported a net loss of over half a billion US dollars in the first five months of the year, according to the Financial Times , which cited fundraising documents. At the same time, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanickâ€‹ has pledged to spend more than a billion US dollars this year on the company's China expansion.\nThe commitment follows unexpectedly rapid growth in cities like Chengdu, a technology and manufacturing hub in China's west, that has become Uber's top location globally in terms of average daily completed rides.\nIn some ways China is just like any other market for Uber. The company is adopting a similar strategy to its rollout in other parts of the world; paying drivers extra during peak times to ensure there are enough cars to meet demand. Uber is also charging fares that are often lower than taxi-rides to win over customers.\nThe problem lies in the competition. In China, Uber is up against a competitor with state-backing and investors that have deep pockets, including the country's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, and internet giants Alibaba and TenCent.\nJack Chen says Uber currently pays Chinese drivers who complete a minimum of 25 orders a week, 110 per cent of the fare between 7 and 10 in the morning, 80 per cent of the fare during the evening rush hour and 60 per cent of the fare over the weekend. Dave Tacon Working in its favour are a superior technology system and the backing of another internet giant, Baidu, China's equivalent to Google.\nChen is generally happy with the extra income. However, he says the big salaries talked about by his friends, who took home around 20,000 yuan ($4464) a month last year, have been greatly reduced. That's because Uber is gradually lowering subsidies in more established cities as it looks to move toward profitability and has also cracked down on a scam by which drivers would buy up to ten phones and book phantom trips during peak times.\nNow, salaries for full-time drivers are around 10,000 and 12,000 yuan, he says.\nDiminishing pay According to Chen, drivers in Shanghai pay Uber 20 per cent of the fare as a fee for using the technology system. After that, Uber currently pays drivers who complete a minimum of 25 orders a week, 110 per cent of the fare between 7 and 10 in the morning, 80 per cent of the fare during the evening rush hour and 60 per cent of the fare over the weekend. For normal working hours, drivers are paid a 40 per cent subsidy.\nThe bonuses vary depending on what car you drive and how many rides you complete per week. If you manage a minimum of 50 orders, for example, those subsidies increase to 130 per cent and 100 per cent for the morning and evening rush hour periods, 80 per cent over the weekend and 60 per cent for normal fares.\nAt Didi, according to drivers interviewed by The Australian Financial Review , the subsidy system is more fluid. If there is a promotion, the company can pay much more than Uber while at other times the subsidies are far less. Generally, drivers are paid a flat fee of up to 100 yuan if ten orders are completed during a peak period.\nTang, who offered only his last name, worked for Uber for one week before deciding to return to his job with Didi.\nDidi more busy A former waiter and factory worker, the 23-year-old spent 160,000 yuan to buy his Skoda car and began driving for Didi in May.\n\"At Uber I had to wait for orders but at Didi you never wait,\" he says.\n\"Didi is for the mass market while Uber is more for high-end clients, who are more polite and patient, but at the end of the day, there is less income.\"\nLi Dong, another Didi driver, explains he chose the local player over Uber, because of job security.\n\"I was worried Uber would not be around for a long time and I don't want to change companies too frequently,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:04:31.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
