More Equity fund sales hit 15-year record \n“People think that impact investing is way too complex, so it is simpler to give money through philanthropy and keep investments separate,” said Greg Davies, head of behavioural-quant finance at Barclays. \nAn 18-month Barclays study, published on Thursday, found that only 9 per cent of 1,800 retail investors and wealthy individuals surveyed had made impact investments, despite more than half (56 per cent) reporting an interest in doing so. \nMr Davies said that attempts to unlock billions of pounds in potential impact investment will remain unsuccessful so long as the market focuses on increasing the supply of products. \n“Nobody has been asking how can we get investors comfortable with this,” he said. “It’s a new field, it feels uncomfortable [and] when faced with making difficult decisions, people abdicate responsibility and step back.” \nFollowing the study, Barclays is introducing to a profiling tool to help its wealthy clients re-evaluate how much they invest for impact and give away to charity. \nBy responding to 25 statements designed to measure their attitude towards the balance of social and financial priorities, as well as moral duty, personal satisfaction and financial security, the bank’s behavioural framework will help individuals work out how much of their investable wealth should be allocated to philanthropy and impact investing. \n“For typical investors, if they follow the framework we estimate it will give them the confidence to invest twice as much in social good,” said Mr Davies. \nBarclays’ research suggests that a rise in impact investment would not be to the detriment of investors’ charitable donations, with only 7 per cent of those surveyed saying they would reduce the value of their gifts. \nThe two are clearly viewed distinctly, however. More than four in five investors told Barclays they would expect a financial return from impact investing that is either close to the market benchmark or above it. Only 19 per cent said they would expect to sacrifice performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:39:29.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
