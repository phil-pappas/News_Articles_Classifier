That plan has been scrapped after regulators refused to consider it until Exxon Mobil responds to certain requirements that have not been not publicly released. \nThe federal Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration cited the company in mid-August for several violations related to the February explosion, some of which the agency called \"willful,\" the article said. The agency also fined the company more than $500,000.\nExxon Mobil officials told the Los Angeles Times the \"c ompany has been working with all agencies and will continue to work with the air quality regulators.\" \nThe plant supplies one fifth of Southern California's gasoline, according to the Times. \nGasoline prices in the Los Angeles area were around $3.19, compared with the nationwide average of $2.28. \nShares of other West Coast refiners were higher Wednesday following word that the Exxon Mobil refinery would remain closed into next year. Those stocks included Tesoro , Western Refining , Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum .\nU.S. crude oil (WTI) was trading around $45.90 on Wednesday, and Brent crude trading at about $48.80.\nRobert Ferris Science Reporter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change XOM --- OIL ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:08:38.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
