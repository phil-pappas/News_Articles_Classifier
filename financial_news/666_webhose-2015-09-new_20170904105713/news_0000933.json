He insisted that we are on a path that will debase the dollar and drive our investments into the trash can.\nI was injured at work a while ago, and I can no longer work. My wife works in a supermarket and earns a modest salary. She just recently joined her company's 401(k) plan with a contribution of $40 per pay. She has about $20,000 in an IRA. That's not bad after raising children and grandchildren. Ron Paul spoke so convincingly that I'm worried sick about our future. My wife intends to work another seven or eight years and retire. I know that you don't normally get involved in politics, but this is an economics issue. He's convinced that the Fed is a big part of the problem. Should we worry?\nWHAT HARRY SAYS: Most politicians know so little about economics that it's pitiful. He, and many of his ilk, have been yelling this same tune ever since the Fed really saved us in 2008 and '09. Many believe that if the facts don't bear out your prediction, ignore the facts and speak louder. The world will not end tomorrow or next week, but the Ron Pauls among us will still see doomsday ahead.\nEmail Harry Gross at harrygrossDN@gmail.com , or\nwrite to him at Daily News, 801 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19107.\nHarry urges all his readers to give blood.
