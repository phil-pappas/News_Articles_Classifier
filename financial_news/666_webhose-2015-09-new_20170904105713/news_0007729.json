Photo: Christopher Pearce\nThe outgoing investment chief of one of Australia's biggest union-aligned superannuation funds has broken ranks to back the government's controversial plan to force all funds to appoint one-third of independent directors, including an independent chair, to their boards.\n\"I do think mandating one-third independents and independent chairs will be good for the industry,\" retiring Sunsuper chief investment officer David Hartley told The Australian Financial Review .\nThe equal representation model, whereby non-profit super boards have a 50:50 split of employer and employee representatives, had historically accompanied very strong performance from the industry fund sector, he said.\n\"But that model can be retained across the remaining two-thirds of the board, while providing a timely opportunity as the sector matures for funds to hopefully appoint independent directors who will fill skills gaps.\"\nAdvertisement Directors with investment expertise could help navigate the challenging outlook for financial markets, he said.\nOther high-profile identities from the non-profit super sector to publicly support the governance shake-up include former Australian Workers Union boss and AustralianSuper director turned KPMG consultant Paul Howes and Telstra Super chief executive Chris Davies .\nMr Hartley's support for governance reforms are at odds with the official line of his soon-to-be-ex employer, which backs a campaign from non-profit super groups Industry Super Australia and Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees to block the changes before Parliament.\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has backed the one-third independents rule while resisting the Financial Services Council's push to legislate for a majority of independents.\nSunsuper board renewal As Mr Hartley prepares to retire, Sunsuper is following in the footsteps of a small band of other leading industry funds, such as QSuper, that have already begun rejuvenating their boards with independent directors ahead of the regulatory change.\nBut Sunsuper chief executive Scott Hartley (no relation to his outgoing investment chief) is insistent that prescribing in law that all funds must appoint one-third independent directors will be overly prescriptive and a mistake .\nOn Monday, the fund will announce the appointment of two new independent directors: former Macquarie Group executive and founding chief executive of Social Ventures Australia Michael Traill alongside former Queensland treasurer Andrew Fraser. This follows the June appointment of Jenni Mack, a former chair of consumer advocacy group Choice. The new board will select a replacement for outgoing chairman Ron Monaghan.\nA Queensland-based industry fund established in 1987, Sunsuper is Australia's fifth-largest superannuation fund with nearly $30 billion in funds under management.\nPortfolio manager Stuart Wilson is acting as interim CIO with a permanent appointment to the role due to be announced before Mr Hartley completes his handover period in November.\n\"Whoever takes the reins faces a big challenge to continue delivering the returns expectations of members, of which I'll be one, in a low-growth and low-rates world,\" Mr Hartley said.\n\"Record low interest rates and quantitative easing by global central banks have been pumping up asset prices for seven years, bringing forward tomorrow's returns. While the sell-off of recent weeks means there is once again value in pockets of equity markets, protecting long-term returns is going to require an even greater shift into unlisted assets.\"\nInquiry focus on fees Over a decade in the role, Mr Hartley lifted Sunsuper's total exposure to \"alternative assets\" – namely unlisted property, infrastructure, private equity and hedge funds – from 12 per cent to nearly 30 per cent.\n\"That trend needs to continue but as the strategy has become mainstream, finding value is now much more difficult. Some fund managers are starting to stray into strange corners of asset markets and that requires heightened scepticism,\" he said.\nKeeping a tight lid on costs will also be a focus for Mr Hartley's successor. The need to reduce the fees charged to super fund members is a major focus of the government's financial system inquiry, chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, who recommended the governance shake-up as part of a suite of reforms .\nMr Hartley warned the inquiry's focus on fees was \"overly simplistic\", \"dangerous\" and \"wrong\".\nInstead, he thought it would be better to force funds to be more transparent about the breakdown of their fees, to ensure they were delivering value back to members.\n\"Good external fund managers can be expensive but worth it. What is crazy is that funds are not forced to tell members what portion of their fees are going back to the fund itself and related third parties.\"\nImproving transparency in this area was equally important for customers of the bank-aligned retail funds as it was at the union-aligned industry funds, he said.\nMore competition is also putting pressure on administration costs, as funds up the ante in their marketing efforts to compete for members.\nSunsuper is sponsoring talk show queen Oprah Winfrey's December tour to Australia.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/telstra-super-chief-executive-chris-davies-backs-push-for-more-independent-directors-20150618-ghqxdt", "http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/sunsuper-boosts-independent-directors-but-insists-its-not-a-win-for-coalition-20150920-gjqmms", "http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/paul-howes-backs-independent-super-fund-boards-20150806-gisztq?stb=twt"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:34:01.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
