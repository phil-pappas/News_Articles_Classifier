Peter Rae Share on twitter by Perry Williams On Tuesday Peter Coleman boarded a flight from Perth and settled in for the long journey.\nHis destination was Level 23, 1 Bligh Street in Sydney's CBD - the headquarters of Papua New Guinea focused oil explorer Oil Search where he hoped to meet boss Peter Botten​.\nColeman had not initially expected to be in Sydney.\nBut revelations by The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column that Woodside had made a formal approach for Oil Search on Monday night had forced his hand.\nOn Tuesday morning the West Australian energy giant had to prematurely announce details of its all-share, $11.6 billion offer for the PNG producer.\nWith the slump in the price of oil battering the share prices of every major Australian energy company in the last 12 months, Woodside's move – which would be the largest Australian takeover since 2011 – sparked an investor frenzy in the broader oil and gas sector.\nEmbattled energy producer Santos, which is also seen as a takeover target, saw its shares increase by nearly 12 per cent at one stage while others like Origin Energy also bounced on the prospect of brighter times ahead.\nThe search is on Woodside investors were not immediately impressed with the stock falling 3 per cent following the announcement.\nBut Coleman had a more immediate problem to deal with.\nOil Search's Botten was nowhere to be found.\nWoodside's camp, including advisors Gresham and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, put in a number of calls to Botten's office seeking confirmation of a meeting.\nBut calls were not returned. An early rumour suggested Botten was already in New York preparing for a US results roadshow to investors.\nWord eventually filtered back to Woodside that Oil Search's investor relations head, Ann Diamant, may have taken his place in the US.\nIt took another day before it emerged Botten was already in PNG holding talks with two of Oil Search's key stakeholders: the PNG government, a 10 per cent shareholder and ExxonMobil Corporation, the gatekeeper operator of the PNG liquefied natural gas project.\nAfter two days in the harbour city – and with no engagement from his takeover target – Coleman was back on a plane to Perth to draw up the next phase of his battle plan.\nThe wily Botten, one of the longest serving bosses of an ASX company, returned to Sydney the following day and has been locked in talks with adviser Morgan Stanley ever since.\nBotten joined Oil Search when the company was a minnow with just a handful of staff and a market value just shy of $300 million. In two decades since, he's built close ties with the government and stakeholders in PNG and built Oil Search's value beyond $14 billion at its peak into one of Australia's strongest energy players.\nThe feather in his cap But by far his biggest achievement has been his part in building the $US19 billion PNG LNG project, in which Oil Search is ExxonMobil's ­largest partner.\nThe LNG project is regarded as one of the most profitable globally, spitting out cash since gas started flowing to its customers in Asia in 2014, and helping Oil Search reap strong profits despite oil prices plummeting by more than half to just US$49 ($69) a barrel from $US105 a barrel a year ago.\nOil Search also holds much envied stakes in a third train expansion of PNG LNG and the development of the Elk-Antelope field, now considered one of the real gas finds of the last few decades given it could lead to an additional two train LNG project under French developers Total.\nWhile Woodside remains the top-ranking LNG producer within Australia's borders thanks to its North West Shelf and Pluto projects, it has hit something of a stumbling block in terms of growth options.\nThe economics of its grandest project, Browse, appear more uncertain than ever although a final investment decision won't be due until next year.\nAn expansion of the profitable Pluto plant is off the agenda partly due to a lack of gas availability and the Sunrise LNG development remains mired in a standoff with the Timor Leste government.\nSpeculate to accumulate With Woodside's relatively low debt profile, its board has made little secret of its desire to buy top tier assets at a low point in the oil cycle to kickstart its next phase of growth.\nSources close to the current talks say Woodside's strategy team, led by Greg Roder​, first identified Oil Search as a possible target some two years ago after Pluto started delivering gas.\nRoder, a former executive of AMP Capital Investors and Macquarie Bank, could see that Oil Search's growth potential in PNG easily outstripped the best assets on offer within Australian shores.\nMichael Chaney, Woodside chairman and Rick Lee, Oil Search chairman are understood to have held informal talks last year about a merger alerting the Sydney company to its rival's intentions.\nRoder and his team kept a watching brief on the company and when its market value dipped below $10 billion, compared with Woodside's $25 billion, plans were drawn up for a confidential approach.\nColeman was an early supporter of the plan given in his role prior to Woodside he was responsible for ExxonMobil's operations in PNG.\nWhile Woodside was mildly annoyed its approach was revealed prematurely, it remains confident it can get a deal over the line – eventually.\nOil Search for its part is understood to be looking for a share price premium of closer to 25 to 30 per cent to get it to the negotiating table rather than the 14 per cent premium on offer.\nThe next few days are likely to go a long way to deciding the success of the proposed deal. Coleman and Botten are due to meet in Sydney on Sunday to discuss the offer, along with Chaney and Lee.\nBoth sides are uncertain about how the meeting will proceed. Botten is thought to be back in Perth this weekend at his family home and over the weekend both he and Coleman will board flights for the trip back to Sydney.\nThe two energy bosses will meet in a \"neutral location\" with the tone of the talks expected to play a big part in the outcome of Oil Search's board meeting scheduled for early next week.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-09-11T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:04:02.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
