It's much more complicated than a lot of those people are saying when you actually sit down and have a look at doing it, it's an enormous impost for very little return.\" Stefan Postles by Ben Potter Peter Costello said dumping the tax exemption for superannuation payouts, which critics says is too generous, will be enormously complicated and generate little revenue.\nThe former federal treasurer abolished the tax on superannuation payouts for over-60s in his 2006 budget, and strongly defended the changes as a \"massive simplification\" of an overly complex system that had taxed super at three levels.\nMany tax experts in think tanks, accounting firms and big business argue the system is too generous to high income earners and their concessions worth billions of dollars annually should be wound back.\nThe national reform summit last week agreed that that super tax breaks are too generous and should be reviewed as part of the wider tax reform process.\nSpeaking after the $117 billion Future Fund revealed a 15.4 per cent return , Mr Costello, who is the fund's chairman, said there was no need for an inquiry into the superannuation system.\n'Much more complicated' He said he learned from past experience that the taxation of super earnings raised little revenue in practice because of the complexity.\n\"Up until then we were taxing contributions, earnings and payouts. There were three tiers of taxation and the third tier...was an extremely complicated tier with RBLs [reasonable benefit limits] and quarantining of taxed money and un-taxed money and it was honoured more in the breach than in the observance I can tell you that,\" he said.\n \"There were theoretical end taxes that were theoretically being collected but it was so complicated the revenue was very minor. So that was a major simplification and it came with a whole suite of other things including contribution limits.\"\nMr Costello said advocates for restoring the tax on super payouts ignored the difficulties.\n\"There are those who say we should go back to that third tier of taxation again,\" he said.\n\"I'll make this prediction. It's much more complicated than a lot of those people are saying when you actually sit down and have a look at doing it, it's an enormous impost for very little return.\"\nMr Costello said the Abbott government had come to the same conclusion when it considered the former Labor government's un-enacted plan to restore the super payout tax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:08:14.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
