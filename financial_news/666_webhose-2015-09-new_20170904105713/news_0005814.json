Dotted with several residential and commercial complexes, the vicinity boasts of having great social infrastructure. Goregaon East has a number of sub localities namely Pandurang Wadi, Jaiprakash Nagar, Aarey Milk Colony, Ram Nagar JJC, Gokuldham Colony, Workers Colony, Durga Nagar and Film City. \nThe sleepy periphery today is a bustling residential catchment area that is home to several high net worth individuals (HNIs) and mid income groups (MIGs). However, developments and schemes for lower middle class people under the NNP (Nagari Nivara Parishad) are now available in the New Dindishi area of Goregaon East. The once lively river Mithi flows through the locality. The 1000 hectare wide Aarey Milk Colony is a popular landmark in Goregaon East. \nFactors affecting growth \nWith the Sanjay Gandhi National Park falling within the limits of Goregaon East, residents of this area get to enjoy nature at its best. And with a number of prominent builders now announcing projects here, the rapid deforestation is pushing several wild animals away from their homes. Among the 100 residential projects that are up, over 70% of the projects offer ready to move in flats while 25% are still under construction. Most of these projects are said to cater to the needs and demands created by the high class and upper middle class groups. \nHowever, under the NNP, over 30,000 people have been facilitated under the affordable housing scheme in the New Dindoshi area of Goregaon East. \nInfrastructure developments \nCompeting with the established neighbouring micro markets, Goregaon East boasts of great social and physical infrastructure. The existence of several educational institutions, health-care units and a growing commercial belt has attracted a pool of cosmopolitan crowd. Under construction projects like the Western Line station and the Western Railway Elevated Corridor will phenomenally improve intra-connectivity. \nBy: indiaproperty.com Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:40:47.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
