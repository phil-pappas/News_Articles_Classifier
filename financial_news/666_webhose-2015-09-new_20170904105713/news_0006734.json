Once that process which we are currently engaged in is completed, we will roll out the initial design of the FEED.” \nHe added that after a year, BOST will commence the execution of the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning – EPCC process, which is the actual construction of the pipelines once the FEED is completed. \n“We are looking at extending the existing network which has been built from Abuadze to Atuabo and Ghana Gas is currently building from Asiama to Prestea. We are also looking to extend that network to Kumasi where there is demand and then we will move further to Buipe” Mr. Wilson added. \nBOST also considering extending its infrastructure from Takoradi to Tema and according to Mr. Wilson, this is to “ensure that the gas that is in the Western Region is able to be moved to the Eastern side.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:39:26.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
