Wayne Taylor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow \"He's having a what?\"\n\"Conception party.\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"A conception party – you know, nine months before his 80th.\"\nIllustration: Rod Clement \"To mark when…\"\nSilence. Jaws drop. A tum\nbleweed rolls across an empty plain.\n \" Yes .\"\nIt would be fair to say that it took us a few minutes to get our heads around the latest mail from planet Lindsay Fox .\nBut once we did, we could not be more on board with this instalment of the life and times of the greatest personality in Australian logistics, who with a fortune valued at $2.24 billion sits at number 15 on the latest BRW Rich List.\nHere are the details: the billionaire founder of the Linfox trucking empire is having a \"conception party\" in July 2016, nine months before his 80th birthday – which falls on April 19, 2017.\nFox, in his own words, had a \"reverse wake\" for his 70th birthday. Others described it as a three-day Sydney bender.\nThe man likes to mark milestone birthdays. As he told Andrew Denton back in 2007, it all comes from his surprise at still being alive.\n\"My father got to 62,\" Fox said . \"I never thought I'd get anything past 62. \"\nThis upcoming party is essentially be a two-week long version of the television show \" The Love Boat \". Lindsay, the handsome devil, will presumably play the part of Captain Merrill Stubing .\nCaptain Fox will sail the ensemble across the Mediterranean from Athens to Venice. One hundred loved-up couples will join him.\nIt's a favourite part of the world for Lindsay during the Australian winter. Indeed, he last featured in this column when our agents spotted him lunching on the Amalfi Coast a few weeks ago .\nThe early invitations for the conception do are a mark of the calibre of the ensemble. Expect the usual Fox suspects – legendary union leader Bill Kelty , fellow Melbourne billionaire Solomon Lew , former Labor leader Simon Crean , Linfox chairman Peter Fox and a fair whack of the Melbourne business establishment.\nIt sounds amazing. Although it does set a pretty high bar for his 90th.", "external_links": ["http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-200/2015/;jsessionid=2501922E0A0DD94E3FB7BE96ABABC738", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITTt_8OhNA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AITTt_8OhNA?rel=0", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2114465.htm"], "published": "2015-08-31T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:05:13.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
