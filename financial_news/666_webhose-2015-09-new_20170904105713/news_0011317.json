A televised inquiry which ran through 2011 and 2012 exposed the close ties between senior executives at Murdoch's newspapers, the police and leading politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron.\nNews Corp also said Tony Gallagher, currently deputy editor at the Daily Mail, a rival to the Murdoch titles, would become editor-in-chief of the Sun, its daily tabloid which is the highest-selling newspaper in Britain.
