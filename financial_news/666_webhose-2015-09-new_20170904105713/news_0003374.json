Nic Walker Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell South African retailer Woolworths Holdings has turned to former Westpac chief executive Gail Kelly to help transform itself into a leading southern hemisphere retailer after last year's $2.1 billion acquisition of David Jones.\nWoolworths Holdings – which outlaid $2.1 billion for David Jones and $213 million to mop up minorities in apparel retailer Country Road Group – has appointed Mrs Kelly to the board as a non-executive director, starting October 1.\nThe appointment was announced on Thursday by Woolworths chairman Simon Susman.\n​\"As our group grows to become a major southern hemisphere retailer of scale, it is a real honour to have a world-class mind such as Gail's to help us navigate the fast-moving environment of global retail,\" Mr Susman said.\nWoolworths now generates 40 per cent of annual revenues from Australia after the acquisition of David Jones and it recently established a foothold in New Zealand, acquiring Wellington department store Kirkcaldie & Staines.\n\"After decades at the top of the corporate ladder in both of our major markets, I look forward to seeing the value her experience and perspective will bring to our group,\" Mr Susman said.\nMrs Kelly was chief executive and managing director of St George Bank from 2002 to 2007 and CEO of Westpac from 2008 until early this year, overseeing a merger of the two banks in 2008. Under Mrs Kelly's watch, Westpac's market value and profits more than doubled to $104 billion and $7.6 billion respectively.\nThe first female chief executive of one of the big four banks and Australia's highest-paid banker in 2014, the mother of four was a strong advocate for increasing female leadership in the workplace, setting gender-equality targets for senior and middle management at Westpac and introducing policies to encourage diversity and flexibility in the bank's culture.\n Mrs Kelly, who was born in Pretoria and grew up in South Africa where she held senior positions in the Nedbank Group, joins another Australian non-executive director on the Woolworths Holdings board, corporate adviser Patrick Allaway.\n\"Growing up in South Africa, I have always had a love for the Woolworths brand, and while in Australia, I have closely observed its growth path, including the acquisitions of Country Road and David Jones,\" Mrs Kelly said.\n\"I am looking forward to working with my fellow directors and the Woolworths team, both in South Africa and in Australia, to assist them on their ambition of becoming a leading southern hemisphere retailer.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/woolworths-vs-woolworths-djs-new-owner-to-overhaul-food-business-20150624-ghwgqo.html", "https://twitter.com/@suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-09-10T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:07:29.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
