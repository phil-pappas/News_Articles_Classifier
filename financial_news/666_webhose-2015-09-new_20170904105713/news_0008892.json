The company is also replacing the well-known blue lower case \"g\" icon with an upper-case \"G\" combining blue, green, red and yellow. \nThe 17-year-old Internet company is keen to follow users of its online products onto new generations of Internet-linked devices such as smartphones, tablets and watches. \n\"We're introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens,\" the California-based Internet firm said in a blog post. \n\"We've taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs - such as tap, type and talk.\" \nThe unveiling of the new logo came just weeks after a surprise reorganization of Google under a newly formed parent company called Alphabet. \nThe plan calls for Alphabet to be the corporate parent, with an operating unit for Google and its related search operations, and a handful of other operating firms created for projects in health, Internet delivery, investment and research. \nWhile Google is known as the dominant player in Internet search, it has launched a variety of projects in recent years that are marginally related at best to its core operation. \nThe projects include self-driving cars, Google Glass, Internet balloons, drones, health care, Google TV, mobile payments, home automation and its Google+ social network, among others. \nThe Google unit, to be headed by current company vice president Sundar Pichai, will include search, ads, maps, YouTube, Android and related technology infrastructure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T21:03:05.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
