The Company has already brought substantial inward investment into the city's Govan area, having so far created five scientific and professional jobs at its dual facility, with more to come. \nNicola Sturgeon said, \"I'm delighted to open this new facility and very much welcome HCi Viocare's investment in Govan. I congratulate everyone involved in establishing the centre and look forward to seeing how this innovative technology progresses.\" \nHCi Viocare's co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Christos Kapatos commented, \"Today's opening is an important landmark for HCi Viocare. As well as actively seeking partners to commercialise our smart sensors and other technologies internationally, we aim to extend prosthetics and orthotics clinics across Mediterranean Europe based on the model being established by our new Glasgow clinic.\" \nThe Company's near-market innovations include patent-pending low cost, smart sensing systems, incorporated into insoles for monitoring and preventing diabetic foot ulcers, as well as for monitoring athletic performance and preventing common running injuries. Multiple adaptations of the technology exist in health and sports sectors, including smart mattresses for preventing pressure sores. \nHCi Viocare's prosthetics and orthotics clinic is the only independent provider in Scotland. As well as seeing clients from Scotland, the north of England and beyond, it will act as a centre of reference and training for the company's future clinics in European and Middle Eastern countries, where prosthetics and orthotics services are generally less developed than in the UK. \nDr Kapatos added, \"Scotland is renowned for its innovation, highly skilled workforce and commitment to commercialisation. We value having our technology hub and first clinic here in Glasgow. We expect to create further high calibre jobs, recruiting from my alma mater the University of Strathclyde where possible, contributing to our company's success as well as to Scotland's economy and international reputation.\" \nAbout HCi Viocare \nHCi Viocare has a dual, complementary business model of 1) creating the first cross-border independent chain of prosthetics and orthotics (P&O) and diabetic foot clinics in Europe and the Middle East, and 2) developing a portfolio of biomedical technologies to address unmet needs in the diabetic foot, P&O and other health and wellbeing areas, for licensing to established industry participants. HCi Viocare is listed on the OTC Markets in the USA ( VICA ), has its executive office in Athens, Greece, and R&D centre in Glasgow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:56:39.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
