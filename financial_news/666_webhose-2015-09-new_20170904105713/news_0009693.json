Welcome to the world of Jobbatical — where spending your life at work doesn’t mean staying in one place.\nThe Estonia based start-up — named for ‘job’ and ‘sabbatical’ — was founded by former television producer Karoli Hindriks who wanted a way of using her skills to work overseas.\nIt provides a way for digital natives to spend between one and 12 months on sabbatical anywhere from South East Asia to Europe. A quick browse of current listings reveals jobs for a Java developer in Budapest, as a mobile publisher in Barcelona or “creative ninja” in Mumbai.\n“We like to joke that a jobbatical is sort of like dating before marriage” said chief marketing officer Isabel Hirama. She’s currently working as a “digital nomad” in Montreal after taking her own jobbatical to head office in Estonia and said it’s the perfect way to trial a new job and country.\n“If it didn’t go that great, then no hard feelings, they don’t have to continue but if they like each other they can commit to something more serious.”\nShe said the stints on offer for digital designers and developers, marketers and social media experts are a win-win for employees who want to travel and start-ups who can access talent they might not be able to convince to move there full time.\n“[A start-up] probably wouldn’t be able to get someone from Silicon Valley to move to Myanmar to work for them …. but if they’re just saying ‘hey come work for us for six months’, that’s a crazy adventure,” she said.\nWeekends in Cinqueterra could be the norm if you’re working for a start-up in Europe.

University of Canberra Economics Professor Phil Lewis said Uber is the darling of this new mode of work based on specific gigs for short periods of time.\n“The concept of “employer” has little meaning to these workers since they are better regarded as self-employed selling a service in much the same way as a greengrocer sells apples,” he said. Who needs to sit in a cubicle for 40 hours a week when you can Airbnb your apartment, drive Uber or sell your services on Task Rabbit at a time that suits you?\nMs Hirama said most of those using Jobbatical are looking for a break between jobs or permanent freelancers who want access to a different industry. Pay and benefits are up to the worker and the company to decide in what she thinks is a trend we will see more of in the next decade.\n“People are going to see themselves as more empowered in their careers,” she said.\n“They don’t have to just find a job and stick to it because it’s a job, they can be looking for something that really excites them and that they love to do and when they want to do something else they can go and follow their passion to the next thing or country or continent”.\nJobbatical is advertising for tech workers in Barcelona.

Downsides include lack of potential benefits like superannuation, maternity and health insurance, as well as the risk it might be hard to demonstrate long-term commitment.\n“How do you codify your experience in this pop-up economy where you’re doing little bits and pieces all over the place? Which may be great fun, may be great variety but in a sense when you want to go for that next step upwards perhaps a full time job with a big company, how do you persuade them you’ve actually got the experience and knowledge?” he said.\nFor Ms Hirama, Australia has huge potential as a jobbatical destination because “everyone in the world wants to go there” and the company wants to change the way people think about work.\n“The idea of shorter term contracts not being a bad thing but actually being an advantage in your career, we think that’s actually going to come into play within the next decade,” she said.\nWould you quit your job to work in another country?
