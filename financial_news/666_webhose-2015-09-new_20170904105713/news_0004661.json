The FTSEurofirst 300 rose and was last up 2.0 percent on the day. \nGerman bund futures hit the day's high and were last up 70 ticks on the day at 153.84. Yields on benchmark 10-year German bonds, which the ECB has been buying under its quantitative easing programme, were down 4 basis points at 0.75 percent, with other euro zone equivalents down 2-8 bps.
