Tamarack Consulting worked with PayNet Inc., the nation’s leading provider of small business credit ratings, to release PayNet for Salesforce. “As more lenders choose the Salesforce platform for managing their customers, this new application will allow Salesforce users to access PayNet Credit History Reports within Salesforce,” states James Brown Director of Operations, PayNet, Inc. \"This PayNet integration combines scores and data into a unified customer management solution with Salesforce that will enable efficient credit underwriting for our customers.” \"Being able to access our PayNet reports all in one single place (Salesforce) allows us to be more efficient and accurate at credit adjudication and reporting – not to mention it has allowed us to quickly streamline our process,\" said Raquel O'Leary Vice President of Operations at Allegiant Partners. \"We can now view fully formatted PayNet reports, as well as utilize key report data in workflow, docs, and eventually scoring.\" \"This solution will help further automate credit adjudication. As well, our customers are looking to analyze and build scoring models based on PayNet data. This integration enables this in Salesforce.com,\" says Kristian Dolan, Solution Architect at Tamarack Consulting.
