Photo: Bloomberg\nAs the number of deaths linked to defective cars made by General Motors has steadily risen to 124, victims have waited for the answer to a burning question: How will US prosecutors hold the car maker accountable for its decade-long failure to disclose a defect with its ignition switch?\nOn Thursday, US time, they got their answer, and many were disappointed.\nIn a settlement with prosecutors, no individual employees were charged, and the US Justice Department agreed to defer prosecution of the company for three years. If GM adheres to the agreement, which includes independent monitoring of its safety practices, the company can have its record wiped clean.\nGeneral Motors Company CEO Mary Barra: \"Let's pause for a moment and remember that people were hurt and died in our cars.\" Photo: Getty-Images\nAnd even though General Motors will pay a $US900 million ($1.25 billion) penalty, it was 25 per cent less than the record $US1.2 billion Toyota agreed to pay last year.\nAdvertisement \"I don't understand how they can basically buy their way out of it,\" said Margie Beskau, whose daughter Amy Rademaker was killed in an October 2006 crash in Wisconsin. She added, \"They knew what they were doing and they kept doing it.\"\nAt a news conference, Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, defended the settlement and said that the victims had been paramount in the minds of the prosecutors.\nGM's cooperation, he said, was the reason the settlement was reached after only 18 months, citing GM's creation of a compensation fund for victims of the defect and its dismissal of 15 employees, among other factors.\n\"Good behaviour after the fact does not absolve GM or any company of responsibility,\" Mr Bharara said, \"but companies should be encouraged to act as GM did here to help the truth come out faster.\"\nMr Bharara emphasised that individuals could still be charged, but bringing a case against employees faces higher legal hurdles than in some other industries.\nGM struck a tone of contrition on Thursday. In a meeting with employees, Mary T. Barra, the chief executive, again apologised.\n\"Let's pause for a moment and remember that people were hurt and died in our cars,\" Ms Barra said.\nHer address to employees came on a day when GM reached another legal milestone, setting aside $US575 million to resolve the cases of about 1380 people. Altogether, the private lawsuit settlements resolve more than half the outstanding private cases against GM.\nThe complaint filed by prosecutors details what has become a familiar narrative in the GM safety crisis - employees within General Motors were aware going back more than a decade of problems with an ignition switch, which is prone to turning off, cutting the engine and disabling systems like power steering and airbags.\nBut prosecutors focused their attention to a relatively short period of time - only about 20 months from the spring of 2012 to February 2014, when GM began recalling 2.6 million older cars to fix the switch - even though the first reports of the problem had been made more than a decade earlier.\nNew York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:22:48.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
