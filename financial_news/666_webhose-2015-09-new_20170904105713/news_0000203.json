Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho’s governing coalition faces the Socialists, which requested the 2011 international rescue and then backed some of the bailout’s most important elements when cast out of power. While austerity fueled the rise of Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece, no equivalent party has appeared in Portugal.\n“For markets, the lack of anti-establishment movements in Portugal is likely to mean less headline risk and less chance of policy discontinuity,” said Peter Goves, a London-based strategist at Citigroup Inc.\nBond Yields The country’s 10-year bond yield will edge down to 2.5 percent by the end of October if Coelho retains power, according to the median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg survey. Should the Socialists win, the yield will be just five basis points more, the economists estimate. Three of them expect no difference in yields between the two results.\nIn a nod to the political stability that’s come to characterize Portugal, Standard & Poor’s this month raised the country’s credit rating to BB+, one level below investment grade. The nation’s budget deficit will narrow to about 3.1 percent of gross domestic product this year from 7.4 percent in 2011, European Commission figures show.\n“We expect broad policy continuity, regardless of the outcome of Portugal’s upcoming general elections,” the ratings company said.\nBy contrast, Moody’s Investors Service decided against lifting Ireland’s credit rating this month, partly on concern that a looming general election could lead to an easing of fiscal policy. Ireland also was forced to seek an international bailout during the debt crisis.\nEnduring Coalition In Portugal, Coelho, 51, leads the first coalition government to survive a full term in office since 1974 when the dictatorship ended, and polls are painting a mixed picture of his chances of staying on.\nHis coalition led the Socialists by seven percentage points in a poll for TV\nstation RTP on Thursday, and lagged by 0.5 percentage point in one published by Expresso on Friday.\nEven if no clear winner emerges, Portugal is no stranger to forming minority governments. The last party to obtain a majority in parliament without relying on a coalition partner were the Socialists in 2005.\nA minority government can survive for at least a couple of years if parliament doesn’t block key policies. For example, the Social Democrats in 2010 let the Socialist budget proposal pass by abstaining in a vote.\nThis time around, the two blocs don’t agree on everything. Socialist leader Antonio Costa, 54, proposes narrowing the budget deficit at a slightly slower pace than Coelho. Moreover, the Socialists promise to reverse cuts to state workers’ salaries and eliminate an income-tax surcharge faster than Coelho.\nYet even with a Socialist victory, the market might win.\n“A minority coalition with the existing government parties would be more fiscally conservative,” said Bermingham at BNP. “But a Socialist minority government would probably be more stable.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T10:55:02.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
