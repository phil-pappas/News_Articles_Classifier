Those responsible for this scandal must be punished,\" Ulrich Hocker, head of German shareholder union DSW, told press agency DPA. \nGermany's Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks also expressed her anger, saying the scandal \"casts a pall on the environmental promises of German companies,\" in an interview with Handelsblatt daily to be published Monday. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) impacts of the scandal continue to emerge, with one of the latest being fears over the financial future of the Volkswagen-owned football club. \nBased in the northern German city of Wolfsburg, where the automaker is headquartered, the eponymous team may see its financial lifeline dry up. \nThe Japanese corporation's decision to sell up in the midst of the scandal came as a new sign of distrust in VW after it lost a third of its market capitalisation -- over 20 billion euros -- this week. \nVolkswagen's shareholders, dominated by the Porsche SE holding company -- a separate entity to the luxury brand car -- are expected to hold emergency talks in Berlin on November 9. \n- New strategy needed - \nThe German group had just overtaken the Japanese carmaker Toyota as the world's top car maker. \nIn an interview with FAZ that will be published in full on Sunday, Daimler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) 's CEO Dieter Zetsche expressed \"compassion\" for his former VW opposite number Winterkorn, who was forced to quit Wednesday over the scandal. \nWinterkorn, who once famously said he knows \"every screw in our cars\", said he was \"stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen group.\" \nOf the engines fitted with the defeat devices, 2.8 million are in Germany, according to the country's transport ministry. \nThe group says that five million Volkswagen brand vehicles -- including the sixth-generation Golf, seventh-generation Passat and Tiguan models -- are affected worldwide. \nWhite-haired, blue-eyed Mueller now faces the daunting task of managing the scandal's financial and judicial consequences. \nVW has set aside 6.5 billion euros in provisions for the third quarter to cover the potential costs of the disclosures. \nMueller must also create a new strategy for the group, which in 2014 clocked up a record profit of 11 billion euros and sales of 202 billion euros. \nOther challenges VW faces include competition in the fast-growing car market in China, where the German carmaker's sales have dropped by 5.8 percent this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:14:00.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
