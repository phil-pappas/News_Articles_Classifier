This highlights consumers fragility in the current economic environment.\" \nThe survey found that the dip in confidence was broad based, with people increasingly worried about economic conditions and household finances. \nThe reading on whether consumers felt now was a good time to buy a major household item dropped to its lowest level since May 2014. \n\"Combined with the drop in households' view of their own finances as well as slower house price growth, this suggests that the outlook for retail is likely to remain challenging,\" Ms Emmett said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook PM wants quick passage of China trade deal AAP \nTony Abbott will call on parliament to fully support the trade deal his government has sealed with China.
