Case in point - Savills's most recent World Residential Market report notes that, based on a formula of \"broad economic and demographic factors,\" the U.S. is a \"clear number one\" country for investing in real estate. Of course, the U.S. is a big country, and success for real estate seekers depends on where they plant their financial flags. \"There is a world of difference within the U.S.A. between top tech cities and languishing rustbelt ones,\" says Yolande Barnes, director of world research at Savills.

Stay away from busy streets, commercial structures and nasty externalities.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:32:38.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
