Schmidt also said that they have appealed to the exhibitors and visitors of this year's show to use water sparingly. \n\"We urge all the visitors at this year's show to report any running toilet(s),\" he pleaded \nThe Windhoek Show which kick off tomorrow, will be hosting almost the same number of exhibitors as last year's show. According to Schmidt, this year's stands are all sold. \"We didn't build any additional halls nor have we created new stands,\" he said \nSchmidt also hopes that this year's show will bring different new products thanks to ever changing and advancing innovations. \n\"The show will definitely be different,\" he said, adding that another interesting thing about this year's show is that the whole ground of the show has been turned into a hotspot. \nThis year's show will see security elevated to the next level with different measures put into place. \"The whole area is now covered by surveillance,\" said Schmidt. \nSchmidt hopes that people will have a better experience of the show this year as new rides from the fun park, among other new things will be in operation. \"We believe people will have a tremendous time here visiting the show,\" Schmidt said. This year's show starts tomorrow and will run until Saturday, 3 October.
