Rival parties, who promise to keep the budget balanced, say the Liberals will run short of money and the deficits would be crippling.\nIn a detailed costing of their program, the Liberals said that by the 2019/20 fiscal year they would raise C$3 billion ($2.3 billion) annually by cutting expenditure and boosting personal income tax revenue.\n\"We are very confident we can find these savings ... I think it is the responsibility of any government to continue to seek ways to spend taxpayers' money prudently,\" said Liberal legislator John McCallum, a former national revenue minister.\nThe Liberals promise to cut tax benefits for those earning more than C$200,000 a year, cap how much people can claim through stock option deductions and clamp down on tax evasion.\nLeader Justin Trudeau has already vowed to raise taxes on the top one percent of earners and cancel child benefits paid to all parents, focusing relief instead on those who need it.\nThe costing said the deficit under a Liberal government would be C$9.9 billion in 2016/17, C$9.5 billion in 2017/18 and C$5.7 billion in 2018/19. The budget surplus in 2019/20 is due to be C$1.0 billion.\nThe party it would lower the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 27 percent from the current 31 percent.\nIn a statement, the New Democrats said Trudeau's spending commitments \"continue to pile up along with the questions about how he's going to pay for them\".\nEarlier this month the New Democrats - who have never governed federally - said they would raise the corporate tax rate to 17 percent from the current 15 percent and crack down on tax avoidance.\n($1=$1.33 Canadian) (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Dominic Evans )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T19:26:55.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
