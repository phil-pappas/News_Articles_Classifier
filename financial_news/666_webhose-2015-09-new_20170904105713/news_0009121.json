If it is a consolation, this car can withstand bullets and even hand grenade blasts and is exclusively hand made. This is the first armored vehicle coming from the stable of the automaker famous for manufacturing luxury cars and SUVs. If you are a billionaire with money to spare, this is the car for you.\nRange Rover Sentinel is based on the wheelbase of Range Rover Autobiography . It is built keeping the defence forces in the mind, so it has a six piece armoured passenger cell at its core made from the super high strength steel which can withstand piercing bullets of 7.62mm high velocity. The car has been certified by QinetiQ to V8 standards against ballistic threats.\nIn case of a blast, whether on the roof or from under the vehicle, the Range Rover Sentinel is built to provide lateral protection to its occupants against up to 15 kgs of TNT blast and from DM51 grenade explosion. From the Autobiography, Sentinel has taken the glass but it has been upgraded to a multi-laminated bullet proof armor privacy variety. Another upgrade is the suspension and the 380mm front and 366mm rear ventilated disc brakes with high density pads.\nWith the suspension being upgraded to handle more weight, Range Rover Sentinel has the off road capabilities just like the stock Ranger Rover. This puts the Sentinel ahead of the armoured vehicles which are being sold currently, as going off road and escaping from the uncharted tracks becomes easy when the need arises. The car runs on 20inch split rim alloys with flat inserts, which ensures that the car can run even when the tyres have been deflated.\nThe Range Rover Sentinel also boasts of an anti-tamper exhaust, self sealing fuel tank, auxiliary back up battery and a split charging system. The 100mm opening in driver’s window for document delivery makes sure that no damage is done to the vehicle. It’s optional features include floor and hood fire suppression system, a siren, flashing lights and an external speaker.\nUnder the hood, the Range Rover Sentinel is powered by 3.0 litre supercharged V6 which is mated to a specially calibrated ZF 8 speed automatic transmission.\n 26, 2015 2:26 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.cardekho.com/overview/Land_Rover_Range_Rover/Land_Rover_Range_Rover_Autobiography_5.0_V8.htm"], "published": "2015-09-26T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:47:13.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
