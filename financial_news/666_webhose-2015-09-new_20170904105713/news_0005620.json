The potential for investors is tremendous as the solutions dynaCERT provides are enormous and global in scale. The independent 3rd-party is expected to verify what the Company has already demonstrated on diesel engines in the field; a proven reduction of toxic gasses within the emissions by 35% to 40% all while improving fuel economy of ~15%. The full Technology Journal Review may be viewed at http://technologymarketwatch.com/dya.htm online.\ndynaCERT has solutions to big political real-world pollution issues including carbon emission reduction and significant fuel savings. The Company has the potential to become a major player in the trucking, marine, rail, power generation industries, and its technology even has application within automotive. The share price of dynaCERT is poised for significant upside revaluation to reflect the success of its proprietary technology and the apparent demand for the problems it solves.\nThis fall the Canadian-based technology company will begin shipping the first of its new-generation proprietary carbon emission reduction and fuel-saving units for the trucking industry; dynaCERT is currently filling an initial order for 50 of its new units and is building an inventory of 100. Over the last few years DYA.V has worked with some of the largest trucking fleets in the world under the understanding that with 3rd-party validation of a minimum 8% fuel savings they will commence outfitting their fleet with dynaCERT's 'HydraGen' units. There has been no disagreement that dynaCERT’s technology accomplished 8%+ fuel-savings, the issue since has been obtaining the hard data to give to engineers of its clientele; it has been a time consuming and expensive process. The good news is all of the data is now objectively computer generated, pulled right from the trucks and sent to an accredited 3rd-party source. It is a fact that rigorous year-long multi-phase field testing has validated enormous reductions in toxic emissions combined with impressive increased fuel efficiency, and it now appears with the first of the Company's new-generation of units to hit the street this fall, that official 3rd-party accreditation is expected to follow near-term.\nOver the last several years dynaCERT engineers (former NASA rocket scientist and engineers experienced in combustion efficiency) have refined development of the technology while testing with selected prospective commercial end-users, and the results have been impressive. dynaCERT had over 200 Pepsi trucks equipped and demonstrated an average of 14.8% fuel savings, several of the units are still in service today (September-2015). dynaCERT has expressions of interest from numerous entities expected to translate to sizeable purchase orders. dynaCERT's technology is scalable; the Company is tackling the trucking industry first with its new 3 L/minute Hydrogen units, and is also working on validation of its up to 300 L/minute Hydrogen units for marine, rail, and power generation industries. The math on sales potential is staggering; example: to outfit just one container ship could easily generate close to $1 million in sales and there are >90,000 commercial cargo ships operating world-wide, let alone the tens-of-millions of trucks worldwide.\nUnderstanding the uniqueness behind dynaCERT’s H2/O2 HydraGen technology: dynaCERT’s technology is unique in the marketplace, it's units are essentially computerized on-demand electrolysis systems that supply the air intake of internal combustion engines with timed releases of hydrogen and oxygen gases. Results verify increased fuel economy, improved torque, extended engine oil life and a substantial reduction harmful emissions. The introduction of hydrogen, in the correct proportion and at the right timing, into the air intake of a diesel engine creates a cleaner, more efficient burn, however unlike cruder and problematic 'brown-gas', dynaCERT's 'HydraGen'TM units produce pure oxygen and pure hydrogen and releases these elements individually in a controlled & timed way by interfacing with the on-board computer of the subject engine.\ndynaCERT is currently targeting the commercial diesel truck market with a 3 L/minute Hydrogen unit. dynaCERT now has some trucks in the field returning with in excess of 17.5% improved fuel economy while at the same time reducing the toxic gasses within the emissions by 35% - 40%. The newest generation from dynaCERT is fully computerized and able to communicate directly with the on-board computer of the truck and alter the fuel mapping of the truck to enhance the burn. The unit has an in-cab monitor that provides status information, including distilled water level (the raw ingredient for making the hydrogen) indicator, a built-in GPS, and a built-in cellular communication for dynaCERT or a fleet maintenance crew to log into from anywhere in the world and monitor. With most trucks the payback on investment from fuel-savings alone is easily within a years, even at lower gas prices today. An even bigger savings comes from the fact that one of the biggest expenses for some (especially buses) is the down-time because of carbon fouling, something that is dramatically lessened with the cleaner (more-complete) burn attained with H2/O2 technology. With 3rd-party accredited validation nearing a point engineers for fleets can officially act on the data, a fleet operator would be remiss in not proceeding with purchasing dynaCERT technology.\ndynaCERT is also targeting power generation, rail, and the marine market with a 300 L/minute Hydrogen unit.\nThe full Technology Journal Review may be viewed at http://technologymarketwatch.com/dya.htm online.\nSource of news regarding VW admitting cheating: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-09-21/volkswagen-admits-cheating-u-s-diesel-emissions-tests -- Bloomberg News September 21, 2015.\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements regarding future events that involve risk and uncertainties.
