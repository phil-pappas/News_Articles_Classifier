Mass production will start from September 30. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150929005871/en/ Toshiba: High-side N-Channel Power MOSFET Gate Driver for Reverse Battery Protection in Automotive Applications (Photo: Business Wire) Idling stop systems, which turn off car engines while the car is stopping for traffic lights and traffic jams, are now commonly used in automotive systems as a means to improve fuel efficiency. Using the new gate driver, “TPD7104AF”, and an N-channel power MOSFET allows you to form a semiconductor relay for each power supply line to control the power supply between the batteries and the starter generator used in idling stop systems. Also, the new product prevents the flow of electric current into the IC when the power supply is connected to reverse and can control MOSFETs with reverse battery protection. [1] Idling stop systems, junction boxes, semiconductor relays and semiconductor switches of electronic control units (ECU). Key Features of the New Product: 1. Built-in charge pump circuit 2. Built-in protection functions: overcurrent, reverse battery 3. Built-in diagnostic functions: overcurrent 4. Small size package: PS-8 (2.8mm x 2.9mm) 5. Output leak current for reverse connection of power supply: I REV =-1μA(max) (@ T j =-25°C) Notes [1] The design needs to have pin No.4 open, with pin No.1 being the lowest voltage in the circuit when the power supply is connected to reverse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:32:53.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
