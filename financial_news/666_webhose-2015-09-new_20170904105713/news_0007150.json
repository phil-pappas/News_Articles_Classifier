The accelerated decline this year has highlighted expectations that barring regulatory changes, railroads' revenue from coal should continue to decline.\nRailroad shares have plunged as a result. The Dow Jones U.S. Railroads index has pulled back 27.9 percent this year after rising 39.7 percent in 2013 and 28.9 percent in 2014. The railroads' decline has contributed to a 14-percent year-to-date decline for the broader Dow Jones transportation average.\nThe major publicly-traded U.S. railroads including Union Pacific Corp, CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp have missed estimates or trimmed earnings forecasts, furloughed workers and parked equipment, largely as a result of the coal downturn.\n\"All that coal is not coming back,\" said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. \"The question is how much (consumer goods) can mitigate those declines.\"\nIt is an open question. Intermodal freight volumes are more than double coal and make up 47 percent of total rail traffic, according to the American Association of Railroads, but that is a low-margin business where revenue per carload is often half or less than coal.\nAnd though intermodal shipments have risen more than 17 percent since 2008, the moderate 3.1 percent increase in intermodal freight shipments so far this year has not been nearly enough to offset coal revenue declines.\nIf the economy and consumer spending hit a consistent stride in 2016, that would lift intermodal shipments - perhaps enough to beat 2015 volumes. But with consumer spending on goods and services expected to rise just 2.8 percent in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will likely take years to offset coal's decline.\n\"If economic growth can pick up, the rails will look like a bargain,\" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Mark Levin.\nWall Street consensus shows aggregate earnings returning to more than 9-percent growth in the first half of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. But part of that improvement will likely be because of a comparison with weak 2015 numbers.\nThe group is seen posting an earnings decline of 8.3 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe 2016 earnings estimates may need to come down. Macquarie Research analyst Cleo Zagrean says, \"the commodity environment remains bleak\" and U.S. utilities may switch to natural gas at a faster pace than investors expect in coming years.\nCOAL BURNOUT\nAll of the major publicly traded U.S. railroads have experienced double-digit declines in coal shipments and revenues since 2008.\nCSX, the most exposed with 21 percent of second quarter revenue coming from coal shipments, has seen coal shipments decline 30 percent since 2008. Its share price has fallen 26.8 percent this year. Norfolk Southern's coal carloads have fallen and 28 percent while Union Pacific coal carloads have fallen nearly 25 percent in the same time frame. Norfolk Southern shares are down 31 percent so far this year while Union Pacific shares have fallen 27.3 percent.\nRailroad executives have expressed hope consumers will help lift intermodal in the year ahead.\n\"Where we're doing better are the consumer-driven things,\" Norfolk Southern chief financial officer Marta Stewart told a Citibank investor conference this month. \"We think that's going to continue into 2016.\" (Reporting By Nick Carey and Sinead Carew; editing by Linda Stern and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T08:22:43.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
