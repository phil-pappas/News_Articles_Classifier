He has sent me some extremely offensive messages. But he has said nothing to me in the office. What should I do? \nA This colleague might be ignoring you in the office, but you can’t ignore him. Until you tackle him face to face, the messages will keep coming and may well become even more offensive. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) time your paths cross, ask for a word, and say, “I don’t like receiving your messages and if I get one more I will take action.” \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) might be tempting to suggest putting his picture on the canteen dart board, but it would be better to expose his behaviour by revealing all to your boss. \nQ Ninety per cent of the emails sent to my work address are useless, boring or downright annoying. I want to stop these idiots from wasting my time. What automatic response can I send to prevent further irritating missives without making me hugely unpopular or stopping people sending me the messages I actually want to read? \nA I confess that sometimes I enjoy deleting an unwelcome message, with a flourish and a four-letter word in a similar fashion to the way I answer recorded telephone messages that try to persuade me to pursue a PPI claim. \nI assume your IT department has installed a spam filter, but don’t expect perfection. Unfortunately, some important and even vital messages can be caught by the filter and a few bits of junk are bound to get through whenever it becomes a problem I forward the offending message to our head of IT, Paul. \nBut even he can’t stop all my unwelcome emails. \nI get several sales messages from friendly foreign companies who slip through the net by sending the email from Nikki, Suzie or Bill. The ones in Russian are particularly easy to spot. \nI still attract “only a few places left” invitations to conferences, seminars, webinars and breakfast briefings from accountants and lawyers, all keen to show me how to make life even more complicated, and creating a new fee income for themselves in the process. \nI get irresistible offers to buy a once- in-a-lifetime corporate package to Ascot, Wimbledon or Twickenham, and have more than once been invited to abseil down The Shard for charity. \n(I have such a severe fear of heights that early in our married life Alex had to take me off Blackpool pier). \nI am particularly irritated by the sales pitches that treat me like a bosom pal. “Hi John, how’s your day going, just pinging a message to check if you have a gap in your diary for a face to face on Tuesday, Speak soon, Steve.” \nNeedless to say, I don’t know Steve, or Pete who is touching base to check whether I could diary a call, or even Sally, who wants me to put her in touch with the person responsible for buying loo paper. \nBusiness emails are irritating, but the most annoying come from people I know who should know better. \nTop of the list are those who always press the “reply to all” button. There really is no need to send everyone in the committee a copy of your email to the chairman saying you might be 10 minutes late because you have to drop your partner off at her Zumba class. \nAlmost as irritating is the auto-reply. After an urgent email request you are delighted to get an almost immediate reply, only to discover that the recipient is not at their desk and won’t be back until after a long weekend. \nOne day, I bought five books at WH Smith (LSE: SMWH.L - news ) at Euston and as I reached my platform I was tapped on the shoulder by the shop worker with the credit card that I’d left at the checkout. \nI emailed the WH Smith customer service desk asking them to pass on my praise to their helpful guy at Euston. I received an automatic reply: “We are sorry to hear you have cause for complaint. We are very busy at the moment, but will respond to your problem within four days.” \nI suggest that you forget any thoughts of creating your own general reply to unwelcome emails. However you respond, you will probably get another annoying message in return. \nSimply express your frustration using your favourite expletive while deleting the offending message. Once it has disappeared, you will feel a lot better. \nJohn Timpson is the chairman of key-cutting business Timpson, which supports the charity After Adoption.
