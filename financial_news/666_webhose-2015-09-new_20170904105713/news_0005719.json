CDM resulted from the privatization of what used to be state owned breweries in Maputo and Beira, and is currently the Mozambican subsidiary of SAB-Millers, the British-South African company that is the second largest producer of alcoholic drinks in the world. \nNyusi praised CDM for using Mozambican cassava to brew the “Impala” brand of beer in a new brewery built in the northern city of Nampula. Initially the cassava was purchased in the Nampula district of Ribaue. Subsequently CDM also purchased cassava in Inharrime, in the southern province of Inhambane. \nCurrently about 6,000 farmers are selling cassava to CDM. Thanks to CDM, “this crop now has a guaranteed market”, said Nyusi. \nIn addition, CDM was now buying sugar and crates from Mozambican suppliers. “This is a clear indication that other materials which are still being imported to produce beer could be acquired locally”, said the President. “This is also a true contribution to national development”. \nHe also noted that CDM is one of the country's major taxpapers. Its contributions to the state budget, said Nyusi, “will contribute to expanding education, health and water supply services, as well as to building roads and expanding the electricity grid”. \nHe stressed that industry is one of the priorities for his government, since it allows the structural transformation of the economy, increased competitiveness, and the insertion of Mozambique into the world market. \nIndustry, he said, “plays a key role in the modernization of our economy, the increase in production, productivity and employment, the promotion of the value chain and of local content, and in import substitution”. \n“In other words, we are saying that our government regards industrialization as a determinant factor, driving economic development”, declared Nyusi. \nBut CDM's success is built on a product which can cause enormous damage. Nyusi recognized this and called on the company to transit educational messages urging the responsible consumption of alcoholic drinks, and avoiding the excessive drinking that can destroy families and lives. \nNyusi reiterated the government's full support to industrial development initiatives. The government he said, encourages an increase in investments that will put Mozambique in a prominent position on the international industrial map. \nFor his part, the chairperson of the CDM Board of Directors, Tomas Salomao, said that the company's contribution to the Mozambican state in taxes over the past ten years amounted to the equivalent of about one billion US dollars. It had also generated income of about 800 million dollars for the traders who deal in its products. \nOver the same period, Salomao added, the purchase of local materials and services had reached 746 million dollars, thus including local businesses in the CDM value chain. CDM employs 1,300 people directly, but an estimated 150,000 other jobs are dependent on its value chain. \nSalomao took the opportunity to announce that later this year CDM will launch a new, non-alcoholic drink, based on maize.
