Andre Penner Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Here's a helpful travel hint. Don't ask a taxi driver for an opinion on Uber. The blaze of fury about unfair and illegal competition is likely to last all the way to the passenger's destination.\nThe trouble for the taxi industry is that an increasing number of their former passengers don't share that antipathy. Quite the reverse. UberX now has more than 1 million users in Australia. Most wouldn't consider reverting to an alternative they see as more expensive and less reliable.\nThis strong consumer preference will inevitably overwhelm attempts by various governments – in Australia as well as much of the rest of the world – to stop the Uber service in its tracks.\nBut it apparently doesn't deter a range of governments from trying to limit Uber's accelerating popularity, if only to try to assuage angry taxi drivers forced to pay much higher licence and other fees.\nFrom Florida to California, from Spain to Belgium, local governments are challenging the legality and terms of the latest \"ride-sharing\" service. The company, which is now valued at over $US50 billion, fights back with just as aggressive legal tactics.\nUber's most powerful weapon is still the consumer, along with an apparently endless supply of people happy to earn extra money by providing this new service. Even New York City mayor Bill de Blasio backed down from his attempt to limit numbers after a social media campaign.\nRegistrations suspended The latest Australian front in the battle is this week's decision by the maritime roads and services authority in NSW to suspend registration of 40 vehicles for three months . That means these cars are supposedly not registered or insured for any road use at all, not just Uber driving. It's inevitably going to result in yet another court battle. In July, the NSW authority had already been forced to drop charges against 24 UberX drivers for alleged breaches of the Passenger Transport Act because of what it called \"evidentiary issues\". Other states like Queensland and Victoria are also taking some Uber drivers to court.\n The revised NSW punishment may cause some UberX drivers to reconsider the appeal of their new jobs. It may be more effective than simply issuing the drivers with fines which the company pays anyway. It may even make some taxi drivers hope that the worst of the Uber challenge is over.\nBut it's certainly not going to stop more and more people using the service. The comparison with fingers in dykes is irresistible.\nSuch tough action by the NSW traffic authority also seems to cut across the work of an independent taskforce set up by the state government to examine the ride-sharing industry. Maybe waiting for some recommendations first might have been appropriate?\nSuch political contradictions and policy confusion are not unusual in \"the sharing economy\", however. Every business, every consumer, must adjust to massive changes. But many politicians veer between praising innovation and warning of the potential threat to established working conditions or to the tax base.\nThe sharing economy has a very broad definition, of course. The general principle is the idea of making better and more productive use of under-utilised assets – from spare bedrooms or apartments to the family car – in order to provide a service. That sharing, most often, means extra income for the owner and more options for the consumer.\nTax base But there's no doubt that much of this activity does also alter the tax base and the traditional conditions of work.\nUber drivers are not employees , for example, so they don't have the same protections. Instead they rely on the rankings and customer assessments of their passengers and the freedom of when and how to work. Other people use websites to bid to deliver tasks, virtual or physical. That clearly offers greater flexibility and work opportunities. It could also be considered a form of cut price exploitation.\nGiven the carnage being wreaked on much of the working world, the concept of new forms of growth and new sources of jobs is still obviously appealing – as well as unstoppable. So what restrictions, if any, should be in place?\nThe Australian Taxation Office has just had a major brawl with Uber over whether it should be classed as a taxi service, for example, making its drivers liable to pay GST on every fare from August 1. This will also end in court. But so far the ATO has stuck to its judgement and there's been a spike in taxi driver registrations, presumably Uber drivers. But Uber is just one of many companies helping to use the complicated international tax arrangements, often channelled via the Netherlands, to help to limit the corporate income tax it pays in higher taxing countries.\nUber's argument is that their drivers pay income tax on the 80 per cent of the fare they get to keep after Uber takes 20 per cent. And that the business is actually creating more jobs and opportunities for people to take advantage of new services in a new digital world.\nThe different ways to use this digital world can still be costly to more traditional providers, well beyond the taxi industry. Or even to a hotel industry coping with accommodation services such as Airbnb.\nOn a recent trip to Europe, we often rented strangers' apartments in different cities. That turned out to be much more relaxing than hotel living. Yet I noticed our temporary neighbours, although polite, were hardly welcoming. I realised how irritating it would be for permanent residents to have new tenants next door every few days, with little ability to control behaviour or noise. Ok I promise to be quiet – but next time I will still be renting apartments.
