At the just concluded World Athletics Championships in Beijing, China, the country emerged tops, beating heavyweights like Jamaica, USA and Great Britain. \nOur athletes' prowess has given them great rewards, with many of them becoming overnight millionaires. However, managing the instant transition from poverty to wealth amongst sportspeople has been a challenge, with many them plunging into social problems. \nGetting huge race proceeds without investing in viable businesses has almost become a norm, with many athletes ending up squandering their hard-earned money. Some of our great sportsmen and women of yesteryears are languishing in poverty despite their exploits on the track. \nAccording to financial experts, most of them come from humble backgrounds and they are poorly equipped with financial knowledge on how to deal with the transition from poverty and wealth. \nIronically, athletes who competed in these races when huge cash prizes were not given or were running without pay are leading a good life after planning for the little they got. \nThere are those who have succeeded like marathon legend Paul Tergat, first Kenyan woman Olympian Tecla Sang, active world marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang, David Rudisha and Lornah Kiplagat who are forces to reckon with in investment. \nIn May 2011, former Olympic marathon champion Samuel Wanjiru lost his life in unclear circumstances. \nDutch journalist Frits Conijn in his book Running on Empty writes about Wanjiru's story on how he was felled by money, women, fame and alcohol. \nIt clearly painted a sudden rise and fall of a star unable to manage their massive wealth, social life among other issues. \nMartin Keino is the director of Keino Sports Marketing, which has been conducting seminars on investments and social life management aimed at sensitising athletes to lead better lives. \n\"There are several emerging sad cases of athletes being overwhelmed in their personal life, turning to drugs and alcohol and thus destroying their careers,\" Keino said. \n\"That informed our decision to start such training workshops where we can bring in different experts in financial, lifestyle specialists, communication and other crucial areas to educate them,\" he added. \nIn most cases, Keino said, athletics management bodies have focused more on athletes' finances, forgetting other important aspects like wealth management, self care, stress management and career planning. \nJoseph Rotich of Strategic Investments Leverage Ltd said an athlete's career is very short yet many of them seem not to have internalised this. \n\"It is true that money has been a challenge for our athletes and you will find that they totally don't have knowledge on how to wisely spend it,\" Rotich, whose company helps start-ups to develop viable business ideas, said. \nRotich said the athletes end up using their money on 'unreasonable things' like going out with friends and buying flashy cars without a clear plan. \n\"Most of them get huge amounts of money at once and that could be their only money in their life, so they need to know how to manage it. It is important to seek professional advice and make their money last through investment,\" Rotich advised. \nHe said it is important to plan ahead and choose appropriate investment options based on their goals -- they should be aware of market changes and know how the changes will affect their money. \nHowever, Rotich noted that some athletes may be willing to invest but lack proper advice. \n\"We are proposing the setting of bodies that can visit athletes and offer them advice on investment and social life. Otherwise they may want to but where will they get the right information?\" \nAthletics Kenya had launched seminars that train athletes on various issues ranging from doping, education to investment but the initiative collapsed. \nAccording to Dennis Rop from Kenya Securities Ltd, there are several investment opportunities, which are viable, and it is high time athletes started venturing into some of them. \nRop said stocks, bonds and treasury bills are some of the ways in which athletes can invest their money. \n\"Athletes should diversify their portfolio and venture into this kind of business. When you own shares you participate in the profitability of the company,\" Rop said during the AK athletes' seminar held in Eldoret in 2013. \nCoach Robert Ng'isirei said they have been advocating for the setting up of a trust fund for athletes so as to benefit them when they retire from the track. \n\"It has been very difficult since most of them don't want to hear about the idea and when someone wins money they don't want to be told how to use it. There is need for a trust fund where they can contribute while still active and when they retire, they will benefit,\" he said. \nKeino said it is a global problem and athletes need to know that without discipline, talent is useless and they need to safeguard their image too. \nElite sportspeople overseas rarely reveal their secrets, he said, since they have developed a plan on how to handle their socials problems. \n\"Problems are always there but should you let the public know about them and tarnish your image? Only few cases of elite athletes' misbehaviour are heard but many of them get into problems but their system of handling them is very professional,\" he said.
