The company is a well-known investor in renewable and sustainable energy companies and has acted as lead underwriter in several initial public offerings that have debuted on the mainland Chinese stock indices.\"Despite the hyperbole, shale oil isn't the long-term answer to the world's need for cheap and abundant energy. In our view, natural gas is far closer to being a solution than the particularly messy business of hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking' and we've been happy to back that view with funds,\" says Ollie Seigler, head of energy research at Fox Capital Partners and a long-term critic of fracking's environmental impact.Seigler was speaking at a renewable and sustainable energy symposium in Beijing ahead of the launch of a series of Fox Capital Partners institutional investor reports discussing what it considers to be the bright prospects for alternative fuel investment against the current backdrop of low crude oil prices. The firm recently reported that it was in talks with a leading sustainable energy company that it hoped would be one of the first new IPOs to be listed on a mainland Chinese stock market since the country's financial regulator banned new listings in response to a deep, protracted correction in share prices in June this year.Fox Capital Partners still believes that shale oil is unviable with prices below $90 a barrel. That some of these producers are still in business owes more to creative accounting and their ability to borrow billions on Wall Street than it does to any new efficiencies in their production techniques,\" explained Seigler.
