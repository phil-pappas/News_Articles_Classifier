What better topic to discuss this time than smart-security devices that are simple to use, in addition to being smarter and in most cases cheaper than your average home-security system?\nCocoon Although very small, Cocoon (pictured above) has a few aces up its sleeve. It will monitor your home when it matters most: when you’re out and about or when you’re asleep. It will keep your place safe by tracking noise levels and reporting any unusual sounds via the Cocoon app on your smartphone. To separate the “usual noise” from a burglar breaking in, as well as to monitor sound levels throughout your home, Cocoon employs technology similar to what is currently used by seismologists to detect earthquakes.\nWhen suspicious sounds are recorded, its high-definition night-vision-enabled camera will turn on, giving you the opportunity to see what’s going on and an option to ignore the notification, turn on the siren or call the police. Video streamed to your phone is encrypted, so it won’t be hijacked or used by a third party.\nCocoon is being featured on Indiegogo, with shipping to backers scheduled for December 2015. At the time of writing this article, only a triple pack (three devices) was available for purchase, for $999.\nCanary Canary Canary holds a special place on my wish list, since it’s a device I’ve been thinking of buying for a while. With this all-in-one device, you get a motion-activated security camera, as well as air quality, humidity and temperature sensors. That makes Canary ideal for pairing up with automation-enabled air conditioners and heaters, thus further increasing its already impressive set of features. Once motion detection has been triggered, night-vision-enabled cameras turn on, sending a feed to your phone and allowing you to fire a very loud 90-decibel alarm (think Boeing 737 loud), call the police or ignore the event altogether. The device will save these videos by default, so you can review them later.\nAlthough Canary is a one-time purchase, there are subscription plans available to increase the length of recorded video history (from the default 12 hours up to 30 days) and enable you to bookmark more than five videos. This is by no means mandatory and can be useful if you make recordings you’re particularly fond of, such as recording your pet or a child. Canary costs $249.\nCocoon and Canary are great, and what’s even better, they can be used whether you own a home-automation setup (into which they could be integrated) or not. But what if you want to prevent someone from intruding in the first place? Owning a smart lock could help. Here are a few:\nKevo Smart Lock Kevo Kevo is a Bluetooth-enabled deadbolt that can turn your smartphone into a key. It locks and unlocks with a touch of a finger while your smartphone remains in your purse or pocket, eliminating the need to fumble for keys. It is powered by four AA batteries that last up to a year. Using an iPhone or an Android app (see which devices are supported ), Kevo can be programmed to allow access to select individuals and during specific times.\nNo smartphone? No problem. You can open the lock using Bluetooth fobs (one comes bundled, additional ones are sold separately), which can be configured according to your specifications. They can be attached to your keychain or belt strap, so they’re great for children and those who forget (or don’t own) a smartphone. In case of an emergency or failure, you can open Kevo with a mechanical key that comes bundled with the deadbolt. This device costs $189.50.\nGoji Smart Lock Goji Smart Lock The Goji Smart Lock is an interesting device, but caution is warranted. This beautifully crafted digital lock can send alerts to your smartphone as well as take photos of visitors. The lock system is touted as being very safe, boasting features such as bank-security standards, 256-bit encryption as well as a mechanical lock itself being UL-compliant.\nHowever, that’s sadly where the good news ends. If you’d like to own a Goji Smart Lock, I advise caution. Many customers who have paid for it have not only filed for a refund, but are also considering joining a possible class-action lawsuit against the company. That has delayed the product release for quite a while, and also increased its price to $324, due to adding (seemingly undisclosed) additional features. Those are a lot of red flags for what could be an amazing product.\nSo far we’ve covered home monitoring all-in-one solutions and smart locks. (Here’s a great list of even more locks — Haven looks quite interesting.) But you could also just use your existing smart home-sensor system. The system could detect unauthorized entry and send the video feed through installed cameras, or you could schedule lights to turn on and off at evenings to simulate someone being at home. A more imaginative user could even play sounds, such as footsteps, TV or even dog barking when a proximity sensor gets triggered, thus discouraging a would-be burglar.\nIf you’re not a DIY person, similar systems (such as MivaLife or Rogers Home Monitoring) already exist, whether as a part of a security bundle or as a stand-alone product. Although packing more features, these bundles usually come with subscription fees and there may be additional costs associated with installation, so make sure you take that into account when considering a purchase.\nWhich one of these devices seems most interesting to you?
