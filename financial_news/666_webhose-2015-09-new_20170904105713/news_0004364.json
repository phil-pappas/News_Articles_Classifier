Sasha Woolley by Ben Potter Things have reached a pretty pass when central bankers feel free to lecture professional politicians on the dark arts of spin.\nBut Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Phil Lowe didn't take a backward step last week when asked by a concerned businessman how the government could better sell \"reform\".\nIt's \"semantics but important semantics\", Dr Lowe opined in full Hollow Men mode.\n\"When you talk about reform you get a sense that it's boring and technical, not that interesting for the community as a whole.\"\nBusiness has lamented with increasing desperation through the Rudd, Gillard and Abbott governments that modern politicians are unable to sell reform like past masters of the dark arts.\nThe frustration led The Australian Financial Review and its rival newspaper, The Australian , to host a National Reform Summit last month in a bid to get economic reform going again.\nOrdinary people don't relate to the need for reform, Dr Lowe explained to a Committee for Economic Development of Australia lunch in Melbourne on Thursday.\nBut they could better relate to the idea the economy needs to grow more strongly, needs to generate stronger growth in real wages, stronger growth in living standards and \"stronger growth in our collective wealth\", he said.\n \"So it's really about that framing.\"\nGrow the pie Dr Lowe was just getting going. \"If you frame the question as 'How do we reform?' – you lose people straight away.\n\"If you frame the question as 'How do we grow? How do we grow the pie? How do we grow our real incomes? How do we grow our wealth?' – that's something that's much easier I hope for people to catalyse around.\"\nHe conceded that \"you obviously need reform for growth\".\nOddly though for one of the Reserve Bank's top policymakers, when asked \"what reform?\" he pleaded that the question was \"way beyond my competency\" and that he could only \"reflect what I read\".\nOne candidate would be the \"relatively poor record\" of collaboration between business and universities in Australia.\nThe other would be \"the general incentives in the tax system and the bankruptcy code\", he said.\n\"Most economic actions are driven by incentives.\"\nBack on safer ground, Dr Lowe observed that \"real income per capita in Australia today (is) no higher than it was in 2008\".\nBefore 2008, real income per capita grew by two-and-a-half per cent each year for 15 years, he said.\nBut the factors that drove that surge – exceptional productivity growth in the 1990s, the mining boom in the 2000s, favourable demographics – had shrivelled.\n\"The whole wealth generation mechanism – the way our average living standards were rising – that's all changed.\"\nWe need to get the debate back to income growth per capita, he said.\n\"How can we get that to grow again? That's the key to living standards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T09:49:31.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
