Its shares have fallen by half in the past year. The slashed capital budgets at oil and gas producers have hit service providers such as Weatherford first. It has also been considered the runt of the sector. Its enterprise value of $15bn lags behind titans Schlumberger ($100bn) and Halliburton ($37bn). \nThe basis of Monday’s investor revolt is curious, however. Energy firms, have been selling debt and equity to shore up balance sheets. Weatherford, though, is projecting positive free cash flow this year after cutting 40 per cent of its workforce over the past two years. It just extended its credit facility and has $2bn in liquidity. \nWeatherford’s management believed it was ready to go on the offensive; the fundraising would have put it in a position to acquire a directional drilling business that the combined Halliburton/ Baker Hughes was expected to divest. Analysts believe the unit is a good fit and the company said it expected any dealmaking to add to earnings. \nShareholders, however, clearly prefer that the company hunker down. That aversion to growth could earn a Clintonian indictment of investor priorities. But management looks worse, lacking the credibility to execute a stealth offering, or quell the subsequent revolt. \nEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
