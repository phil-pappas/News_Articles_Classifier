A new ship, the Celestyal Nefeli (ex Gemini), will replace the Celestyal Odyssey, whose charter agreement will be concluded at the end of October according to its agreed-upon terms. The name, “Nefeli,” comes from Greek mythology; Nefeli was a goddess of hospitality and a nymph of the clouds.\nThe Celestyal Nefeli will perform Celestyal’s popular itineraries for the next two years, with embarkation from Turkey. She is the perfect size for docking in the smaller, unique harbors throughout the Eastern Mediterranean like her fleet mates Celestyal Crystal and Celestyal Olympia. The introduction of smaller ports is part of the strategy to open new destinations in Eastern Mediterranean cruising. Since 2014, Celestyal has added 15 new destinations which include Milos, Ios, Kos, Samos, Symi, Chios, Cesme and Syros. These gems are only accessible to mid-sized vessels that comprise Celestyal’s fleet. An added benefit of the smaller ships is warm and personalized service. All of Celestyal Cruises’ source markets have responded to these new destinations with enthusiasm.\nPassengers have also responded with enthusiasm to the company’s program of on-board and offshore bespoke themed events. In 2016 Celestyal will increase the number of themed events on its cruises so as to provide even more travelers with the best of Greek culture, gastronomy, history and wine. These themed events have become core to the “Real Greek Experience” that Celestyal offers its cruisers.\nThe Celestyal Nefeli (ex Gemini), which can accommodate 1,074 cruisers, was originally built in 1992 by Union Naval de Levante SA in Valencia, Spain. She will be delivered to Celestyal in February and refurbished prior to the commencement of the 2016 cruise season. Of her 400 cabins (277 outside and 123 inside), 12 are executive suites and 31 are junior suites: most of the executive suites have private balconies.\nCelestyal Cruises 2016 Iconic and Idyllic itineraries are now available for booking.
