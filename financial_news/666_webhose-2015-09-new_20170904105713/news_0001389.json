Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Controversial ride-sharing app company Uber has been dealt a blow after losing a legal bid to have criminal charges against their drivers thrown out of court in a critical test case of the app's legality.\nProtests by taxi drivers against the unregulated UberX service have intensified across the country and the criminal case will now proceed to trial on October 9, as state governments have been left baffled by the digitally driven business model which confounds existing regulation.\nMelbourne Magistrate Julian Ayres said on Friday that he did not accept Uber's argument that UberX driver and former band manager Nathan Brenner was entrapped by agents from the Taxi Services Commission and that a Victorian undercover sting operation was legal. In July, the NSW government was forced to drop similar criminal charges against 24 UberX drivers after a bungled prosecution.\nBrenner: test case UberX driver Nathan Brenner is facing three charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court Simon Schluter Mr Brenner is the lead case for 10 other UberX drivers who have been charged with driving and owning a commercial passenger vehicle without a licence, and faces fines of up to $24,000 in a national test case for Uber.\n\"I do not consider the words and actions of investigators ... convinced Mr Brenner to act in any way involuntarily ... any relevant evidence obtained is admissible,\" the magistrate ruled.\n\"Even if I am incorrect about admissibility, such evidence was received anyway. I do not accept [Uber's] no case submission,\" he ruled on Friday afternoon.\nThe alleged offences took place between May 28 and August 27 in Geelong, Southbank and Melbourne's central business district, specifically a $9 trip when Mr Brenner drove undercover investigators from Melbourne's Hilton Hotel to Hotel Como in South Yarra.\nThe failure of state governments to act has led to protests and citizen arrests of UberX drivers. Justin McManus A spokeswoman for Uber, which now has 15,000 drivers, has shown a track record of frustrating regulators , including paying fines for drivers and blocking the mobile phones of Queensland transport inspectors.\n\"We are disappointed that the case against Mr Brenner was not dismissed today. We will continue to support him as the case continues,\" spokeswoman Katie Curran said after the decision.\n\"[The] government needs to quickly create a regulatory framework for ride-sharing rather than wasting further taxpayer money targeting everyday Victorians through the courts.\"\nState governments across most states have launched inquiries into Uber – which is also on a collision course with the Australian Taxation Office over the payment of GST – but the failure to quickly respond has led to protests and vigilante action including citizen arrests of UberX drivers.\nThe NSW Taxi Council's ad about ride sharing. NSW Taxi Council Consumer group Choice and federal politicians have backed Uber, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull praising the ride-sharing app for being part of the \"agile\" economy, just hours before the decision. Labor's shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh, speaking in Melbourne on Friday about the sharing economy, is another supporter.\nBut the NSW Taxi Council has launched an advertising campaign warning that ride-sharing is no safer than hitchhiking.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/uber-has-revolutionised-transport-in-australia-but-will-taxpayers-get-anything-in-return-20150924-gju1kb.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/uberx-rides-are-safe-says-choice-busting-the-taxi-council-claims-20150923-gjswf9.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/taxi-drivers-to-rally-in-the-city-during-the-tram-strike-to-protest-against-uberx-20150909-gjiejo.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/why-the-uber-court-decision-is-important-20150924-gju4xf.html"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:11:16.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
