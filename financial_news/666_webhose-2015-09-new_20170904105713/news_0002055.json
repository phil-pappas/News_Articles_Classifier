( FTTN ) has seen several promising signs the market may at last have corrected and prices will now stabilize and even inch upward . \n“We’ve seen several indicators that show demand is rising and production declining , which will eliminate the current oversupply ,” said FTTN CEO Sydney Jim. “Once we reach an equilibrium, the recovery can begin. FTTN has been diligently preparing and we’ll be in an excellent, diversified position to prosper and take full advantage of the rebound when it arrives.” \nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has issued a report predicting today’s low prices will soak up the supply glut, result in production cuts in non-OPEC nations and lead to greater need for its products. \nFTTN has remained vigilant during the current price slump, keeping its eyes open for value-based acquisitions of existing producing properties and looking to partner with other companies to expand into new production opportunities . FTTN is also currently exploring other revenue-generating ventures in renewable energy and enhanced oil recovery . \n“We continue to build towards sustainable revenue streams and increased shareholder value,” Mr. Jim said. “Our aggressive, yet prudent strategy will help us achieve these goals.” \nFor more information on FTTN’s oil and gas projects, please visit www.firsttitanenergy.com . \nAbout First Titan Corp. \nFirst Titan Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiary, First Titan Energy, LLC, is committed to the exploration and development of oil and natural gas resources around the globe.
