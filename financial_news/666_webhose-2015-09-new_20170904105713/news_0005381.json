The function allows apps to perform certain tasks in the background while you're using other apps or not using your device. \nHope all is dope and those in final exam classes are slogging at their studies like there is no tomorrow. \nThis week's buzz is with iphone 6 and 6 plus. \nUnlike the previous iphones which of course some of you are still stuck with, these two iphones come with bigger screens, iphone 6 has a 4,7 inch, while the 6plus has a 5,5 inch screen. This actually proves that bigger is better because it allows the user to have a better display and easier to use. \nWith these two iphones the user can easily reach the top of the iphone using one hand as the screen can be shifted up and down to allow easy accessibility of the top functions, especially when the other hand is occupied, hence, the iphone 6's new reach ability feature. \nYou simply double-touch the Home <http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/> button to shift the screen down closer to your thumb, and once you make your selection, it will conveniently slide back up to its natural position with no second hand required. \nThe iphone 6 has stellar video recording capabilities, especially when you enable 60 FPS which allows you to capture smoother videos. The feature essentially doubles the amount of frames per second when recording, taking iphone 6 videos from 30 to 60 frames per second. \nUnlike previous iphone models, the iphone 6 is capable of capturing slow-motion videos, which are great for recording action videos. You only need to launch the Camera app as you would normally do, and select Slo-mo from the sliding wheel at the bottom of the screen and then, choose the frames that you want per second. \nWith the iphone 6 and 6 plus taking photos can be done using the volume button and it's as easy as it sounds. As long as the camera app is open, you simply press either the volume up or down button housed on the left-hand side of the smartphone to take a photo. The process even works when using a pair of headphones featuring an inline remote and volume keys. \nYou cannot talk of a smart phone without considering the battery, with these two the battery is certainly better than past models, as they can allow you to monitor on which apps are draining your battery. This improves the lifespan and the number of times that you recharge your battery. \nWith the bigger and better screen, multitasking is one of the iphone's flagship features. The function allows apps to perform certain tasks in the background while you're using other apps or not using your device. \nWho is going to be the first to get it? \nSo recently there was a noise about the girlfriends' gate away at Ster Kinekor, with them jostling to watch the chick flicks which were being screened. \nSo me and my hommies decided to do our own boys' gate away and check out a chick flick. \nWe decided to watch \"The Perfect Man\" because it has some serious action. The thriller features characters that ladies really like who include Morris Chestnut and Micheal Ealy. \nThe movie is a must watch because it talks of a young successful lady Sannaa Lathan who wants to start a family but her boyfriend Morris Chestnut is not so keen on the idea. If you want to know more then go watch it yourself. \nAll I can promise you is will not be disappointed. Zimbabwe \nAFTER seeing off the challenge from former Vice-President Joice Mujuru in the brutal fight to succeed President Robert … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Herald. All rights reserved.
