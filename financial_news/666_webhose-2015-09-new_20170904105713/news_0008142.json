If Williams holders chose to receive more than an aggregate of $6.05 billion cash, the deal would be subject to proration.\nIncluding debt and other liabilities, the deal is valued at about $37.7 billion.\nEnergy Transfer, a Dallas-based pipeline company, had been pursuing Williams for six months before Williams spurned its unsolicited offer, valued at $48 billion or $53.1 billion including debt and other liabilities, in June. Williams said at the time that the offer significantly undervalued the company, setting the stage for a potential bidding contest.\nWilliams also terminated its deal to acquire pipeline affiliate Williams Partners LP, which will remain a publicly traded master limited partnership.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/BT-CO-20150928-703632/?mod=mktw", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/8c0qZeKcA2p"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:29:00.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
