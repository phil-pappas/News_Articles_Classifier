Photo: Leesa Marie Gere\nDivorce doesn't exactly shout new career opportunity. But for Renee Catt, creator of The Divorce Go To Girl, \"hitting rock bottom\" in the early days of her divorce set her on an unexpected path. Rediscovering her self-confidence, Catt's business is dedicated to helping other divorcees negotiate their way through this difficult time.\nCatt doesn't gloss over divorce. She's honest about the fact that the last three years of her marriage saw her retreat into a highly anxious state where she shunned her friends. When her marriage finally ended, with two children under the ages of five, she felt fearful about the future. To compound matters, she thought she'd failed.\nIn hindsight, Catt doesn't believe that anyone fails when a marriage ends. Not wanting the experience to define her, she finally reached out for support by way of mentors and coaches. This enabled her to see her divorce as an opportunity to grow.\n\"On the day of the divorce, I took myself off to a bar after the family court and had a glass of champagne,\" recounts Catt. \"I was really proud of how far I'd come. I thought, life isn't just about marriage. It was a positive thing, not like 'I'm glad I'm rid of you' \".\nAdvertisement Catt took herself on a divorce holiday to Vegas to push herself outside of her comfort zone as well as pamper herself. After Vegas, she started offering divorce holiday packages in her then travel business. It was one of Catt's business coaches, on seeing how animated she became when talking about helping other divorcees, who urged her to 'just go and do that'. That was all the encouragement she needed.\n\"I'd thought following your dream was for rock stars,\" says Catt. \"I didn't think little ole me from the suburbs could go and do that.\" Divorce Go To Girl has been operating for over a year now and offers the Beyond the Breakup Boot Camp, an e-course aimed at people who are considering separating or have just separated.\nThe program offers emotional and financial insights over a seven week course, which includes Catt's e-book How to get over your divorce from A-Z .\nCatt also offers a second program for those who later on want to up-level their financials. Catt backs up her offerings with an array of experts from financial planners to life coaches to real estate professionals. Her workshops and retreats offer more intensive face-to-face support and a closed Facebook group for female divorcees offers a safe space to congregate.\nCatt doesn't believe in bandaids. Instead she says there's a lot of emotional work involved in trumping divorce. Her no bullshit style is refreshing.\n\"Look, I say it how it is,\" says Catt. \"I think that's what you need. Sometimes it not always easier, especially when kids are involved.\" Catt is also generous and affable. She appears to have come out the other of divorce all the wiser.\n\"I don't blame my ex and I don't blame myself,\" says Catt. \"There's always three sides to the truth: his side, her side and the truth. So I asked, what did I do to contribute to this? Not that anyone did anything wrong, it's just feedback.\" The most rewarding aspect of Catt's work is helping people.\n\"It's that simple,\" says Catt. \"Doing this work lights me up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:13:38.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
