Platts is a leading global provider of energy and commodities information and benchmark prices. The consensus estimate accounts for an average of five to six days of crush lost to rain. \nAnalysts' expectations for cane crush spanned 27.8 million mt to 30.7 million mt. Brazilian sugarcane industry group UNICA is expected to release its bimonthly sugarcane harvest data in the upcoming days. \nAnalysts at Platts' Kingsman forecast the cane crush at 29 million mt. The amount of sugar available (ATR) would be 147.5 kg/mt, up 1.61 kg/mt from second-half of August. \nAccording to Platts' Kingsman, the peak of the ATR curve is approaching. Normally it occurs during the second half of September or the first half of October. However, this year it could peak earlier due to abnormal weather, flowering and the age of the cane. \nIn terms of ethanol production, the average of analysts' expectations points to total ethanol output of 1.454 billion liters, which would be a decrease of 513 million liters compared with H1 September 2014. \nHydrous ethanol production is expected to fall to 861 million liters, the lowest volume for 1H September since the 2006-07 crop when 639 million liters were produced, and closely compares to the volume of 859 million liters recorded in 1H July. If hydrous ethanol production proves to be 861 million liters, it would be a 27.5% drop from the same period a year ago. Nonetheless, analysts expect accumulated production this crop season to be up 10.31% year from a year ago. \nFor 1H September anhydrous output is expected to be 588 million liters, down 24.32% from the same period last year. \nHydrous sales in the domestic market during 1H September are expected to remain strong, reaching 750 million liters. This is because hydrous remains competitive at the pump in the main consumer states of the Center-South region, despite the recent hike in ex-mill hydrous prices. \nHigher sugar prices in 1H September and the weaker Brazilian real exchange rate to the U.S. dollar were factors favoring sugar production, but poor weather has proved a detriment. The Center-South Brazil saw an average of six days lost to rain, but rain delays were even worse Sao Paulo and Parana states, both traditional producers of sugar. \nAccording to a Platts survey of analysts, the sugar mix is expected to reach 42.23%, down 1.78 percentage points from a year ago.
