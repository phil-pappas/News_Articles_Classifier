Alex Ellinghausen At issue is Professor McKibbin's claim, based on his economic modelling for the federal government, that Australia's pledge for the Paris peace talks is \"at the top end\" of effort compared to other rich countries if measured in terms of the cost to its economy.\nProfessor McKibbin found Australia's pledge to cut emissions to 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 would reduce gross domestic product in the final year by 0.4 to 0.6 per cent, more than in most countries except China.\nBut Mr Fraser said the government's targets for 2030 were \"miserable\" and \"pretty modest\" relative to other countries in terms of the size of the cuts in emissions.\n'Trivial' costs He said it was clear even from McKibbin's \"very uncertain modelling\" that the costs of climate change action would be \"minor\" or even \"trivial\" depending on which emissions reduction technologies were used.\nMr Fraser did not know Professor McKibbin well, since he joined the RBA board a decade after Mr Fraser stepped down as governor.\nHe regarded Professor McKibbin as a professional in his approach to economic modelling but said his report was flawed, especially because it failed to account for the benefit to the economy of avoiding the costs of extreme climate change.\nHe said it was strange Professor McKibbin wanted to measure each countries' effort relative to the cost to their economy since he had admitted predictions of future economic costs for the next 15 years were highly uncertain.\nOn the other hand, the CCA's recommendation for emissions cuts of between 40 and 60 per cent by 2030 on 2000 levels was motivated by climate scientists' recommendations to avoid a dangerous rise in temperatures.\nMr Fraser said exaggerated estimates of the costs of climate action usually came from ministers who had \"no respect for honesty or evidence\".\nHe said Professor McKibbin's modelling showed Australia would suffer a big fall in coal exports as a result of policies of China and the United States, which were independent of Australia's climate change policies.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852"], "published": "2015-09-01T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:26:41.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
