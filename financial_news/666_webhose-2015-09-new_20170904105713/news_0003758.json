They will be allowed to mix and match the type of cover they want for contents and cars.\n\"Three million Australians are deemed to be severely or completely financial excluded. We know that if we can reach that market with the right financial products at the right time... that people do become economically mobile,\" said Adam Mooney, chief executive of Good Shepherd Microfinance, which is Australia's largest microfinance group.\nAdvertisement \"This partnership will open up this whole market for us going forward – we'll be making margin out of this business. The partnership... has been valuable for us to rethink what we do as an insurer,\" Suncorp's chief executive of personal insurance, Mark Milliner, said.\nMr Milliner said Suncorp would be making \"single digit\" profit margins on the new product, which is called Essentials by AAI, despite its low costs. The product will allow policyholders to insure their contents for $10,000 to $20,000 and up to two cars to the value of $5000.\nPayment options were designed to be flexible, including fortnightly direct debit and payment through Centrepay which aligns a person's income with the payment of their premium.\nEssentials need cover \"Our research shows that this market just wants cover for essentials like their second-hand car and whitegoods. We have worked with financial counsellors, Legal Aid, the Financial Ombudsman Service, researchers and consumer representatives, who have helped us to design a product to do just that,\" Mr Milliner added.\nSuncorp and Good Shepherd Microfinance consulted external advisers and worked with financial counsellors, Legal Aid, the Financial Ombudsman Services and researchers to create the product.\nMr Milliner said Suncorp is aiming the product towards customers across the country, and specifically at Australians who can't afford cover in natural-disaster prone areas such as North Queensland .\n\"It's not designed for high-risk areas within Australia – it's about us thinking through the insurance needs of all Australians,\" he said.\nThe product will be distributed through Suncorp's call centre and other community organisations that offer Good Shepherd Microfinance loans.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/insurers-weather-stock-price-plunge-20150903-gje2k8"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:31:26.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
