She turned her gaze to the industry at the center of the crisis: banking.\nAdmati made waves on the national financial reform scene in 2013 with the book The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong With Banking and What to Do About It , co-written with economist and banking expert Martin Hellwig.\nIn conversational prose, the book patiently explains basic banking concepts and forcefully argues for a new paradigm of bank regulation, one that looks less at what banks do with their money and more at where their money comes from: Is it borrowed or their own?\nShe argues that requiring banks to rely more on shareholders’ money than on borrowing funds would increase stability, harness market forces to deter risky behavior and lead to a smaller, safer system as banks pulled back on bets that didn’t make financial sense.\nHer arguments have drawn fierce pushback from the banking industry, but they got the attention of financial policymakers. They also earned her appointments to advisory committees to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as an invitation last summer to the White House.\nSo what’s a bank to do? The Los Angeles Times recently spoke with Admati; here’s an excerpt of the talk:\nSo what’s wrong with banking?\nWhat’s wrong with banking is that a lot of people are able to take risks and not be fully responsible and accountable for those actions. They can get away with doing things that are really inefficient and dangerous, somehow. And it works for them but it’s dangerous for the rest of us.\nPeople need to understand that the biggest banks are really, really big, by any measure. Just how much is a trillion? It’s an enormous number. They are larger than just about any corporation, so it’s not just big. It’s really very, very big.\nIt’s also the complexity and sort of breathless scope of what they do and just how much of it is opaque. It remains incredibly fragile as a system.\nWhy is a bank’s equity important?\nEquity is like a down payment on a house. It’s money from shareholders, not borrowed, and that’s what most corporations live on primarily. Some corporations don’t borrow at all.\nThe question is, just how much reliance on debt should banks have?\nIs it the same as bank capital, which we usually hear about?\nEssentially, yes, but think of equity as the best form of capital. Capital is often misunderstood as a rainy day fund, money that sits on a shelf until it is needed to absorb losses. That’s false.\nThe word “capital” is one of the world’s most misunderstood words. When we talk about capital we think about machines.\nBut in banking, and only in banking, the word “capital” is meant to represent where the money comes from. And really what regulatory capital means is essentially money that’s unborrowed.\nCapital requirements, boiled down, amount to a few percentage points of a bank’s total assets. What’s the right ratio?\nCurrent requirements are ridiculous by any normal standards. A supposedly “harsh” regulation would be 5 percent of the total. Corporations just never ever live like that.\nI talk about 20 percent to 30 percent of assets, but what’s really complicated is how you measure assets. The way assets are measured now pretends to be scientific, but the rules are designed in a flawed way. I want simpler measures and for capital to be 20 percent to 30 percent of the total.\nWhere would banks get all this capital?\nStop paying dividends, for one thing. If you just invest profits, you immediately have more money. That’s how Warren Buffett lives. He hardly ever pays out and just invests it back in the business.\nIf they don’t have profits or can’t raise equity by selling stock, then you have to wonder about their business model.\nYou’ve heard the argument many times from the finance industry: The more capital you require, the more you withhold from lending. It’s money taken out of the economy.\nThat’s ridiculous. That’s utter nonsense. You’re talking about where the money comes from, not what they can do with it. More capital does not constrain what they do. It just makes what they do safer for the rest of us.\nDean Starkman,\nLos Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:53:10.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
