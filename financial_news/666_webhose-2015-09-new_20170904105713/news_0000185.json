To support Zimbabwe's efforts of national construction, in the past 10 years, China has provided about $1,5 billion worth of preferential, concessionary and commercial loans to Zimbabwe. \n\"There has been a lot of breakthrough in major projects such as the Kariba South Hydro Power Station expansion, NetOne broadband expansion, the Victoria Falls International Airport expansion, etc,\" he said, \nHe said many Chinese financial institutions and enterprises were discussing with their Zimbabwean partners on implementing more major projects in the country. \n\"The biggest moment is President Mugabe's successful State visit to China in August last year. During the visit, the two presidents reached important consensus and pointed out the direction for further development of the bilateral ties,\" Ambassador Lin said. \nDuring his visit to China, President Mugabe negotiated mega deals in the areas of infrastructure development and rehabilitation, energy, transport among other economic enablers. \n\"Now the two sides are joining hands in implementing the outcome of this visit.
