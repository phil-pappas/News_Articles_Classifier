If you have read some of my other reviews you will know by now that the first thing I do is turn to the charts. In May of this year, copper saw a nice decline about 2 months ahead of our equity markets. \nThis week we are noticing a start of a rebound pattern in copper prices following a diamond signal we got last week. These diamond signals suggest a possible oversold/overbought pattern with a possibility of turn around. This early reversal pattern coincides with our stock market strong bounce following Labor Day weekend, as well as the interventions made by the Bank of China (PBOC). \nSo far, at the time of writing ( 9-9-15), copper still has to prove something…that something would be a close above 247.70 as seen in the weekly chart below. \nMy outlook on this one is that it is still just a bounce after a strong sell off. I do see a possibility of making an attempt back to 263, but in my opinion the trend is still down. \nThe options market in copper is not the most liquid, hence I would stay away from options on this one and rather use straight futures. You can find out copper futures specifications on our website. Heikin-Ashi weekly chart of copper for your review below. I am not a fan of selling at certain levels just because they appear on the chart, “considered to be” support or resistance etc., hence I will not just simply look to sell at 247.70 or 263…instead I would like to see that these levels are being confirmed by a trigger. That trigger can be found by using lower time frame, daily or even hourly. I would look for either a moving average cross over on the lower time frames against the resistance levels. Maybe even better, look at RSI or similar indicators suggesting overbought on the short-term and then starting to point down. This is when I look to enter short positions and depending on when these signals happen, I will look at nearby levels to determine my initial stop loss orders.
