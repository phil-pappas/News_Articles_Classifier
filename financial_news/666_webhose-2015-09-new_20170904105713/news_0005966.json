Now CMO Today reports the deal is happening : comScore will acquire Rentrak in an all-stock deal to “build a cross-platform currency,” said comScore Chief Executive Serge Matta, who will lead the combined company. It remains to be seen whether or not it can seriously take on Nielsen, which uses its famous panel of U.S. households to measure media and provide the currency for the roughly $70 billion television market. ComScore is a digital measurement expert while Rentrak uses set-top box data to measure TV viewing. And unlike Nielsen, an independent measurement company, comScore and Rentrak have an advertising giant as a significant shareholder: WPP PLC.\nWAR OF WORDS : The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group that represents the online ad industry, doesn’t think too highly of ad blocking tools. Speaking at an Advertising Week event, IAB Technology Lab’s general manager, Scott Cunningham, said that when ad blockers accept payment from publishers to let ads through their toll booths, it’s akin to “highway robbery,” CMO Today reports. Though he didn’t name any culprits, the model Mr. Cunningham described is put in practice by Adblock Plus, which lets about 700 companies through its filter (and around 70 of those pay). Meanwhile, Adblock Plus-parent Eyeo says it is planning to form an independent board to determine which ads are “acceptable.” That way, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the one to decide which ads pass through its gates.\nMOBILE BOWL : Sheryl Sandberg , chief operating officer at Facebook, took to the Advertising Week stage on Tuesday to champion mobile advertising’s ability to reach a big audience with targeted ads, CMO Today reports. Ms. Sandberg said that Facebook has a “Super Bowl on mobile every day.” Perhaps it feels that way to the social network, since 76% of Facebook’s advertising revenue comes from mobile. TV folks would probably say that only the Super Bowl has Super Bowl reach. But Ms. Sandberg was diplomatic when it comes to the extent to which Facebook is making a play for TV dollars. “TV and Facebook and video really go together,” she said.\n140 PLUS : It doesn’t take the world’s best codebreaker to decipher what Twitter’s secret “140 Plus” project is about. The Wall Street Journal reports that Twitter, led by interim CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, is thinking about whether to let users tweet more than 140 characters at a time. The plan, first reported by Re/code , may take one of two forms. Twitter could just raise the character limit for everybody, or create some sort of larger publishing platform for longer posts. The latter option sounds sort of like Facebook’s Instant Articles program, where publishers post directly to Facebook. Of course, in this case, every Twitter user out there could be a “publisher” once freed of the 140-word limit.\nElsewhere Football, “Empire,” and “The Walking Dead” top the list of priciest shows for advertisers [ Variety ]\nPinterest’s CEO says advertisers take a back seat to users [ CMO Today ]\nAl Jazeera America’s union drive will head to a vote through the National Labor Relations Board [ International Business Times ]\nFox has named ValueAct Capital CEO Jeffrey Ubben, an activist investor, to its board [ WSJ ]\nActivist Starboard Value LP urged broadcaster Media General to negotiate a deal with Nexstar [ WSJ ]\nCumulus Media CEO Lew Dickey has stepped down amid an executive shakeup [ New York Post ]\nThere was a panel at Advertising Week called “Here are all the black people” that featured no black panelists [ Digiday ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "http://nypost.com/2015/09/29/dickey-brothers-out-at-radio-giant-cumulus-amid-board-shakeup/", "http://recode.net/2015/09/29/twitter-plans-to-go-beyond-its-140-character-limit/", "http://digiday.com/agencies/what-happens-when-you-have-a-black-people-advertising-week-panel-without-black-people/", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/tv-advertising-prices-football-empire-walking-dead-big-bang-theory-1201603800/", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://www.ibtimes.com/al-jazeera-america-will-not-recognize-union-nlrb-elections-underway-2118695#.VgqWxDPH5Ko.twitter", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:35:17.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
