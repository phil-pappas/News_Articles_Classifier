Demand for jobs \nAlthough financial reward is always going to be an important factor, graduates looking to enter the world of finance also need to consider using their recently acquired degree to the best possible advantage, as the money will often take care of itself if you choose the right niche. \nAs you will already have seen, the finance industry is most definitely multifaceted and there are a plethora of career options to consider, all of which require a variety of different skillsets and interests. \nThe wealth of opportunities and the sheer variety of potential jobs to pursue is encouraging in one respect, but this is also a compelling reason why you need to narrow down your choices, so that you can focus your attention on a financial job which is best suited to your particular skills and attributes. \nYou should be prepared to commit some time to researching and identifying the type of jobs that are best suited to you and your qualifications, so that you can channel your energy into landing a job where you know you are likely to perform well. Investment banking \nIf you are excited by the prospect of providing complex financial solutions for wealthy investors and corporate clients, it is feasible to suggest that a career in investment banking would be a suitable career path. \nAlthough this is an area of finance which is viewed as prestigious and glamorous, there is also little doubt that this can be one of the most intense and stressful roles that you could take on, so you need to decide if you have the motivation and total work ethic that investment banking can sometimes demand of you. \nObviously a graduate is going to have to work their way up to a position of authority and standing by proving their ability to find creative financial solutions, but talented professionals can definitely enjoy a successful and prosperous career if they turn out to be made for a career in investment banking.

Insurance \nAnother popular sector for pursuing a financial career is in the insurance industry. \nWorking within insurance will often involve helping individuals or businesses to successfully anticipate any potential risks that they need to address and protect against losses. \nThis is just one aspect of insurance and you could use your mathematical prowess to work as an actuary for example, so you need to do your research in order to establish first of all that this is a sector that interests you and secondly, that you would like to pursue a career around insurance. \nThese are just some of the sectors to consider, so try to work out which type of financial career you are most suited to and whether a career in finance would suit you. \nSiva Kumar is a growth hacker, blogger, social media marketer, content strategist and content manager for Simplilearn.
