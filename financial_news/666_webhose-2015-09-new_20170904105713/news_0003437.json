The US officials described the inquiry on condition of anonymity because it's a continuing investigation.\nThe Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker plunged as much as 23 per cent Monday to 125.40 euros in Frankfurt, wiping out about 15.6 billion euros ($US17.6 billion) in market value. The stock closed at 132.2 euros, its lowest in more than three years.\nVolkswagen's admission is putting pressure on Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn to repair the reputation of the world's biggest carmaker. Winterkorn, whose contract renewal is scheduled for a supervisory board vote on Friday, now faces a serious challenge to his leadership, said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst for Evercore ISI.\n\"This latest saga may help catalyze further management changes at VW,\" Ellinghorst wrote in a note Monday.\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment.\nCriminal inquiries can take months or years and lead to charges against individuals and companies. They can also result in fines and deferred-prosecution agreements, such as the one recently struck with General Motors Co., to spur companies into improving their behaviour and addressing problems revealed during the investigations.\nVolkswagen admitted on September 18 to fitting some of its US diesel vehicles with software that turns on full pollution controls only when the car is undergoing official emissions testing, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. Affected are diesel versions of the VW Jetta, Golf, Beetle and Passat and the Audi A3.\n During normal driving, the cars with the software -- known as a \"defeat device\" -- would pollute 10 times to 40 times the legal limits, the EPA estimated. The discrepancy emerged after the International Council on Clean Transportation commissioned real-world emissions tests of diesel vehicles including a Jetta and Passat, then compared them to lab results.\nVW said it's cooperating with regulators probing gaps between emissions on the road and lab tests on some diesel models. According to the EPA, the company insisted for a year that discrepancies were mere technical glitches.\nWinterkorn, who has led VW since 2007, was forced to halt sales of the cars on Sunday and issue a public apology, saying he's \"deeply sorry\" for breaking the public's trust and that VW would do \"everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused.\"\nThe violations could result in as much as $US18 billion in fines, based on the cost per violation and the number of cars.\nThe US accusations are \"grave\" and must be clarified swiftly, said Stephan Weil, prime minister of the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 percent of Volkswagen's voting shares. \"Possible consequences can be decided after that.\"\nThe European Commission also said it's taking VW's cheating seriously and is in contact with US regulators and the company about details of the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:45:42.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
