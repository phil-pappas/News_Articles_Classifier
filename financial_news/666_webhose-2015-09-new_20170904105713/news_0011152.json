A city rating above 100 indicates that a city is doing better than the state average from 2009 to the present. \nThe index, created by the ATU College of Business and sponsored by Arvest Bank, is intended to provide a snapshot of economic activity around Arkansas. \nThe latest ATBI, released Tuesday and measuring results for the second quarter of 2015, is again dominated by cities in northwest Arkansas which took the top five spots: Bentonville, 106.34 Rogers, 104.32 Fort Smith, 103.17 \n\"The major cities in northwest Arkansas continue the pattern of leading the state in the economic recovery at a steady pace,\" said Mike Willard, president and chief executive officer of Arvest Bank in Prairie Grove, in a news release. \"We have seen this growth echoed in construction, business expansion and general consumer optimism throughout the region. Arvest Bank has seen demand in mortgage, consumer and commercial loan activity to match this economic recovery.\" \nConway was the leading performer in central Arkansas, coming in sixth with an index listing of 101.90. Other cities rating above 100 were Hot Springs at 100.38 and Mountain Home at 100.01.
