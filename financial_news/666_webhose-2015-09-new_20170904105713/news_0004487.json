Photo: FDC\nCopper and other industrial metals fell on Friday, unnerved by prospects of an increase in US interest rates and the reopening next week of the hard-hit Chinese stock market.\nGlobal shares declined after data showed US job growth slowed in August, though a fall in the unemployment rate to a near 7-1/2 year low kept alive prospects of a Federal Reserve rate rise later this month.\n\"The outlook for the Fed is keeping a bit of pressure on the market,\" said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale in London.\n\"Whether or not that (data) makes the Fed more inclined to raise rates in September or later this year, that provides a further headwind to the markets.\"\nAdvertisement A rate hike could boost the dollar, eroding the purchasing power of commodities buyers paying with other currencies.\nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed down 2.4 per cent at $US5120 a tonne, reversing gains of the same scale in the previous session.\n\"It seems many of the metals had their 'moment in the sunshine' yesterday with short-covering rallies that look to be finished for the time being,\" Kingdom Futures said in a note.\nShort-covering has been the main driver that lifted copper from a six-year low of $US4855 a tonne touched last week.\nThe Chinese stock market, which reopens on Monday after a two-day holiday, has taken a battering on recent economic signals. Data in coming weeks is expected to point to further weakness in the economy of the world's biggest metals consumer.\n\"The market's getting a bit uneasy about the fact that there's already been a lot of stimulus but the Chinese economy is continuing to slow,\" Bhar said.\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange reopens on Monday, but US markets will be closed for the Labor Day break.\nOther metals also fell, with LME nickel closing down 1 per cent at $US9900 a tonne, aluminium off 1.4 per cent at $US1608, zinc 1.4 per cent lower at $US1785 and lead sliding 3.1 per cent to finish at $US1665.\nTin failed to trade in closing open-outcry activity and was bid at $US15,025, down 1.2 per cent, but ended the week with a gain of about 6 percent, the best weekly outcome since mid July.\nIndonesia, the world's top exporter of tin, shipped none of the metal in August, trade ministry data showed on Friday, amid depressed prices and delays in issuing export permits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:01:11.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
