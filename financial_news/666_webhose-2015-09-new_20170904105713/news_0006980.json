Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires An appetite for buying in financial stocks drove the Australian sharemarket higher on Monday in the absence of major economic news.\nShares fell in early trade after a mixed lead from Wall Street on Friday. The big miners dragged again on the index after a dismal week, but within the hour the market had found its footing in positive territory and rallied strongly for the rest of the day.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 finished 71 points, or 1.4 per cent, higher, at the day's peak of 5113.5 points. The broader All Ordinaries rose 68 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 5145.1.\nThe only major data around came from China and showed profit in industrial companies plunged 8.8 per cent in August compared with the same time last year, despite the raft of measures from Chinese authorities to stimulate the economy.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index was lower in early trade but stemmed losses in the afternoon to trade 0.5 per cent lower, boosting the rally on the Australian bourse.\nThe ASX outperformed the Asian region, although Japan's Topix struggled under the weight of 1000 companies trading ex-dividend.\nPatersons economist Tony Farnham said Monday's trade was calm but a series of major economic data would keep investors on their toes this week.\n\"We have had a respectable day but there are a lot of events further on this week,\" Mr Farnham said.\n Final Caixin Chinese PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) figures are released on October 1, the start of China's national day \"Golden Week\" holiday.\n\"We won't know how Chinese investors react until the 8th of October. Across that period, we get US non-farm payrolls,\" he said.\nThe employment data will inform the market of the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates in October.\n\"The US market is definitely moving based on suspicion of what might happen at the next Fed meeting,\" Morgans stockbroker Tim Evans said.\nMore than 30 companies traded ex-dividend on Monday, but were generally not big enough to drag on the market.\nSome of the worst-performing stocks, including Cabcharge, which fell 2.3 per cent, and Estia Health, down 1.8 per cent were ex-dividend.\n\"There are a lot of dividends hitting bank accounts worth billions of dollars,\" Mr Evans said.\n\"With the amount of liquidity out there, a fair bit is being recycled on the market, and those big companies are attracting money again,\" he said.\nAmong those, the banks were a magnet. Commonwealth Bank of Australia finished 1.8 per cent higher to $72.70. ANZ Banking Group climbed 1.5 per cent to $27.40, while Westpac Banking Corporation rose 1 per cent to $30.24. National Australia Bank rose 1.7 per cent to $30.30.\nThe miners turned around a poor start, but the results were mixed. BHP Billiton rose 1 per cent to $23.15, while Rio Tinto closed 0.4 per cent lower at $48.75. Fortescue Metals Group finished 0.8 per cent lower to $1.78.\nMeanwhile, Woolworths rose 0.6 per cent to $25.04, and Wesfarmers gained 1 per cent to $39.56. Telstra shares rose 1.2 per cent to $5.74.\nThe big company news for the day was a proposed merger between telecommunications companies M2 Group and Vocus. If approved by the regulator, M2, the owner of Dodo and iPrimus, would sell its shares to corporate broadband provider Vocus to create a $3 billion telco giant.\nM2 shares rose 13.4 per cent to $9.55, while Vocus shares fell 7.4 per cent to $6.01. They were the day's best and worst-performing stocks respectively.\nThe best-performing sectors was information technology, up 2.7 per cent and energy, up 2.2 per cent.\nThe worst-performing sector was healthcare, up a meagre 0.07 per cent. CSL shares traded lower in early trade but recovered to gain 0.4 per cent to $90.76.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-28T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:04:26.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
