Finance Bill set to limit RBI's role Let's not mess with 'Existing India' \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is planning to introduce repo in corporate bonds which will help the market which has been lacking liquidity. Though bi-lateral repo in corporate bonds is allowed, but volumes are absent because of the counter party risks and the lending rates are not system driven as a result of which they tend to be higher. \nLast week RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said in Mumbai that they are contemplating possible repo in corporate bonds. \n\"There is a need for repo in corporate bonds as it lends liquidity to the market. The trade can meet their short-term funds requirement through this route. It will offer a lot of freedom to institutional investors as they will have additional comfort to hold these bonds,\" said K P Jeewan, head of fixed income, Karvy Stock Broking. \nRajan had also emphasized last week that in the corporate bond market very highly rated investors issue bonds in the open market. But people are scared of investing in corporate bonds because, a part of it is to do with lower levels of information about the companies. \"We do not have a good bankruptcy system which protects the bond holder in times of distress,\" he had said. \nThe government bond market on the other hand enjoys good liquidity as repos are allowed by RBI. Under repo in government securities (g-sec) a g-sec holder can borrow funds from the central bank by selling g-sec with an agreement to repurchase at a future date. \n\"I do not know if this will get implemented soon, but if this happens then RBI will provide liquidity to people who hold corporate bonds. This will work just like the way repo happens in government securities. First the draft norms are awaited, then based on the feedback the final guidelines will come and after that repo in corporate bonds will start. This will ensure that traders do not have to force sell corporate bonds. It will also ensure affordable funding for those who hold corporate bonds,\" said Ajay Manglunia, senior vice-president (fixed income), Edelweiss Securities. \nIn recent times the government and RBI has been taking a number of steps to boost the corporate bond market. In fact since the Foreign Institutional investors (FIIs) limit in g-sec was near full, these FIIs had opted for buying corporate bonds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:11:11.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
