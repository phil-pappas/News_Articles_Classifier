Whilst the market is clearly still challenging, with food deflation impacting many categories, we are making good progress on delivering our strategy.\" \nSainsbury's said that \"should current market trends continue, we expect our full-year underlying profit before tax to be moderately ahead of our published consensus\". \nThe retailer opened 27 new convenience stores in the past 16 weeks, indicating that smaller stores are forming part of the new space race for supermarkets as they target shoppers who are shunning the weekly shop in favour of smaller and more frequent trips to stores. \nGrocery online orders grew by 15pc and the supermarket said that since the launch of its Tu clothing brand online six weeks ago trading had \"significantly exceeded expectations\". \nSainsbury's clothing sales grew by nearly 13pc in the last quarter, buoyed by a 'back to school' campaign that saw it sell 640,000 pairs of boys' trousers. \nThe grocer said that it had improved product availability and cut waste levels as a result of better demand forecasting. Sainsbury's is attempting to enhance the quality of over 3,000 own-branded products; it has improved the quality and ripeness of avocados, which have surged in popularity over the past 18 months thanks to a trend towards health-conscious cooking. \nLast week Sainsbury's was shown to be the only one of the \"big four\" supermarkets to grow sales for the 12 weeks to September 13 , according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:55:09.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
