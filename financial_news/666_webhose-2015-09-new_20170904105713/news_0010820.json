But, considering the already existing tensions in the South China Sea, New Delhi’s move will only aggravate the situation.”\nSignificantly, China defends its plans to build an economic corridor with Pakistan through PoK as a commercial activity aimed at improving people’s livelihoods.\n“What’s more, the meddling of outside forces, such as the United States, in the maritime disputes in these waters has already disrupted regional efforts to resolve them peacefully,” the daily said.\n“As a country near the disputed waters, India should respect and support the efforts of the countries involved to resolve their disputes through bilateral channels, as it too has a stake in peace and stability in the waters,” it said.\nChina has lodged protests in the past when ONGC conducted drilling at the invitation of Vietnam.\n“Both Beijing and New Delhi have devoted a lot of efforts, especially at the highest-level, to improve their meaningful interaction and keep their differences at bay. Both countries should be aware that it is in their mutual interests to continue to propel the current desirable momentum in bilateral ties,” the editorial said.\n“They should not entertain any doubt that they have everything to gain by deepening cooperation in areas they are both interested in. And they should avoid taking missteps that may sabotage the good development of their ties,” it said.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 9:50 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:31:29.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
