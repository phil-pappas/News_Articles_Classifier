Exports of mostly red wine to Nigeria have risen to 4.5 million liters (1.19 million gallons) a year, while Angola buys 6 million liters, of which 5 million liters are bubbly wine, mainly shipments of J.C. Le Roux, a low-cost sparkling wine that in South Africa can retail for less than $4 a bottle, Mbatha said. \n\"They are crazy about J.C. Le Roux\" in Angola, \"it is the biggest mover in the market,\" Mbatha said. \"In Nigeria, they really like to consume red wine there, as much as it's hot, they love your Pinotage, your Merlot.\" Exporters also aim to increase sales in Uganda, Kenya and Ghana, which along with Angola and Nigeria, are either preparing to produce oil or already do. Another key growth market is China, the world's most-populous nation, where exports increased by more than 30 percent last year, said Mbatha. \nTo boost sales in the U.S., where South African wines command just 1 percent of the market, the industry group is trying to get more retailers to put white-grape Chenin Blanc on their shelves, said Jim Clarke, a U.S.-based official with WOSA, in an interview in Cape Town. \n\"Our red blends are the ones doing well in the U.S., that is something that South Africa has always done very well and made a priority in making wines,\" Clarke said. \"We show them the Chenin blanc because it is that middle ground for the more white-wine lovers in the U.S.\" South Africa is the world's seventh-biggest producer of wine by volume, representing 4 percent of global output last year. The country grows white wine grapes, including Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, and its red varieties include Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage, which was created in South Africa. The country's almost 100,000 hectares (247,100 acres) of vineyards are mostly concentrated in the Western Cape and the industry employs 300,000 people. \nWine exports declined to 422.7 million liters last year from 525.6 million liters in 2013, according to WOSA's website. \nOrganized by the Embassy of France in Nigeria, this event will be the occasion to present the French market, the recent reforms and measures to better receive foreign investors, and business opportunities for Nigerian investors in France. \nWorld's sixth largest economy, France is one of the leading destinations for foreign investment, ranked 8th globally in 2014 for FDI stocks received on its soil. There are many reasons for companies to establish themselves in France: a qualified workforce, an attractive tax system, support for innovation and research... A springboard to the rest of Europe, with low set-up costs, France is home to more than 20 000 foreign companies employing a total of more than 2 million people. \nHis Excellency Denys Gauer, Ambassador of France to Nigeria and Mr. Dominique Simon, Head of the Regional Economic Department, will present these different opportunities to very few Nigerian companies, selected for their potential interest and willingness to grow quickly and durably in cooperation with our best French companies.
