Australia - the new emerging market Turnbull takes us to 'next level' with China: Packer Mal Maiden: The negative narrative needs to go Oh, the joy!\nThe business lobby could not shout its approval loudly enough on Tuesday as Malcolm Turnbull took the nation's reins as Prime Minister.\nThe key reason is that so much of what many of them would like to see had been taken off the table under the leadership of Tony Abbott.\nAdvertisement Either that, or it had sunk into a negotiated standstill through Abbott's crash-or-crash-through political style.\nWith one voice the lobbyists talked about a hoped-for ability in Turnbull to make the public argument, to cut the political deal and get tough things done.\nSo what exactly are the nation's biggest companies, and their lobbyists, looking for in our new Prime Minister?\nChAFTA ChAFTA will be an early test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity. Photo: Vince Caligiuri\nTurnbull himself put the China free trade deal up on the tee as an early goal. In his first speech to the media announcing the challenge, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was the focal point for his attack Labor leader Bill Shorten.\nIn a speech in August, Turnbull decried \"outrage outbursts of economic chauvinism\" from Labor over the issue and raised concerns about a racial edge to the criticism.\n\"In the ChAFTA context the winners overwhelmingly outnumber the losers,\" he said in the same speech.\nBusiness is pinning its hopes on his winning this debate.\nBusiness legend Don Argus was quick to make this a key point , he was echoed by the Business Council of Australia (which represents the nation's 100 biggest companies), gaming billionaire James Packer and others.\nBusiness wants this deal done and it will be an early test of both Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and also to negotiate with the senate cross-bench.\nEffects test Small Business Minister Bruce Billson supports the Harper Review recommendations. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThis issue is shaping as a potential early rift with the business community. The effects test is applied in big mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition . It's called an \"effects test\" because it takes into account not only a company's actions and intent, but the effect that they have on competitors and the market. How that test is worded is extremely important to the outcome.\nThe Harper review of competition law recommended a change to the effects test that will make harder for large corporates to squeeze smaller operators out.\nUnder Tony Abbott, the government was all set to side with the Business Council of Australia and the big retailers. Turnbull has now signalled he wants to have a full cabinet consider what to do next.\nThe BCA has jumped straight out of the blocks to say consumers will pay higher prices if Turnbull takes up the Harper review's recommendations. One irony is that business has also strongly urged the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for cabinet process, which is Turnbull seems to be doing in allowing his Small Business Minister Bruce Billson (who supports the Harper recommendation) to makes his case to his colleagues.\nTax reform Turnbull will now be the one to receive the tax white paper when it is finished. Photo: Michael Mucci\nYip-yippee shouted the bean counters. Turnbull, they believe, is a tax purist whowill take some tough calls . Abbott commissioned a tax white paper process but promptly took several key targets off the table.\nHigh on that list are changes to the GST and superannuation concessions. With Abbott gone, many groups and leading companies - such as the big four accountancy firms PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte - are hoping Turnbull will be \"braver\" and put these issues up for public consumption.\nThey point to a decade-old paper that Turnbull co-authored on the future of tax as evidence he will be a fan of broadening the base and lowering the rate of taxes as well as tackling bracket creep.\nOne can see why they might think that, given he says as much in the paper: \"A broader tax base and a lower tax rate is desirable for many obvious reasons.\"\nBut Turnbull will now be the one to receive the Abbott-comissioned tax white paper when it is finished. Some are tipping he may even broaden its remit to tackle areas previously off limits.\nOf course when he penned that piece, the budget was in a very different position. The mining boom was raining money on the nation and the GST was only a few years old.\nIn fact, in that paper, Turnbull doesn't even mention the GST. How times change.\nIndustrial relations Insiders in the IR club are scratching their heads as to where Turnbull might lead them. Photo: Vince Caligiuri\nThe initial reaction shows the business lobby still has industrial relations on its mind. Before the next election Turnbull will recive the Productivity Commission's final report on the industrial relations system, as well as the final report of the Heydon Royal Commission into union corruption.\nAgain business groups are hoping the Turnbull's advocacy skills will steer a path to change. The Productivity Commission's moderate initial report sucked wind from the sails of employer-side campaigners in this area and the Heydon inquiry is also now damaged by the allegations of bias.\nInsiders in the IR club are scratching their heads as to where Turnbull might lead them, making general comments such as wanting a \"sensible discussion\" on penalty rates. But it seems likely Turnbull will leave the Fair Work Commission to run its process through the award review on that question.\nIt seems unlikely he'll risk risk political capital trying to push through a tougher building industry regulator in the face of Senate opposition.\nOne key marker in this space will be whether Turnbull retains forceful right-winger Eric Abetz in the employment portfolio. A looming round of appointments to the Fair Work Commission will also be telling.\nMedia Malcolm Turnbull has advocated for change to the so-called reach rule. Photo: Sam Bennett\nMedia companies were delighted to see Turnbull's rise. They have dealt with him up close for several years in the communications portfolio.\nTurnbull \"gets our industry\", gushed Seven boss Tim Worner.\nAgain the hope is Turnbull will unwind a blanket opposition to change under Abbott. This time the key issue is ownership laws.\nAbbott has long maintained that unless the industry could serve up a consensus position he would not be moving.\nTurnbull on the other hand advocated for change to the so-called reach rule which stops any broadcaster rashing 75 per cent of the population as well as the two out of three rule which prevents one company from owning a radio station, a tv station and a newspaper in the same market.\nTurnbull has described these laws as \"horse-and-buggy legislation in the 21st century\".\nInvestors certainly look happy about the prospect of change and have pumped media stocks upwards in the last two days.", "external_links": ["http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/China-Business-Week", "http://www.theage.com.au/business/the-economy/liberal-leadership-decade-of-drift-must-end-says-business-20150915-gjmo8y.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:39:59.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
