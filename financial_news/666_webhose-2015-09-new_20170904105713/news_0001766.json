If it doesn't, perhaps knowing that the Buckeye State is home to several cities among America's most affordable places to live might change your mind. \nIn fact, Midwest cities dominate the top 15 affordable places to live, according to a report out by online real estate listings Web site, Trulia . \nIt's not just housing costs that are affordable in many of these middle-class cities. Other fixed expenses, such as commuting costs and utility bills, contribute to the city's affordability.

To calculate monthly mortgage payments, it used the median-priced home for sale in the 100 largest areas and based mortgage payments on a 30-year fixed rate loan at 4% interest plus property taxes and insurance. \nTo calculate utility costs, Trulia used data from the American Community Survey on median monthly household expenditures for electricity, gas, and water in each of the areas. Commuting costs were calculated by using the median household driving commute time to work for each metro area. Trulia assumed a $7 per hour operating cost (at $3.50 per gallon, 20 miles per gallon average, and 40 miles per hour average speed) plus 25% of the local median hourly wage, it said. \nReady for the list?
