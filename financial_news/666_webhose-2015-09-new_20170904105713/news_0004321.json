Phil Carrick Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket surged on Wednesday, capping off a $55 billion two-day rally led by the big banks, as a rebound in investor sentiment sparked fireworks on global sharemarkets.\nTraders took their cues from strong overnight leads from Wall Street, which returned from the US Labor Day holiday, and the positive tone carried throughout the day to record the best two-day run on the ASX since December.\nAt close of trade on Wednesday the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was up 106 points or 2.1 per cent at 5221.1 , while the All Ordinaries rose 103 points or 2 per cent to 5236.9.\nThe theme of the day was value, CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner said.\n\"People have been waiting in the wings for things to settle down, and once the buyers start to return people come off the sidelines,\" he said.\nThe rally was fuelled by buying in the big four banks. Commonwealth Bank rose 3.4 per cent to $76.72, Westpac Banking Corporation shot up 4.2 per cent to $31.81, National Australia Bank rose 3.5 per cent to $31.27 and ANZ Banking Group lifted 3.7 per cent to $28.54.\nThe buying indicated that some confidence had returned in the banks, Patersons economist Tony Farnham said.\n\"The bulk of the major banks' near-term capital raising requirements are out of the way, we may have Westpac there again, but the other three seem content,\" he said.\n \"More broadly in terms of market sentiment, things have settled down in China and US markets have bounced back, so a lot of people go into major stocks and of course the banks are in that category,\" he said.\nAsian bourses also enjoyed a strong day, with Japan's Nikkei surging 7.7 per cent to record its best day of gains since the global financial crisis.\nThe rally came after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a group of investors he would seek to lower corporate tax rates to boost growth and gave hope that he would not let the economy flounder. That gave an additional boost to the Nikkei which had erased its year-to-date gains on Tuesday.\nThe buying on the ASX was broad-based with all sectors except for utilities recording gains, as the defensive stocks were spurned in favour of high-yield plays.\n\"[The] 4 per cent rebound in the banking stocks offset weakness in BHP Billiton and Woolworths, which traded ex-dividend today,\" Mr Dagan said.\nThe miners were spurred by a lift in commodity price overnight, with copper rising 3.8 per cent, iron ore up 1 per cent and brent crude up 3.7 per cent.\nRio Tinto rose 2.6 per cent to $51.51, while BHP Billiton fell slightly, down 0.2 per cent to $24.65 after paying out its hefty dividend.\nEx-dividend, Woolworths fell marginally, down 0.04 per cent to $25.32, but Wesfarmers added 0.9 per cent to $40.15. Telstra added 1.9 per cent to $5.79.\n\"If you take the glass half empty position, this is what volatility is all about... large corrective swings in the opposite direction,\" Mr Spooner said.\n\"The next testing level for the index will be up around 5300 or a little bit above, that was the high of the last surge of volatility we saw in late August,\" he said.\nA lift above 5300 might be difficult to sustain due to Australia's exposure to a still uncertain China, he said.\n\"The Chinese economy is in a period of cyclical softness and structural adjustment that is likely to cap the rally in the stock market and in the Australian dollar\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-dark-clouds-lift-20150908-gji6nx.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:02:05.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
