We are working to provide the ways and the means to improve their lives, but it is also important to take the time to connect with these citizens, because in the end, they are the ones who implement these good ideas,\" Kagame said. \nHe added: \"We can start by recognising the many contributions and quantify that citizens themselves make. These amounts may look small compared to other sources of financing, but it's a big deal\". \n\"Their contributions range from using their own money to buy necessary inputs, to time spent in community meetings, learning about new and better ways of doing things, to absorbing risks now in order to make gains in the future\". \nThese are important measures of the commitment of citizens and communities, without which there would be little development, the President noted. \"Development is what happens when citizens are convinced about the logic and pace of change. \n\"Country systems must help people to understand their problems, and collaborate to find solutions, including serving as a conduit for development partnerships\". \nSharing Rwanda's experience, Kagame said: \"For Rwanda, there is nothing casual about the term \"lessons learned\". We have been changed by real learning from our experiences and circumstances. And therefore we have had to do things differently, earning us different results\". \n\"At the core of our political mobilisation work, are the principles of inclusiveness, taking responsibility, and building consensus\". \nIn Rwanda, he observed, state effectiveness is derived from success at forging a common national vision. 'This has enabled faster and deeper development results. And explains why the results achieved, sometimes far surpass available resources\". \nThe country is one of the few that have fully achieved several MDGs and made significant progress on all the others. \n\"The SDGs are the next chapter in global collaboration on development, and hopefully, a new opportunity to move away, from the business as usual mode,\" Kagame said. \n\"The goals are more ambitious, and some would even say less focused. That is to be expected, given the progress of MDGs, and also the reality that, the most stubborn forms of poverty, may be much harder to eradicate\". \nWhat's key, he said, is that \"we have a new template, for cooperation and dialogue for the next generation\". \nFor the SDGs to succeed, the President observed, \"we need to have a more serious conversation, about the forms of governance and democratic participation, required to get there\". \n\"The challenge for all of us, is to close the triangle of sustainable development. The SDGs offer hope, of making the importance, meaning, and most importantly, practice of good politics, more widely understood,\" he added. \nHe called on leaders to \"work to complement the new SDG framework, with a genuine effort, to objectively assess the degree of citizen buy-in and involvement, in decision-making and accountability\". \nIt is up to us, to make the most of this new opportunity, he added.
