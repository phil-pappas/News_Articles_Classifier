It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will start at £7.20 and will rise to £9 an hour by 2020, replacing the £6.50 minimum wage currently in place. It will only apply to people over the age of 25. \nBut the impact “does not look to set to be evenly spread”, with areas such as the North East, where unemployment rates are already far higher than in other regions, “set to be hit especially hard”, according to a new report from Capital Economics. \nAs a result, the North East is likely to suffer “sharper falls” in employment. Firms could also be forced to raise their prices more swiftly than in other parts of Britain to offset the higher salary costs - making their businesses less competitive. \nAnd while the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that just 60,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the measure, Capital Economics’s analysis suggested that some sectors will come under far more strain than the rest. \nThose seeking work in retail, hotels, restaurants and the social care sector will be most vulnerable. \n• How the new national living wage will kill jobs • Living wage 'risks hurting jobs and investment' \nResidential and social care in the North East will be particularly hard hit as the new minimum wage will be high compared with salaries in the profession. That could lead to job losses in a sector already struggling to balance the books under government spending cuts, according to the report. \n• Living wage a 'completely hopeless' way of reducing poverty • Hundreds of care homes will close because of national living wage \n“The recovery in the North East has lost some steam” even before the national living wage has been brought to bear on the region, the report added. Surveys also suggest that private sector expansion in the area has slowed, and house price growth has ground to a halt. \nThe jobs market in the region “has weakened too” and the unemployment rate in the North East is higher than the UK average. It grew for the third month in a row in August to 8.5pc. \nThe report came as discount grocer Lidl announced it would become the first British supermarket to pay its workers the living wage. \nFrom October 1 all Lidl employees in the UK will be paid at least £8.20 an hour across England, Scotland and Wales, while staff working in London will get £9.35 an hour. \nThis will equate to an average wage increase of £1,200 a year, with 9,000 of Lidl UK’s 17,000-strong workforce and all age brackets benefitting from the rise. \nThe Government's new wage guarantee, however, is separate from the living wage as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation . \nLidl's living wage policy is based on what the Living Wage Foundation has calculated is the minimum hourly rate needed to get by, rather than on the Government's new national living wage. \nThe higher staff salaries will cost Lidl £9m a year, but the supermarket is more than able to shoulder the burden, given its feverish rate of growth in the UK. \nLast year was a record for the supermarket, which reported annual sales of more than £4bn. \nRonny Gottschlich, chief executive of Lidl UK, said: “We recognise that every employee forms an integral part of team Lidl, and each individual’s contribution is valued. \n\"It’s therefore only right that we show our commitment, in the same way that the team commit to the business and our customers each and every day, by ensuring a wage that supports the cost of living.\" \nHe added that the pay rise would make Lidl employees among the best paid in the supermarket sector. \nThe announcement is likely to put pressure on other grocers, such as Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) 's, Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Morrisons, to follow suit. \nHowever, declining sales, shrinking market share and growing debt piles among the UK's big established supermarkets could make it difficult for them to do so. \nGerman-based Lidl, and its counterpart Aldi, have been growing fast in the UK as their low-price food and cut-price deals on one-off items, such as hedge trimmers and underwear, have attracted cash-strapped British shoppers. \nIn the 12 weeks to August 16, sales at Lidl soared 12.8pc and its market share rose to 4.1pc. \nIn July, Lidl splashed out £10m on a site for its new headquarters , in a clear statement of intent about its ambitions to grow in Britain. \nMr Gottschlich says Lidl wants to double in size in Britain, with a target of between 1,200 and 1,500 shops (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:25:36.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
