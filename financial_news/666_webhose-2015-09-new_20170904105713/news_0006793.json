The proposal is to raise the insurance benefit for over 60 million EPFO subscribers. It will be placed before the EPFO’s apex decision-making body headed by the Central labour minister. Once the trustees give their nod, the EDLI scheme will be amended by a notification of the ministry. It is now proposed that the maximum benefit should be raised to 30 times of the average pay drawn during preceding 12 months in addition to 50% of the average balance of the EPF account subject to a ceiling of Rs1 lakh.
