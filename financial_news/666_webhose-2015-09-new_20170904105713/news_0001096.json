Photo: Jesse Marlow\nDevelopers have backed away from two controversial projects after failing to overcome new restrictions on building setbacks in the CBD and heritage planning hurdles.\nThis month, Planning Minister Richard Wynne stunned the property industry when he introduced interim planning rules requiring minimum setbacks and plot ratios, effectively reining in extremely tall and contentious skyscrapers ahead of a year-long central city planning review.\nOne of the first victims of the new rules appears to be developer Brady Group's proposal for a 186-metre tower located less than seven metres from a neighbouring high-rise on a Little Lonsdale Street site.\nBrady's plans for the heritage-listed Phillips Shirts building included keeping the historic facade and building a sheer tower above it, a move described in a Melbourne City Council assessment as having a \"detrimental impact\" on the adjoining building.\nAdvertisement Brady this week withdrew plans for the site, which was purchased for $15 million last May.\nThe group was contacted for comment.\nThe minister's new rules were likely to make it more difficult to develop smaller city sites, planning experts suggested.\nMelbourne Heritage Action group said the withdrawal of Brady Group's project was a \"good example\" of how the new ministerial rules would support better development.\n\"These smaller heritage sites are likely to see less, rather than greater, development pressure . . . reversing the deeply worrying contemporary trend,\" it said.\nRichard Gu's AXF Group had also withdrawn plans to demolish the Total House car park in Russell Street after it was listed by the Heritage Council in May.\nAXF had planned to replace the structure – one of the earliest examples of brutalist architecture in Victoria built in 1964 – with a glittering 68-level apartment and hotel skyscraper.\nThe push to protect the Chinatown site sparked an outspoken reaction last year from Opposition Leader Matthew Guy who, as the then planning minister, described the postwar building as \"ugly\" and an \"eyesore\".\n\"It looks like an upturned tissue box. Stalinist designers would be proud,\" Mr Guy said at the time.\nAXF lodged a Supreme Court appeal against the heritage listing, suggesting it would fight the decision. However, it has since withdrawn the plans submitted for the site.\nThe group could not be reached for comment about its legal action or plans for the property, which it reportedly purchased for $40 million in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:53:49.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
