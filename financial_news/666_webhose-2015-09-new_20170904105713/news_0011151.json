Roughly 91% of participants surveyed receive a company match and 87% of those who do contribute enough to get the full company match. With that in mind, 90% of respondents said they would think twice about taking a job if the company did not offer a 401(k) plan. \nGranted, that doesn't mean they know what one is or what they're doing with it -- especially the 25% taking loans from their 401(k) either to pay for houses or cover bills -- but why let those little details ruin a good time?
