The pacts, to be signed later today during a day-long investors' conclave here, would include those with Gautam Adani-led Adani Group for a solar power project, a senior state government official said. \"We will be signing over 40 MoUs which involve an investment of Rs 33,000 crore,\" the official said before the start of the conclave here in the financial capital. The agreements will be signed in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav , who is leading a delegation of ministers and officials from the state for attracting investment into the country's most populous state. Yadav is also likely to announce a film subsidy scheme, under which support of up to Rs 3 crore will be given to film producers for shooting in the state,. The chief minister is also scheduled to have a luncheon meet with top bankers, including SBI's Arundhati Bhattacharya . This is one of the biggest investment road shows for the state and comes amid a growing stress on 'competitive federalism', wherein states are being encouraged to compete with each other to attract investments.
