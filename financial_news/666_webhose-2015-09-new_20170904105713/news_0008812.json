This is why the authorities WON'T investigate Appeal parking tickets in 30 seconds with free website New website called donotpay.co.uk helps drivers win their appeal against parking tickets. Student Joshua Browder, 18, set it up after being fined 30 times Motorists are given 28 days to pay for a parking ticket, and if they refuse the price continues to go up Photo: ALAMY Comments \nA free service that allows drivers to appeal against car parking tickets in just 30 seconds has been set up by a disgruntled motorist who says councils slap fines on motorists for \"trivial\" reasons. \nJoshua Browder, an 18-year-old computer science student, came up with the novel service for motorists to fight fines automatically after being issued with 30 car parking tickets since passing his driving test in January. \nAs part of the service, which has received 6,500 driver's complaints since being unveiled last month, the website automatically uploads pictures of unclear or confusing road markings gathered from Google Maps. \nDonotpay.co.uk promises to \"generate winning appeals to parking tickets in seconds\" by packaging up a complaint that can be sent to the local council – although it's not clear if any of the complainants has been successful. \nMotorists pick one of 12 defences with which to contest their ticket, including \"the vehicle has diplomatic immunity\", \"I was travelling to hospital urgently\" and \"there are missing details on the PCN (ticket)\". \n\"Many motorists leave the scene of their parking ticket without taking photos of the road markings. In light of this, the website will now include photos of the street to support relevant claims,\" Mr Browder said. \n\"Councils issue tickets first and ask questions later,\" he added. \nThe website's owner, Joshua Browder, says 6,500 drivers have signed up so far to challenge parking tickets \nAround 10 million parking tickets are issued in Britain each year, generating hundreds of millions of pounds for local councils. On top of this, private firms make an unknown sum by issuing their own charges. \nAmong those subjected to seemingly unfair ticketing practices was Natalie Bynorth, a motorist hounded for £350 by her local council after its own pay-by-text ticket system failed. \nMs Bynorth, a nurse, pays £4 to park near the hospital where she works, but one day her text payment failed and she was not informed. Gloucestershire County Council responded by sending letters from bailiffs to collect the \"debt\". \n• The free \"complaints resolver\" that takes on your customer service woes \nDrivers have the right to appeal against a ticket, but must produce evidence to prove it was issued unfairly, for example if there were no road markings to indicate parking restrictions. \nA \"penalty charge notice\" (PCN) ticket usually costs around £120 and you must write to your local council to appeal. \nAlthough donotpay.co.uk says its online service takes just 30 seconds, the local council has 28 days to consider your challenge. \nIt is better to do this sooner rather than later, because the longer you delay paying, the higher the charge. If you pay the fine within two weeks it qualifies for a 50pc reduced rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:42:31.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
