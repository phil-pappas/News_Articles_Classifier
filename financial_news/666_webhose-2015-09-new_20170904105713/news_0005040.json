John White has served on the PCAOB advisory committee continuously since he was at the SEC between 2006 and 2008.\nHe did resign as an equity partner at Cravath when his wife took the chairwoman’s job, since Cravath is a top white-collar and corporate defense firm that represents clients at the SEC frequently. Mary Jo White has recused herself from weighing in or voting on SEC cases when her husband’s firm is involved. The issue has been receiving new attention since Mary Jo White told reporters last Wednesday at a meeting of the Investor Advisory Group, according to a Wall Street Journal report , that the SEC is “identifying interested and qualified candidates” to chair the PCAOB. The current chairman, James Doty, whose term expires in October, has said he’d like to stay in the job.\nThe Bloomberg report cited the Center for Effective Government, an advocacy group, calling for White to step aside from the selection of the next PCAOB chairman.\nAn SEC spokeswoman told MarketWatch that agency ethics professionals reviewed John White’s participation in the PCAOB advisory committee when SEC Chairwoman White first took the job. The issue of any potential conflict with John White’s ongoing membership on the PCAOB Standing Advisory Group and Chairwoman White’s involvement in board-member selection and appointments was taken up again and cleared by internal ethics when the first PCAOB board-member appointment came up.\nJohn C. Coffee of Columbia Law School called it “backstabbing” in an article in the New York Law Journal this week, for White, the wife, to announce the search at a PCAOB event. Coffee singled out the SEC’s chief accountant as the potential source of the SEC’s negative view of Doty. “More recently, the Office of the Chief Accountant has been upstaged by the PCAOB,” wrote Coffee. “This has not gone unnoticed at the Chief Accountant’s office, which would like to view the PCAOB as merely a subordinate vassal agency.” The current chief accountant, James Schnurr, is a retired Deloitte partner who “seems to have taken the protection of the [audit] industry as his priority,” Coffee wrote.\nMarketWatch reported on Sept. 10 that the SEC itself has modified, significantly delayed or issued competing proposals , such as on the audit-partner identification initiative.\nTwenty-nine supporters of Doty’s, including former SEC chairmen Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Vanguard Group Inc. founder Jack Bogle, as well as several academics, wrote Mary Jo White last week praising Doty’s leadership and urging White to reappoint him. “James Doty’s vision and agenda have advanced the mission of the SEC and PCAOB to oversee and improve audit quality,” the letter stated, going on to urge White to give Doty the time it takes for his “initiatives to come to fruition.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202737222254/Backstabbing-in-Washington-The-Curious-Case-of-the-PCAOB?slreturn=20150818094704", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-looking-at-outside-candidates-to-lead-audit-regulator-pcaob-1441826964", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/sec-chair-faces-new-conflict-claims-over-husband-s-legal-work"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:16:38.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
