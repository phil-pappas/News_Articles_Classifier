Erin Jonasson by James Frost Rates for property investors have been stepped up as lenders have introduced a premium over owner-occupiers in response to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority concerns about loan growth.\nRates are still extremely low by historical standards, but lenders are no longer falling over themselves to give away money at rock-bottom prices. The trigger was the regulator's decision to cap loan growth at 10 per cent, which has seen lenders put the brakes on their ballooning loan books and some withdraw from the market altogether.\nLoan Market's Katarina Skold says the competition among lenders for property investment business has substantially lessened since APRA took action. \"Rates for investors are, on average, 25 basis points higher across the board,\" she says. \"Some of the majors are no longer lending to customers who require lenders' mortgage insurance. AMP has stopped lending to investors altogether.\"\nMichelle Hutchison from comparison website Finder.com.au notes the change has introduced a spread between the rates offered to owner-occupiers versus investors of between 20 and 40 basis points. \"There is still a lot of competition between lenders for owner-occupiers, but it's a different story for investors,\" she says. \"They are increasing rates and tightening up lending criteria. It's become more difficult to secure a better rate.\"\nData from Finder.com.au shows that variable rates being offered by the big four banks to investors are, on average, 22 basis points higher than the same loan for owner-occupiers. Loans fixed for three years are 36 basis points higher on average.\nSkold says the pullback hasn't just been limited to the big four, noting that most lenders put up their rates to comply with the caps. The consensus, however, is that the best offers are with the smaller lenders.\nHutchison says the best offer for a variable rate loan is almost 100 basis points better than the average offer from the big four.\nAccording to the Finder.com.au database, investors can still secure investment finance for slightly less than 4 per cent if they look around. Easy Street offers a basic variable rate loan to investors for 3.99 per cent, while Greater Building Society offers a loan fixed for three years at 3.99 per cent as well, according to Finder.com.au .\n Bridging finance It's a common enough problem. After months or years of looking, the perfect house finally comes on the market. But you haven't sold your existing home. Or you have but you haven't yet settled.\nEnter bridging finance, an arrangement where the bank lends you enough money to buy the property of your dreams and settle up following the sale of your existing home.\nOf course, it won't come cheap: depending on the size of your mortgage it will cost you somewhere between $5000 and $15,000 a month. But before you run out and make a bid, there are several things you should know.\nFirst, don't expect the same amount of choice you may have had for your home loan. Bridging loans are variable only and the pool of active lenders is small. Loan Market's Katarina Skold explains: \"Bridging finance is typically the domain of the majors. Some smaller and mid-tier banks do offer it but the big four are better able to provide it in a speedy fashion,\" she says.\nSecond, the arrangements vary between lenders. Some, such as Commonwealth Bank, want payments during the period of \"peak debt\". Others will only want proof you can service it, charging you a premium on your rate, to be settled when you complete the transaction. The premium is likely to be small, with most lenders actively courting owner-occupiers.\nStuart Wemyss, a mortgage broker with ProSolution Private Clients, says it's important to get your affairs in order if you want this type of arrangement.\n\"If you have less than 30 per cent equity in your home you may find it difficult to secure bridging finance,\" he says. \"You want to be able to convince the bank that you have been conservative. If you can prove that you have been conservative with your reserve or base case for the sale of your house then you will do well.\"\nExperts recommend minimising the amount of time you spend in peak debt. However, Weymss recommends clients take out bridging finance for 12 months in order to maximise the prospect of a successful sale price.\nTop suburbs for houses and units\nAdvertise effectively, get your reserve right\nTricks for selling your property and deal-breakers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:05:54.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
