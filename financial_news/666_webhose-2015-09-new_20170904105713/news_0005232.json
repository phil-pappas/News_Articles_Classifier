Lani Jensen by Craig Tansley Though I'm yet to meet her in person, the unofficial member of Cicada Lodge's welcoming committee is a two-metre-long python called Esmeralda who is harmless – unless, that is, you're small enough to swallow.\nRelax. Humans are far too big and too bony to ingest whole – yes, even the youngest of your beloved children – although I'm told Esmeralda never gave up trying to swallow the operations manager's puppy (until it grew into a metre-high Great Dane).\nBut then, what do you expect? Cicada Lodge is built so close to the bush that it's part of the bush: inside Nitmiluk National Park. And while thousands of tourists each year flock to the iconic 300,000-hectare park – the site of 13 spectacular gorges cut through an ancient sandstone plateau by the Katherine River and known collectively as Nitmiluk Gorge (you might know it as Katherine Gorge) – there are just 18 rooms at the lodge, each shut off entirely from the public. This means guests can sleep right in the heart of one of the country's most revered and internationally recognised outback sites.\nMaternity ward Cicada Lodge's restaurant offers plenty of opportunity to luxuriate over long meals that incorporate elements of Indigenous foods. When I arrive, however, there are far more intruders than paying guests. Because it offers refuge from larger males, female agile wallabies use the grounds as a maternity ward while they're raising their joeys. I arrive in the last light of a cloudless afternoon; wallabies with joeys in pouches gather near my room, drinking water dripping from the room's airconditioning unit.\nIt's a hell of a time to get your first glimpse of the place. The sun is setting in a sky dirty with ochre-orange that swiftly turns to muddy mauve, all above a slow-moving tributary of the Katherine River.\nThere's no peace out here at dusk, though: the sky us thick with fruit bats flying god-knows-where for the night, while enormous yellow-crested black cockatoos scream blue murder as they circle the skies above the vast sandstone plateau laid out for miles below my back balcony.\nThey stop soon enough when the dark takes hold and the outback is ensconced in eerie silence. By then I've made it down to the lodge's al fresco dining area which looks out to bright, beaming planets and stars that shoot across the sky from end to end with a regularity that begins to concern me.\n Fly into the gorges fr a relaxing swim, drip dry courtesy of the blazing Northern Territory sun. While others in the park wake inside musty tents and creaky caravans, I look out across polished timber floors, and through floor-to-ceiling windows to the national park at dawn. Joeys are fending for themselves in these tender hours, feeling brave enough to venture outside the pouch. Not wanting to alarm them, I wait and watch behind the windows as if I'm viewing them on TV, lingering in bed as the park slowly comes to life.\nNo one but buffalo Cicada Lodge offers exclusive helicopter tours (among other activities) and so after breakfast by the lodge's pool I'm driven a short distance to a helipad cut from the bush. We rise up above the park – it's warm enough already that I don't need a door – and fly out over the 13 gorges of the park, zeroing in low over waterholes inaccessible by road or by boat where water buffalo gather to drink, scattering when we come in close.\nOnly three of the park's gorges are accessible by boat tour, so as we fly further and further out there's no one here at all but buffalo. The gnarled prehistoric sandstone walls of the gorges get deeper and more spectacular as they zigzag their way across the plateau, the water the colour of lagoons.\nThe local people of the region, the Jawoyn, own Cicada Lodge. We land by a freshwater swimming hole beside one of the gorges. The pilot powers down the chopper and there's no sound but the never-ending chorus of cicadas that give the park its name. The water's warm on the surface, though when I break through underneath it's cool enough to call it a refreshing dip.\nAfter a long swim where I finally stop thinking of saltwater crocodiles (the gorges are checked for saltwater crocs before the start of each dry season, but isolated freshwater swimming holes like this one are safe year-round), I drip dry courtesy of the blazing Northern Territory sun.\nLong meals Tours take up a morning or an afternoon, allowing me oodles of time to luxuriate over long meals overlooking gorge country from the lodge's restaurant, or to walk a few hundred metres to kayak down the first and second gorges, beside river pandanus and overhanging paperbark trees and beneath endless columns of red-ochre-coloured sandstone that reach up for hundreds of metres on both sides.\nIt's possible, too, to take a helicopter tour exclusive to the lodge to see hundreds of ancient rock paintings from the Dreamtime in an area of the park that has been seen by very few visitors.\nThe local people of the region, the Jawoyn, own Cicada Lodge (their art is showcased on the walls of the restaurant and on the walls of the villas and Jawoyn are represented in the lodge's staff) and have been living in this region for more than 40,000 years.\nProfits from the lodge go back to the Jawoyn community while chefs from the lodge incorporate elements of Indigenous foods into meals and workshops are run featuring Jawoyn guides, who provide an insight into their ancient ways.\nSome days I don't stray outside the protected walls of the lodge, content to be there alone as I listen to the sounds of tourists outside anxious to get out on the gorges; if I sit still long enough the bush produces events of its own. I sit on my back porch and watch hawks glide on the warm thermals, dropping like stones at the promise of a meaty snack below.\nAnd then, when the day plays itself out and the creatures rally for a final frenzy in the moments before lights out, I sit overlooking the whole scene with a cold drink, waiting for the bats to scoot off so I can have the park and all its blinking stars to myself.\nNEED TO KNOW\nGetting there: Cicada Lodge is a 350-kilometre drive south-east from Darwin, and is 32 kilometres from Katherine.\nStaying there: Cicada Lodge offers 18 rooms, each with private balconies looking out across the national park. It also offers packages that include helicopter excursions, tours and meals.
