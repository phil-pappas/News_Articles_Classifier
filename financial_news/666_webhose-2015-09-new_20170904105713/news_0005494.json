Michael Horn, who earlier this week admitted the company had “totally screwed up”, will remain as the US chief and report to him. \nMr Vahland runs the Skoda division and prior to that was responsible for the car maker’s operations in China. \nThe group also confirmed that Hans Dieter Poetsch, currently the finance chief, will become chairman of the board in November. \nThe scandal showed no signs of abating on Friday, despite VW confirming that 5m cars had been affected, down from the 11m initially feared. \nExecutives at VW were accused of masterminding the emissions scandal from the company’s headquarters in Wolfsburg. \nThe chain of command of those involved in the rigging deception stretched all the way back from the US to VW’s home patch, it was claimed, with executives in Germany controlling the key aspects of tests which the firm now admits were manipulated . \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was said that the cars that missed US emissions targets were reported to managers in Wolfsburg. \nTesters at a California site evaluated vehicles and results were sent back to Germany before being passed to the US Environmental Protection Agency . \nIf any car failed to meet emissions targets, a team of engineers from Volkswagen headquarters or Audi’s base in Ingolstadt was flown in. \nThe disclosures followed an explosive week for VW in which the car giant admitted falsifying tests by using a complex software programme in its vehicles. \nThe news has wiped billions of pounds off the value of the company and the stock plunged as much as 7pc on Friday after the crucial board meeting dragged on. \nGermany’s transport minister Alexander Dobrindt told reporters in Berlin that “Volkswagen tampering was undoubtedly illegal”. \nHe also revealed that 2.8m vehicles in Germany are now believed to be affected by the emissions rigging, including the smaller 1.2 litre engine cars and “light trucks”. \nMr Mueller , the former Porsche boss, will have the world’s “toughest corporate gig”, in the words of one analyst, as he attempts to rescue the car maker from the wreckage of the pollution scandal. \nAlexander Traill, a partner at the risk and insurance law firm BLM, said: “Mr Mueller may be walking into a liability minefield. The prospects of class actions by disgruntled shareholders are significant, particularly if the share price of VW is negatively impacted in the longer term. The new chief is under a huge amount of pressure to rectify the problem.” \nThe crisis has overwhelmed the company and tarnished VW’s previously spotless reputation for reliability and quality. \nIt is also likely to land VW with tens of billions of pounds worth of fines, recall costs and legal bills as governments, consumer groups and investors around the world look to hold the company to account. \nSeveral countries have already opened investigations some of them criminal into the affair. \nThe latest nations to launch probes include India, Brazil, Australia, South Africa and Norway, whose economic crime unit has opened an investigation. \nPrivate law firms are also lining up to take on VW, with a class action suit already being filed by a Seattle law firm. \nThe automobile giant already faces at least 60 lawsuits which have been filed in federal courts in the US by consumers alleging the company committed fraud by cheating on emissions tests, which means their cars might not be as efficient as they believed them to be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:16:09.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
