Performance reports, drafts, feedback, political priorities and power arrangements are all over the table, waiting for decisions from the core leadership. The job is all about circumspectly looking at performance, reviewing plans in line with feedback, aligning plans with the right set of political priorities and putting the right people at the right place. \nThe messy board has to be cleaned by mid-September, in readiness for the next legislature to work on. As such, the priority seems to be the Second Growth & Transformation Plan (GTP II), which seems to be the hotspot of political wrestling, competition for influence and adaptive rivalry. \nIn technical terms, crafting the plan is a job entrusted to the National Planning Commission (NPC), a newly formed Asian-style planning body headed by Mekonnen Manyazewal and his deputy, Getachew Adem, both bureaucrats with huge experience in planning welfare systems and poverty reduction programmes. For the top planning bureaucrats and their team, having a final planning document is all about putting in place a realistic macroeconomic matrix, detailed sectoral plans, effective sectoral integration, comprehensive treatment of cross-sectoral issues and a functional monitoring mechanism. Much of the job, therefore, is dealing with macroecomic models and iterative targeting. \nBut the politics of planning is not as simplistic as this. It entails balancing interests, attending sensitivities and bringing an equilibrating compromise. The ruling Revolutionary Democrats have found themselves in the kind of environment in which their hegemony is largely defined by their own integrity and the task entails playing the cards cautiously. \nIf previous plans, including GTP I and its largely successful predecessor, the Plan for Accelerated & Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), are to serve as springboards of comparison, the tendency has been playing the cards in favour of politics, the public sector and infrastructure, despite compelling rationales to favour economics, the private sector and human development. And whenever the bias was questioned, the answer from the Revolutionary Democrats was that \"the plan is ambitious, but achievable, with the right priorities.\" \nThere seems to be a tendency within the camp of the ruling elite to continue the dance to the same tunes under the GTP II. The draft plan, released for public consultation, shows that the next five years will also be about a hegemonic public sector. It is foreseen than the state will play a leading role in sectors as varying as industry and services. The vehicles it will be using in the process, according to the plan, will differ from direct policy guidance to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \nAs if to show that the plan is dominantly influenced by the political threads of the Developmental State Theory, the private sector is barely mentioned. And in all cases where private sector development is mentioned, only hopeful statements exist. No defined objectives, clear targets and detailed schedules are included for private sector development. \nOf course, considering the statist inclination of the EPRDF, it may not be surprising to see private sector development sidelined in planning. After all, one distinguishing facet of the statist camp is their deliberate downplaying of the role of the private sector in the economy. Not only do they show it in their planning, but they sometimes take it to the public space. It may help to remember the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi saying, \"the marriage between the state and the private sector is a catholic marriage\" and \"... the state will go without the private sector\" at the same event - a gathering with influential traders in 2009. \nYet, things have changed so much over the years. It will no longer be possible to bring economic growth (not to mention structural transformation), through public investment only. For one, this path has its own limits. The state may build infrastructure, schools, clinics and research centres. It may even take a more activist role and use SOEs as pullers to structural shift. Yet, it cannot operate all the economic establishments. It lacks both the nature as well as the incentives to do so, and in that gap lies the role of the private sector. \nIncentivised by profit, the private sector is ready to take risks that the state would not. It innovatively produces and packages products (and services) to serve the needs of the market. The way the private sector employs, deploys and manages human resources is also directed at optimum productivity and efficiency. Hence, the sector has a key role in sustaining growth and development. \nIt is even more important for today's Ethiopian economy. What the economy needs is investment in key industrial sectors, specifically manufacturing, that could help shift the redundant (and underproductive) labour in the agricultural sector away and exploit the idle productivity for maximum output. And this relies on innovative private investment. \nThis does not happen in vain, however. It requires an effective state support system, be it in business registration and regulation, land provision, access to finance, tax notification and clearance, effective service provision and market facilitation. In other words, this means that the inflow of investment will largely depend on the ease of doing business. \nEasing the process of doing business requires the state to plan for reforms. It is this very commitment that is missing in the draft GTP II document and the state cannot afford to omit it. \nEven in Korean index planning, a replacement to their long overdue medium-term planning; and Malaysian national planning, often considered as a benchmark for the Ethiopian planning system, key state supports such as private sector credit to gross domestic product (GDP), cost of doing business, reforms on tax clearance and compliance, inputs and market linkages have been artfully included in state plans. The Malaysian experience takes the case even further with the Prime Minister taking personal responsibility for the accomplishment of planning, by signing a declaration of implementation. \nOne may not expect the Revolutionary Democrats to directly adopt either the Malaysian or the Korean experience. After all, each system works best in its own context. This, however, does not mean that lessons cannot be learned. \nIndeed, it is important for the Revolutionary Democrats to show planned commitment to support the private sector. Mere open statements will not help achieve the required inflow of investment in the productive sector. Instead, there should be a predictable set of reforms pipelined to enhance private sector development. \nAs they get back to the drawing board, after spending almost two months on post-election consultations, policymakers and politicians need to face the truth that sustainable growth happens only through public private partnerships and a vibrant private sector demands predictable policy guidance in the form of clear support targets. \nIt is high time for planners to reconsider their open statements and to include measurable targets in the support they are going to provide to the private sector. Only then can they think GTP II could have a better multiplier impact on growth and structural transformation than GTP I.
