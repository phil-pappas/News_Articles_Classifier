That will be quite a major focus going forward.” \nWilliam Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) attempted a £720m takeover of 888 in February but the bid was knocked back by one of 888’s founders. \nThere is speculation Hill may now have another tilt, but Mr Mattingley said: “Nothing has changed, we have one shareholder who is not a seller and he will remain in that position.” \nHowever, in a gambling industry in the grip of consolidation, there are few options for 888. Paddy Power (LSE: PAP.L - news ) is merging with Betfair and Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) is combining with Coral. \nBwin investors will own two-thirds of the enlarged company following the GVC deal and will receive 25p in cash and rest in GVC shares, which closed 4pc lower at 435p. Bwin initially rose 3.7pc before finishing down 4.5pc at 110p and 888 edged up 0.3pc to 162.5p. \nBwin boss Norbert Teufelberger will join GVC’s board as a non-executive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T02:15:46.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
