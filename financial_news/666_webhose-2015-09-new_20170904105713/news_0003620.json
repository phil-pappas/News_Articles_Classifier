Getty Images Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Global bond giant PIMCO is launching a fund that invests in global bank capital securities to capture what it believes is a major \"transfer of wealth\" from bank shareholders to creditors and hybrid investors forced upon them by regulators.\nThe PIMCO Capital Securities Fund will be made available to Australian investors and will invest primarily in capital securities such as hybrids and contingent capital (\"CoCo\") bonds issued globally by banks that sit between shares and bonds.\nThe fund will take advantage of the forced strengthening of bank balance sheets at the expense of shareholders, which has made higher yielding bank capital securities a more compelling alternative to bank equity. A portfolio of global bank capital securities is expected to yield about 8 to 9 per cent in Australian dollar terms.\n\"This has been driven by regulatory changes globally with banks having to improve their levels of capital, reduce their leverage and being subjected to greater supervision,\" PIMCO portfolio manager Aaditya Thakur said.\n\"As the banks become a bit safer and they have a bigger cushion of capital, it's to the benefit of the creditor over the equity holders,\" he said.\nGlobal banks, and in particular those deemed globally systemically important, have sought capital required from regulators to make them more durable from the bond market since new rules were bedded down in 2009. Buyers, meanwhile, have been attracted by high interest rates on offer in a low interest rate environment.\nAbout $US362 billion ($514 billion) of capital contingent or CoCos has been issued since UK lender Lloyds Group sold the first of the current generation of bank capital securities in 2009, according to rating agency Moody's. Issuance has been dominated by European banks that have used this type of funding to meet tougher capital requirements. Asian banks have issued capital securities to finance balance sheet growth and meet fast-tracked deadlines to lift their capital ratios.\nAustralia: retail investors Australia's banks have been among the biggest issuers of hybrids or capital notes, largely through the issue of securities to retail investors via the ASX. Westpac ranks in the top 10 issuers of capital securities since 2009, raising $US7.4 billion. The list is topped by Credit Suisse and Bank of China, which have issued $US19.2 billion and $US18.9 billion of capital securities since 2009.\nAustralia's hybrid or capital notes market is dominated by retail investors. In Asia, the US and Europe institutions and wealthy investors are the main buyers of equivalent securities. In the UK, retail investors are prohibited from investing in capital notes, a move Moody's says is aimed at limiting the \"risk of inappropriate retail distribution rather than finding fault with the nature of the instrument\".\n\"In the eyes of the regulator, ordinary retail investors do not have the skills to properly assess the risk/return trade-off typical of these instruments,\" the agency said in a report published last week.\nThe structure of these securities has evolved since the global financial crisis to ensure that they better protect depositors and bond funds by absorbing losses. This has made them riskier investments as the securities can either convert into shares or have their value fully wiped out if the bank is sufficiently stressed. The initial offerings of contingent capital, or CoCo, were snubbed by institutional investors that believed the returns were too low relative to the risks, while their mandates prevented them from investing in securities that could convert to equity. But over time more big funds have grown comfortable with capital securities as senior bank spreads have narrowed, at the same time as banks have improved their capital positions.\nBanks forced to raise equity capital In recent months Australia's banks have also been forced to raise additional equity capital to shore up the banking sector , a cost shareholders have borne as banks have issued dilutive capital. The banks are estimated to need between $25 billion and $40 billion of equity, which will create \"a greater layer of loss-absorbing equity capital, cushioning against any negative shock\".\nAustralian hybrids have not escaped the sell-off that has befallen bank shares, which are down 15 per cent from their peak in April. Aussie capital notes have been dumped by investors that have either switched into the safety of cash or been enticed into higher-yielding bank shares. Recent issues by Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and NAB are marked down by between 5 and 10 per cent of their face values, wiping out the value of more than a year of income.\nMr Thakur said it will be equity investors that bear the burden of the cost of making the financial system cheaper. The cost could also be borne by customers through higher mortgage rates. Depositors too will be squeezed in rates given the lack of competition for funds.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:04:41.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
