Montanaro \nQ: I am plan­ning to retire from the mil­i­tary in a few years. I am already con­tribut­ing to a Roth IRA. Is it worth it to start con­tribut­ing to the TSP (Roth option), or since I can’t con­tribute to it after I retire, should I just start con­tribut­ing to a tra­di­tional IRA that I can con­tinue to build on after my mil­i­tary service? \n–Fran, U.S. Army \nA: Don’t let a lit­tle retire­ment get in the way of tak­ing full advan­tage of all your Roth options. Okay, that may be a bit over the top, but the Roth TSP is a nice way to com­ple­ment what you’re already doing with your Roth IRA. One of the neat fea­tures of the pro­gram is that in 2015 those under age 50 can con­tribute up to $18,000 to the Roth TSP, even if they’re already mak­ing the max con­tri­bu­tion to a Roth IRA (con­tribut­ing to one does not pre­vent you from con­tribut­ing to the other). \nThat’s an addi­tional $54,000 (with­out account­ing for future increases in the con­tri­bu­tion lim­its) of “Roth sav­ing capac­ity” that would be avail­able to you if you vis­ited myPay and signed up for the Roth TSP. That cer­tainly could be a pretty exciting opportunity. \nWhen you retire, you will be able to, in your words, “con­tinue to build on” what you would have accu­mu­lated in the Roth TSP. At that point, you would be able to leave the money in the TSP, roll it over to your new employer’s plan or roll it into your Roth IRA. So, in my mind, if you’ve ana­lyzed things and decided that Roth is what makes the most sense in your sit­u­a­tion, why not con­sider tak­ing it to the next level! \nGood luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:26:46.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
