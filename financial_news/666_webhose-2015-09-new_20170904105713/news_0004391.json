AAISHA DADI PATEL rounds up. \nIn a statement, News24 editor-in-chief Andrew Trench explained the company's decision saying it had come following \"follows months of internal debate and discussion\". \n\"The end result of these debates is that we have decided that we wish to be known for the quality of our content rather than for our comments,\" he said. \nIt's true that over the years News24 has developed the reputation of being a place where you actually do not want to read the comments, lest you open yourself up to a tsunami of hate and vitriol. Unless you're bored, and looking for something to laugh at, then of course, that's exactly where you go. \nHaha what will people do with their tea breaks now?
