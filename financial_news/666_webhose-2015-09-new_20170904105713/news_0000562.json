Amazon.com Inc is testing delivery in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia and California, for a $299 annual fee.\nBender said Wal-Mart is targeting pickup in part because it allows customers to pinpoint a pickup time, rather than having to be at home at a set delivery time of fresh items. He cited a busy mother with children as an example of the type of customer that would benefit from the service.\nShoppers can choose from about 30,000 items, roughly the same assortment as in stores. After ordering and paying online, customers drive to the outlet at a designated time and workers load items into their cars. Fayetteville and Charlotte, North Carolina; Ogden, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Tucson, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado are the other new markets for the service.\nWal-Mart will add a new role of \"personal shopper\" to retrieve and store the items. In some cases, that will entail promoting workers within a store, but overall it expected to add some headcount related to the service, Bender said.\nNeil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle, said investing in pick-up makes sense from a cost perspective.\n\"The economics of pick-up are much better for a retailer. Delivering to the home remains costly, even as services like Instacart and Shipt attempt to reinvent the model,\" Stern said.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Chicago and Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Alan Crosby)\nProfessional Services Wal-Mart", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:48:44.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
