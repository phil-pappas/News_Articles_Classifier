We also expect to grow our value share because you can measure the market both in terms of the number of subscribers as well as the value that you derive from their subscription. \nWe will also try to do so not only by relying on traditional business by also building new streams and to support. We will not seek to grow by killing others. We will seek to grow and grow the industry”. \nThe new CEO worked previously with Unilever for about 13-years during which he rose to become Managing Director for the Zambia office. \nUntil his latest appointment he was Head of MTN-Rwanda. \nMr. Twum Asante also looks forward to more investment by MTN in Ghana by expanding the company’s social responsibility arm, the MTN Foundation. \n“They [Ghanaians] should expect a lot more innovation in the area of digital, in the area of internet; in the area of digital mobile financial services and even when you talk about the core voice area also, there is a more that lies ahead of us and Ghanaians should expect that we will continue to improve and take MTN to the next level”. Mr Asante promised. \nMr. Twum Asante's appointment follows a request by the Asantehene to officialsof MTN to appoint an indigenous Ghanaian to take head the company. \nMTN-Ghana has since 2006 invested over 2.4 billion dollars into the local economy, with a whooping 700 million dollars in the Ashanti Region alone. \nOut of 110 million dollars spent annually in Ghana, the region receives 35 million dollars, providing jobs for over 30,000 people. \nAsantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu the second wants MTN to do more to impact on the lives of Ghanaians. \nHe is particularly suggesting the company partner hospitals, universities and other private sector collaborators to eliminate graduate unemployment, with emphasis on technical education. \nStory by Ghana/Nhyira Fm/Ohemeng Tawiah Business & Finance Follow Us EVERY BOY AND EVERY GIRL BORN INTO THIS WORLD IS EITHER A LITTLE LIBERAL OR A LITTLE CONSERVATIVE By: HABU GAYA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:27:03.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
