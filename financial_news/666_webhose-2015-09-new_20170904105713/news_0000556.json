Did you purchase any of your shares prior to September 29, 2015? Do you think the proposed buyout value is too low? Do you want to discuss your rights? Rigrodsky & Long, P.A. announces that it is investigating potential legal claims against the board of directors of Rentrak Corporation (\"Rentrak\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ GS: RENT) regarding possible breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of law related to the Company's entry into an agreement to be acquired by comScore, Inc. (\"comScore\") (NASDAQ GS: SCOR).\nClick here to learn more: http://rigrodskylong.com/investigations/rentrak-corporation-rent .\nUnder the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Rentrak will receive 1.15 shares comScore for each share of Rentrak they own.
