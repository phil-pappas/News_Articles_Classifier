The collection until September 21 was Rs 286,766 crore. Commenting on the issue, JCA President Ajay Goyal said, \"The Government had agreed to an overhaul of the department and the Cabinet had approved a proposal to raise the workforce by 20,751 in May 2013. That has not happened yet.\" \n\"Officials had stopped work on expanding the tax base for the past two weeks and deadlines for scrutiny assessments remain unmet,\" he added. \nAs per reports, the collections have consistently fallen short of targets for three years. In 2014-15 the original target of Rs 7.98 lakh crore was initially revised down to Rs 7.36 lakh crore and then to Rs 7.05 lakh crore. It could, however, only collect Rs 6.96 lakh crore.
