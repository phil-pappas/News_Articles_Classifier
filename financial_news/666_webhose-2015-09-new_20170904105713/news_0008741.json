Photo: Rob Homer\nThe man who negotiated the bailout of Greece in 2012 says that whatever the outcome of this Sunday's election in Greece, it is \"highly likely\" global financial markets will again be thrown into turmoil over the beleaguered country's debt burden and the long-term sustainability of the euro.\nAnd with markets transfixed by the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision due on Friday morning, Charles Dallara, the executive vice-chairman of heavyweight investor Partners Group, says the unwinding of central bank-induced asset bubbles will remain a source of volatility, along with a lack of liquidity in bond markets and the rise of high-frequency trading.\n\"Globally, we have some distortions that need to work themselves through and the sooner the better as far as I am concerned,\" he said. \"This is why I don't think we should be overly concerned about some of these recent corrections in global public equity markets, or the slowdown in China.\"\nMissed opportunity Advertisement Mr Dallara, who as head of the global bank lobby group the Institute of International Finance negotiated the second Greek bailout in 2012 that critics have argued was too harsh, said the €23 billion, third bailout of Greece – which captivated financial markets in August – was a missed opportunity for European nations to reduce claims on the Greek economy and push harder for a fundamental restructuring necessary to kickstart growth.\nWhether Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras or his New Democracy opponent Evangelos Meimarakis triumph in the election on Sunday that is too-close-to-call, Mr Dallara said volatility induced by Greece \"is highly likely to rear its head again. Whether it does so around this election, or whether it is in 2016 or 2017, the problem is that despite all of the drama and the turmoil of the summer, very little was fundamentally resolved.\"\n\"This is an economy riddled with inefficiencies and distortions. It almost needs a remake from the ground up,\" he said, suggesting it needs a new tax system, corporations law, and raft of policies to encourage new business.\nThe market ructions and political tensions over the European summer revealed to the markets that European governments \"do not see the integrity of the euro as sacrosanct. That has been revealed by the willingness of the Germans to ask the Greeks to take a 5 year time-out from the eurozone.\"\nUnsustainable model Stepping back from Greek peculiarities, Mr Dallara said the whole economic model of the eurozone is not sustainable, given it is \"a common currency area without a common fiscal policy and without a game plan for any medium-term degree of fiscal federation\".\n\"Once European leaders begin to entertain openly and publicly the idea of countries leaving the euro, as they have done openly and energetically with Greece, it seems to me the genie is out of the bottle about the lack of long-term sustainable integrity of the euro in its current form.\n\"I don't think the euro is going to disappear, but I do think the odds of the euro having the same constellation of members a decade from now is much less than it was before this summer's Greek crisis. What Greece needs is to get to a stage where it can tackle structural reforms, and what western European governments need to finally feel comfortable to reduce some of their claims against Greece is a period of growth.\"\nWorld expert on bailouts Mr Dallara could lay claim to being the world expert on sovereign bailouts. As head of the IIF for 20 years to 2012, he also mediated discussions between banks and heads of state during the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and the fall of Lehman Brothers seven years ago this week.\nDuring an earlier stint at the US Treasury, he worked on the Brady Bonds that were used to rescheduled the debt of several bankrupt Latin American countries in the early 1990s, and spent five years at the International Monetary Fund. It's a background that has put his phone number on the speed dial of various players in the markets and in governments around the world. \"I get more calls than I would like to,\" he said.\nMr Dallara, who counts David Murray, chair of the financial system inquiry, as a friend, said the global movement of building more capital and liquidity in banks and reducing leverage in the financial system \"has been a sound thrust, and it is not surprising the Murray report picked up on that and carried it forward.\"\nYet echoing calls made by ANZ Banking Group chief executive Mike Smith last year ahead of the G20 meeting in Sydney, Mr Dallara said the Basel committee should study the unintended consequences of recent reforms before introducing new ones.\n\"We need to catch our breath on banking regulatory reform. I think investors in financial institutions, their managers and regulators need some time to consolidate.\n\"There is no human activity that I have come across in four decades in global finance that doesn't need occasionally some period of consolidation, stocktaking and reflection. The market pace is such that we need that, but I am not sure that we are getting that. But individuals and organisation only have so much bandwidth.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/economy/monetary-policy/federal-reserve-chair-janet-yellen-will-look-backwards-for-rate-guidance-20150916-gjoi7x"], "published": "2015-09-18T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:30:28.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
