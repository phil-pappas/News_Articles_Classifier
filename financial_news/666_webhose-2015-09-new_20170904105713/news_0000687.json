Challenges in production are expected to be exacerbated by climate change. \nClimate scientists at the Colombia-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) have predicted the rising temperatures will lead to massive declines in cocoa production cocoa-growing areas in West Africa by 2030. \nThis puts at risk an estimated 800,000 farm households in Ghana that depend on the cocoa sector for their primary livelihood. \nIncreasing production demands expansion of areas under cultivation, with the resultant effect of converting forests to farming systems which leads to decline in carbon stocks. \nThe intervention of the Cocoa Eco Project is to limit the encroachment of cocoa plantations onto forest lands and conservation of biodiversity. \nIn the past two years, farmers have been supplied with 34,000 shade tree seedlings in addition to 120,000 cocoa seedlings. \nFrank Okyere says the project is beneficial to the environment and the economic livelihood of farmers. \n“It will help them increase their productivity, sell the trees because they are economic trees and in the wider sense, protect our environment by absorbing the carbon dioxide so that everybody will benefit,” he said. \nA technical team at SNV Ghana is working with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on climate mitigation activities in the country. \nCharles Brefo-Nimo, Project Manager of the Cocoa Eco-Project, says there are arrangements to identify climate hot-spots in the country “so that they can use that to advise farmers as to areas that they need to take note of”. \nThere are also programmes to limit the level of degradation of forests in local communities, by using tools that “help us to identify cocoa and forest, such that if people are encroaching into a forest zone, that system will enable us to see and respond”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:33:51.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
