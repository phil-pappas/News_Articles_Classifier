Asia accounted for more than half of Manulife's insurance sales in the first quarter of 2015.\nFor Standard Chartered, the sale would mark a further retreat from Hong Kong, after it exited the consumer finance unit last year. Standard Chartered managed about HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) under Hong Kong's mandatory provident fund (MPF) scheme.\nStandard Chartered and Manulife declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.
