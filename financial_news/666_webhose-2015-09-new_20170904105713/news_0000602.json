Supplied by John McDonald\nMany viewers will be touched, charmed, moved and seduced by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's Me and Earl and the Dying Girl . Hey, it won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival, so it must be doing something right. There is a lot to like about this film, but also a niggling feeling that we are being sold some dubious values under a warm blanket of feel-good filmmaking.\nTeenagers are notoriously self-obsessed. They'll tell you it's not their fault, simply a matter of raging hormones. Even by the usual standards of teen weirdness, Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann), presents a severe case of heightened self-consciousness and low self-esteem. Or so it seems.\nIn a Pittsburgh high school beset with freaks and divided into tight little subcultures, Greg strives to be invisible. He has learnt to mimic the language of every group so as to fit in seamlessly. Gomez-Rejon and writer Jesse Andrews have had a lot of fun creating Greg's peers, which must be only very slight exaggerations of the different types that inhabit an average school.\nEnvironmentalist and journalist Bob Hunter in a shot from the documentary How to Change the World To maintain his low profile Greg has made himself into a hermetic personality. While blending in with everyone, he identifies with no one. The only exception is Earl (R.J.Cyler), a black kid from a poor neighbourhood, that Greg refers to as a \"co-worker\" rather than a friend.\nGreg and Earl are movie buffs who spend their lunchtimes watching classic films in the office of history teacher, Mr McCarthy (Jon Bernthal). For years they have been filming short spoofs of great movies, building up a library of titles – A Sockwork Orange , Pooping Tom , 2.48pm Cowboy , Eyes Wide Butt , and so on. They are aware this smacks of adolescent humour, but it's become an obsessive project – a secret activity that distinguishes them from their schoolmates.\nGreg's self-contained lifestyle is put in jeopardy when his mother (Connie Britton) suddenly insists that he go and visit another student who has been diagnosed with leukemia. This is a burden for Greg because, in his anatomising of school subcultures, he had always put Rachel (Olivia Cooke), under the heading: Boring Jewish Girl.\nWell-worn patterns At this point you may recognise a well-worn pattern of the coming-of-age saga – self-obsessed adolescent male is forced to open himself up to another person's pain. In the process he achieves a new sense of empathy and maturity.\nThis is roughly what happens, but Greg is so resistant to joining the human race, and Rachel so nonplussed by his awkwardness that the story is charged with comedy.\nThe deadpan sobriety of Greg and Rachel's exchanges is thrown into relief by the bizarre nature of the adults in the film. Greg's father (Nick Offerman), is a university lecturer who spends much of his time wandering around the house in a dressing gown, devising unusual meals. Rachel's mother (Molly Shannon) is a single parent struggling with sexual frustration and an addiction to the bottle. When Greg comes to the door she almost gobbles him up, like the witch in a fairy tale.\nUnder the subliminal pressure of his new-found friendship with Rachel, Greg begins to slip up. He loses his invisibility and his schoolwork suffers. It's a love story at one remove, because Rachel is labouring under a death sentence and Greg can't permit himself to give way to his feelings. He even argues with Earl, who comes back to support him when needed.\nThe big idea that moves the story towards a conclusion is that Greg must make a film for Rachel – not a spoof of a Hollywood classic, but a heartfelt, inventive work that touches her declining spirits.\nWe are sucked right into this story, in which Gomez-Rejon employs every trick and device, including brief animated sequences. It occasionally feels like a film made by a director who is worried he won't get another chance. As this is only his second feature, and it has been a raging success, he is probably on the verge of a stellar career.\nIt was only upon reflection that I began to have misgivings. Rachel may be dying, but the entire story is told through the medium of Greg's self-torturing sensitivities. By the end, she appears as nothing more than a vehicle for Greg's search for maturity, as if his own ascent to adulthood were more significant than her imminent extinction.\nThe character of Earl is just as problematic. It's never clear how Greg, from a white upper middle-class neighbourhood, ever became friends with a black kid from the slums. Even allowing for Greg's ultra-defensive personality, there's a lingering suspicion that he is secretive about this relationship because it constitutes a racial and social taboo.\nEarl, who has the stereotypical cool and toughness of a boy from the wrong side of town, is cast as Greg's protector. He demonstrates a more humane attitude towards Rachel, and helps Greg out of a jam, but he is similarly treated as a prop whose chief function is to enable his friend to grow up.\nAs the entire film is narrated by Greg, it could be argued that it's understandable we view Rachel and Earl through his eyes, seeing them as actors in the unfolding drama of his own teenage traumas. It's understandable, but slightly repellent, as if Greg doesn't grow up after all, but remains trapped in a narcissistic bubble. But perhaps one has to adopt a sociological perspective.\nWith a new wave of cultural hypersensitivity passing through US campuses it may be that narcissism now qualifies as a form of maturity.\nThis changes everything There are some big egos and life-changing traumas on display in How to Change the World , a documentary about the early years of Greenpeace, which focuses on the group's first leader, the late Robert Hunter.\nFor the most part Jerry Rothwell's film celebrates the idealism, and surprising successes, of a group of young people who took up the cause of militant environmentalism in the seventies. It is only as the movement matures, and becomes a casualty of its own success, that the personal tensions reach catastrophic proportions.\nBecause Greenpeace always understood publicity to be the main weapon in the fight against entrenched national and corporate interests, there is an abundance of film footage that documents every step of the journey. This is interspersed with new interviews with the first Greenpeace warriors, who all look depressingly old when compared with their hirsute seventies selves.\nThe story begins with Bob Hunter, a product of the Aquarian generation who burned his college admission letter and became a crusading journalist in Vancouver. In 1969 Hunter and a group of like-minded activists set sail on a leaky boat to try and prevent the Nixon administration from detonating an atomic bomb on the island of Amchitka, near Alaska. It was a ramshackle excursion that didn't stop the blast, but generated huge international coverage.\nThe group arrived back to a heroes' welcome, and a movement was born. They had found a strategy for utilising the mass media that Hunter called \"planting a mind bomb\".\n\"The boat is a mind bomb sailing across an electronic sea into the front rooms of the masses,\" he wrote, in prose redolent of the psychedelic era.\nHunter had emerged as de facto leader, even though he never sought power. It was his idea that the next big Greenpeace project should be to save the whales, although most of his friends found this perplexing in a world still dealing with the threat of nuclear war.\nThe new voyage that saw the activists disrupt the activities of Russian whaling vessels off the coast of California, proved to be the making of Greenpeace. The stunts were death-defying and the publicity overwhelming. Quote: : \"We were transformed from flower children into a sea-going gang of ecological bikers.\"\nGreenpeace was launched into the big time, with branches and offices springing up all over the planet. This was the point where it all started to go haywire, as tensions emerged in the core group. Although Hunter was universally accepted as the leader he was temperamentally unsuited for the role. Like a true hippie, he distrusted the nature of power, and believed in Allen Ginsberg's advice: \"Let go of it before it freezes in your hand.\"\nHis colleagues, notably Pat Moore and Paul Watson, had no such qualms. These men were bitter rivals, who both considered themselves Hunter's second-in-charge. Watson believed in direct action, while Moore was a strategist.\nAs his lieutenants' clashes became more intractable, Hunter sank into deep depression, keeping himself afloat with valium, booze, pot and nicotine. When he quit the movement, mainly for reasons of his own health and sanity, Moore took over and made strenuous efforts to bring the movements's international branches under one central umbrella.\nMoore's techniques were so abrasive the result was a series of insurrections and lawsuits. Watson had been expelled from the organisation, and would set up his own environmental action group. Eventually Hunter would return, to help thrash out a new global structure for Greenpeace before retiring again and dying of cancer.\nThe rivalries of those early days still cut deep, but every interviewee speaks with appreciation and nostalgia of Hunter's visionary role. He was the vital catalyst for a movement that can honestly claim that it has helped change the world. In the jargon of the hippie era, these achievements were hailed as harbingers of revolution, but today we can see they were merely the beginning of a long, slow war of attrition.\nMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\nDirected by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon\nScreenplay & novel by Jesse Andrews\nStarring Thomas Mann, R.J.Cyler, Olivia Cooke, Nick Offerman, Jon Bernthal, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon\nUSA, rated M, 105 mins\nHow to Change the World\nWritten & directed by Jerry Rothwell\nStarring Robert Hunter, Patrick Moore, Paul Watson, David Garrick, Rex Weyler, Bobbi Hunter, Paul Spong, Rod Mannin\nCanada/UK, rated M, 110 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T14:32:48.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
