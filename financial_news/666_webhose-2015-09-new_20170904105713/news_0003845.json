Metro Bank Kicks Off Talks About £1bn Float By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 31 minutes ago View Photo \n\nMetro Bank, Britain's first new high street lender for more than a century, has kicked off talks with advisers as it steps up its preparations for a London listing that could value it at more than £1bn. \nSky News has learnt that Metro Bank has asked investment bankers to pitch for roles advising on an initial public offering (IPO) which could take place as soon as the first quarter of next year. \nThe news underlines the lender's determination to press ahead with a listing despite the threat of a future hit from the Treasury's new Corporation Tax surcharge, which will hit banks making more than £25m in annual profits. \nThe flotation, which could target around £300m in fundraising proceeds, will crystallise substantial windfalls for the investors who backed the business prior to its launch, including Vernon Hill, the bank's American chairman. \nMetro Bank now has more than 35 branches open, most of which are concentrated in London and the south-east, and has continued to report strong customer and deposit growth despite ongoing losses. \nThe bank recently marked its fifth anniversary by announcing that it had more than 540,000 customer accounts, which it believes underlines the effectiveness of its service-oriented offering to customers. \nCraig Donaldson, Metro Bank's chief executive, said in July: \"Our second quarter results show record growth in lending, with total loans surpassing the £2bn mark. We’re particularly proud to report that a significant amount of our lending goes towards supporting local businesses, while our mortgage lending has experienced significant demand.\" \nMr Donaldson is among a group of challenger bank bosses who will meet senior Treasury officials later this week to protest at the Chancellor's announcement in his most recent Budget that banks and building societies would pay an 8% surcharge on profits of more than £25m. \nAlthough Metro Bank remains loss-making, its forecasts suggest it is likely to make more than £25m in profit within a few years, meaning that it would fall within the tax's current parameters. \nCity sources said on Tuesday that Metro Bank aimed to appoint advisers for its planned flotation in the coming weeks. \nInvestment banks which have worked on earlier private fundraisings, such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Canada (Other OTC: RBCDF - news ) , are likely to be in the frame for key roles on the deal. \nMetro Bank has so far raised over £600m from investors, meaning that the revised total after a successful flotation could reach close to the mooted £1bn valuation of the business. \nThe company has a heavyweight board, with non-executive directors include Lord Flight, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, and Roger Farah, the co-chief executive of US fashion brand Tory Burch. \nMetro Bank declined to comment on its IPO preparations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:33:03.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
