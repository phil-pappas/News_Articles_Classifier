It meant the appropriations measure failed to achieve the 60-vote majority needed to advance to final passage in the 100-member Senate.\nCongressional Democrats and Republicans are fighting over a range of tax and spending issues as the end of the fiscal year approaches.\nIn the case of the Department of Defense, Democrats oppose a Republican-led plan to use some $38 billion in special war contingency funds to let the Pentagon sidestep mandatory \"sequestration\" spending cuts put in place under the 2011 Budget Control Act.\nA similar vote on the appropriations bill in June also failed.\nThe two parties also have been arguing over Republican-led efforts to include a measure to defund the women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood in any temporary funding measure to keep the government open.
