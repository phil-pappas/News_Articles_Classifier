Existing rules designed to make companies more accountable can, in fact, be used to obscure the way incentives are calculated.\nOne veteran director who sits on several ASX200 boards privately concedes that annual remuneration reports are taking up more of directors' time than any other single issue, including running the company.\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors for the first time this year included the valuations of realised pay for all chief executives in its annual pay study, which included the market value of shares and options. It found the average realised pay for ASX100 chiefs in 2014 was $5.63 million, compared with reported pay of $5.01 million.\n \"There has been an increasing trend of complexity in these remuneration structures and the result is a lack of transparency and certainty as to what is the end outcome. We don't begrudge people being paid well for very good jobs done, we begrudge people being paid very well for average or poor jobs,\" says Simon Mawhinney, managing director of Allan Gray, one of the most vocal institutional critics of the way executive pay is structured.\nThe spotlight is about to fall onto the issue as the first of hundreds of annual general meetings kick off in coming weeks. A lot of companies are still finalising their annual reports, which means proxy advisers don't yet have a clear read on whether the number of strikes against remuneration reports will exceed last year's ten.\nHowever, the Australian Shareholders Association (ASA) believes there will be more protest votes in 2015 as investors start scrutinising the real value of executive take-home pay.\n'All of us got hoodwinked' \"All of us got a bit hoodwinked because we kept looking at these possible big numbers rather than paying more attention to what the guys were actually getting. It was probably something we probably should have focused on earlier. We will see more strikes and more people upset,\" says ASA's NSW company monitoring committee chairman, Allan Goldin.\nThe ASA is meeting with Qantas on Tuesday to discuss chief executive Alan Joyce's $11.9 million pay packet . They will argue he was overpaid by 20 per cent because of the way the airline calculated the value of the share rights he was granted in 2012 and vested in 2014. Qantas says Joyce's pay reflects the strong turnaround in the airline.\nGoldin also says the ASA will vote against AGL's remuneration report when the energy retailer meets shareholders on September 30. AGL narrowly avoided a first strike against its remuneration report last year. It has since had a change of chief executive, with Andrew Vesey replacing Michael Fraser.\nThe two-strikes rule, which allows a board spill if more than 25 per cent of votes are received against a pay report two years in a row, was introduced in 2011. It has not resulted in a spill so far. While there are mixed views about its effectiveness, it has acted as a reputational incentive for companies to reign in executive pay.\nThe unwanted side-effect has been opening up an avenue for shareholder activists or takeover suitors to use the laws to push for a spill when executive pay was not the actual motive. Crescent Capital Partners has indicated it will vote its near 20 per cent stake against takeover target Cardno's remuneration report this week.\nUGL, which received a \"strike\" last year, is also expected to come into the firing line this year despite a new line-up of executives and directors. Mawhinney says part of the problem is that chief executives were still receiving generous packages when they left a company, leaving a new management team to uncover the skeletons in the closet which impacted financial performance after they left.\nNewcrest Mining, Cash Converters, Seven Group Holdings, FlexiGroup, ScanTech, Harvey Norman, Primary Healthcare and Cabcharge also received a strike last year, according to the ASA.\nThe debate around executive pay has always been contentious. It is easy to complain that executives are paid too much, but boards also need to be competitive to attract the talent. The interesting thing now is that all sides agree the current system is too complicated, but no one can agree on a solution.\nThere is a grey area in the way share rights for executives are valued in terms of a company's performance and treated in terms of accounting standards. In some cases executives receive benefits such as dividends for shares they had no entitlement to until they reached certain performance targets. Lawyers say benchmarking market practice is complicated.\nThere will be additional tension between shareholders and boards this year following a string of IPOs, which means chief executives will be incentivised to recognise past contributions made before the company became public.\nJohn Egan, of remuneration consultant Egan Associates, said there will be greater scrutiny on companies increasing the level of fixed remuneration this year as well as the way the value of incentives was calculated for underperforming firms.\n\"Where they will complain is where someone hasn't done a great job and they have been paid very handsomely. There will be closer examination on annual incentive payments paid where shareholders have not seen an improvement in a company's profitability. Proxy advisers will look very carefully at sign on arrangements.\"\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-21T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:07:58.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
