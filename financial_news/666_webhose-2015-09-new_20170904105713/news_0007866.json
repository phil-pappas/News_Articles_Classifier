ICER president Steven Pearson said. \nHigh cholesterol has been tied to heart disease, the most common cause of death in the United States. \nElizabeth Baxter, of Sanofi, said in a statement: \"We need to better understand the ICER analysis, particularly their model and methodology, as we performed our own cost effectiveness model to help us determine the appropriate price. \n\"These calculations are complex and a robust and open peer-review process is essential.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T05:43:21.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
