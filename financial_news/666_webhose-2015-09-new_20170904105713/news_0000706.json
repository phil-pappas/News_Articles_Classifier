The brokerage believes strong growth remains, with seven major new product platforms being commercialised and a total industry volume potential 9 times today's capacity. \nAt 1058 BST, Victrex shares were up 4.3% at 1,733p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:59:16.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
