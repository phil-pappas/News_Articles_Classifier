Photo: AFR\nConsumers group Choice is accusing MasterCard, Visa and the banks of funding research aimed at keeping credit card fees high.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? Weâ€™re @FairfaxMoney\nChoice says the card companies and banks are behind a sophisticated campaign to prove that high fees are good for consumers.\nChoice says the worst offender is MasterCard, which has been funding what it calls a \"phoney\" campaign against the Reserve Bank of Australia's plans to force down \"interchange\" fees.\nAdvertisement An interchange fee is the charge one bank (the card issuer) charges another (the merchant's bank) whenever a consumer chooses to pay by card.\nInterchange fees are set by card schemes - such as Visa and MasterCard - but collected by banks.\nChoice campaigns manager Erin Turner, says: \"It's time MasterCard came out of the shadows, ended their support for this dodgy front group.\n\"It's one thing to argue for the interests of your business, it's another to fund front-groups to do it for you,\" Turner says.\nIn backing the Don't Change My Interchange campaign, which is run by the International Alliance for Electronic Payments, Turner says MasterCard is trying to spread misinformation about the impact of reforms being considered by the Reserve Bank.\n\"The campaign uses research, funded by MasterCard, to claim that consumers will be harmed if a key cost for using credit cards, interchange fees, is reduced, Turner says.\nChoice say that the campaign makes false, misleading or questionable claims such as the assertion that consumers were harmed when the Reserve Bank regulated fees in 2003 and that merchants do not pass on the fees to consumers.\nIt even claims that further efforts to lower interchange fees will harm consumers and could lead to higher interest rates, higher annual fees and shorter interest-free period\n\"We are warning consumers today against this phoney grassroots movement backed by MasterCard that has been designed to distribute mis-information to the public in an attempt to keep bank fees unnecessarily high.\"\nWhen Choice looked back at more than a decade of debate about interchange issues it found studies and lobby groups funded by MasterCard, Visa or the banking industry that argue that keeping fees high is good for consumers.\n\"The fact is MasterCard and Visa are two of the major beneficiaries of keeping interchange fees high. Arguing that higher bank fees reward consumers is laughable,\" Turner says.\nMasterCard's head of public policy for Asia Pacific, David Masters, did not back away from the company's funding of research when quizzed about it at a Senate inquiry in credit card fees in Canberra.\n\"We would be asleep at the wheel if we weren't actively engaging in research on this. It would be malpractice,\" he says.\n\"Our business is about growing transaction volumes, and when transaction volumes slow as a result of what we think is bad regulation, we do what we can to protect consumers.\"\nHe argues the company did not want interchange fees set too high because this would deter usage of MasterCard for payments.\n@jcollett_money", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@FairfaxMoney", "http://twitter.com/@jcollett_money", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtoldZCLYqU"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:41:38.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
