September 29, 2015 03:15 ET | Source: Telarix \nMUNICH, Germany, Sept. 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Telefónica Germany has completed the rollout of Telarix's billing and settlement systems into their fixed and mobile networks. \nThe integration has created a single, company-wide billing, reporting and traffic management platform capable of efficiently and consistently serving all of Telefonica Germany's departments and making Telefónica Germany the first carrier to automate their billing system based on origin versus destination. \nRecently, market conditions have changed requiring carriers to switch from B# or destination based to A# or origin + B# or destination based rating routing, trading and billing. The Telarix deployment at Telefónica Germany includes the incorporation of origin-based A# rating, routing, trading and billing. As a result, Telefónica Germany has found significant increases in departmental efficiencies throughout the company. \n\"With Telarix, we have been able to convert our complex, segmented system into one comprehensive platform inclusive of both domestic and international billing,\" said Maria Mehrens, Director Carrier Management ＆ Roaming at Telefonica Germany. \n\"We now have access to consistent, company-wide data, have integrated business support in each step of the value chain, are SOX compliant and, most importantly, we are poised for growth,\" Mehrens said. \n\"While trade volumes continue to increase and become more complex, carrier and reseller numbers are also growing exponentially causing regulatory changes to occur. These industry changes are forcing carriers to look at their systems differently,\" said Telarix's Vice President of Sales (EMEA), Wolfram Thielen.\"Telefonica Germany's decision to simplify their systems, through this partnership, has enabled them to deal with this complexity, improve efficiencies, protect revenue, realize significant cost savings and increase visibility into their networks,\" said Thielen. \n\"Automating and incorporating the regulatory changes A# rating has placed on carriers was another key component to the success of this partnership and integration,\" said Thielen. \"We, at Telarix, are thrilled with this new partnership and look forward to growing with Telefónica Germany for many years to come.\" \nThis article was originally distributed on PRWeb.
