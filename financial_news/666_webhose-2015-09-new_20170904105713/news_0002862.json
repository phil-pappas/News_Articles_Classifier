AOL made this acquisition in order to gain mobile user data collected by Millennial Media over the years. With this information AOL will aim to provide targeted ads to its mobile users. Moreover, AOL needs to become larger in scale in order to compete with Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) in the mobile ad market. \nAccording to a report from eMarketer, and as the chart above shows, Google will continue to lead the net US mobile ad market this year with a share of 32.9%, although it will have declined from 36.9% in 2014. Google will be followed by Facebook, for which the market share will increase from 18.5% in 2014 to 19.4% in 2015. \nTwitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO), Apple (AAPL), Pandora (P), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Amazon (AMZN) are smaller players in this market. Millennial Media comes next with a small share of 0.3% in this market. Verizon acquired AOL mainly for its video ad technology \nDespite having the smaller market share, Millennial Media will benefit AOL for to the reasons discussed above. Incidentally, Verizon (VZ) had acquired AOL a few months back, mainly for its video ad technology. We discussed this topic in Verizon Acquires AOL on May 12 to Leverage Video Ad Market . \nBy associating with a bigger company in Verizon, AOL can continue to improve its ad technology. Such improvements will act as a threat to the likes of Google and Facebook. \nTo get diversified exposure to Google, you can invest in the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ). QQQ invests about 4.3% of its holdings in Google. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:42:56.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
