Bullard is a non-voting member of the Fed.\nAdding to the positive sentiment, oil prices rose by more than 2 percent on Monday after data showed U.S. drilling slowed. Exxon's shares were up nearly 1 percent.\nAt 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 175.62 points, or 1.07 percent, at 16,560.2, the S&P 500 was up 19.26 points, or 0.98 percent, at 1,977.29 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 46.03 points, or 0.95 percent, at 4,873.25.\nAll 10 major S&P sectors were higher. Apple's 1.1 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.\nData on Monday showed that U.S. home resales fell more than expected in August. Analysts say the decline might be due to rising prices shutting out potential buyers.\nShares of GoPro were down 5.5 percent at $33.22 after Barron's said the video camera maker's shares could plunge to $25 as its latest product launch underwhelmed customers amid increasing competition.\nChipmaker Atmel jumped 15.6 percent to $8.40, a day after Dialog Semiconductor said it agreed to buy the company for about $4.6 billion.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,217 to 661. On the Nasdaq, 1,785 issues rose and 870.\nThe S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 29 new highs and 28 new lows.
