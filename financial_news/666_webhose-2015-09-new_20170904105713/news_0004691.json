The index rises when more issuers are placed in that category, and it falls when liquidity improves. \nThe U.S. high-yield market is dominated by energy companies, many of them highly leveraged shale producers that have been hit hard by the rout in oil prices. Crude has lost roughly 58% of its value in the past year, falling from a high close to $107 a barrel in 2014 to about $45 on Wednesday . \nReflecting the pressure on risky borrowers, the energy Liquidity Stress subindex climbed to 12.7% in August from 10.5% in July, its highest level since January 2010, said Moody’s. \nEnergy companies accounted for seven of 11 downgrades of high-yield issuers in the month. Exploration and production companies Ascent Resources–Marcellus LLC, rated at Caa2 with a negative outlook; EXCO Resources Inc. XCO, +8.31% , rated at Caa1 with a negative outlook; and Penn Virginia Corp. PVA, +0.00% rated Caa1 with a negative outlook, joined the ranks of issuers tumbling to SGL-4. \nIn Moody’s ratings scale, a Caa1 rating is a full seven notches below investment grade, while Caa2 is eight notches below, both indicating a high level of credit risk. The negative outlook means that Moody’s may downgrade the issuer again in the medium term. \nThe remaining four energy downgrades were in the oil-field-services group, where drillers continue to announce massive cost cuts and capital-spending reductions to counter the steep drop in oil prices. Among the liquidity downgrades in this area was that of Pioneer Energy Services PES, +0.99% which is rated at B2 negative, and dropped two notches to SGL-4. The B2 rating is five notches below investment grade. \n“Excluding energy from the LSI paints a different and more benign picture of speculative-grade liquidity — showing that underlying credit conditions remain supportive and weakness in energy is not spreading broadly to other sectors,” John Puchalla, a Moody’s senior vice president, said in a statement. \nExcluding the energy sector from the Liquidity Stress Index, there were more upgrades than downgrades in August, mostly driven by improvements in operations and cash flow. Notable upgrades included that of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT, +2.20% which was upgraded to Ba2 from Ba3 with a stable outlook. \nA separate report from rival rating agency Standard & Poor’s confirmed the trend. S&P downgraded seven high-yield oil and gas sector issuers in August, and counted three defaults, it said in a statement. S&P downgraded 25 high-yield issuers in the month, up from 17 in July. \nThe high-yield sector had its worst month since last September, losing 1.6% on a total-return basis, as the speculative-grade corporate composite spread widened by 36 basis points, said S&P. Investors also pulled money from leveraged loan and high-yield funds.
