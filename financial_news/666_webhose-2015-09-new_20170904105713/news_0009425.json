Graham Tidy Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan New Employment Minister Michaelia Cash says Sunday penalty rates are hurting tourism and forcing businesses to not open, denying jobs to university students and women.\nIn an interview with The Australian Financial Review , Senator Cash described a draft proposal by the Productivity Commission to bring Sunday penalty rates in certain industries into line with lesser Saturday rates as a \"minor\" recommendation.\nSenator Cash said university students unable to work Monday to Friday would \"love the opportunity to work in hospitality on a Sunday\" while women with children have told her they would consider working Sundays.\n\"What I get perturbed by is that there are businesses who cannot open on a Sunday because the wages bill far exceeds what they can take in,\" she said.\nSenator Cash said unions did not want to have a \"rational conversation\" about penalty rates and recognise that Australia needed to be globally competitive and attract the \"burgeoning middle class of China\".\n\"You need to ensure you are globally competitive, which means that you need to ensure our hospitality and tourism industry are delivering what tourists want,\" she said. \"The fact that we have an industry which, in many places, is unable to open on a Sunday, quite frankly, that's doing a disservice to the Australian people and the Australian economy.\"\nDebate welcome However, while she welcomed a debate on penalty rates, she said any decision to reduce them would be solely left to the Fair Work Commission, which is currently reviewing rates. She said the government did not intend to make a submission to the commission review at this stage.\n Senator Cash said the government would consider the final report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the workplace relations framework – due next month – before determining what proposals would form part of its policy to take to voters at the next election.\n\"I think when you look at what the Productivity Commission report endorsed, it endorsed the government's approach,\" she said.\n\"It also called for repair of the existing system, rather than replacement. Again, if there are sensible changes, then I think the government should take an industrial relations policy to the next election.\"\n\"But the important thing here is we will explain it to the people and we will seek a mandate.\"\nSenator Cash said she remained committed to the workplace policies of the previous government, including the reinstatement of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and a new Registered Organisations Commission. Bills for both proposals have been previously blocked by the Senate.\n\"At the end of the day, industrial relations has long been pitched as a battle between the government and the unions, and business versus unions,\" she said.\n\"In terms of my approach to the portfolio, the goal of any changes needs to be to achieve more flexibility because flexibility in 2015 is what so many people want, whether it's an employer or an employee. We also need to achieve higher levels of employment but, at the same time, we need to reassure Australians that their conditions are not threatened.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-30T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:00:08.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
