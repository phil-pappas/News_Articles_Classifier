No raw materials should leave the country without being processed into final products,\" Zikalala said. \nHe said the KwaZulu-Natal ANC would \"push this view\" at the National General Council. It wanted to see this implemented within the next three years. \n\"These minerals are taken out of the country and sold back to us at exorbitant prices. We know that this process will create jobs. There are many other proposals that we are going to be presenting at the council. \n\"We will raise many other issues that pertain to land and to industrialisation. At the end of the month we will hold a general council where we will finalise our submissions to the National General Council.\" \nDeputy provincial secretary Nomusa Dube-Ncube said: \"The issue of beneficiation is really about the capacity of the State to deliver, as opposed to outsourcing things. \n\"There is a lot of mining that gets done in various areas in KZN and we are saying that those factories should be here in KZN or in South Africa so that we don't have to take raw materials out of the country.\" \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:38:52.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
