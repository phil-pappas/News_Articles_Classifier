Nepal decided to extend its long-term partnership with OT following OT’s performance over the last 5 years, supplying 4.5 million MRP. OT has been supporting the Nepalese government for secure and reliable identity solutions since 2010. It will provide the next 2.5M passports thanks to an end-to-end solution producing and personalizing secure machine-readable passports in a dedicated center in Katmandu. The Nepalese government will be able to further accelerate the delivery of secure machine-readable passports to all its citizens whether they live in Nepal or abroad thanks to the 50 enrolment stations provided by OT. In addition to their presence in Nepal, the LECs will be available in 8 other countries with the highest concentration of Nepalese: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arad Emirates, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Hong Kong and the United States. Nepalese citizens living abroad will now have access to the enrolment stations so their personal data, including biometrics, can be captured by the LECs. They will be directly sent through a secure connection to the Nepalese Department of Passport and the passport personalization center in Katmandu, managed and maintained by OT. This will significantly shorten the passport application transit time and will allow a much faster passport delivery service for Nepalese who were used to submitting printed passport demands. ” We are particularly proud that the Nepalese government has renewed its trust in OT’s ability to supply both machine-readable passports and secure enrolment stations. This new contract further reinforces our long-term privileged relationship with Nepal and proves our leadership in supplying secure and reliable identity management solutions globally,” stated Christophe Fontaine, Managing Director of the Citizen Access & Identity Business Unit at OT. Mr. Lok Bahadur Thapa, General Director of the Department of Passport, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nepalese Government said: “ We are delighted that the MRP project has been running smoothly ever since it started at the end of 2010. We trust that our continued partnership with OT will make the passport service even better and more efficient in the future for Nepalese citizens wherever they may be in the world” .
