Photo: 123RF\nOpening my wardrobe to choose a work outfit recently, I was confronted with a boring reality: far too much black.\nI think most professional women face the same problem. We've invested in black skirts, black tops, black shirts, as well as trousers, shoes and tights. I may as well be dressing in widow's weeds my colour palette is so drab.\nI can't take it any more, especially as spring has sprung. It's deadly dull and it doesn't reflect my state of mind or my personality, which is neither dark nor dreary.\nSo it's time to bring back colour. I intend on brightening things up by wearing red shoes, patterned tops and coloured tights and carrying bright handbags. Guaranteed, it will lift my mood and I'll bet others react more positively, too.\nAdvertisement I asked Sarah Stephenson, colour activations manager with paint company Valspar , about why women wear so much black to work.\nShe explained that apart from being renowned as slimming, the colour black had other connotations and psychological connections.\n\"Black is linked to sophistication and quality, like the little black dress. Black can act as a barrier to external emotional stresses and also creates a feeling of power. So I guess women may feel safe and in control in the colour. It may give them confidence and a feeling of authority. In a male-dominated workplace, wearing black could help a woman to feel more equal and be taken more seriously,\" Sarah says.\nHowever, she notes black is not an overly friendly colour.\n\"It doesn't channel energy and vibrancy; it doesn't attract. Black can feel intimidating if it's worn alone. A person who constantly wears black can create a serious or sombre aura, perhaps keeping colleagues at bay. Having said that, it really depends on the energy and personality of the wearer. Many designers and artists choose to wear black as it channels sophistication and no pretences.\"\nSo do women who dress in colours have an advantage purely because they differentiate themselves from the black crowd?\nSarah points out that in her role, she's \"completely colour obsessed\".\n\"I am constantly in awe of the effect colour can have on our moods, emotions and environment. If I'm tired or feeling under par, I will deliberately wear warm colours that vibrate more energy.\"\nOf course, it's not just the colour but the intensity of a colour that matters. So on a dull day, the brighter the colour the better.\n\"Like any colour partnering, colour and tonal balance is all important,\" Sarah says. \"I do find people are drawn to you if you're brave enough to wear strong colours.\"\nSo what are the best colours for women to wear to work?\nSarah suggests red, given it can help project confidence for those who are shy or lacking in will power.\n\"Yellow is another great colour for the working day. It resonates with the left or logic side of the brain, stimulating mental agility and perception. It's a great colour for creative thinking and it's really uplifting and happy,\" she says.\nHowever, Sarah notes peace and calm are important factors in workplaces like hospitals or health spas. If you work in this sort of environment, think about wearing cooler, calmer colours like soft aquas and greens.\n\"Blue is a very trusted colour and that's why we see it so often as the colour of choice for uniforms.\"\nSarah's other advice for women in terms of choosing colours for work clothes is to wear whatever you feel most comfortable in.\n\"Plan your colours around your agenda. If you have a busy day, full of meetings and want to make a lasting impression, go for bold, warm colours that will channel energy. Don't be afraid to wear colour. It really will change your mood and the impression others have of you.\"\nWhat do you think? How can we get out of black and back into colours?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:49:23.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
