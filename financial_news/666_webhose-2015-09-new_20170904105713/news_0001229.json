(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \nNEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. stock market is drifting lower ahead of a much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting later this week. \nMore signs of slowing economic growth in China weighed on prices for copper and other commodities Monday. That sent prices for materials stocks lower. Energy stocks fell along with the price of crude oil. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average slipped 80 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,352 as of 11:45 a.m. Eastern time. \nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 10 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,950. \nThe Nasdaq composite declined 27 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,794. \nTraders are looking ahead to a Federal Reserve meeting that begins Wednesday. The bank could raise interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
