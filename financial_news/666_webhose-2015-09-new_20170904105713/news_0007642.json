The prospect of cutting prices in order to grow volumes, while increasing its cost base, led the shares lower. \nMark Simpson, of Goodbody, warned: “EasyJet will compare unfavourably to rivals given the challenge in cities such as Rome and Milan, where Ryanair is pushing capacity in key airports in easyJet’s network.” \nLast week, the stock posted its biggest one-day rise since January, as the airline raised its full-year profit outlook after reporting a record 7.06m passengers last month amid strong demand for beach and city breaks. \nHowever, despite revising its forecast of full-year growth up 21pc 7.5 points higher between £675 and £700m, traders said the no frills airline’s lacklustre figures could not compete with the surprise profit guidance update from Ryanair. \nThe Irish low-cost carrier raised its full-year profit guidance by 25pc after it enjoyed a bumper summer thanks to poor weather in northern Europe. Mike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, said: “Ryanair’s update has taken the edge off easyJet’s upgraded profit guidance last week.” \nEarlier this year, industrial action by air-traffic controllers in France forced easyJet to cancel hundreds of flights. The stock slipped 13p, or 0.7pc, to £17.80. Meanwhile, Ryanair hit a fresh intraday high of €14.25, before finishing up 5.2pc at €13.61. \nOn the broader market, European shares hit a two-week high amid hopes China’s finance ministry will provide further stimulus. The FTSE 100 rose 82.91 points to 6,229.01 yesterday, bringing its three-day gain to 3.1pc, as the mining-heavy index largely ignored a report which showed UK manufacturing output had fallen in July . \nChris Beauchamp, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “The morning’s overflowing bullish optimism is looking slightly less enthusiastic, but overall equity markets continue to rebound, putting the difficult days of August behind them.” * China leading world towards global economic recession, warns Citi After dominating Britain Benchmark index on Tuesday , mining stocks and asset managers reclaimed their spot among the top FTSE risers. Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) rose 39p, or 5.5pc, to 742.9p after annoouncing the sale of its Rustenburg mine in South Africa for $331m. Des Kilalea, of RBC Capital Markets, said “while the financial impact of the sale of the Rustenburg Platinum mine may not be large, the disposal is an important milestone in Anglo’s efforts to restructure its portfolio”. \nOther miners joined the upward trend, with Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) 4.8pc higher to 144.2p, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) up 3.7pc to £11.27 and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) rose 2.9pc to £23.78. Mid-cap platinum producer Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) also bounced higher, up 5.7pc to 25.4p. \nElsewhere, Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) claimed the FTSE 100 top spot, leaping 78p, or 7pc, to £11.93 buoyed by a strong set of full-year results and a continued recovery in equities. Despite pre-tax profits falling 5pc to £199m this year, Paul McGinnis, of Shore Capital, said the results marked “the end of the two year headwind”. \nTotal (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) assets under the company’s administration jumped 18pc year-on-year, while new business also picked up in the second half of the year. \nPremier Farnell (LSE: PFL.L - news ) led the midcap index higher, up 7.9pc to 136.6p. Analysts said the move upwards was nothing more than short-squeezing, after a weak run in recent months. The group, which was demoted from the FTSE 250 last week during the latest review of the index constituents, will enter the small cap index on September 21. The troubled electronics distributor has been plagued by takeover rumours for months, particularly after it issued a profit warning in July . \nGlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) was left nursing the heaviest loss on the FTSE 100, down 16.5p, or 1.2pc, to £13.13 following news that the drugmaker’s inhaled medicine Breo fails to prolong the lives of patients who suffer from chronic respiratory disease. \nMeanwhile, Wilbur Ross’s move to sell another 45m shares in Virgin Money , the company he co-founded, sent the stock into the red. \nIn his second share sale this year, Mr Ross will reduce his holding from 23pc to 12pc. Ian Gordon, of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) , said “further share placements within the UK 'challenger bank’ space may follow given that private equity majority stakeholders are now out of lock-up at OneSavings and Aldermore”. Shares slipped 19.5p to 404p. \nFinally, Aim-listed Monitise (Other OTC: MNQQY - news ) dived 51.8pc to 2.8p as it announced chief executive Elizabeth Buse was stepping down after the mobile money group reported a full-year pre-tax loss of £227.4m. \nWith management changes and a weaker revenue growth outlook for next year, David Mulholland, of UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , said “the market will remain sceptical on Monitise (EUREX: MOTF.EX - news ) until it is delivering on revenue”. While Mr Mulholland believes the business continues to have significant potential to grow, he said “risks remain, given it continues to burn cash”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:04:01.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
