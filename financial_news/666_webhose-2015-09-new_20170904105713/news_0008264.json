Power"], "text": "17.8 million units 16.5 million units 1 Figures cited for September 2015 are forecasted based on the first 16 selling days of the month. 2 The percentage change is adjusted based on the number of selling days in the month (25 days in September 2015 vs. 24 days in September 2014). \nSales Outlook As a result of the vigorous selling pace during the spring and summer months—the selling rate from May through August averaged 17.5 million units—LMC Automotive is raising its 2015 total light-vehicle sales forecast to 17.2 million units from 17.1 million units and its retail light-vehicle forecast to 14.1 million units from 14.0 million units. \n\"The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates at the current level paves the way for the U.S. auto market to post strong results for the remainder of 2015, as the primary risk to volume—a rate increase—is likely pushed out to December or early 2016,\" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive . \"Sales the previous three months have significantly exceeded expectations, so if interest rates remain low, auto sales in 2016 will get a further boost from an economy that should accelerate.\" \nNorth American Production North American production in August 2015 was 1.58 million units, a 9.5 percent increase compared with August 2014. U.S. production, with help from strong SUV demand, has accounted for 70 percent of the volume increase in North America. Given the strong sales pace, manufacturers were able to reduce inventory in August to a 55-day supply, down from 59 days in July 2015 and 56 days in August 2014. \nAbout J.D. Power J.D.
