But assistant secretary Geoff Derrick, rumoured to be her rival, said he hoped the union had come up with a way forward.\n\"We are hopefully getting on with the job of doing the best we can for our members,\" he said.\n\"We've got some difficult challenges ahead but the hope is we'll get on with the main game.\"\nSimmering tensions came to a head on Wednesday, when Ms Jordan she used an open letter to 30,000 members on the FSU website to air her grievances about the organisation's national executive.\nMs Jordan is effectively the union's chief executive and the 17-member national executive is akin to a board.\nThe national executive is believed to have issued a directive some months ago requiring Ms Jordan to take certain action, but she refused.\n The nature of the directive is unclear. Mr Derrick has previously described operational and budgetary plans presented to the national executive by Ms Jordan as \"narrowly cast\" and \"lacking insight\".\nIn her website post, Ms Jordan accused the executive of countering staff appointments and terminations and replacing minutes of meetings she had circulated with their own amended versions.\n\"The truth is, attempts to change our union, to restore confidence in it, to pursue the agenda of making us a more professional organisation equipped to deliver on member needs, have been blocked,\" she wrote.\n\"The efforts have been deliberately undermined by a series of extraordinary actions designed to stymie change.\"\nThe FSC has between 28,000 and 30,000 members in banking, finance and insurance. It is in pay negotiations with two of the big banks. Another meeting of the national executive has been scheduled for September 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:52:04.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
