PUBLISHED: 13:20, Fri, Sep 18, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:53, Fri, Sep 18, 2015 GETTY Ryanair is breaking consumer law, according to the flight regulator \nThe budget carrier is breaching European rules designed to help passengers who suffer disrupted flights, according to the UK's aviation regulator. Customers who have been delayed by more than three hours on a European Union flight, as a result of the airlines’ fault should be entitled to between £180-£440. But Ryanair has refused to pay full compensation for delays caused by technical faults and is attempting to impose a two-year claim limit from the date of the flight, according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The watchdog is now using legal action to force the airline to change the way it treats customers. CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, said: \"The law is clear that compensation must be paid if a flight is delayed for more than three hours by a routine technical fault.\"It is also clear that air passengers have up to six years to issue a compensation claim at court. \"This position was reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal last year.\"The CAA is committed to protecting the rights of air passengers and we are determined to ensure all airlines comply with this regulation.\"The regulator's review of airline policies has led to Jet2, Aer Lingus and Wizz Air changing their positions.However, Ryanair has not moved and insisted it complies with compensation rules.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which? said: \"The regulator is right to take legal action against any airline that is failing to comply with the law. \n\"Airlines must be held to account and consumers should claim the compensation they are rightly owed if they have a lengthy delay and their carrier is at fault.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:28:45.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
