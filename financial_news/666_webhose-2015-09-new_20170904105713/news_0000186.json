Rob Homer by Sally Rose UniSuper's independent chairman Chris Cuffe criticised the federal government's plan to force all superannuation funds to appoint one-third independent directors, as the $50 billion fund named Colonial First State executive Nicolette Rubinsztein, a vocal supporter of the governance overhaul, its latest independent trustee.\nMs Rubinsztein recently resigned from her position as head of retirement at Colonial First State, with plans to become a professional non-executive director ahead of an expected flurry of demand for board members with investment experience. She will finish up at the Commonwealth Bank-owned wealth management group by the end of November.\nA government bill to mandate one-third independent directors is before Parliament. The change has been welcomed by the retail fund sector but broadly criticised by the non-profit fund sector .\n\"I have been very supportive of the introduction of the independent director reforms and am confident it will be a positive move for the industry,\" Ms Rubinsztein said.\nNew UniSuper director, and outing Colonial First State executive, Nicolette Rubinsztein supports the planned super boards governance overhaul. Supplied Industry funds typically have a 50:50 employee to employer representative board structure.\n\"Independent directors bring objectivity and fresh thinking, which is very important for boards,\" Ms Rubinsztein said.\nShe also told the Committee for Sustainable Retirement Incomes conference in June she supported a proposal to open up the award system and allow employers to choose any fund as their default .\nSpeaking at an Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) event in Sydney on Monday, Mr Cuffe opposed the governance reforms.\n Risk of bloated boards \"UniSuper has had an independent chair for more than a decade but it arrived at that arrangement for a rational reason. As a big fund with its own financial advice business and more than 50 per cent of investment management done in-house, without the use of asset consultants, the job requires an independent chair who has enough time to devote to the job,\" he said.\n\"It doesn't make any sense to force smaller funds to change their model for an arbitrary reason.\"\nUniSuper, a closed-offer fund for university staff and researchers, is one of the country's largest super funds.\nMr Cuffe's comments follow the announcement last week that $34 billion Queensland fund SunSuper boosted the independence of its board, while insisting it was not a win for the Coalition's planned reforms .\nGeorge Fishlock, the chairman of $2 billion aviation industry fund AvSuper, told the AIST gathering the changes were \"ideologically driven\" and risk super boards becoming bloated rather than more efficient.\n\"To comply with the rules, funds will either have to push out some existing representative directors or increase their numbers, which is unlikely to lead to better governance outcomes,\" he said.\nMr Cuffe agreed.\n\"There is a lot of internal politics involved in removing representative directors to make way for independents, so there are going to be some problems there with some boards swelling out to around 12 members.\"\nCate Wood, the chair of $9 billion industry fund CareSuper, said the changes were unnecessary. She criticised the government's definition of independence as unclear, leaving funds in limbo in terms of succession planning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:01:16.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
