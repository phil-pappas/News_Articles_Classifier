U.S. stock index futures indicated a higher open on Friday as markets digested Thursday's speech from Fed Chair Janet Yellen. \nU.S. stock index futures indicated a higher open on Friday as markets digested Thursday's speech from Fed Chair Janet Yellen . \nYellen, who spoke after the market closed, may have slightly recalibrated expectations for a rate rise, by saying she personally anticipates a hike this year. \nTraders had hoped the speech would clarify the central bank's position on rate hikes, after last week's FOMC meeting and a week of volatile markets. \nThe Fed chair said it would likely be appropriate to raise rates from near zero \"sometime later this year,\" though the decision would continue to rely on economic data. In her comments last week, she had not identified herself as part of the group favoring rate hikes this year, but she had made a similar comment during the summer. \nDow futures were up about 240 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also indicated a higher open.\nOn the data front, Friday will see the release of the third look at second-quarter GDP at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is expected to show growth at 3.7 percent. Consumer sentiment is due to be released at 10:00 a.m. \nIn Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index ( ^STOXX ) was 3.11 percent higher on Friday morning, with Yellen's speech helping to ease concerns over the health of the global economy. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite (Shanghai Stock Exchange: .SSEC) index closed down 1.62 percent, while Japan's Nikkei (Nihon Kenzai Shinbun: .N225) finished 1.76 percent higher. \nOn the earnings front, BlackBerry (Toronto Stock Exchange: BB-CA) and Finish Line ( FINL ) are expected before the bell. \nIn oil markets, Brent crude (Intercontinental Exchange Europe: @LCO.1) traded at around $48.31 a barrel, up 0.33 percent, while U.S. crude was at $45.32 a barrel, up 0.91 percent. \n--CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report. \n\nMore From CNBC \nTop News and Analysis \nLatest News Video \nPersonal Finance \nStocks & Offerings Janet Yellen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:57:19.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
