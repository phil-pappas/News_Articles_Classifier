L.P. \nForm 8-K for KKR & CO. L.P. \n9-Sep-2015 \nUnregistered Sale of Equity Securities, Regulation FD Disclosure, Financial Statem Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities \nOn September 9, 2015, in connection with the contemplated acquisition of a 24.9% equity interest in Marshall Wace LLP and its affiliates (\"Marshall Wace\" or \"MW\"), a subsidiary (the \"Purchaser\") of KKR & Co. L.P. (\"KKR\") agreed to deliver at the closing of such acquisition newly issued KKR common units (\"Common Units\") in excess of 1% of the currently outstanding number of Common Units in a private transaction exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At closing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, the Purchaser will subscribe for a 24.9% equity interest in MW Group (GP) Ltd. (the \"Company\"), the general partner of MW Group LP, the proposed new holding entity of MW, and KKR will issue approximately 7.4 million Common Units (assuming no changes in foreign exchange rates) in partial consideration for the acquired Marshall Wace equity interest. The Common Units will be subject to a three-year restriction on transfer, subject to certain customary exceptions (including to fund the payment of certain taxes). In addition to the Common Units, KKR will deliver cash at closing, the majority of which will be required to be invested in funds managed by Marshall Wace for a minimum period of time. \nFurther, subject to the exercise of a put option by the Company or a call option by the Purchaser, at subsequent closings to occur in the second, third and fourth years following the initial closing described above, and subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, the Purchaser may at each such closing subscribe (or be required to subscribe) for an incremental 5% equity interest, for ultimate aggregate ownership of 39.9% of Marshall Wace. The purchase price in respect of each of these subsequent subscriptions (a \"Future Price\") will be based on the future financial performance of MW and will be paid in cash unless the Purchaser elects in its sole discretion to pay all or a portion in Common Units. 50% of the Future Price must be either reinvested into investment funds managed by MW or held in Common Units, in either case for a period of three years, subject to certain customary exceptions (including to fund the payment of certain taxes). \nThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including with respect to the consummation of the subscription, the initial and subsequent closings described herein and the issuance of Common Units. The forward-looking statements are based on KKR's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to KKR or are within its control. No assurance can be had that the subscription, closings or issuances of Common Units described above will be consummated or, if they are consummated, regarding the timing of such transactions. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. KKR does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, except to the extent required by law.
