This is the highest level for the period since 2011, when there were US$50 billion worth of deals in play.\nVeda, which listed in December 2013 with a $1.5 billion market capitalisation, said on Friday afternoon a written offer via a scheme of arrangement had followed a verbal bid.\nThe price was a 35 per cent premium to its $2 share price at the opening of trade on Friday morning. Veda went into a trading halt at 10.33am on Friday morning which was to last until Tuesday. But it was lifted by 12.02pm when it confirmed the bid, as first reported by Street Talk .\nOffer pushed up By the close of market on Friday, the offer had pushed Veda's stock up 31 per cent to $2.62, down from the $2.80 it hit after coming out of the trading halt.\n\"The proposal is subject to a number of conditions including due diligence and regulatory approvals, which includes FIRB approval,\" the company said in a statement.\n\"The board of directors of Veda intends to evaluate the expression of interest and will update its shareholders and the market in due course.\"\nMacquarie Capital and law firm Herbert Smith Freehills are advising Veda on the offer.\nEquifax, which is being advised by UBS, is one of the three largest credit bureaus in the world, alongside Experian, which already competes with Veda in Australia, and Trans Union.\nM&A bankers say the fall in the Australian dollar and the weak share market, which has dropped by almost 11 per cent in six months, was spurring a strong rise in inbound acquisitions.\n\"You have got a number of multibillion dollar inbound M&As happening over the past several months and the M&A activity has been fairly robust,\" Citi head of M&A Douglas Farrell said.\n\"A couple of factors are coinciding, the currency is falling and the share prices are falling.\"\nCo-head of Rothschilds Australia, Gareth Cope, said he expects more Australian companies to become takeover prey. \"We are expecting that inbound M&A over the next several months will be quite strong,\" he said. \"There has been some share price weakness and that has been compounded by the weak Australian dollar, so Australian companies are appearing quite cheap.\"\nBut these macro factors are usually the trigger for buyers to flip the switch on an acquisition they have been sizing up for a long time.\nIn Veda's case, Equifax would have been waiting for the expiry of the last escrow period for the shares of its former owner Pacific Equity Partners, which ended on August 27 when Veda handed down its 2014-15 results.\nVeda's share price had fallen more than 18 per cent since July 31 to $2 on Friday morning when Equifax's offer was announced.\nHowever, the $2.70 bid is only a 20 per cent premium to Veda's volume weighted average price of $2.25 in the six months to the opening of trade on Friday morning and when its board meets in coming days to consider the scheme, it may see it as too low to accept.\nBankers close to the company say Equifax sees the present price as good value because Veda stands to benefit when the big banks finally begin pouring mountains of extra data into its credit bureau under the new comprehensive credit reporting rules, which came into effect in March 2014.\nThe banks are waiting on approval by the ACCC of an industry agreement which will govern how lenders treat their data, as well as systems upgrades before contributing the new information.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/street-talk/veda-inbound-offer-expected-20150918-gjpk70"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:33:02.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
