'Exes' Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert still 'buddies' ‘Calendar Girls’ box office collections hit a wall on day 1 itself as the movie logged an occupancy rate of 15-20%, which translated into a meagre take of just Rs 1.21 crore – that does not augur well at all for Madhur Bhandarkar, not to mention the future of Akanksha Puri, Kyra Dutt, Avani Modi, Satarupa Pyne and Ruhi Singh in Bollywood . Sunday’s figures are yet to be revealed, but a U-turn is not expected.\n‘Calendar Girls’ box office collections are totally dependent on a simple formula, and that is, skin show, plenty of it. It was intended for the mature, but niche, audience and that by itself can be very limited if the promotion of the film is not up the mark or it gives off a feeling of ‘been-there-done-that’ in the movie-going public. The movie is meant for a predominantly male audience, but girls cavorting in various stages of undress does not seem to have packed enough ‘lure power’.\nHaving said that, the industry is still optimistic ‘Calendar Girls’ will pull of a miracle at the box office. Analysts too are expecting a decent surge in the upcoming first weekend of the film. Unlike all the earlier movies of Madhur Bhandarkar, ‘Calendar Girls’ was expected to be a big hit. That does not seem to be the case at the moment as Kapil Sharma starrer ‘Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon’ box office collections are running away with all the money the audiences are dishing out this Friday with an occupancy rate of 50%.\nMadhur Bhandarkar has brought ‘Calendar Girls’ on the big screen exactly three years after the release of ‘Heroine’. ‘Calendar Girls’ is a moderately budgeted film is releasing at around 1,000-1,100 screens, which is good for a film of this scale.\n‘Calendar Girls’ is a Bollywood drama movie. The film focuses on five girls who hail from different regions of India, and who have been selected to pose for the country’s most prestigious annual calendar which is a joint effort between business tycoon Rishabh Kukreja and his photographer friend Timmy Sen. Suhel Seth and Rohit Roy have also played significant roles in ‘Calendar Girls’. All the five actresses are making their debut in Hindi film industry.\nTake the poll, tell us what you think about ‘Calendar Girls’:\nTake Our Poll (With Bollywood Hungama inputs)\n 25, 2015 9:27 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9096932"], "published": "2015-09-26T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T10:07:53.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
