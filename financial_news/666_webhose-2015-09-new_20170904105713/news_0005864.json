The previous model can run at 51 miles a gallon.\nThermal efficiency - or ratio of work performed to energy consumed - will be 40 percent, up from 38.5 percent, the company also said.\nThe car, unveiled in Las Vegas late on Tuesday, is the first model built under the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) strategy, a new approach to development to improve its cars' fuel efficiency, styling and other features, partly by using more common components.\nThe launch comes at a challenging time for Toyota. U.S. petrol prices are at their lowest for this time of year since 2004, pushing consumers to trade in hybrids and electric vehicles in favour of sports utility vehicles.\nAugust Prius sales in the U.S. fell 24 percent from the same month a year earlier to 17,757 cars. Last year, U.S. Prius sales totalled 122,800 vehicles.\nOther automakers are adjusting product launches as cheap petrol muddies the sales outlook for green cars.\nGeneral Motors Co will limit the sale of its next-generation Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid - slated to launch in coming months - to California and other states where hybrid and electric cars sell well, a Chevrolet spokesman said.
