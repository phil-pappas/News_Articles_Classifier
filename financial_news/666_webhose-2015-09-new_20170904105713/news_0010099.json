Photo: Cox Richardson Architects\nThe $220-million redevelopment of the Four Points by Sheraton and the adjoining conference centre has been given an extra boost with the addition of two more floors at the adjoining office project.\nIt comes as the Sydney office market is showing stronger growth in terms of demand and higher rents for landlords.\nIn the reporting season, office landlords all said the level of rental incentives was diminishing in term of rent-free deals and free office fit out, which has led to net effective rental growth.\nAlthough supply could become an issue in 2017 with more new sites being completed, the rise of the technology groups, such as Amazon, Google, LinkedIn and Apple among others, are leading the charge for space once earmarked for traditional industries of banking and legal firms.\nAdvertisement Known as One Wharf Lane, which is owned along with the hotel by the Singapore-based M&L Hospitality group, the office component will now be 6500 square metres of boutique A-grade space, which will sit above the hotel extension of the Four Points Hotel.\nThe rejuvenation of the hotel includes additional rooms, conference and convention space, upgrade to the hotel plus new restaurants along Sussex Street.\nScott Berriman, the director of office leasing at Knight Frank, who is working on One Wharf Lane, says demand for the boutique-style offices has been strong, particularly given the proximity to the $6 billion Barangaroo South development.\nHe said the site's practical completion was on track for August next year over levels 17-25.\n\"The Western corridor vacancy of Sydney's city has tightened over the past 12 months and choice for medium-to-larger occupiers has concentrated to just a few opportunities,\" Mr Berriman said.\n\"Now with the official approval of an additional two floors, we believe One Wharf Lane's delivery by will create a quality point of difference to existing repositioned and refurbished A-grade stock.\"\n\"Our target occupiers are technology groups and emerging enterprise, those with vision and foresight that want adaptive and flexible workspaces. This strategy does not limit us approaching professional services groups, media and telco, nor finance and banking groups such as CBA.\"\nHe said the wide-spread adoption of activity-based workplaces has seen demand rise for more amenities and flexible adaptive space.\n\"It is all about the people and collaboration is essential to creating the best workplace,\" he said.\nM&L Hospitality's chief executive Neil Maxwell said, the group was \"excited to be bringing such a unique commercial concept to Sydney\".\n\"One Wharf Lane really is one of a kind, combining new boutique office space with all the world-class hospitality and meeting and convention amenities that the Four Points by Sheraton Sydney has to offer in a spectacular new tower,\" Mr Maxwell said.\nM&L Hospitality, has engaged Cox Richardson Architects to design the new tower, and as part of the hotel development is also revitalising the heritage precinct of Sussex Street, introducing new dining concepts and providing new access to Darling Harbour with a new pedestrian through-link.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:18:54.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
