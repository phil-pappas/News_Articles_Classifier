A company spokeswoman said that with internet speeds climbing and wireless connections available in more and more places, the ability to stream live wherever you are will increasingly dampen the need to download.\nAmazon has been expanding services for Prime members, including its Prime Instant Video service, to attract more subscribers to the annual program.\nShares of Amazon.com Inc. fell 2 percent to $501.78 amid a broad market sell-off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T23:56:56.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
