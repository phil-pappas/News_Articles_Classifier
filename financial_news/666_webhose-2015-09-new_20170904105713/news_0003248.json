Out of 30-Sensex constituents, 27 ended higher. The 50-issue NSE Nifty reclaimed the 7,800-point mark by surging 130.35 points or 1.70% to close at 7,818.60. \nIt logged an intra-day high of 7,846.05. The rally was across-the-board with all the BSE sectoral indices led by metal and auto ending in the positive range. \nThe rupee strengthening by 31 paise to 66.24 against the American currency also helped, traders said. Telecommunications stocks such as Bharti Airtel rose 2.44%, Reliance Communication surged 11.57% and Idea Cellular gained 2.12%. \nHindalco was the top BSE gainer with a rise of 7.97%, followed by Vedanta 6.85%, NTPC 5.50%, Tata Steel 4.57%, Tata Motors 3.98%, Maruti Suzuki 3.81%, RIL 2.84%, Infosys 2.76%, Bajaj Auto 2.68% and Axis Bank 2.60%. \n\"All the sectors ended in green and the major gainers for the day were metal, auto and realty, which closed up to 3.54% higher,\" said Delhi-based NSE broker Manoj Choraria. \nMeanwhile, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs 659.672 crore on Tuesday, as per provisional data. \nEuropean stocks were also higher in their late morning deals, tracking gains in global equities amid optimism that China's market turmoil may be contained.
