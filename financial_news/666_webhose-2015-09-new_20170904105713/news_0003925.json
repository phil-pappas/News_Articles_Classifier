By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 1 hour 22 minutes ago View Photo \n\nAir pollution experts in Bristol have been monitoring diesel fumes in the city for years. But despite improvements in fuel and engine technology, air quality has not been improving. \nProfessor Duncan Laxen founded Air Quality Consultants over 20 years ago, and has served on many working groups for the UK government and for the EU. \nHe told Sky News: “People are being affected by their exposure to this pollution. The concentrations haven’t been reducing even though we have in place Euro standards for most new vehicles coming onto the roads. \n“That should have brought down concentrations by a considerable amount over the last 15 years. That’s not been happening.” \nDiesel is a very European fuel. Around half the cars sold here are diesel powered. \nAlthough many motorists bought them for financial reasons, such as lower road tax and greater fuel efficiency, a large number bought them because they thought they were greener. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) they're not so sure. \nIn fact, according to the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers, average CO2 emissions from diesel cars are only fractionally lower than from petrol cars, meaning diesels are not as green as many drivers think. \nDiesel engines also emit particulates, which can be carcinogenic, and Nitrogen oxide and dioxide which can cause, or make worse, serious health conditions including bronchitis, asthma, heart attacks and strokes. \nEstimates are that across Europe there are up to 500,000 premature deaths because of air pollution. \nIn London in 2010 the Mayor's office says there were 3,500 premature deaths due to dangerous airborne particles, while Nitrogen Oxides caused 5,900 premature deaths. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) short-term exposure has been found to cause an increase in deaths from heart disease by just under one percent, and from lung disease by just over one percent. \nThe Volkswagen scandal has highlighted existing concerns over the effects of diesel fumes, but experts say the engines that create them do have some advantages. \nBrian Madderson from the Petrol Retailers Association said: “Diesel engines are robust, the performance has been much improved and torque is excellent and they are perceived to offer much more miles per gallon than a petrol engine. \n“Those factors, along with tax incentives from successive governments, have resulted in a tsunami of demand for diesel engines over the last 15 years.” \nThe \"diesel dupe\" scandal is set to cost Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) billions of euros and its chief executive his job. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may also have spelt the beginning of the end for Europe's love affair with diesel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T05:59:55.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
