This new book, which deals with the realities of using reverse mortgages as a tool for retirement income planning, is authored by renowned expert on reverse mortgages, Shelley Giordano.\nJack Tatar, Publisher of People Tested Publications says, “This is a book that I was excited to publish because it takes on a subject that most people have many preconceived notions about – reverse mortgages. Shelley reminded me, as well as readers, that this strategy has significantly grown and matured over the last 2 years and is not at all like what many perceive it to be. Shelley examines the current realities of the reverse mortgage product and goes in depth on using the strategy for retirement income. She challenges the myths of the product and examines how this strategy is now achieving its original intent when it was put into law by President Reagan, to help retirees to earn income on their home, while being able to remain there. The current realities of tax treatment, healthcare and need for steady income are examined in the book, which makes it different from other books on the topic available on the market. For me, this is the definitive book on reverse mortgages and will answer any question you have on the topic.”\nShelley Giordano, an expert of reverse mortgages and member of the Longevity Task Force, a group of thought leaders in retirement portfolio theory, has written a book that discusses the significant improvements made by HUD/FHA to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM.) Over the years, and most notably in 2015, HUD has improved consumer safeguards, and reduced acquisition costs for those wishing to use their housing wealth in a controlled and strategic pattern. Shelley has brought together thought leaders and experts to write a book that applies sound analysis to demonstrate that the prudent and conservative use of housing wealth, accessed via the modern HECM, can have a profound positive effect on our other assets and our ability to generate income for retirement. This book debunks the hoary old myths attached to reverse mortgages. Reading this book will provide you with a full understanding of reverse mortgages to see beyond the current sales and advertising tactics related to the product allowing you to discuss the best options with your adviser, banker and family.\nFor more information or to purchase the book, visit PeopleTested.com or email This email address is being protected from spambots.
