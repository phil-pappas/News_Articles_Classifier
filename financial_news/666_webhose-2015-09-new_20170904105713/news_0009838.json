What happened there?\" he said, laughing as the women explained the fish was spawning.\nHe tried his hand at Yup'ik native dancing with grade school students before taking his motorcade down the main drag, passing a fishing boat with the hulking head of a recently killed moose.\nAt the N + N Market, where a large bag of Doritos cost $9.39, Obama talked about the high costs of food in places where almost everything has to be shipped in.\nThe community was plastered with signs like \"Mines and fish don't co-exist\" protesting against the Pebble Mine copper and gold project proposed by Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has placed restrictions on the proposed mine, which the company is fighting in court.\n\"Our view is that if the president is interested in the issue he should try to hear from all perspectives about it, including those closest to Pebble who would like the jobs Pebble may provide,\" said Mike Heatwole, a spokesman for Pebble Limited Partnership.\nObama did not address the mine directly, but noted he had taken steps this year to shut off Bristol Bay from oil and gas exploration to protect the fishing industry.\n\"There are other threats to this environment that we've always got to be alert to,\" Obama said.
