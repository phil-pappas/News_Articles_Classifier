Fifteen members of the Fed's 17 person rate-setting committee thought in June that the first rate rise would be announced in 2015, and 13 members of the committee still do.\nAdvertisement In deciding to hold rates one more time the Fed has taken the recent share market ructions into account, however. That's unusual, and for some, a bit worrying. The market downturn was sparked by concerns about growth in China, and how it might affect growth elsewhere. It may be that the Fed is concerned about the same thing.\nChairman Janet Yellen told a post-decision press conference that while the \"Fed should not be responding to the ups and downs of the markets\", recent sharemarket volatility suggested prospects for growth in China and the world have weakened.\n\"When there are significant financial developments, it's incumbent on us to ask ourselves what is causing them,\" she said.\n\"Given the significant economic and financial inter-connections between the United States and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching,\"\nA bond market rally that drove yields lower after the decision confirmed to investors think that the fed is more concerned about economic growth than it was and that the timetable for rate rises has, as a result, lengthened.\nThe Fed also wants to see inflation in the US get a bit higher before it launches a rate rise that will tend to slow the economy, and push inflation back down again.\n\"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\" it says, adding that it lift rates when it sees \"some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium term.\"\nControlling inflation is core responsibility for central banks, and if it threatens to to go above what they regard as a stable range they bear down on it by raising interest rates. Our Reserve Bank's target range is two to three per cent. The Fed considers that two per cent in an appropriate long term target.\nTo the surprise of many who thought that record low rates and a $US4 trillion quantitative easing cash splash from the Fed would unleash rampant inflation, the United States is still tracking below the Fed's two per cent inflation target, however.\nConsumer prices actually fell by 0.1 per cent in August compared with July and rose by only 0.2 per cent over a year. They rose by 1.8 per cent in the year to August if elements including lower oil and fuel prices are ignored. That is still below the Fed's target, however, and inflation futures contracts predict that inflation will still only be two per cent in five years' time.\nThe inflation outlook was crucial for the Fed meeting because a rate rise will temper economic growth and inflation, and low inflation or negative inflation - deflation - are also undesirable.\nIn a world where there is deflation, the prices of goods and services are declining as time goes by, and purchasing power of cash is rising. Economic growth is undermined, because there is less incentive to take a risk and put money to work, and because the real cost of existing debt and the real cost of servicing debt rises, making defaults and bankruptcies more likely.\nAs prominent US economist Carmen Reinhart also pointed out ahead of the latest Fed meeting, low inflation has become a global issue as the hangover from the global crisis persists.\nIn the 189 countries for which inflation data is available median inflation has fallen this year to an average of two per cent. Inflation in nearly half of the countries is at or below two per cent, there are more countries experiencing deflation than 10 per cent-plus inflation, and in a group of 23 advanced economies, the median inflation rate is 0.2 per cent.\nThe Fed would make its rate call based on America's economic performance, but the global inflation outlook argued for \"policy gradualism,\" Reinhart concluded. It may be that the Fed agrees.\nWhat will the markets make of this decision?\nReserve bank assistant governor Guy Debelle remarked this week that a US Federal Reserve interest rate hike was the most well telegraphed rate rise in the history of rate rises. \"If you're not ready for it, you sure as hell have been warned,\" he said, adding: \"You've got no excuse.\"\nBets about what the Fed would do at its meeting this week diverged in the wake of August's share market sell-off in response to heightened concerns about China's economy, however.\nAhead of this week's rate-setting meeting just over half of the 113 economists and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a rate hike. US interest rate futures put the risk of a rate rise at only 28 per cent, however, and the latest Fed decision isn't going to leave the markets single-minded.\nLift-off still seems near, but the Fed has noticed the recent market ructions, and wants inflation up and further improvements in the job market before it moves.\nThat will disappoint some in the markets who just want the guessing game to end. Others will be happy to see the Fed's interest rate holiday continue.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/us-fed-leaves-interest-rates-on-hold-20150917-gjpe82.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:35:51.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
