Wayne Taylor by Amanda Saunders First it was tobacco, then alcohol, gambling, then asbestos. Sugar might also be on the nose for investors. But right now it is hard to find a more loathed sector than coal.\nNot only are the forces of environmentalists lining up against the commodity. But there seems to be no end in sight for depressed prices.\nThe gas industry turned rogue on their counterparts in coal a few months ago too, attacking the industry in a bid to position itself as a cleaner source of energy.\nAnd in a fresh kick in the guts, news broke out from the United States on Friday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was preparing to announce a cap-and-trade scheme to curb emissions as part of a climate deal with the US, ahead of climate talks in Paris in December. China is Australia's biggest coal customer and as China and US face off in a climate change battle, the commodity is likely to be a victim.\nSo imagine the challenge facing the person that has to talk up this industry under siege. That person is Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association.\nIt might feel like he is trying to sell ice to eskimos, lobbying for an industry so beleaguered. But Sporton, an Australian who took the top job at the World Coal Association three months ago, is ditching soft diplomacy for advocacy.\n\"You can't compare it to tobacco,\" he told AFR Weekend in Melbourne on Friday.\n\"Coal has social value, coal is a provider of electricity, and products that make steel and cement. That's where we have the job to explain that. I don't think as a global industry we've been sufficiently active in making the case for coal.\"\n The case for coal The WCA is not the only outfit turning to advocacy. On Friday, it also came out that Royal Dutch Shell and BHP Billiton are heading a carbon caucus to reintroduce fossil fuels to the highest levels of debate over climate change ahead of COP21 in Paris this year.\nSporton is in Australia to talk up coal's case after touring Asia earlier this month. Clean coal is a major part of the solution to a lower carbon future, he says.\nSporton's chairman, Mick Buffier, who is also a key coal executive for Glencore in Australia, has joined Sporton on tour.\nAustralia, along with the United States, is one of the most hostile countries in the world to coal right now. Progress in the Hunter Valley is under threat, and Indian giant Adani's plans to build a mega mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin are looking incredibly shaky. Australia is the world's second-biggest exporter of coal, after Indonesia.\nBuffier says \"Australia is up there\" as a challenge, \"particularly with the activisation of people opposing coal mines, but we are also experiencing this globally\".\n\"A large chunk of opposition driven is by the premise that to solve climate change, coal has got to go away. But that doesn't add up. It puts more pressure back on the industry to explain why coal will continue to have an ongoing role.\"\nCoal is \"not dying\", he says, and the industry body needs to focus on getting the message across that coal no longer has to be associated with high emissions. Buffier says the anti-coal lobby is \"partly succeeding\" in their goal of delaying coal projects, and mine expansions, which is \"costing the industry money\".\nAs the rallying cry for divestment has ramped up over the past 18 months, the industry had been slow to make its case. In a direct response to the increasingly successful divestment and anti-coal push, Brendan Pearson's MCA has created an advertising campaign called Little Black Rock, with the tagline 'Coal. It's an amazing thing'.\nWhitehaven managing director Paul Flynn told AFR Weekend on Friday that the industry must continue to state its case, and the facts, to drown out the \"noise\" from the anti-coal lobby.\n\"The industry is coming from behind because we've allowed the hysterical, screaming minority to suck up all the oxygen in the room,\" he said from the US, where he is on an investor roadshow post 2014-15 results.\nAsia investing in coal-fired power ​\"When you focus on the facts it is irrefutable that coal will be the cornerstone of energy needs or energy supply in our region in particular.\"\nFlynn says coal is not in structural decline, but a cyclical downturn.\nIn Asia, all key markets are growing their coal-fired power stations. It is likely China will agree to help finance cleaner energy options for poorer countries, as well as trying to halt its own emissions by making it more expensive to pollute and forcing companies to use cleaner forms of energy.\nHow far China's cap and trade system will go is still to emerge, but it could see the Asian giant push even harder on its rollout of low-emission high-efficiency power stations called supercritical and ultra-supercritical. Two years ago, the US committed to stop financing new coal-fired power plants. It is not clear, either, how far China will go to try to beat the US on carbon policy after this historic White House summit meeting with Barack Obama.\nBut energy demand is still growing and coal still has a big role to play in that, Sporton says. And the coal industry is banking on the 1.3 billion people in the world who live without access to electricity.\nAnti-coal campaigns have gained a high profile in Australia, even though Whitehaven's Flynn, who has been on the frontline with the miner's Maules Creek project in NSW, says there have been \"no substantive wins that they can claim\".\nBut in the United States, the gas revolution that has driven down the price of gas and encouraged the switch from coal, has proven a bigger problem for the industry than divestment.\nBut the coal industry says switching to gas isn't the answer, despite the rival industry's concerted campaign.\nSporton picked up the phone and called some of the oil and gas big boys after a surprise attack from Woodside, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and France's Total, who used a World Gas Conference in Paris in June to attack coal, call for a carbon price and push cleaner-burning but more expensive gas as an alternative to coal to make electricity.\n\"I have spoken to people I know in the oil and gas industry saying 'why are we doing this'. Gas isn't an answer either. They try to help us forget that these companies are in oil and gas. But we are all part of the fossil fuels industry, we all need to address our emissions. So we should all be working together on this, lobbying for more action on CCS [carbon capture and storage] together.\"\nAnd in most Asian countries, gas cannot displace coal.\nPrices fall further Coal prices continue to take a battering – with 2015 shaping as a horror year. New Hope chief executive Shane Stephan​ said earlier this week that a recovery in thermal coal prices \"is likely to be gradual and is still some time away\". Thermal coal has fallen 16 per cent since January to $US55 ($78) a tonne, a fraction of the roughly $US150 it was fetching in the heady days of 2011. Metallurgical coal has crashed another 28 per cent this year to about $US79 a tonne – again, nowhere near the $US300 a tonne it was trading at four years ago.\nThe IEA says coal will still be the world's main source of electricity for the next 20 years. It's an emerging world fuel that the developed world doesn't like anymore.\nThe future looks a bit brighter for exporters of quality coal, like Australia.\nQuality coal is better for the more efficient power stations, cleaner and attracts a premium that at current prices could be the difference between being in the red and the black. Whitehaven is one example, helping boost margins with its thermal coal attracting a premium of about $US5 a tonne on top of the current benchmark thermal coal prices of about $US55 a tonne. The importance of high-quality coal is underlined by the the new Chinese coal import testing regime.\nEven with the IEA's ambitious growth projection for renewables and significant international climate action, coal will still be big in 2040, the WCA says.\nThe IEA says electricity generation from coal will be 45 per cent higher in 2040, despite its share of generation reducing from 75 per cent to 52 per cent. Again, how China's cap-and-trade scheme would alter that is unknown.\nGlobally there are 510 coal-fired power plant units under construction. With a further 1,874 planned that's a total of 2,384. They are mostly in China, India and Indonesia. Of those, India is the great hope.\nSporton says the most important thing countries can do in the short term to reduce CO2 emissions is to increase the efficiency of coal-fired power plants.\nAfter that, the great hope is near-zero emissions from coal using the still nascent carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.\nSporton and Buffier reject suggestions the coal industry has been too slow to move on CCS. They are calling for \"urgent and improved action\" but say it's not the industry's fault there has been insufficient investment to date. Only now, there's not as much money in coal miner's coffers.\nCoal miners and industry groups are also vocal on the energy poverty line – coal is the cheapest, most effective, reliable form of energy.\n\"We are 88 per cent urbanised, China is 52 per cent, India today is 35 per cent. You need electricity and concrete and steel to feed that,\" Buffier says.\nBHP coal president Mike Henry says that the coal industry needed to improve its \"public engagement\" but it isn't about \"selling\" coal.\n\"It's about getting the facts on the table and engaging in balanced discussion about the role of coal in the world,\" he says. \"The public has more than enough ability to make sense of the facts and the different perspectives once they have them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:10:56.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
