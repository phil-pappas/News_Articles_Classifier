Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson \"You people are reporting politics like it's a reality television show,\" Scott \"ScoMo\" Morrison complained to a radio interviewer after yet more questions about whether it was time Joe Hockey was voted off the island.\n\"We as a government take it more seriously than that and they're the issues we're focused on – jobs, growth, community safety,\" Morrison said.\nYeah right. If politics is show business for ugly people, Canberra is the new Hollywood.\nIn federal parliament this week, a film crew stalked the corridors filming the Foxtel thriller Secret City based on the political insider novels, The Marmalade Files and The Mandarin Code . Unlike this fictional version of Canberra, the real thing is heavy on action stunts but thin on plot.\nTake for instance, \"community safety\" formerly known as national security, and before than known as \"policing\".\nOn Thursday morning, Immigration and Border Protection minister Peter Dutton called a 9.30 press conference with Border Force commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg​ at a Brisbane industrial port. Dutton and the telegenically square-jawed Quaedvlieg, in his impressive black Border Force uniform with gilt badges, stood in front of a dry-docked yacht in which a record cocaine haul had been discovered.\n\"This is a great day for Australian Border Force and I congratulate the commissioner,\" Dutton told the cameras.\nFor the such a momentous drug bust, the press conference resulted in very little news coverage. The reason? The same drug bust of 70 kilograms of cocaine had been already announced by the Australian Federal Police and comprehensively covered on August 25. The pretext for the media event was that a subsequent search of the yacht by Border Force officials had found another 30 kilograms secreted in the hull. It had all the appearance of those old election campaign re-announcements where the same pot of taxpayer funding is dressed up, recycled and reannounced in the countdown to election day.\n Quite rightly, Dutton was questioned by reporters why he would call a press conference on a 10-day-old drug bust when he wouldn't comment on last week's disastrous Operation Fortitude because it was an \"operational matter\". Was this in fact a PR stunt?\n\"I don't agree with the characterisation of your question,\" Dutton said.\n\"When the professional police, law enforcement agencies like the ABF, when they have done their job, governments talk about the success of those operations and the outcome of those operations and that is what we have done here today.\"\nForget about reality shows, it's more like an episode of Yes, Minister . When public servants do their jobs successfully, ministers get to talk about it.\nWhile national security and fighting the evils of terrorism is one of the Coalition's core electoral strengths, it is a difficult thing for politicians to boast about without putting real-life operations at risk. Or annoying people.\nWhen Tony Abbott attempted to compare Islamic state extremists to Nazis who \"did terrible evil but they had sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it\", there was the predictable outrage. Abbott, a repeat offender of Nazi metaphors, is becoming the Basil Fawlty of Australian politics. We might be about to bomb Syria, but for god's sake, don't mention the war.\nPerhaps this is one reason why the political rhetoric on national security has morphed quietly over the past couple of weeks into \"community safety\" to include any activity by Border Force – remember it's just the old Customs department – in stopping drug shipments. National security tends to imply stopping wrongdoers in the hot, dusty \"over there\" whereas community safety is all about the dangers \"over here\".\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten is playing at community safety as well, going as far as to fly to the contested seat of Canning in Perth to announce a Labor government would spend $3.2 million on CCTV cameras and rehab services to help the good folk of Canning beat their addiction to ice. In fact Shorten said much of the 571 assaults, 377 home burglaries, 34 robberies and 130 car thefts in the area were \"directly attributable to the Liberals' failure to address the growing ice crisis\". Goodness, who knew all those ice addicts were Tony Abbott's fault?\nFor those looking for a little more substance in their political news, let's move on to the other two of Coalition's triumvirate of hot issues: jobs and growth.\nThe big stories this week are the faltering national economy and the government deciding basically not to do stuff.\nNo one wants to say the \"r\" word, yet the national accounts show the economy came within a whisker of shrinking in the second quarter of this year, with GDP growing just 0.2 percent in the June quarter . So there's soft economic growth, weak productivity growth and the only upside being weak wages growth propping up employment.\nYet approaching its two-year anniversary and looking down the barrel of a tough election campaign sometime next year, the government gives the appearance, right now, of a small target strategy.\nUnder pressure from business and an uneasy backbench, the Abbott cabinet has dumped the bank deposit tax that would have boosted the budget by $500 million a year and deferred indefinitely Small Business Minister Bruce Billson's contentious plans to crack down on the use of market power by big business .\nDon't forget this is the time in the government's reform timetable that all those first-term reviews and audits should be producing fruit to boost the economy's competitiveness and productivity, and the measures that will make the budget more sustainable for future generations.\nAbbott says he'll have more to say on the old issue of the GST and growing problem of bracket creep on personal income – which hits productivity and workforce participation – in the \"months ahead\". But there's growing alarm among community leaders – as seen at last week's National Reform Summit – that the task of getting Australia out of its economic rut can no longer be at politicians' luxury of fitting in with the electoral cycle.\nUnderstandably, large slabs of the electorate are irritated by the manufactured outrage over the superficial faux pas of politicians – such as Abbott's latest Nazi gaffe and Shorten's confusing sandwich chain Subway (whose former US frontman Jared Fogle​ is embroiled in a child porn investigation) with convenience store chain 7-Eleven, which is accused of underpaying thousands of its Australian workers.\nYet as Labor's Andrew Leigh points out in his book, The Luck of Politics , even small blunders – such as Abbott's knighting of Prince Phillip on Australia Day – can take on mammoth proportions if it happens during an uneventful media cycle.\nParliament resumes on Monday and no doubt there'll be blunders on both sides and let's hope they will be gutsy, meaningful ones rather than fodder for our light entertainment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:06:58.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
