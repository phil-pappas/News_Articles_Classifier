G20: endorsed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revised principles on corporate governance and the progress on principles for SME financing; stressed the need to finalise outstanding core elements of the global regulatory reform package; welcomed work on the total-loss-absorbing-capacity standard (TLAC) and work on simple and transparent securitisation structures; looked forward to delivery of work on temporary stays on early termination rights for OTC derivative contracts extended to other instruments and firms, and on risk-weighted asset calculations; highlighted the forthcoming implementation of the G20 shadow banking roadmap; called for progress on central counterparty (CCP) resilience and legal barriers to the reporting of OTC derivatives contracts to trade repositories and to the cross-border access of authorities to trade repository data and to improve the usability of that data; and continues to prioritise work on freezing terrorist assets and international cooperation. It noted reports due from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in November on progress towards criminalising terrorist financing, applying targeted financial sanctions and strengthening counter-terrorism tools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:34:02.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
