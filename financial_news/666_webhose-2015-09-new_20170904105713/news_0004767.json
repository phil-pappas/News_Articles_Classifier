Philip Gostelow by Amanda Saunders Australia's big mining services firms face a struggle to generate enough cash to pay back huge looming debt maturities, Standard & Poor's says.\nIn the next four years, about $US1.7 billion ($2.38 billion) of the sector's capital markets debt will mature. That includes lump-sum payments of between $US250 million and $US485 million for Barminco and Boart Longyear​ in 2018, as well as Emeco, BIS Industries and Ausdrill in 2019.\n\"Refinancing risk will be a focus in the next few years, as weak cash flow generation will call into question mining services companies' ability to meet bullet debt repayments,\" S&P said in a new report on Wednesday.\n\"[They] have a delicate balancing act between reducing unused [credit] facilities, which carry additional costs, and protecting their liquidity position.\"\nIn addition to the $US1.7 billion in debt due across the sector by 2019, Transfield Services faces a $US325 million maturity in May 2020 and Boart Longyear has a further $US300 million due in April 2021.\nPremiums are being paid for tenor and \"covenant lite\" facilities, like Fortescue Metals Group's expensive refinancing of $US2.3 billion of its $US7 billion debt pile in April this year.\nThere is \"negative investor bias toward speculative-grade issuers exposed to the mining sector, demanding a higher margin premium compared to similarly rated entities that operate in less cyclical sectors\".\nS&P expects the sector's leverage peaked in fiscal 2015, mainly driven by the cut in operating and capital expenditure, but no \"material reduction\" in leverage is expected until the business cycle turns in mining.\n The sector has excess capital invested. Five out of the eight mining services companies rated by S&P are on negative outlook.\n\"The negative rating bias remains high in the Australian mining services sector, even after multiple downward rating actions over the past 18 months.\"\nThe sector's credit quality is getting smashed on multiple fronts – including miners' cuts to capital spending on exploration and mining and moves to bring mining operations in house to cut costs. In addition, miners have deferred expansion plans. and \"changed the competitive dynamics for new and existing contracts ... to share the strain and align incentives between the two groups\".\n\"Competition for contracts has heated up amid the sluggish environment plagued by an oversupply of mining services providers and equipment,\" S&P said.\nTo survive, mining services firms have been forced to adopt \"innovative\" strategies like the profit-sharing agreement Atlas Iron struck with its contractors to return to production.\n\"Coupled with business diversity in some cases and capital flexibility, these innovative efforts have kept mining services companies afloat so far.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:05:14.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
