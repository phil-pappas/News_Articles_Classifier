Puskar, File) \n\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Alcoa will split into two independent companies, separating its bauxite, aluminum and casting operations from its engineering, transportation and global rolled products businesses.\nThe century-plus-old metals maker has been dealing with a downturn in its smelting business because of lower aluminum prices. The split will create one company focusing on upstream products, including aluminum. The other company will focus on engineered products, which includes the automotive and aerospace segments.\nThe split is part of a wider movement by companies to spin off units in a bid to boost shareholder value. Often, the strategy helps free the stronger part of a company's business from a weaker segment.\nThe aluminum and upstream products company will retain the Alcoa name. The name of the engineered products company has yet to be determined.\nAlcoa Inc., which is based in New York with significant operations in Pittsburgh, expects the split to be complete by the second half of 2016. The company has been an industrial presence in the U.S. economy for well over a century, dating its founding to the Pittsburgh Reduction Co. in 1888.\n\"In the last few years, we have successfully transformed Alcoa to create two strong value engines that are now ready to pursue their own distinctive strategic directions,\" Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld said in a statement.\nThe company has been shifting its focus to its more profitable automotive and aerospace products, which also involve titanium. It has been shutting down unprofitable aluminum smelters as a surplus of the material on the market weighs down prices and profit.\nEarlier this month, Alcoa broadened a partnership with Ford Motor Co. through the use of a stronger form of aluminum for auto body parts. It also spent about $60 million to expand its three-dimensional manufacturing capabilities at a technical center in the Pittsburgh area.\nAfter the planned split, Kleinfeld will lead the as yet unnamed company focusing on engineering products. Each company will have its own board of directors and full management teams will be named in the months leading up to the split.\nSeveral other companies have either split over the last year or plan to do so. eBay split off its payments unit PayPal into a separate company. Hewlett-Packard is in the process of splitting its slumping personal computing unit and its better performing servers, software and consulting services unit. Gannett Co. plans to split its weaker publishing unit from its digital and broadcasting unit.\nAfter initially rising, Alcoa's shares slipped back and were unchanged at $9.63 shortly ahead of the market open.\nCommodity Markets Alcoa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:37:28.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
