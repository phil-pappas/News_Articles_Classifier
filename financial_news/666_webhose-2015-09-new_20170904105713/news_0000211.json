What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about optimal sequencing of widow's and retirement benefits. Question : My husband died at 51. I am now 61 and am applying for widow’s benefits. Since he died at a young age his benefits are $1,440 a month. I have been told that at 67 I can draw mine, which is more. Is this correct, and is this the right way to do it? Answer : I’m really sorry for your loss. This is not exactly the right way to do it. Assuming that you weren’t earning so much as to lose all your widow’s benefits to the earnings test, you should have filed for your widow’s benefit at 60.You should file for your widow’s benefit now. Unfortunately, Social Security won’t give you past, unclaimed benefits. You should wait until 70 to collect your own retirement benefit, at which point it will start at its largest possible value. This presumes you have a pretty high maximum age of life (note, I didn’t use the word expected).
