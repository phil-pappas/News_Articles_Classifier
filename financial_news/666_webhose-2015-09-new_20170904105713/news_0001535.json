Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd The AFR Magazine 's hotly anticipated annual Power issue includes lists of the key players across eight different industry sectors. Here, the top five from education.\nThe former federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, had been expected to make sweeping changes to higher education, which for the next few decades would have been known as the Pyne reforms. But it wasn't to be.\nHe wanted to deregulate fees for bachelor degrees, apply a higher interest rate to HECS loans, extend course subsidies to private higher education providers, broaden the range of subsidised qualifications to include lower levels such as advanced diplomas, and cut overall funding for courses by 20 per cent.\nBut Pyne was thwarted by the five independent senators who blocked the far-reaching legislation in March. Instead of ushering in a new era of higher education, the minister finds himself an also-ran in this year's education power stakes.\nIan Chubb says we need to rethink the way we teach our kids STEM. His opponents, who feared deregulation would send fees soaring, proved more potent than him. lite universities continue to chafe under rules that say courses at a top-tier university and a third-tier university must cost the same.\nAnother part of Pyne's package â€“ which would have helped less privileged students by giving them a second chance to enter university through pathway courses â€“ was also blocked. Simon Birmingham now holds the Education portfolio.\n1. Five independent senators By killing Pyne's changes to university-level education, the five independent senators â€“ Jacqui Lambie, Glenn Lazarus, Ricky Muir, Dio Wang and Nick Xenophon â€“ became the most potent wielders of power in this field in the past year. But they are change negators, not creators. We wait to see how the challenges facing higher education will be resolved.\nDelighted to be Min for Industry, Innovation and Science as well as Leader of the House. Thanks to all in Education for last seven years ðŸŽ‰\nâ€” Christopher Pyne (@cpyne) September 20, 2015 2. Stephen Parker The only vice-chancellor who publicly rejected fee deregulation, Parker, head of the University of Canberra, argued Pyne's package would entrench differences between prestigious universities, which could charge high fees, and the rest. The opponents of deregulation rallied and they won this round.\n3. Christopher Pyne His stalled reform package nevertheless convinced universities that government funding will remain tight and some form of fee deregulation will eventually come. The result is that many universities are making themselves more competitive and efficient.\n4. Ian Chubb Using his wide political network and high public profile, the nation's chief scientist and former ANU vice-chancellor convinced the federal government to pay more attention to science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education, establish a science council chaired by the Prime Minister and end Australia's status as the only OECD country without a science and technology strategy.\n5. Nicholas Saunders The former vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle now heads the revamped higher education regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. The agency says yes or no to applications to be a higher education provider and enforces the new regulatory regime, which is based on risk assessment rather than ticking boxes.\nThe AFR Magazine Power issue, out Friday September 25 inside The Australian Financial Review .\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cpyne/status/645478321589895168", "https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "https://twitter.com/afrmag", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney", "https://instagram.com/afrmag/"], "published": "2015-09-21T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:07:17.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
