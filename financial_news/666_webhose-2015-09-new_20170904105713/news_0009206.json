Speaking to Churchill was sometimes like \"talking to a brass band\". by Maximilian Walsh Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain were two leading lights of the British Conservative Party in the 1930s, who had their differences but one shared determination. That was to exclude Winston Churchill from their governments.\nBaldwin confided the reasons for this pact in May 1936 to a Tory colleague, Dr Tom Jones.\n\"One of these days I'll make a few casual remarks about Winston. Not a speech – no oratory – just as few words in passing. I've got it all ready. I am going to say that when Winston was born lots of fairies swooped down on his cradle with gifts – imagination, eloquence, industry, ability, and then came a fairy who said: 'No one person has the right to so many gifts', picked him up and gave him such a shake and twist that with all these gifts he was denied judgment and wisdom.\"\nWhen I encountered this anecdote in Roy Jenkins' magisterial biography of Churchill, it immediately conjured a Turnbullian image.\nThis might well have been generated by the fact that on an earlier occasion I had exchanged some views with Turnbull regarding Churchill's wartime leadership.\nLet's say Turnbull lived up to Chamberlain's description that such encounters with Churchill were akin to \"arguing with a brass band\".\nThat's the way he was 15 years or so ago. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is certainly entitled to demonstrate whether he has, with the passage of time, managed to retrieve those valuable fairy gifts. He is going to need them.\nOdds against him Throughout his various careers, Turnbull has been fortunate, or skilled enough, to get the timing right. That does not appear to be the case this time. Turnbull comes to the prime ministership when the odds against emerging as a successful, talented and popular economic manager – the benchmark of Australian political leadership – have become dauntingly short.\nIn a parliamentary party that has become increasingly centre-right, Turnbull has succeeded as a pragmatist of the centre-left. He is clever without being glib.\nHe has become Prime Minister of an Australia that has been extensively re-fashioned by the latest and largest mining booms to roll through our history, underwritten by vast deposits of iron ore and coal and China, which is determined to restore its economy to superpower status.\nBy virtue of its expanded wealth, geography and success, Australia moved up the global power rankings and remained there as the boom wound down.\nBooms carry with them the seeds of their own destruction. While hardly being a disinterested bystander at the demise of the boom, Australia was fortunate that China's crash-through economic management style embraced Keynesian demand stimulation with an open cheque book.\nChina is paying the price now for its extravagance – it is handicapped by excess capacity across its manufacturing and transportation sectors. In addition, it embarked on a program of residential development the likes of which the world has never seen.\nAustralia was, in effect, given a free ride through the boom and its aftermath. Turnbull prospered while maintaining a low public profile. His wife, Lucy, served as lord mayor of Sydney.\nProvocative fashion When he decided to run for Parliament, he did so in a typically unorthodox and provocative fashion: challenging a sitting Liberal Party member.\nHe also spent up big. His gift of timing resulted in his election as the second post-Howard leader of the Liberal Party.\nHowever, when he sought support from his party colleagues for a pro-climate, environment-friendly platform, Turnbull was unexpectedly defeated. He was dissuaded from resigning from Parliament and was ultimately rewarded by his colleagues, who re-elected him three weeks ago.\nThis time he won because he was widely seen by the parliamentary party as being the only candidate who could win government for the Liberals.\nJust what sort of Prime Minister he will make remains to be seen. While demonstrably much more popular with his Liberal colleagues than was the case six years ago, his elevation has been the result of ability, not popularity.\nOf more import is what sort of Prime Minister will he be? This could prove to be an unusual mistiming – it is not the best time to find yourself leader of the national government.\nOne strong plus is that your opponent, trade union executive Bill Shorten, has failed to make any impression on the Parliament. Shorten is basically a kingmaker, not a king.\nNor is the policy arena particularly attractive to either candidate for the prime ministership.\nReduction in workforce The end of the mining boom will result in a sharp reduction in the workforce remaining in that sector. Whether a recession results is anyone's guess.\nLabor won the 2010 election by running a union-funded campaign against changes to industrial laws, which Labor argued would cost jobs.\nThen there is the winding down of the motor vehicle industry, which will cost between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs.\nThere is also the expected arrival in Australia of the El Nino weather system, which can usually be translated into extensive droughts.\nA serious El Nino can cut gross domestic product by a full per cent. Sub-3 per cent growth is already expected, so the El Nino fall-out could be the political decider.\nThen there is the real worry for an Australian government – a hard landing in China. Such an outcome would almost certainly be accompanied by recessions across the universe of emerging markets.\nAustralia has not experienced a recession in more than 20 years. In the past a recession could cut the value of stock exchange investments by 45 per cent. Unemployment, at 5.6 per cent, could double.\nRock-bottom interest rates have underwritten million dollar mortgages across Australia. Recessions are usually sparked by central bank imposed rate increases.\nSuch a scenario would be toxic for an incumbent government.\nMalcolm Turnbull is riding a wave of popularity. He is going to need all the help he can get to insure re-election, even from fairies.\nMaximilian Walsh is deputy chairman of Dixon Advisory and a former editor and managing editor of The Australian Financial Review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:09:31.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
