However, it might have been weighed down by a statistical fluke that has led to sharp upward revisions to August payroll figures.\nAverage hourly earnings increased 8 cents, the biggest rise since January, and the workweek rose to 34.6 hours.\nThe jobless rate declined 0.2 percentage point to 5.1 percent, its lowest level since April 2008 and in the range that most Fed officials think is consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation.\n\"The headline was a little weak, but every other metric was strong,\" said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York. \"No one thinks the September (rate hike) is a done deal, but this certainly supports that.\"\nExpectations of a rate hike by the Fed in September have waned as a slowdown in China has brought increased market volatility across asset classes. That has caused the dollar to struggle in recent weeks, especially against the yen.\nThe dollar index of major currencies traded against the greenback repeatedly fluctuated between gains and losses and last was little changed.\nThe dollar was down as much as 1 percent against the yen but was last at 119.30 yen, or a loss of 0.65 percent.\nThe dollar was up against the euro, which pivoted from earlier gains stemming from unwinding of euro-funded carry trades.\nThe euro hit a two-week low against the dollar on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank's bond-buying program may run beyond September 2016 and that its size and composition may be adjusted.
