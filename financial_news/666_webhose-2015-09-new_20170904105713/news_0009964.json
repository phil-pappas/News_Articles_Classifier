The court concluded that FHFA’s claims against RBS are not time-barred because the extender statute in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 preempts statutes of repose as well as statutes of limitations, pointing to the statutory language, congressional intent, and recent precedent in support of its holding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:02:56.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
