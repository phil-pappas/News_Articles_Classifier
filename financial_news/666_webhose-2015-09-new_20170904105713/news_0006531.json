She will lead a team that will simplify processes across the business to help Target react quickly to shoppers’ needs. \nGupta will report to John Mulligan, the company’s former chief financial officer who was named last month to a new position of chief operating officer. Gupta joins Target from private equity firm Hellman & Friedman and starts Oct. 12. She previously served as vice president for process and profit improvement at Michaels Stores Inc. and held operational leadership roles at Safeway. \nThe moves come as Target, like many retailers, confront basic problems like keeping items in stock while responding to shoppers’ new ways of buying such as ordering online and picking up at the store. \nThe personnel change is the latest in a string of moves that Cornell has tried to make Target to be a more nimble player. He also aims to restore its position as a cheap chic purveyor. In August, Target said that Kathryn Tesija, an executive vice president and former chief merchandising and supply chain officer, would shift to a strategic advisory role until she leaves the company in April.
