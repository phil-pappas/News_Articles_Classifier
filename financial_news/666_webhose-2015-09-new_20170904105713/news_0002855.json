Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Christopher Joye Everyone in finance has their fingers crossed that the former venture capitalist, investment banker, and legal maestro Malcolm Turnbull will fulfil his once-in-a-generation potential and usher in a new era of articulate straight-shooting on the critical policy debates of the day and the need for market-based reforms.\nWhen it comes to matters of the mind, Turnbull is neurologically wired to project the truth. After decades spent trying to solve tricky commercial problems as quickly as possible, Turnbull's impulse is to stubbornly hone in on, and communicate, the most tractable solutions. He's a dependable rationalist who has always struggled with political dissembling when it comes to ideas. Recall the sly smirks when thrown curve-balls about Liberal party policies he obviously did not support on Q&A ?\nIt's this authenticity and economic leadership that Turnbull has correctly identified the nation requires after years of mind-numbingly inane rhetoric from politicians who have never worked in the real world.\nWhile Joe Hockey was a solid Treasurer at the pure policy level – he undoubtedly struggled with messaging and marketing – my experience dealing with Scott Morrison suggests he will be a very able successor. As demonstrated in his portfolios to date, Morrison is an intelligent, composed, and pragmatic executive. I'm also delighted to read speculation that Arthur Sinodinos and Kelly O'Dwyer will be rewarded with more responsibilities.\nAlthough I faulted Sinodinos on the Coalition's changes to the Future of Financial Advice Laws (we rolled them in the Senate), they were really a Mathias Cormann love-child that Sinodinos inherited. The former Treasury economist is, and will continue to be, an outstanding public servant.\nO'Dwyer is a super-sharp former Freehills lawyer who advised Australia's greatest Treasurer (nay shadow prime minister?), the inimitable Peter Costello. A rare talent, I rate her as one of the best next-generation leaders with the ability to go all the way. Go girl!\nFor the right reasons While some might attribute these promotions to partisans in the Abbott-Turnbull battle, the polarising Goldman Sachs alumnus has always been a meritocrat. And make no mistake he's doing this for the right reasons: it's not much fun being perpetually pilloried by colleagues, dumped as Opposition Leader, and resigning from politics, only to return with little hope of resurrection. This resilient and mercurial maven genuinely wants to make an enduring difference.\n An interesting early policy test will be whether Turnbull sees fit to interfere with the government's response to Hockey's excellent financial system inquiry, which was due for release on Tuesday. Like the Council of Financial Regulators, I would recommend pricing the currently free taxpayer insurance of bank deposits, which could materially reduce net government debt and mitigate the significant moral hazard the subsidy causes. But I will not hold my breath.\nIn this context, Turnbull would do well to reflect on two excellent speeches this week by Wayne Byres , the chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. A key take-away was Byres' emphasis on just how poorly the majors' capitalisation stacks up when measured on a global basis using their \"leverage ratios\". Byres argued that while the more frequently cited Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratios \"are obviously of prime importance, they are not the full story\".\nA CET1 ratio divides a bank's equity capital by the dollar value of its \"risk-weighted\" assets. The problem is that these risk weights are arbitrarily determined by banks and regulators using either unilateral estimates or flawed financial models. In the case of all-important home loans, the big banks' risk weights have shifted wildly over the past decade, from 50 per cent down to 16 per cent and then back up to 25 per cent, with more movements likely under the incoming rules known as Basel 4.\nByres continued that \"while we might give primacy to the [risk-weighted] CET1 ratio, we shouldn't fixate on it alone. We know that in the financial crisis, the [non-risk-weighted] 'leverage ratio' – despite (or perhaps because of?) its simplicity – was something investors paid attention to.\"\nUnalloyed picture The only difference between a CET1 ratio and a leverage ratio is that the latter divides the value of a bank's equity capital not by \"risk-weighted\" assets but rather by the actual dollar value of assets. It provides, therefore, an unalloyed picture of a bank's capitalisation that is not subject to regulatory and/or bank fiddling.\nA key drawback with CET1 ratios is that risk weights can suddenly increase in a highly pro-cyclical fashion during periods of distress and reduce reported capitalisation at the worst possible time. Under Basel 2, which was introduced in 2008, so-called \"advanced\" banks like the majors were permitted to determine their own risk weights based on their forecasts of loan default rates and losses. Unsurprisingly, this resulted in a dramatic fall in risk-weighted assets and hence a fictional rise in their CET1 ratios. As Byres notes, the majors' shareholder funds as a proportion of their asset values has not changed since before the global financial crisis (we pointed that out in 2014).\nThe concern is that in the next recession default rates will inevitably jump to levels that are higher than banks are assuming (partly because we've had no bona fide housing corrections in the past 30 years), and computed risk weights will automatically rise, mechanically lowering CET1 ratios. Importantly, this fudging can never affect a leverage ratio because $1 dollar of equity and assets always remains $1 dollar of equity and assets.\nHere the impressively direct Byres cautioned that \"we need to be mindful that the strengthening of Australian risk-based capital ratios has not generated an equivalent strengthening of leverage ratios\". The following day he canvassed a related concern: while the majors look great when assessed on their CET1 ratios, the leverage ratio \"story is less positive\". \"The largest Australian banks compare less well on this measure to peers,\" Byres said. This is a profound point. In APRA's July 2015 study of the majors' capital ratios, it found that their average 4.2 per cent leverage ratio was remarkably below the 50th percentile of competing banks overseas. That is, they rank in the bottom half of the pack. The only solution to improving leverage ratios is boosting core equity (not hybrid or bail-in debt) capital. This is why Byers said on Tuesday and Wednesday that \"continuing to steadily accumulate capital looks to be a sensible strategy for a while yet\".\nMight get tougher Depending on where you sit in the majors' capital structure, the news gets better or worse. First, Byres warned that Basel 4's proposed rules, like minimum capital floors that Australian banks don't employ now, might adversely affect them \"to a proportionally greater extent than is the case in some other jurisdictions\". This means the threshold to becoming an \"unquestionably strong\" bank might get tougher again.\nThen Byres revealed that contrary to accepted best-practice since the global financial crisis the majors have not, in fact, reduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding sourced from overseas. His worry is that this accentuates the mismatches between their short-term liabilities and long-term assets (and solvency risks). The answer is to issue more long-term debt. The downside is that a major bank pays about 0.63 percentage points more in annual interest on a five-year bond than it does on one-year money. They will, therefore, have to cut deposit rates and/or lift loan rates further to offset higher funding costs.\nWhen this journey is complete the big four will rank among the safest banks in the world. Along the way we will see more equity issues, dividend reinvestment plans, asset sales, and repricings of their products. It's positive for debt securities and negative for equity.\nThe author is a director and shareholder in Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income investment portfolios.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-09-18T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:06:28.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
