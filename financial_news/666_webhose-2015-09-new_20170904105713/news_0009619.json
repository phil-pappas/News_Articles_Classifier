The aggressive upward push has brought prices to level unseen in a month, erasing in five weeks of losses in just five days of gains. Looking ahead, near-term resistance is now at 55.90, the 50% Fibonacci retracement, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the 61.8% level at 59.13. Alternatively, a move back below the 38.2% Fib at 52.67 opens the door for a challenge of the 23.6% retracement at 48.67. While the move higher is enjoying strong momentum, lasting follow-through seems questionable. The latest edition of the CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report shows last week’s pickup in net-long positioning came primarily from the unwinding of shorts rather than new buying interest. This paints current gains as corrective in the context of a longer-term descent rather than a sustained bullish trend change.
