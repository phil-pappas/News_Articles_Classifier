The tender price represents a 40 percent premium to its closing price of 124 naira on Tuesday, Guinness said in a statement. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Lagos-listed Guinness Nigeria, which has lost 25.5 percent so far this year, gained 5 percent to 131.48 naira each after the news, outperforming the broader stock index down 2.85 percent after JP Morgan's bond index expulsion moves. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the local brewer would continue to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange after the deal which is still subject to regulatory approvals. \nMultinationals from Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever (Amsterdam: UZ8.AS - news ) to British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) have bought more stakes in their Nigeria units, shrugging off the prospects of a weaker domestic economy and worries over a six-year old insurgency largely in the Muslim north. \nDiageo's intentions comes as pretax profits in Nigeria are falling, amidst rising competition particularly from rival brewer Heineken (Other OTC: HEINY - news ) and a consumer segment squeeze in the wake of dwindling government revenues after crude prices plunged. \nIndustry sources said Diageo was taking a bet on Nigeria's future given its relatively young population of 170 million people and the possible shift to a consumer-driven market from its economy's current reliance on the oil sector . \nLast week Guinness reported an 8 percent fall in pretax profit to 10.8 billion naira for 2015 and proposed a dividend. \n($1 = 199.00 naira) (Additional reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Jermey Gaunt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:56:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
