The third-largest U.S. bank by assets will invest in its equities franchise as it adapts to new rules designed to make the financial system more stable and less risky. Among the regulatory and legal changes, banks are now required to keep more capital. \nAfter spinning off non-core assets in the years following the economic downturn, Citi now hopes to profit from the retreats from equities of rivals such as Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) . Citi plans to court hedge funds more actively as part of its plan to beef up its equities market share. The shift in focus away from traditional asset managers to hedge funds could bring higher returns through fees. \nCiti will also revamp its trading technology, hire key executives, and expand research as part of its four-point plan. There is no word yet on how much the bank plans to spend as part of its rebuilding efforts, but it has hired John Lowrey to lead its electronic execution unit and former UBS ( UBS ) executive Adam Herrmann to head prime brokerage. Citi also added 11 analysts for its investment advisory business. \nThe last time Citi invested in its equities unit was in 2007, when the bank bought Automated Trading Desk for $680 million. New York City-based Citigroup provides financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Shares of Citigroup have fallen about 1% so far in 2015, but the stock has gained nearly 4% over the past year. In Monday's regular trading session, Citi shares are trading in the green, up about 0.5% shortly before the close.
