On completion of the acquisition, which is subject to approval by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, AGL will add a comprehensive range of financial and debt advisory services to JLL's existing real estate capital markets business, which is already the country's market leader following last year's acquisition of Tenzing. \nAGL, which was founded in 1994 and employs 15 people, has an outstanding track record of successfully advising more than 200 clients on strategic and operational real estate financing including debt management, treasury management, debt advisory, risk management and derivatives. \nDaniel Gorosch, Managing Director JLL Sweden, said: \"We are really excited by this further addition to our client service offering in Sweden. The AGL business makes an ideal complementary fit alongside JLL's existing Capital Markets capabilities, enabling the combined team of 45 to become a full service provider across the whole real estate capital stack, which means we can offer a truly comprehensive service package for our clients. Knowledge of the right financial solutions plays a greater role in today's world as international capital increases and as transactions become larger and more complex. This knowledge is a crucial factor for success in the real estate business.\" \nLinus Ericsson, CEO of AGL and incoming Head of Debt & Financial Advisory for JLL Sweden, said: \"I'm really looking forward to leading Debt & Financial Advisory for JLL in Sweden. Together we can see a great potential to further develop and sharpen our already great offers within JLL's strong local and international network. By combining our financial expertise with JLL's leading international real estate services platform, we can create offers that I believe will be of great benefit to our customers.\" \nRichard Bloxam, JLL's Head of EMEA Capital Markets, added: \"This is a terrific addition to our business in Sweden and also to our broader EMEA debt and financial advisory offer. The skills AGL will bring blend superbly with our existing service offer, strengthening our debt advisory capabilities and giving us new dimensions in treasury and risk management, derivatives advice and execution.\" \nIn addition to the AGL acquisition and last year's addition of the Tenzing business, JLL also acquired Nextport in April this year to expand its tenant representation and corporate real estate services platform in Sweden. Overall, JLL now employs 115 people in Sweden, of whom 45 are in its Capital Markets group. \nAGL is a securities company under the supervision of Finansinspektionen, Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority, and is authorised to conduct securities business under the Act (2007:528) regarding the securities market. This permit includes advice and trading of financial instruments. The acquisition is conditional upon the Financial Supervisory Authority's permission which is expected to be granted this autumn. An integration phase will then follow, with the AGL team relocating into JLL's existing Stockholm office at Birger Jarlsgatan 25. \nAbout JLL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:00:23.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
