How can I give people at least some of this feeling?” he recalls.\nUntil recently, simulating three dimensions on theater screens had been a trick primarily aimed at kids in fantasy, sci-fi, and animated movies. Think “Avatar,” “Jurassic World,” “Marvel’s Avengers.” Nobody can question the financial success of those blockbusters, but they also gave 3-D a particular kind of reputation for many filmgoers and filmmakers, as a gimmick best suited for simulating fantastical worlds that don’t really exist.\nMartin Scorsese’s “Hugo” in 2011, Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi” in 2012, and Alfonso Cuaron’s “Gravity” in 2013 showed that 3-D could draw adults into emotional films, though those movies still depicted imagined environments.\nENLARGE Director and producer Baltasar Kormákur on the set of ‘Everest’ Photo: Universal Pictures Mr. Kormákur thought 3-D could help tell a true story about the real world, the ill-fated 1996 Everest climbing expedition. The optical effect could help convey the gargantuan scale of the highest mountain on Earth, and, in turn, heighten the emotional impact for audiences by highlighting the risks the climbers confronted. Combined with the large-screen IMAX IMAX -1.06 % format, the 3-D depth could serve the movie’s narrative right along with other filmmaking elements: its ambitious camera work, sound, visual effects, and performances from a cast including Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin.\n“I fought pretty hard to do it,” says Mr. Kormákur, an Icelandic director whose English-language work includes action films “Contraband” and “2 Guns.” “This was [circa 2012] before ‘Gravity’ came out, and we didn’t have many adult movies playing in IMAX 3-D. It was all about superhero movies.”\nMr. Kormákur pitched the idea to producers as a subtler version of the 3-D that moviegoers associated with comic-book blockbusters: “I said it’s more like two-and-a-half-D. I’m not throwing things at people’s faces. It’s more to create volume inside the screen. I wasn’t looking for moments of surprising people, like ‘bah!’ It’s more like ‘oh...my...god,’ slowly. ‘This is high.’”\nWatch the trailer for “The Walk.” Later this month comes “The Walk,” another true story using 3-D and IMAX. The comedic drama features Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit, who in 1974 walked a tightrope between New York’s World Trade Center towers. It’s another “don’t look down” film where height and scale are at the core of the drama.\nDirector Robert Zemeckis labored to get “The Walk” made for more than a decade, and “from the absolute get-go, 3-D and large-screen were integral to his vision of the movie,” says Tom Rothman, a producer of the film and chairman of Sony Pictures motion picture group. The 2008 documentary “Man on Wire” won an Oscar telling the same story, but it didn’t put audiences precariously up on that wire, “walking in the sky between the then two tallest towers in the world,” Mr. Rothman says.\nRelated Reading When the World First Loved 3-D Movies (8/25/15) Why the World Is Watching ‘Gravity’ (10/17/13) Both films will premiere in IMAX and 3-D before opening in regular theaters (“Everest” Sept. 18, then the 25th; “The Walk” Sept. 30, then Oct. 9). Studios and theater operators appreciate 3-D and large-screen formats because they sell for a few dollars extra per ticket, adding volume to box-office grosses. And having adult-oriented movies for large-screen auditoriums helps exhibitors in another way. The films can be released during the fall, avoiding conflict with franchise blockbusters and helping IMAX keep its big rooms busy during what has historically been a slow period between summer and the holidays.\n“Those periods used to be kind of no-man’s-land,” says Greg Foster, CEO of IMAX Entertainment. IMAX, now up to around 1,000 screens world-wide, generally has one screen per movie complex.\nThe emerging dramatic films for large-format screens have grown partly out of the groundbreaking IMAX documentaries once relegated to science-museum rotundas, meant to offer views of nature’s grandeur that audiences couldn’t see before. One of the top IMAX documentaries of all time, in fact, is David Breashears’ 1998 “Everest.” (The link between filmmakers and Everest stretches to film’s early days; one of the first organized Everest expeditions ever, in 1924, was financed by John Baptist Lucius Noel, a British filmmaker who made a silent documentary about it, “The Epic of Everest.”)\nENLARGE Director Robert Zemeckis, left, with Sir Ben Kingsley, center, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt on the set of ‘The Walk’ Photo: TriStar Pictures But filmmakers are discovering more subtle potential in 3-D, as a device for telling stories and building emotion. Later this year come Ron Howard’s seafaring drama “In the Heart of the Sea” and Ridley Scott’s “The Martian,” both in 3-D and IMAX. Ang Lee, who directed “Life of Pi,” is in postproduction of “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime walk,” a 3-D film about soldiers having to return to Iraq after being celebrated as heroes at home.\nWim Wenders has embraced 3-D for his latest small film, “Everything Will Be Fine,” which makes its North American premiere this Friday at the Toronto International Film Festival and opens in theaters in December. It’s not about dizzying heights nor high adventure—it’s an intimate film about a traumatic car accident, starring James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Rachel McAdams.\nMr. Wenders, who adopted 3-D to film dance performances for his 2011 documentary about choreographer Pina Bausch, believes 3-D can get audiences closer to people, not just emphasize distance. He calls the technology an evolution in the language of film—he compares it to the advent of sound—and says it has been miscast in fantasy roles.\n“It’s for capturing reality,” he says. “What I’m trying to achieve is that you’re closer to people. You’re more immersed in their lives. Overcoming a trauma is a process that happens inside people. My feeling is that 3-D can really look into people’s soul.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK776_Everes_M_20150909172745.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK795_everes_P_20150910114401.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK795_everes_M_20150910114401.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK776_Everes_P_20150909172745.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:06:19.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
