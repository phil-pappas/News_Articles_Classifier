U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month Picture Benjamin Graham as a robot. Graham’s 1934 book, “Security Analysis,” with David Dodd, is widely viewed as the urtext of modern value investing. The long-held idea is that some stocks trade significantly below an identified “intrinsic value” and can be bought at a discount, with a built-in margin of safety against a complete washout.\nFor years, ETF investors have been able to buy value-screened versions of well-known indexes from S&P and FTSE Russell. Investors can choose from the broad $5 billion iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) or the $17 billion Vanguard Value (VTV), based on the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index, to narrower S&P Pure Value ETFs from Guggenheim or value ETFs based on First Trust’s AlphaDEX methodology.\nThe new breed Recently, however, as “smart beta” and fundamental indexing have captured investors’ imaginations, a new breed of value funds has emerged looking to prove their worth in investors’ portfolios.\nRanging from the highly concentrated Deep Value ETF (DVP) from Tiedemann Wealth Management to the Diamond Hill Valuation-Weighted 500 ETF (DHVW), each is grabbing on to various notions of how traditional value investors operate, while staying within the limitations of the ETF or index wrapper.\nThis includes a focus on tax efficiency, rules-based security selection and regular rebalancing and index reconstitution.\nThe more concentrated a value-focused portfolio gets—DVP includes only 20 stocks—the closer it can attempt to approximate the effect of a traditional value investor.\nENLARGE “Some things that have ‘value’ in their name couldn’t be more different,” says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ in New York. “There are already a lot of value ETFs out there, and these funds will have to prove themselves. While value investing is a long-term play, there have to be strong enough short-term periods to attract investors.”\nFor example, the largest holdings in the Vanguard Value ETF are Microsoft MSFT 0.49 % and Exxon Mobil , XOM 0.57 % both over 3% of the nearly 314 stocks. Yet, for a fund like Deep Value, nearly 9% is invested in both GameStop GME 1.65 % (GME) and Computer Sciences Corp. CSC 0.96 % (CSC).\n“Even the ‘boring’ value funds are way more complex than you might think,” says Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research for FactSet in San Francisco. “You can put rules around the process, but you still can’t claim that it will re-create the results of great value investors.”\nWesley Gray, portfolio manager at Alpha Architect, is willing to let his valuation process be judged by the market. In running the actively managed ValueShares U.S. Quantitative Value ETF (QVAL), Mr. Gray starts with a model based on an analysis of earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, relative to enterprise value (equity market capitalization plus debt net of cash) to pack 40 stocks at equal weight into an actively managed ETF.\nRelated Q&A with Microsoft’s Tren Griffin on value, index funds and Charlie Munger Even more extreme, the $112 million actively managed WBI Tactical Value ETF (WBIF) from WBI Investments currently holds 10 stocks and is 74% in cash.\nDiamond Hill’s Ric Dillon, on the other hand, uses an intrinsic-value model to assess the 700 largest U.S. stocks by market cap and hold the top 500 by intrinsic-value cap. The index is forward-looking and uses earnings estimates to project cash flow and terminal value after five years.\nIs it worth it? S&P Capital IQ’s Mr. Rosenbluth says such a diversified fund might have difficulty proving its value. “It may end up keeping up with the S&P 500 with less volatility, but there are already low- and minimum-volatility ETFs available.”\n“When you hear the term value, it’s easy to think that there is a clear and measurable meaning,” says FactSet’s Ms. Kashner. “But that’s not the case at all.”\nMs. Kashner says that the MSCI Quality Mix Index series, launched in 2013 citing a paper called “Buffett’s Alpha,” was a previous attempt at this new breed of value-investor-type strategy. ETFs from State Street Global Advisors on this series, however, have failed to attract any investor interest.\nShe emphasizes it is important for investors to understand the specific rules of the fund, how diversified the holdings are, and how frequently the fund rebalances and reconstitutes.\nMr. Weinberg is a writer in New York.
