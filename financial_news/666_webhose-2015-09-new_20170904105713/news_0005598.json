It will visit seven notable San Francisco chocolate shops, chocolate factories, and chocolate-loving restaurants and cafes. And if you’re still craving more chocolate, there are even more great chocolate goodies to explore in the neighborhood.\nHere are some luscious options for chocolate lovers in this chocolate tour:\nDynamo Donuts\nBegin the tour with a donut and coffee for breakfast in the sunny garden patio of Dynamo Donuts. This gourmet donut shop bakes small batches daily using local organic ingredients. The menu changes with the season, but certain classics like vanilla and chocolate are available year-round. Chocoholics will appreciate the variety of chocolate donuts. Recommended for this tour is the Spiced Chocolate Donut. Tossed in chipotle-cinnamon sugar, this dark-chocolate donut represents a synergy of the Mission’s culinary heritage and the latest trends. Dynamo Donuts also has other excellent chocolate donuts, including chocolate with Chocolate-Anise Glaze and gluten-free Chocolate with Raspberry-Black Pepper Glaze.\nMission Murals\nTake a Stroll to Admire the Mission Murals\nAfter your Dynamo breakfast stop, stroll around the neighborhood to discover the colorful ambience. The area is full of small shops and restaurants run by locals. Heading west on 24th Street, you’ll pass by a few interesting murals. At the corner of 24th and Florida streets is an impressive work that covers two sides of a building; the scenes depict the history of indigenous peoples and the Hispanic community. Continuing along 24th Street, notice the lovely painting of the Virgin Mary by Ernesto Paul at the building on the corner of 24th and Alabama Street. Just a few blocks further are Balmy Street is a narrow pedestrian alley covered with beautiful brightly painted murals. Adding to the charm are potted plants lining the sidewalk and fences trimmed in lush bougainvillea and flowering vines. Many of the murals illustrate powerful political and social justice themes.\nEl Metate\nMole for Lunch at El Metate\nFrom Balmy Street, head (east) back to Bryant Street and walk a few blocks north to El Metate Restaurant. This neighborhood restaurant is the real thing. The authentic Mexican dishes are made with love from the freshest local ingredients. Owner Francisco Hernandez follows his mom’s recipes and shops at the market early every morning. Many customers come here just for the chicken mole, which tastes like it was made by a Mexican grandmother. Hernandez learned from his mom and improved the recipe himself by toasting the spices. Hernandez makes both green (tomatillo-cilantro-jalapeño chile) and red (tomato-based) mole sauces from scratch in the traditional style. A key ingredient for both mole sauces is unsweetened cocoa powder which adds a rich flavour. Since the preparation is a time-consuming cooking process, the restaurant only offers mole a few times a week.\nChocolates at Charles Chocolates\nContinue the tour by walking back one block to Florida Street and head north until you arrive at Charles Chocolates. This artisanal chocolate maker is acclaimed for its European-style truffles. Charles Chocolates focuses on classic flavours like caramels and pralines. Customer favorites are the Fleur de Sel Caramels, the Peanut Praline Butterflies (made from fresh roasted peanuts) and the Milk Chocolate Caramel, a grown-up version of Rolo candy. Other highlights are the chocolate pastries, especially the Macadamia ‘Crack’ Tart featuring a buttery crust, chocolate ganache and gooey caramel, and the S’More made with a freshly baked graham cracker, dark chocolate and handmade vanilla marshmallow. You may enjoy the pastries and chocolates with coffee or tea while sitting on the outdoor patio, but keep in mind you should save room for the next three stops.\nVisit a Dandelion Chocolate\nHead west on 18th Street until arriving at Valencia Street where two wonderful stops await you. Spend some time at Dandelion Chocolate, a small-batch chocolate factory that’s part of the New American Chocolate Movement. This San Francisco-based company produces single-origin chocolate from bean to bar. Unlike industrial chocolate producers, Dandelion collaborates with farmers in various cocoa-producing regions all over the world. Then the beans are processed by hand at this local facility. You can take a tour and watch how the chocolate is produced from the roasting process and the grinding of the beans to the tempering of chocolate bars. Free tours of the chocolate factory are held at 6 p.m. on weeknights and 3 p.m. on Saturdays. This location also doubles as a café that serves outstanding house-made hot chocolate, Four Barrel coffee and pastries. Be sure to sample the spicy Mission hot chocolate or the European hot chocolate which is very dense in dark chocolate, in the Parisian style.\nDessert at Craftsman & Wolves\nNext door to Dandelion Chocolate is Craftsman and Wolves, an upscale bakery that caters to the Mission’s hipster crowd with its daring selection of exquisite patisserie. The avant-garde pastries feature innovative flavour combinations such as Chocolate-Raspberry Eclairs and Black Sesame Mandarin Chocolate Mousse Cake. The assortment is based on fresh ingredients and is updated constantly with the season. Craftsman and Wolves uses high-quality Valrhona chocolate in all of its chocolate desserts as well as in the chocolate chip cookies and the hot chocolate. Select a dessert that appeals to you and savor it in inside or at one of sidewalk tables.\nCocoa-Infused Cocktails at ABV\nFinally, celebrate a fabulous day of chocolate discovery with specialty cocktails at ABV. A favorite local hangout, this stylish bar makes some of the best craft cocktails in the Mission. The cocktails are mixed to perfection, served in chilled glasses and delicately garnished for added flair. To conclude your tour, try the Fogerty Cocktail that’s made with cocoa, rye, Campari and orange bitters.\n 24, 2015 5:32 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:21:08.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
