She most recently was global chief communications and brand marketing officer for Publicis Groupe’s Starcom Mediavest Group.\nMs. Hurvitz, who will be an executive vice president, is the latest hire by Turner Broadcasting Chairman and Chief Executive John Martin, to whom she will report. Since taking the reins at the Time Warner Inc. TWX 0.61 % unit in 2014, Mr. Martin has brought in several high-profile hires, including former Fox and NBC programming executive Kevin Reilly to oversee content for Turner’s TBS and TNT units .\nPhoto: Provided by Turner Broadcasting In a statement, Mr. Martin said Ms. Hurvitz’s experience in advertising, technology and cable will “strengthen the leadership team at Turner as we build on the momentum across our portfolio of brands and invest in our company’s next generation of growth and development.”\nSpecifically, Ms. Hurvitz will be responsible for “brand reputation” across Turner’s various platforms, which include CNN, TBS and TNT.\nTurner is in the midst of changing its programming strategies at many of its networks. Mr. Reilly is looking to develop edgier dramas and comedies for TNT and TBS that will attract a younger audience. At CNN, CEO Jeff Zucker has been programming more documentaries and series to make the news outlet less reliant on breaking news.\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KM384_cmohur_D_20150925135146.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:22:33.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
