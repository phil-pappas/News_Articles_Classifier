This may be an effort to protect his businesses as he deals with his debts. “Bankruptcy could give the star a chance to work through the lawsuits, restructure his business ventures, unload underperforming or overvalued assets, and eliminate unsecured debt,” Steinberg said.\nMost people who file bankruptcy, whether it be Chapter 7, 11 or 13, do so as a result of unforeseen events in their lives such as a loss of job, loss of spouse, or a major medical problem. According to Steinberg, even people who don’t have famous names to fall back on can and do survive bankruptcy stronger and more resilient. But regardless of why they have to file bankruptcy, most people use it as an opportunity to examine how they handle their finances and to learn from their past mistakes.\nUS Bankruptcy Court/District of Connecticut (Case No. 15-21233)\nAbout Mark S.
