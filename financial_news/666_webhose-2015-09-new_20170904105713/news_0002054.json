The program will be delivered in partnership with EverFi via its powerful financial literacy learning platform. The California Credit Union Financial Scholars Program is web-based, using the latest in new media technology – including simulations, avatars, gaming, and adaptive-pathing – to bring complex financial concepts to life for today’s digital generation. Through this platform, students in 10 high schools will cover scores of topics in personal finance, allowing them to become more informed, responsible citizens.\nCalifornia Credit Union will work with EverFi , to deliver the interactive financial management program to students at no cost to the schools.\n\"It is more important than ever to arm young people with the skills to navigate an increasingly complex financial landscape,” said Ron McDaniel, CEO of California Credit Union. \"We hope students take full advantage of this innovative educational experience that uses the tools they love – digital learning and gaming – to explain these important topics.\"\nThe Financial Scholars program, a 10-unit course offers approximately six hours of instruction aimed at teaching, assessing and certifying students in a variety of relevant financial topics. These include credit scores, insurance, credit cards, student loans, mortgages, taxes, stocks, savings, 401k accounts and other critical concepts that map to national financial literacy standards.\nThe platform tracks the progress and score of every student and provides students who successfully complete the course with Certification in Financial Literacy, a valuable mark of distinction on college applications and resumes.\n“EverFi technology is literally transforming how students learn, and we are incredibly grateful for the public-private partnerships that make this possible,” said EverFi CEO Tom Davidson. “California Credit Union is critical to the success of our mission to ensure that these cutting-edge tools reach all communities.”\nThe California Credit Union Financial Scholars Program will roll out this fall.\nAbout California Credit Union\nCalifornia Credit Union is a federally insured, state chartered credit union founded in 1933 that serves all California public or private school employees, as well as their relatives, members of the student body, and other related organizations.
