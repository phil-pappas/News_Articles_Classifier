Touted as one of the largest irrigation assets in the country, the farms have 12,800 hectares of irrigated land and 7,860 hectares of wheat planted in 2015. According to a 2009 submission to the Productivity Commission, they produced over 35,000 tonnes of wheat and 11,000 bales of cotton in 2008/09. After five years of farming, Eastern put the farms on the market in September 2013 and November 2014. The lead director of the company, Matthew Bickford-Smith said at the time that some of its investors had asked the company to test the market to gauge the value of the lands. The latest market offer comes during a time of weak cotton prices and dry conditions in rural Queensland. Realtors Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers International have been appointed to market the portfolio.
