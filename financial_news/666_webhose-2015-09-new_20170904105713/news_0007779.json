The underground expansion of the project, which will take between five and seven years and where 80 per cent of the mine value lies, was resuscitated in May after an almost three-year dispute was settled between the company and the Mongolian government, which were seeking a better deal.\nA worker at Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine, one of the world's richest copper deposits. Photo: Supplied\nIn a further step forward, Mongolian government agencies this week agreed to accept a key feasibility study for the project which would allow Rio Tinto and its partners to progress talks with its lenders to recommit to a $US4 billion project finance deal, which had lapsed during the delay.\nMr Kinnell said he expected to sign the renewed project finance deal with the miner's consortium of banks in November. As well as securing finance for the project, Rio Tinto must still strike an electricity deal and obtain other permits from the government before starting construction.\nIn the more than two years of stop-start talks, which not only halted the expansion of the mine but also deterred potential foreign investors in Mongolia, copper prices have fallen to six-year lows.\nChina, which accounts for 40 per cent of global copper demand, is grappling with overcapacity, a downturn in construction and property investment and a volatile stock market. Many economists expect economic growth to fall short of Beijing's official target of about 7 per cent for this year.\nBut Rio Tinto, which has raised eyebrows for what some consider overly optimistic forecasts for ongoing Chinese steel demand, is similarly bullish on the country's appetite for copper. The red metal is used in everything from power lines to wind farms and electronics, and is seen as a barometer for global economic growth.\n\"This year is worse than the last,\" Shanghai Ganglian commodities analyst Li Yu said. \"The speed of supply growth is obviously much faster than the growth of need.\"\nInvestment in China's power grid has shrunk significantly, Mr Li said, in part due to a shift in government policy and the suspension of large projects due to indecision caused by the country's ongoing anti-corruption campaign. \"China's power industry consumes 60 per cent of copper. If investment in this sector shrinks, we can't expect growth in the copper industry.\"\nBut Mr Kinnell said the long-run fundamentals of copper remained robust despite the near-term volatility and said the trend toward urbanisation and electrification in other nations, as well as the resurgent US economy would keep demand strong even with moderating Chinese economic growth.\nThe reporter travelled to Oyu Tolgoi as a guest of Rio Tinto", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/rios-6b-mongolia-project-mired-in-tax-dispute-20140814-103vs7.html"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T22:45:14.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
