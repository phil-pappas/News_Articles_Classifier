Its final decision is due in December. The U.S International Trade Commission must also rule on the duties before they can take effect.\n(Reporting by Krista Hughes ; Editing by Bernadette Baum )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:01:56.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
