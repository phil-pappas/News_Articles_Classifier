This will enhance the airline's profitability in the long run,\" Nzahabwanimana said. \nJohn Mirenge, the RwandAir chief executive, said the deal reaffirms the airline's efforts to contribute to national economic development. \n\"The deal is proof of good micro- and micro-economic management and our reliability, passenger comfort, versatility and fuel efficiency, which will enhance our competitiveness in Africa and beyond,\" Mirenge said. \nThe acquisition of these two wide-body aircraft will significantly increase RwandAir's capacity to effectively meet growing demand and provide exceptional service quality for the ever-growing Asia-China and European passenger markets, he added. \nChristopher Buckley, the Airbus's executive vice-president for Africa, Europe and Asia Pacific, said the deal reaffirms the confidence between RwandAir and the manufacturer, which the two can now leverage to grow and thrive in aviation business. \nRecently, both RwandAir and the Eastern and Southern Africa Bank (PTA Bank) signed a financial line of credit worth $160m to support the purchase of the two airlines. \nThere is hope that with two wide body aircraft, the airline's capacity could grow from the current 500,000 passengers annually to more than 3 million in the next five years. \nThe two airlines will see RwandAir fleet grow to 12 planes. \nThe national carrier was early this year recognised as one of the safest airlines by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) after passing the operational safety audit (IOSA). \nIt later became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), joining a club of 250 member airlines in more than 150 countries. \nThe airline flies to more than 18 destinations, including Nairobi, Entebbe, Mombasa, Bujumbura, Lusaka, Juba, Douala, Dar-es-salaam, Kilimanjalo, Johannesburg, Dubai, Lagos, Libreville and Brazzaville, among others.
