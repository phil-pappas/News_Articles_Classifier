The stockpile will shrink by $40 billion a month for the rest of 2015, partly due to efforts to prop up the yuan, according to a Bloomberg survey conducted in August.\n“The pile may already have dropped by as much as $200 billion in the last few weeks of August,” Every said, adding that he expects the yuan to decline to 7 against the greenback by the end of this year, from about 6.4 now. “In 2016, if China’s economic fundamentals do not improve and the U.S. continues to tighten monetary policy, then a further slide to as far as 7.50 and beyond is not out of the question.”\nThe People’s Bank of China has set stronger daily reference rates for the yuan and intervened in the spot and swap markets to prop up the currency\nsince an Aug. 11 devaluation. It has also imposed a 20 percent reserve requirement on financial institutions trading in foreign-exchange forwards for clients, effective Oct. 15, according to people familiar with the matter. The value of yuan forwards transactions was $51.1 billion in July, compared with $698 billion in the spot market.\nStability Signal \"The new rule makes speculating on the yuan’s decline more expensive in the foreign-exchange forwards market,\" said Banny Lam, co-head of research at Agricultural Bank of China International Securities in Hong Kong. \"This is a new signal the PBOC has sent, on top of stronger fixings, that it prefers a stable yuan and the currency’s one-off devaluation is over.\"\nThe onshore yuan, which can trade a maximum 2 percent on either side of the PBOC’s fixing, was little changed 6.3651 as of 11:14 a.m. in Shanghai on Wednesday, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. It rose 0.74 percent in the five days through Tuesday after plunging 3 percent in the three days following the devaluation. The freely-traded offshore yuan in Hong Kong declined 0.18 percent to 6.4356, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe PBOC on Wednesday raised its daily fixing by 0.21 percent to 6.3619 a dollar, the strongest level since Aug. 12. That brings its four-day increase to 0.7 percent. Chinese financial markets will be closed Thursday through Sunday as the nation celebrates the victory in World War II.\nChina’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s biggest stockpile, have slumped $315 billion in the year through July to $3.65 trillion. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that every 1 percent drop in the yuan triggers about $40 billion of outflows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T07:18:37.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
