The economy grew 7.3 percent last year.\n\"China's economy will not see a hard landing\" he told a gathering of the World Economic Forum in Dalian in northeastern China.\n\"Once there are signs of economy slipping out of the reasonable range, we will be fully capable of handling (the situation).\"\nThe economic signs are gloomy. After Li spoke, a report showed auto sales in China were flat in the first eight months of the year, raising the spectre of the market's first contraction since the late 1990s.\nGlobal markets' worries about Beijing's handling of the economy and its currency have been exacerbated by China's attempts to stem the slide in its equity markets. Despite a barrage of policies to support stock prices and push out speculators, its equity markets have fallen around 40 percent since June.\nThe past two days though have seen Chinese stocks push higher, with the positive sentiment feeding into other major equity markets around the world. Still, that optimism was waning on Thursday, with share prices back in the red.\nThe CSI300 index of the biggest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen ended down 1.23 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index was 1.45 percent lower.
