The other is David Mackay. by Simon Evans The exit of Christine Cross from the Woolworths boardroom after less than four years has led some in the market to muse whether the highly regarded former Tesco executive may have worn some of the negativity surrounding the sudden departure of BIG W chief executive Alistair McGeorge five weeks ago .\nMs Cross and fellow Woolworths director David Mackay, a former Kellogg executive globally, are both stepping aside from the Woolworths board as new chairman Gordon Cairns puts his stamp on the boardroom after taking over on September 1. Mr Mackay joined the Woolworths board at the same time as Ms Cross, in January 2012.\nMs Cross is also a director of Brambles and retailer Kathmandu, and Mr Cairns said both of the departing directors had \"brought considerable international retailing\" and fast-moving consumer goods experience to the Woolworths board.\nMr Cairns said both of them had \"heavy commitments\" in Australia and overseas, and had decided it was time to stand aside to allow further board renewal to take place.\nMr Cairns took over from Ralph Waters on September 1 in the major plank of board renewal, and he's also looking for a new chief executive to replace Grant O'Brien who officially announced he was departing in mid-June after a serious slump in the supermarkets business, and big losses at the Masters hardware chain.\nMr McGeorge departed in mysterious circumstances and returned to Britain in late August this year after a staff complaint about his behaviour.\nWoolworths said he had resigned for health reasons. He had been chief executive of BIG W for just 14 months, and before that had been consulting to BIG W.\nHe was a friend of Ms Cross, who several months ago was touted as a possible successor to Mr Waters as Woolworths chairman.\n Mr McGeorge was previously a chairman of British fashion retailer New Look, and had a strong reputation as a turnaround expert in the retail sector.\nBritish specialist retailing publication Retail Week in an article in 2013 Quote: d Ms Cross as saying Mr McGeorge was \"an excellent, well-rounded retail chief executive\" with a grasp of the financial side of things in retail, along with good strategic and commercial skills.\nMr Cairns said Woolworths was \"committed to ensuring a strong and diverse board\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:45:50.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
