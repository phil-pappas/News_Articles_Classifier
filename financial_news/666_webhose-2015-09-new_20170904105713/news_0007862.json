The final spot, which is next to H&M, is understood to have been leased to Zara Home. It is expected to open next year.\nAdvertisement Telco giant Microsoft is opening in Pitt Street at the main entrance to the mall on the combined sites of the former Guess and Cue stores.\nH&M took the keys to the store at 150 Pitt Street at the end of July. It is the anchor tenant to the $30 million redevelopment of the former Glasshouse arcade. It is expected the building will continue to be called the Glasshouse aracde.\nH&M's distinctive red sign will adorn the historic facade of the building but the interior of the L-shaped pedestrian mall between King Street and Pitt Street will be transformed.\nThe second-biggest retail chain in the world behind Zara, H&M will occupy three retail levels – 5000 square metres – within the Glasshouse site..\nThe former Glasshouse building, owned by developer Stockland and the Investa Commercial Property Fund, has been a hive of activity for more than a year. The older arcade was demolished, land was made even and new flooring and load-bearing beams were installed.\nMost of the heavy lifting was done at night as the large cranes in King Street and Pitt Street Mall from 11pm were moved before the morning rush hour.\nH&M has a store in Melbourne's former GPO and in the AMP Shopping Centre's Macquarie Centre in North Ryde, Sydney, but the new CBD store will also offer homewares and a bigger range of accessories and fast fashion.\nAnother new CBD entry – in the soon-to-be-revamped Martin Place – is German luxury luggage brand, Rimowa​, which is to open its doors in Australia in November.\nRimowa's flagship store will be in the newly developed 5 Martin Place. Hunt, which holds the licence, also holds the Longchamp​ brand exclusively in Australia.\nRimowa, which offers luggage that matches the colour of one's Porsche, will open in the 100-square-metres store, next to the H&M-owned Collection of Style and Canadian luxury retailer Kit and Ace.\nCologne-based Rimowa sells products in more than 60 countries via selected dealers, its own boutiques and flagship stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:39:42.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
