Sept 24 (Reuters) - Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc will pay Orbital ATK $50 million to settle a dispute stemming from an Antares rocket launch accident last year that destroyed a load of cargo bound for the International Space Station, Aerojet said on Thursday.\nThe company also said it would take title to 10 AJ-26 rocket engines previously earmarked for Orbital, one of two companies hired by NASA to fly cargo to the station after the agency retired its space shuttles.\nOrbital successfully flew two of eight planned missions under its original $1.9 billion contract with NASA before the Oct. 28, 2014, accident from Wallops Island, Virginia.\nA final report on the botched mission is pending, though the companies have publicly disagreed about whether an engine manufacturing problem by Aerojet and/or mishandling of the engine during processing by Orbital triggered the explosion.\nAerojet declined to release any details about the settlement.\n\"All the data related to the analysis is proprietary,\" Aerojet spokesman Glenn Mahone told Reuters.\nOrbital did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nNews of the payment marks another setback for Aerojet days after United Launch Alliance dumped the company as its solid rocket motor supplier. Instead, the joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co signed a long-term deal with Orbital ATK, effective in 2019.\nULA and its owners last week rejected a $2 billion cash offer by Aerojet, which is racing to cut costs and drum up orders for its space business.\nAn undisclosed part of the one-time, $50 million payment will be covered by insurance, Mahone said, adding that the money will be paid by Sept. 30.\nThe settlement formally ends Aerojet's involvement in the Antares rocket program. Orbital last year decided to speed up a previously planned engine replacement program and is working toward a March 2016 debut of the revamped rocket.\nOrbital also has purchased two Atlas rocket launches from ULA to fly a pair of Cygnus cargo ships to the station to help bridge the gap.\nNASA's second cargo line, operated by privately owned SpaceX, also is temporarily grounded due to an unrelated accident of its Falcon 9 rocket in June.\nThe station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, is also serviced by Russian and Japanese freighters.\nAerojet shares closed 11 cents lower at $17.44 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, well below a year-high of $24.35 reached in July.
