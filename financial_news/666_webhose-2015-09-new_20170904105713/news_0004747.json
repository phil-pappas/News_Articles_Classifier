While he travelled through the nation and abroad, he realized that the quality of vegetables and fruits in NCR is not something close to nature fresh. His keen interest towards farming drove him reach out to the farmers and understand the gap in the market. Before quitting Barclays Capital as Assistant Vice President, in his pursuit, he visited over 250 villages and spoke to farmers about the whole establishment of the farming business. Kundan conceived the idea of Eden Bag as an answer to the pain points of both farmers and consumers. His idea is to develop an ecosystem for the farming business where produce from the farms is directly sold to the people in urban cities. Eden Bag vision is to convert pain points and challenges of the end consumer to a great opportunity for the farmers.\n 15, 2015 8:38 am", "external_links": ["http://www.edenbag.com/"], "published": "2015-09-15T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T22:24:34.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
