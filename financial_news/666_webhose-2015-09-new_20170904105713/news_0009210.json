These include new plantation establishment, rehabilitation of abandoned and derelict plantations, investments in more efficient mills and refineries as well as innovative smallholder initiatives. \nThe growing oil palm sector could contribute significantly to economic development and help alleviate rural poverty. At the same time, the expanding sector could come with significant social and environmental impacts, unless adequate safeguards are put in place. \nThe RSPO provides an opportunity to address the social and environmental impacts of oil palm production. \nThe RSPO is a non-profit association that brings together palm oil producers, processors, traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks, investors, and environmental and social non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to develop and implement a global standard for sustainable palm oil production. \nThough the Roundtable is still relatively new in Africa, many growers are beginning to adopt the best practice guidelines contained in the standard. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:32:52.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
