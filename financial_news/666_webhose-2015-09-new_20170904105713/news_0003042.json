The billionaire businessman has lambasted Bush with a flurry of personal attacks. \nUnder his tax reform plan, Bush would reduce individual tax rates to three: 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent. Currently, there are seven tax brackets, ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent. Bush said 15 million people would not pay any tax under his plan. \nHe proposes doubling the standard deduction, eliminating the marriage penalty, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and ending the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. He also would end the employee's share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers 67 and older. \nBush wants to reduce the corporate income tax from 35 percent — among the highest in the world — to 20 percent and give businesses the chance to deduct new capital investments immediately. He also wants to eliminate the interest on business loans. \nDemocrats called the plan \"more trickle-down Bush economics.\" \n\"Bush is embracing a disastrous economic agenda that benefits himself, and those like himself, while leaving the middle class out to dry,\" said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. \nBush will offer more details on his tax reform plan during a trip Wednesday to North Carolina, where he will visit a manufacturing firm to show how small businesses would benefit from his proposal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:29:24.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
