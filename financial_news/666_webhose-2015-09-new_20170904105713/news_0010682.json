Ralph Lauren Net Worth New York City: The Epicenter of the Global Fashion Industry \nEven after Fashion Week 2015 comes to a close, New York City’s economy will benefit from the fashion industry. After all, the New York City fashion industry is a $98 billion industry \nWith more than 900 fashion companies headquartered in the Big Apple, the city’s fashion industry employs 180,000 people — that’s 6 percent of the city’s workforce, according to the NYCEDC. Thanks to New York City’s fashion industry workforce, the city receives $2 billion in tax revenue from $10.9 billion in total wages. It’s safe to say the city is indeed the fashion capital of the world. \nNew York City has “eclipsed London, Paris and Milan” as the fashion headquarters of the globe, according to Maloney’s report. It’s even “reshoring,” or creating jobs, in the city that had moved jobs overseas. The economic benefits to the city and its residents include $18 billion dollars in retail sales annually, more than $72 billion dollars in wholesale sales annually and $8 billion dollars in manufacturing sales, according to the NYCEDC . \nTo maximize the economic benefits, the government is tripling its investment in New York’s fashion industry. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in February that the city will increase its investment from $5 million to $15 million with programs designed to support manufacturers, young designers and students, reports the Observer. \nMore importantly, New York Fashion Week offers a global branding opportunity that “reaffirms the Big Apple as the epicenter of the global fashion industry,” said John Boyd, founder of The Boyd Company , a leading internationally recognized company in corporate site selection with clients such as JP Morgan Chase and PepsiCo. “It emphasizes the branding value of the city based on its financial, high-tech and cultural uniqueness.” \nBoyd also explained that “60 percent of the world’s millennials live in Asia, and there is a huge appetite among the Asian middle class for U.S.-branded products.” Without a doubt, Fashion Week “fuels global demand for American style and culture.” \nRead: Fashion Week 2015 Runway: Michael Kors Net Worth Vs.

He believes Fashion Week has turned into a “celebrity circus” over the years. \n“It diverted from its origins as an event where designers showcase their wares to buyers from around the world …” he said. The high-profile nature of today’s New York Fashion Week became the norm when IMG began producing Fashion Week. \nHowever, Dunham predicts New York Fashion Week 2015 will be more about the designers and the buyers to benefit the New York fashion industry. He also emphasized the value of Fashion Week. “Without Fashion Week,” he said, “the design industry in New York would be encouraged to relocate to other fashion centers, like Paris or Milan.” New York Fashion Week 2015 Ticket Prices \nTickets to most traditional shows are typically only for the press and buyers, and they’re usually invitation-only. But according to NewYorkFashionWeekLive.com, there are open-to-the-public shows that might require a ticket purchase. \nFor those who want to revel in the glitz and glamour, be warned: a VIP ticket will likely cost you thousands of dollars, according to VIP Concierge, Inc. Here’s how much it would cost to go to some of the famous designer shows: BCBG: $1,750", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:49:13.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
