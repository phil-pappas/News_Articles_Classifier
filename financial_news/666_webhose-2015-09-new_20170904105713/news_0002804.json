Lavasoft’s top priority has always been its users’ privacy – making confidentiality the most important part of its business.\n“Lavasoft exists to help customers preserve their privacy and protect their data from falling into the wrong hands. This is the driving force behind everything we do, and that will never change,” said Daniel Assouline, CEO at Lavasoft. “To that end we do not and will not share any customer data with any third parties. Our users can trust that will always be the case no matter which of our products they’re running.”\nToday, consumers are expected to enter their personal information when signing up for new products or services -- including credit card numbers, email addresses and phone numbers, etc. Each of these come with a privacy policy—however, more often than not, consumers click “accept” without reading through the lengthy privacy policy. Later, they may find their personal information is being gathered by the respective companies and sold to third parties.\nSince 1999, Lavasoft has held firm to not sell personal and or non-personal data to any third parties, including advertisers.\nAs stated in its policy,\n“Lavasoft will not share Your Personal Information with any third party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or if Lavasoft receives your prior permission. Please note in this respect that Lavasoft uses third party hosting service providers for the provision of the Lavasoft Sites and that Lavasoft uses third party service providers for the provision of certain services offered through the Lavasoft Sites, including but not limited to e-mail marketing campaigns, provisions of Lavasoft newsletters, press releases and/or special offers.”\nTo read more, visit Lavasoft’s privacy policy page here .\n“Lavasoft’s focus on privacy has not changed since its founding in 1999 and we will continue to uphold the same privacy standards moving forward,” said Assouline. “As vendors update their privacy policies at length, consumers should educate themselves, and keep a close eye on these changes.”\nAbout Lavasoft\nLavasoft is the maker of Ad-Aware, the world’s No. 1 free antivirus software.
