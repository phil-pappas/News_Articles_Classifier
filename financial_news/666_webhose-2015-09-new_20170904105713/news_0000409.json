For most of her 11 years as chief of the Jena Band of Choctaws, the only funds for her 325-member tribe were meager federal handouts and a tiny profit from a liquor store called Twisted Feather.\nThat was before the Jena Choctaw Pines Casino opened along a country highway in Dry Prong, Louisiana, a football-field-size building featuring a poker room and more than 700 slot machines with names like “Zombie Outbreak” and “Conga Party.” Now, less than three years later, she can provide stipends for college students and pay utility bills for the elderly. There’s even enough for every member to get a $500 birthday check.\nAfter more than a decade’s struggle to secure land and financing, the Jenas built their $30 million gambling den thanks to a high-priced loan from New York-based hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management. More than half of the casino’s profits go to the firm. After other creditors get their portion, the tribe is left with less than 10 percent of the take. Smith isn’t complaining.\nDan Och\nPhotographer: Rick Maiman/Bloomberg “They came to our tribe when nobody else would and took a chance on us,” she said of Och-Ziff, the $46 billion hedge-fund firm run by ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader Dan Och. “With the little money we have gotten so far, we have done good things.”\nAs Wall Street haggles over ever-more-expensive office and apartment buildings, Och-Ziff is putting its real estate dollars into American Indian casinos. Over the past eight years, the firm has become one of the largest nonbank financiers to tribes, backing casinos and hotels in Oklahoma and Ohio, as well as Louisiana. It’s working on a new project in California and owns thousands of slot machines.\n‘Large Marketplace’ It’s an investment niche that can earn more than high-yield bonds and has helped an Och-Ziff real estate fund produce returns of almost 23 percent annually from 2011 through June, according to filings. About $250 million, a fifth of its invested real estate capital, is in tribal gaming.\n“We looked around at commercial real estate in 2006 and 2007 and saw it was overvalued,” said Steve Orbuch, head of Och-Ziff’s real estate group. “What we liked about tribal gaming was that it was a large marketplace with $25 billion a year in revenue, and yet it wasn’t open for lending from traditional sources.”\nThat’s because banks usually don’t lend money for new Indian casino projects. Transactions with tribes whose land is in a government trust are complicated, since no structure built there can be mortgaged. The 566 federally recognized tribes in the U.S. are also sovereign nations that can’t be sued for nonpayment unless they waive that right.\nOch-Ziff’s most valuable tribal relationship is with the 60,000-member Chickasaw Nation. The tribe is unwilling to give up sovereignty, even if it costs millions of dollars more to borrow money. Bankers and scholars say it’s a legacy of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forced the Chickasaws and four other tribes, including the Choctaws, onto the Trail of Tears that led out of their ancestral homeland in the southern U.S. into present-day Oklahoma.\nChickasaw Casino Drive 80 miles north from Dallas, just across the Oklahoma border to Thackerville (pop. 463), and you’ll come upon the largest casino in the world by number of gaming positions. The WinStar World Casino and Resort, the crown jewel of the Chickasaw Nation, boasts the equivalent of five city blocks of gaming space with about 7,500 slot machines to entertain the 3.6 million annual visitors.\nWinStar was Och-Ziff’s first Indian venture. The hedge fund helped finance the casino’s expansion in 2007, making a name for itself as a funding source for tribes that couldn’t get traditional loans. While Orbuch and Chickasaw officials declined to discuss specifics of their arrangement, bankers, consultants and other tribes provided details of how nonbank lenders, including Och-Ziff, operate.\nWinStar World Casino and Resort\nPhotographer: Peter Malinowski/InSite via Koch Communications Och-Ziff offers loans with annual rates as high as 15 percent to be paid back in about five to seven years, according to people familiar with the deals. They’re the kind of loans you’d only get if you had no better option. The high interest payments usually motivate borrowers to refinance with bank loans as soon as they can, typically within two to four years, bringing rates down below 5 percent, bankers said.\nSince investors can’t by law share in the equity of the businesses on tribal land or use buildings on reservations as collateral for debt, their only claims are to the revenue generated from gaming or other businesses.\nSlot Machines At WinStar, Och-Ziff owns about one-third of the slot machines, which can cost as much as $20,000, and leases them back to the Chickasaws. Each machine can make $150 a day in pennies, nickels, dimes and dollars after payouts, consultants say. Och-Ziff and the tribe declined to disclose their split, but it’s common when leasing out a slot machine to receive about 20 percent of the net revenue. That would mean a haul of $27 million a year for the 2,500 machines at WinStar.\nThe hedge fund also financed the construction of three hotel towers with 1,400 rooms on nontribal land, connected to the casino, which cost about $200 million. As they do with the slot machines, the Chickasaws lease the hotels from Och-Ziff.\nAbout 40 percent of the recognized tribes have gaming operations, according to the National Indian Gaming Commission. Their revenues jumped to $29 billion last year from $121 million in 1988, the year Congress passed a law regulating gambling on Indian land.\nWhile tribal revenue is increasing, Och-Ziff’s gaming profits may be tough to sustain. Competition from other lenders, including some tribes, and a glut of casinos in some parts of the country is making the business more of a crapshoot.\nA federal investigation centering on whether Och-Ziff’s dealings with a Libyan sovereign-wealth fund violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could crimp the firm’s off-reservation gambling ambitions if the probe leads to legal action, according to half a dozen lawyers who specialize in gaming law. That’s because most states wouldn’t want to give licenses to operators whose financial backers have been charged, they say. A spokesman for Och-Ziff, which disclosed the inquiry in a filing last year, declined to comment.\nWaiving Sovereignty The largest tribes, which have gambling operations that produce more than enough cash to cover loans and don’t mind waiving some sovereignty, don’t need Och-Ziff’s money. They have access to credit from big banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp.\nThe Cherokee Nation, the largest tribe in the U.S. with about 10 casinos in Oklahoma, has a $1 billion budget and a revolving line of credit with regional banks, said Cherokee Principal Chief Bill John Baker. It has had access to funds from financial institutions since 2008.\nOther funds including Summit Partners and Brigade Capital Management also have provided tribal financing, sometimes buying casino bonds and bank debt.\nSome lenders have gotten burned. The giant Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, run by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, defaulted on more than $2 billion of bonds in 2009 and spent almost four years restructuring its debt. Because U.S. bankruptcy law doesn’t apply to a sovereign nation, there was no bankruptcy judge to streamline the negotiations. In February, Fitch Ratings said the tribe may be forced to restructure again.\nWealthier tribes are taking a page from Och-Ziff’s playbook and lending to smaller players. Their terms may be better than what hedge funds are offering, said Kristi Jackson, whose firm Tribal Financial Advisors helps Indians raise money. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, which owns two casinos, a hotel, golf course and natural grocery store south of Minnesota’s Twin Cities, has made $500 million in loans to other tribes for economic and infrastructure development projects, including casinos, since 1996.\n‘Wonderful Thing’ For Smith, the Jena Choctaw chief, the whir of slot machines has enabled the tribe to buy books for college students and provide an annual stipend of $1,000 to every adult member. Smith, 61, who visits the casino once a week, playing electronic games and eating at JD’s Harvest Buffet, said the tribe wants to open a small hotel. It’s also in the process of refinancing its loans from Och-Ziff, on which it’s paying an interest rate of about 15 percent, with a bank loan Smith expects will be less than 4 percent.\n“It’s such a wonderful thing,” Smith said. “Five years ago nobody would touch us, and now we have the largest banks talking to us.”\nOch-Ziff, one of the largest alternative money managers in the world and one of the few publicly traded hedge funds, will still be making money. It owns half of the slot machines at the Pines Casino, which it leases to the tribe for 20 percent of the net revenue.\n“And they deserve it,” Smith said. To her, the relationship has become personal. She calls Mark Schwartz, an executive in Och-Ziff’s real estate group, a close friend. He brings her pictures of his baby when he visits to check on the investment. “Even though the tribe is refinancing this year,” she said, “there’s a possibility that Och-Ziff will come forward again. I see nothing but growth for the Jena Band.”", "external_links": ["http://www.jenachoctawpinescasino.com/\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:33:14.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
