This new partnership gives CMH access to new resources that will allow it to strengthen its operations, and enhance and expand its services to meet the evolving healthcare needs of communities throughout southeast Indiana. \n“This is an exciting day for Clark Memorial, our team members, physicians and patients,” said Martin Padgett, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of CMH. “Our team spent the last several months analyzing this partnership to ensure it is the right fit for our hospital and the communities we serve. That process only strengthened our belief that Norton Healthcare and LifePoint Health are the ideal strategic partners for us. We are delighted to officially join Regional Health Network.” \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Regional Health Network will invest a minimum of $80 million in capital and technology improvements at CMH over the next 10 years. Regional Health Network also has provided sufficient funding to retire the hospital’s debt, including its pension obligations. \n“This is an exciting milestone in our relationship with Clark Memorial, and we are delighted to welcome the hospital to Regional Health Network,” said Russell Cox, president of Norton Healthcare. “Norton has had the privilege of working alongside Clark Memorial for many years and witnessed firsthand the outstanding efforts of its leadership, team members, physicians and volunteers. I see even greater opportunity to grow the hospital working together with LifePoint in the months and years to come.” \nAs part of the acquisition, Regional Health Network offered employment to all active CMH team members and assumed all physician contracts. It has adopted CMH’s charity care policies and will create a board with members from CMH, Regional Health Network and the community to ensure a local voice in the strategic direction of the hospital. \n“Clark Memorial Hospital provides exceptional care and service to its community,” said William F. Carpenter III, chairman and CEO of LifePoint Health. “The hospital’s commitment to quality and being a place where people choose to come for care, physicians want to practice and employees want to work is part of what attracted us to it. Our cultural alignment and shared focus on making communities healthier will allow us to transform healthcare delivery in this region.” \nThe new partnership offers many benefits to Clark County and surrounding areas. As part of Regional Health Network, CMH is becoming a tax-paying entity, which will support the local community. \nThe agreement of CMH by Regional Health Network was reviewed and approved by the Clark County Council and Commissioners during a public meeting on July 23. \nAbout Clark Memorial Hospital \nSince 1922, Clark Memorial Hospital has provided superior health services to the residents of southern Indiana.
