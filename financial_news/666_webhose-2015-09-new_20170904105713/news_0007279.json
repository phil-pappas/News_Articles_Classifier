Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Andrew Taylor At 4000 metres above sea level it's the size of a man's pom-pom, not just the oxygen-depleted atmosphere, that takes a girl's breath away.\nMany of the younger inhabitants of Taquile Island, on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca, have Facebook profiles, but dating apps hold little sway in this rarefied atmosphere, our genial guide Armando says.\nInstead, romantic success is determined by the click-clack of knitting needles, as befits a culture whose textile art was declared one of the world's masterpieces of cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2005.\n\"The first present they get is not a Playstation or iPhone,\" Armando says. \"It is the knitting needle. This will be the first present for a little boy.\"\nTitilaka is a luxury hotel on the shores of Lake Titicaca. With the snow-capped peaks of Bolivia's Cordillera Real Mountains as a backdrop, he introduces the dashing Roberto, whose skill with needles and a ball of yarn would put members of the Country Women's Association to shame.\nAs the young Roberto matured into manhood he knitted ever-more elaborate headwear, until he graduated to a patterned beanie that denotes his married status.\nWith a deadpan look on his face, Armando adds: \"The moment when the pom-pom on his hat is increasing, it's getting bigger, it tells everybody he's looking for love.\"\nArmando pauses, before collapsing into giggles that soon spread to Roberto and his wife.\n Warm welcome The warm welcome offered to visitors, not to mention Armando's rollicking sense of humour, makes a trip to Taquile Island one of the highlights of a stay at Titilaka Boutique Lodge, Alex Burridge says.\nBurridge, the managing director of South America Travel Centre, says intricate stories are woven by women into cummerbunds that will be worn by their future husband.\n\"A story of their future wife's life and their hopes for their future married life with their chosen partner,\" he says. \"The waist-band will also have some of the weaver's hair woven into it. All part of a beautiful and longstanding tradition.\"\nTitilaka, a luxury hotel on the shores of Lake Titicaca, on the border of Peru and Bolivia, has just 18 rooms – all with splendid views of the lake at sunrise or sunset. The all-inclusive lodge offers a rich variety of tours and activities led by a team of guides including Armando, who cannot resist a joke.\nDriving through fields planted with quinoa and potatoes, the staple foods in this part of the world, he points to the brightly coloured outhouses dotting the countryside and says: \"That's if you want to call the president …\"\nLaughing can be painful at these lofty heights, and Armando's colleagues diligently check oxygen levels in our blood after each excursion, or indeed walking up and down flights of stairs.\nUpon arrival, a small black oximeter clipped on my finger offers a recording of 93 per cent, which pleases hotel manager Virginia. If it drops below 84 per cent, alarm bells will ring, she says.\nDesolate stretch Titilaka is about two hours by car from the regional airport at Juliaca, through a desolate stretch of the Altiplano before we encounter forested hills and Puno, a city on the edge of Lake Titicaca renowned for its distinctive style of dress, dancing and festivals.\nAs night falls we drive along a dimly lit road – apparently favoured by smugglers – towards the border crossing with Bolivia, before turning off at the village of Acora and down a bumpy track to the lodge.\nStaying at Titilaka offers insights into this unique landscape and cultures, as well as providing a much-needed economic leg-up to the region.\n\"By working and engaging with the local community Titilaka does many things,\" Burridge says. \"It provides education, financial support and training and income for locally employed staff, much of which gets spent in the local community.\"\nTitilaka's staff are sweet-natured, fluent English speakers but eager to teach a few words of Spanish or Aymara, and ready with tips about sightseeing or buying textiles.\nRooms are furnished in a minimalist style, with heated floors and with the odd handicraft from the nearby Copamaya weaving community. The open-plan bathroom has an impressively-sized freestanding tub, perhaps designed for shared bathing to conserve water.\nWi-Fi can be sluggish (like many parts of Australia), and there is no television to waste time watching. All attention is instead focused, and rightly so, on the lake and distant shore fringed with sandy beaches, thick totora reeds and marshes.\nAnother highlight Dining is another highlight, with three good-sized meals a day featuring contemporary Peruvian cuisine using local produce – fish caught from the lake and quinoa, corn and potatoes harvested from the fields. The dining room, with wrap-around terrace, offers yet more splendid views of the lake, mountains and sky that compete with the fine food for attention.\nMany of the tours explore the unique landscape of Lake Titicaca – either on foot, cycling or on water.\nA brisk hike to the ancient Incan Titilaka Arch reveals a rocky landscape where adults tend to animals and crops, while children kick around footballs and dream of World Cup glory.\nAnother trek along ancient Inca roads, known as the Colla Trail, offers breathtaking mountain and lake views, as well as the chance to spot taruca Andean deer, eagles and the caracara falcon before reaching the Anatawi Inca ruins.\nTours are also offered to the Uros floating islands, inhabited by people who call themselves kut-suna and used to claim to have \"black blood\" because they did not feel the cold. The man-made islands are built of reeds, which are also used for medicine and sustenance by this inventive group of people. Their hospitality is warm even if the islands are overrun by tourists, their way of life somewhat commodified.\nThe night skies above Lake Titicaca provide another opportunity to discover ancient beliefs as told by the stars. Titilaka's guides offer an enthralling commentary on how the indigenous Aymara people, and later the Incas, looked to the heavens as their life coach.\nA rather less-impressive tale is told by the shaman of Copamaya, who relieves me of 50 nueva soles (about $20) to tell my fortune with coca leaves.\nThroughout Peru and especially in the high plains surrounding Lake Titicaca, coca leaves – chewed, brewed into tea or eaten as a sweet – are a recommended tonic for coping with the effects of high altitude.\nHowever, the shaman Sendong sees only misfortune as he munches steadily through the pile of coca leaves spread between us.\nA slightly embarrassed Armando tells me later to ignore the shaman's dire predictions, blaming a bad batch of coca leaves.\nBack at Titilaka, the barman consoles me with a coca leaf-flavoured pisco sour that he assures me will raise my spirits and cure the ill-effects of high altitude.\nHis prediction turns out to be true. After draining my second coca leaf-infused tonic, the future seems much brighter.\nThe writer was a guest of LAN Airlines and South America Travel Centre, southamericatravelcentre.com.au.\nDETAILS\nGetting there Fly to Juliaca, via Santiago, Chile and Lima, with LAN Airlines. lan.com\nStaying there Titilaka Boutique Lodge is part of the Relais & Chateaux association of luxury hotels.
