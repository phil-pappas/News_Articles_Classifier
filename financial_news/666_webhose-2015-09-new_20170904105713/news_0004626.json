Reopening the coal-mines. Demanding that the Bank of England prints money to give people free houses. They sound like the kind of policies that the late Hugo Chavez might have dreamed up in one of his crazier moments as part of his grand scheme to destroy the Venezuelan economy.\nBut in fact by the middle of this month, they will all be pledges from the leader of the British Labour Party, the main opposition and the most likely alternative government for the fifth largest economy in the world.\nWith the election of Jeremy Corbyn as its new leader , the Labour Party is about to take a dramatic swing to the left. Much like Syriza in Greece, or Podemos in Spain, it is about to tear up the social democratic rule book and offer voters a radical agenda that, while it may have been supported by a few fringe Marxist parties in the past, has never been part of the mainstream political debate before.\nOn the surface, you might think that was terrible news for the economy. After all, renationalizing industries, and printing money at will are usually the kind of thing that scares the capital markets. Paradoxically, however, Corbyn may well be great news for the gradually recovering U.K. economy.\nWhy? Because he is so far to the left, there is zero chance of him ever being elected to power — and Britain will benefit from the political stability that results from that.\nIn the wake of its unexpectedly comprehensive defeat in the general election last May, the British Labour Party has imploded. Instead of swinging back to the center ground, where most elections are won, and picking a more moderate, voter-friendly leader than the out-going Ed Miliband, it has instead turned to a veteran 1980s-style socialist .\nAlso read: Darrell Delamaide on Corbyn’s fight to take back Labour from the Tony Blairs\nAfter a surge in membership — anyone who pays three pounds can vote in the leadership election — Corbyn now looks a certainty to be elected leader of the party on Sept. 12. The bookmakers currently make him the 2-9 on favorite to win, with the initial frontrunner Andy Burnham at 7-2 against. Some of them have already paid out on Corbyn, who was a 100-1 shot when he joined the contest.\nThere is no question that Corbyn has captured the enthusiasm of a generation of left-wing activists, who have joined the party in droves to vote for him (as well as a fair number of Conservatives who have mobilized on social media to support a politician they regard as unelectable). Perhaps, there is nothing very surprising about that. A large section of the electorate in every developed county is fed up with mainstream centrist politicians, and is throwing its support to figures that were once confined to the fringes.\nSyriza is in power in Greece, and Podemos is riding high in Spain. In the U.S., Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist in a country with little tradition of left-wing politics, is making waves in the Democratic Party. On the right, Donald Trump is leading the Republican field, for now at least, while the even more right-wing National Front is making all the running in France. A mixture of globalization, mediocre growth, and stagnant real wages for much of the workforce have driven many voters toward extreme political choices.\nEven so, Corbyn’s actual policies are, to put it mildly, eccentric. ‘Corbynomics’ as it has been dubbed by the press, is a cobbled together collection of far-left causes from the last three decades. He wants to bring privatized industries back under state control, starting with the railways, with no plans to pay compensation to their new owners. He wants to reopen the coal mines — although rather oddly he is also in favor of green energy (presumably it is okay to dig for coal, but not to actually burn any of the stuff).\nHe wants rent controls and higher minimum wages and more powers for the trade unions as well as higher taxes for the rich — defined as people earning more than £50,000 a year — and for corporations. Most radically of all, he wants the Bank of England to be forced to directly print money to finance infrastructure spending — a policy called People’s QE.\nThat might be worrying for investors — except that there is zero chance of Corbyn actually leading the Labour Party back into government. The polls show that, while he has the enthusiastic backing of a few hundred thousand activists, the wider electorate have no interest whatsoever. The U.K., after all, is a reasonably prosperous country, with near-full employment, and a steadily growing economy — nations in that relatively happy condition don’t vote for revolutionaries en masse.\nEven worse, Corbyn has a hung out with some unsavory characters over the years. Only this week, it emerged that he described the killing of Osama Bin Laden as a “tragedy.” That is hardly a majority view.\nIn truth, there is more chance of Barack Obama endorsing Donald Trump as his favored successor than Jeremy Corbyn actually becoming prime minister. It isn’t going to happen. Instead, he will condemn the Labour Party to defeat, and make sure the rival Conservatives can rule unchallenged for a generation or more.\nSome people will tell you that one-party rule is damaging for everyone, and a country needs healthy opposition. But there is no real evidence for that. The Liberal Democrats held power in Japan from 1955 to 1993 — and oversaw one of the great expansions in economic history. The Christian Democrats held power in Italy from 1946 until 1994 — also the most successful period in that country’s economic history.\nIn fact, the stability and certainty that comes from having a single dominant party may help the economy. True, the ruling party may eventually become hopelessly corrupt and inward-looking. But that can take decades.\nWhen the result is announced on Sept. 12, plenty of people will warn you that the U.K. is lurching to the left. Ignore them. In reality, it will be entering a period of exceptional political stability — and that can only be good for the economy.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/leadership-race-in-u-k-labour-party-exposes-ideological-rift-1439302732", "http://www.theweek.co.uk/labour-leader/62858/labour-leader-corbyn-and-the-osama-bin-laden-tragedy"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:39:38.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
