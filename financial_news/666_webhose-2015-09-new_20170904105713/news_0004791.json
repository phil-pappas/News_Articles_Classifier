Photo: Glenn Hunt\nThe depressed coal market will take at least another few years to recover, and the Australian industry must do more to counter the anti-coal lobby, says the World Coal Association's new chief executive, Benjamin Sporton.\nWhen asked if he was managing an industry in decline, Mr Sporton said: \"No, not at all\", and stressed that the fundamentals for coal still remain very strong.\nSpeaking to Fairfax Media on Monday during a trip to Australia this week, he said it was too difficult to tell if the coal market was bouncing along the bottom, but he was confident it would recover.\n\"I think the market will come back and we'll be doing well, but it will take a couple of years,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Coal will continue to be \"a very important part\" of the Australian economy, and local miners were working hard to maintain their social licence to operate in Australia, for example through sustainable mining, he said.\nThermal coal has fallen 13 per cent since January to $US56 a tonne, a fraction of the roughly $US150 it was fetching in the heady days of 2011. Metallurgical coal has crashed another 26 per cent this year to about $US80 a tonne â€“ again, nowhere near the $US300 a tonne it was trading at four years ago.\n\"I see an industry that continues to grow, perhaps not at the pace that it has done historically, but it still continues to play a really important role in the world's energy mix. The growth in demand in China for coal is slowing down but I don't see it going away any time soon.\"\nAnd coal will be crucial to India's growth, and growth will be big in Indonesia too, he said. \"I certainly don't see an industry in decline.\"\nMr Sporton, who became chief of the WCA in June, has been on tour in Asia in the lead-up to the COP21 sustainable business conference in Paris in November to push clean, low-emissions coal technologies.\n\"We can't wish coal away; many countries are looking to coal to power their economies and we need to be helping them do that in the cleanest way possible,\" he said.\nThe role of coal was changing, and becoming an \"Asian story\" he said, and Australian coal was needed to power that.\n\"Much of demand growth in recent years, and projected going forward, is actually in Asia. I don't think that is well understood in the United States and Europe, and North America. It's easy to think coal is going away because in those places coal is playing a lesser role.\"\n\"I think we need to do more to explain the fact that Australian coal is needed elsewhere in the world, that is something that the industry here is focused on doing.\"\nThe Australian industry also needed to do more to explain to communities the role that coal plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:59:29.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
