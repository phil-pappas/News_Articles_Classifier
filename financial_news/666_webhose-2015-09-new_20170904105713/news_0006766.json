Asian index futures also signaled losses. The euro held declines with Greece’s anti-austerity Syriza set to remain in power after elections. Australian bonds rose, while gold futures traded near a two-week high.\nWith traders selling off risk assets at the end of last week in favor of haven investments, and bets on a rate hike being pushed out to next year, Fed officials sought to re-balance market expectations at the weekend. Three U.S. policy makers, including St Louis Fed chief James Bullard, argued that higher American borrowing costs are still warranted this year, with two meetings remaining in 2015. Trading this week could get off to a muted start in Asia with Japanese markets closed through Wednesday for holidays.\n“Investors seemingly decided that the Fed’s baulk was a sign that things are worse in the world than they actually appear,” Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand Ltd., said in an e-mail to clients. “The Fed’s decision to hold last week means we’re in for, at the very least, another six weeks of ‘will they, won’t they.’ Risk markets are unlikely to like the message that the Fed remains very ready to hike.”\nEarly Movers S&P 500 futures lost 0.1 percent by 8:06 a.m. in Tokyo, while contracts on stock gauges in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea and China slipped at least 0.6 percent at the end of last week. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index maintained its rebound amid the Fed commentary, with the euro steady at $1.1293 per dollar following Friday’s 1.2 percent slump. Yields on Australian and New Zealand 10-year debt dropped by at least one basis point, and gold futures were little changed after their first weekly gain in in a month.\nRate Bets While fed funds futures had been pricing in a less than 30 percent chance the Fed would raise rates last week, economists were relatively split. Slow inflation and the gyrations in markets since China unexpectedly devalued the yuan on Aug. 11 were cited as reasons for delaying liftoff. Despite the comments in favor of a 2015 hike from Bullard, the Richmond Fed’s Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed chief John Williams, odds of an increase in October or December remain below 50 percent.\nThe uncertainty over the global outlook and the Fed’s next move has stoked equity volatility, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange SPX Volatility Index climbing 5.4 percent on Friday. Major U.S. stock gauges slipped more than 1 percent, with crude oil back below $45 a barrel also driving losses among energy producers.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude added 0.3 percent early Monday, to $44.83 a barrel, after sinking 4.7 percent on Friday amid ongoing concern over the global glut. Brent crude added 0.2 percent to $47.56 following a 3.3 percent drop at the end of last week.\nElsewhere in commodities, gold futures were little changed at $1,136.80 an ounce following a weekly advance of 3.1 percent, the first since the second-last week of August. Copper futures on the Comex dropped 0.5 percent to $2.3730 a pound, extending Friday’s 2.7 percent retreat.\nFutures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 1.5 percent in most recent trading, while those on the Kospi index in Seoul retreated 0.9 percent. Contracts on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.4 percent as futures on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of mainland stocks listed in the city, sank 1.7 percent. Futures on the FTSE China A50 Index and the CSI 300 Index were down at least 0.6 percent.\nNew Zealand reports on credit-card spending Monday, while Hong Kong and Macau update consumer prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:36:49.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
