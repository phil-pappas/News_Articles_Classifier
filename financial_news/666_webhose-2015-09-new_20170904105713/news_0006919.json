Watchdog considers deadline for mis-selling claims End of PPI nuisance calls? Watchdog considers deadline for mis-selling claims CLAIMS for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) could be subject to a cut-off date, as the city watchdog looks to draw a line under the scandal. PUBLISHED: 16:39, Thu, Sep 24, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:51, Thu, Sep 24, 2015 GETTY PPI calls have become a nuisance - but you don't need a third-party to make a claim \nBanks have paid out around £25billion in customer compensation since 2007 after it was found that policies were widely sold under unacceptable circumstances. And now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering setting a deadline for claims, according to reports. The deadline could put an end to unsolicited contact from 'claims management companies' that sprang to help people get hold of payouts. The firms survive by taking a generous slice of payouts or through hefty fees - and have long pestered people with phone calls and texts in an effort to secure business. People who have not checked whether they were mis-sold PPI have been urged to check before it's too late and to avoid using a costly claims management company. Martin Lewis , founder and editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: \"If you think you are owed PPI or you have never checked, do it now. \"Even if you rejected PPI when you got a loan, credit card or mortgage, in some cases it was added anyway – that’s how rampant the mis-selling was – so many people who think they’re not entitled to cash are.\" Related articles The clock is ticking for PPI claims \nMaking a PPI Claim *PPI was typically sold alongside loans and credit cards. If you look back through your paperwork you will usually be able to see if PPI was a part of your repayments.*If you don't have paperwork you can contact your lender and ask for it - even if you are no longer a customer. *You were mis-sold if you weren't specifically told or agreed to the policy. You were also mis-sold if you wouldn't have been able to make a claim under the policy, this would have been if you were self-employed or had a medical condition that was not included in the policy.*If you believe you could have been mis-sold, write or contact your lender to ask for your money back - yo can download a letter template from MoneySavingExpert.com. *if your claim if rejected, you should then take it to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which can force banks to pay you back if your claim is valid.
