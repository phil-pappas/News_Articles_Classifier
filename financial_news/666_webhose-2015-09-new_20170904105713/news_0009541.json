Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: Baring Private Equity Asia acquired CMS Info Systems, India's largest cash-management company, from Blackstone and the Grover family for Rs 2,000 crore, two people familiar with the matter told ET. This would probably be one of the most successful exits for Blackstone in India — the PE firm will make nearly four times its investment in the last five years. In 2009, Blackstone had partnered with Rajiv Kaul, former chief executive of Microsoft India, to acquire a majority stake in CMS Info Systems from the Grover family, the founders. It had invested a total of — 280 crore in two tranches for a 53% stake in the company. Under the deal, Baring Private Equity has acquired 100% of CMS Info Systems — 53% from Blackstone, 37% from the Grover family and the balance 10% from the management team led by Kaul. After cashing out, Kaul and the management team have decided to reinvest in the company and continue to lead it and drive growth. A CMS Info Systems spokesperson declined to comment. ET had reported the deal plan in last December. Following a keenly contested bidding process that saw top global buyout and sovereign wealth funds Carlyle, Bain Capital , Temasek and Apax Partners also competing in the final round, Baring Asia managed to successfully close the transaction. The current management of the company under Kaul has turned around CMS Info Systems to make it the sixth largest ATM cash management firm in the world, with a network spanning over one lakh ATMs and retail outlets, and managing almost 55% of all cash in circulation in the country. The company made a strong entry into the deployment of selfservice terminals with the largest single phase deployment ever of more than 8,000 ATMs for State Bank of India and its associate banks, and has also emerged as the market leader in the deployment of cash recyclers. After India Post decided to set up its own ATM network, the company's card personalisation business bagged contracts for personalising 15 million debit cards for the Post's account holders. Set up in 1976 as CMS Computers to maintain IBM machines, CMS Info Systems was spawned in 2009 when Blackstone teamed up with Kaul to take its control for about Rs 190 crore. It carved out a set of operations that included cash management services and systems integration. In 2011, Blackstone made an additional investment of about Rs 90 crore. Kaul, executive vice chairman and CEO, holds a single-digit stake in the company. After a twoyear stint with PE fund Actis LLP, Kaul had partnered with Blackstone in the management buyout after the Grovers completed a complex restructuring exercise of their disparate businesses. The company's revenue has grown to more than Rs 1,000 crore in fiscal 2015 from Rs 427 crore in 2008-09. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
