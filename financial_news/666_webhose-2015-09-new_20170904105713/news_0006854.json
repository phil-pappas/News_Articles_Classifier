Scores can be a great tool for risk management. But, at the same time, scores can be incredibly frustrating for borrowers. When an algorithm determines your ability to obtain credit, anger often follow a confusing rejection.Below I have answered some of the most common credit score questions that I regularly receive. I will warn you: in many instances you will find the answers incredibly frustrating. Credit scores are far from perfect. I have an excellent credit score, but you still rejected me anyway. Why? Just because you have a good credit score does not mean you will still get approved. There are three main reasons why you may still be declined:\nYou are most likely not looking at the same score as your bank or finance company. There are literally hundreds of credit scores out there. But most banks will actually build their own custom credit score to make a decision. When I worked in banking, generic credit scores (like FICO) would often be a variable in our own custom model. t You may not make enough money. Your credit score is based upon your credit report, which does not know your income. An individual with $50,000 of credit card debt and $50,000 of income is much riskier than an individual with $50,000 of debt and $300,000 of income. But both may have the same credit score. t You may be rejected for a \"rule\" of the bank. Some banks do not want to lend to \"thin files.\" If you have less than two years of credit history, you could be denied. Or, you may have filed for bankruptcy. Even though your score has recovered, some banks will not deal with you. And there are many other rules that banks can use on top of scores to reject customers. Crush Credit Card Debt: An eBook From Forbes If running from the collection agencies isn't your exercise of choice, read this book for tips and tricks on how to crush credit card debt. Is it true that I need to go into debt in order to have a good credit score? You do no need to go into debt to have a good credit score. This is one of the worst rumors out there, and it never seems to want to die. All you need for a good credit score is a single credit card. So long as you pay your credit card in full and on time every month, you will never pay a dime of interest. Technically you are in debt, because you owe the credit card company money. But that debt costs you nothing.If you do not trust yourself with plastic, there is an easy way to get a great credit score. Just open one credit card. Set up a recurring monthly payment using your credit card. For example, you can pay your mobile phone bill with your credit card. Then set up automatic payment of your credit card from your bank account.Imagine you have a credit card with a $5,000 limit. Every month you will have a $100 balance (if that is your bill amount). That represents 2% utilization, which is excellent. Your credit report will reflect low utilization and on time payments. You don't even need to carry around your credit card, and you will ultimately end up with an excellent score, with no debt required. I had problems in the past. Do I have to wait seven years to get a good credit score? You do not need to wait. Credit scores can recover. Although it takes seven to ten years for most negative information to disappear completely, you can still start rebuilding your credit score sooner. However, you need to be proactive and demonstrate responsibility. One of the best tools is a secured credit card. Many credit unions and banks offer secured cards, which look like credit cards on your credit report, but are actually secured by your own deposit. You should use the same approach I described with a credit card in the previous section. Just select one payment, and automate it with a secured card. Don't just wait for negative information to fall off your credit report. Fill your credit report with positive information to get the fastest improvement. Am I allowed to close this expensive credit card? I don't want to hurt my credit score. It is true that keeping your credit cards open is the best way to have the best credit score. But you should never have to pay for a good credit score. There are plenty of credit cards out there with no annual fee.If you have an expensive credit card with an annual fee, you should give your credit card company a call and see if you can migrate your account to a no fee version. If you are with a credit card company that does not have a no fee credit card, do not be afraid to close your credit card to avoid costly fees. The two most important parts of your score are paying on time and your total debt, which includes utilization. Your focus should be on those two items. If a sub-prime credit card company is charging you $75 for a $500 credit limit, don't be afraid to cut it up, save money and move on. Just make sure you have opened a new, prime credit card with no fee before closing the older one. I am afraid to comparison shop. Won't that hurt my score? First, remember that the only reason you have a good credit score is so that you can get a good interest rate. You shouldn't protect your credit score by paying a higher interest rate.For mortgages, auto loans and student loans, you can do as much shopping as you want in a 30 day period, and it will only count as one credit inquiry. If you want a personal loan, consider using a marketplace lender that only uses a soft pull to check your interest rate. But do not be afraid to shop around.When you do apply for credit, it typically takes 10 or 20 points off your score. And so long as you continue to behave, your score will improve over six months. I only tell people to be extremely cautious if they are planning to apply for a mortgage or an auto loan in the next six months. Before a big purchase, I do not apply for any credit.If you don't have a big purchase coming up and are just looking for a better deal, don't be afraid to shop around.
