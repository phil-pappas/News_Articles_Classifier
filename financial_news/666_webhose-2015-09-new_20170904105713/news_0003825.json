It will fill 77,000 square feet with merchandise priced for the cost-conscious shopper with many items—from clothing to accessories and home items — priced below $30.\nWhile shoppers can take a look at all of these low-price goodies online, they can’t actually purchase them. Primark is making its American debut without an e-commerce component. Moreover, the company has no plans to launch one, a spokesman said. Primark doesn’t have an online sales operation in its home market and works with a small marketing budget.\nWhat it does offer on its website are social media links, giving visitors the chance to share items they recommend.\n“Social media has driven awareness of the brand internationally in Europe,” said Primark’s spokesman. The company has expanded into Spain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, among other markets.\nPrimark is entering the U.S. market at a time when it seems all U.S. retailers are focused on creating omnichannel platforms. Time after time on earnings calls over the past month, retailers have talked about the ways in which they’re integrating their brick-and-mortar locations with their digital channels through e-commerce, mobile apps and more.\nSee also: J.C. Penney focuses on omnichannel growth after better-than-expected results\n“Without digital you’re missing not only an entire generation, you’re missing the opportunity to operate 24/7,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at The NPD Group.\nRetailers can opt to bypass an e-commerce capability as a starting tactic, but ultimately, Cohen says, “even the last of the holdouts come out with some version of e-commerce trade.”\nEven a website can serve as a way to educate consumers and, as Primark says, to share information about merchandise. Word-of-mouth is a powerful tool.\n“Don’t rule out digital as a form of communication, even if it’s not a form of purchase,” Cohen said.\n“Without digital you’re missing not only an entire generation, you’re missing the opportunity to operate 24/7,” Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst, The NPD Group And ultimately, e-commerce is a lot of work and comes at an expense for retailers that have to foot the cost of shipping, handling and returns. With free shipping the norm nowadays, trying to charge customers for this service is a non-starter.\nPrimark’s rock bottom prices makes e-commerce unappealing. “We are not in the business of doing something and not making any money on it,” John Bason, chief financial officer at Primark parent, Associated British Foods ASBFY, +0.50% has said on the topic.\nFor Primark, the strategy has been working. Associated British Foods expects Primark sales to grow 13% for the year on a constant currency basis. Revenue totaled 2.5 billion pounds in the first half, up 15% from the year-earlier period.\n“You need an online presence, but if you can be one of the few that is able to sell a product that is in such high demand or is so fashion forward at the right price, people will come to your stores,” said Simeon Siegel, senior retail analyst at Nomura. “And you’ll be better off for it.”\nSee also: Teen clothing retailers are competing with apps, electronics for their customers’ cash\nResearch conducted by Nomura shows that consumers are willing to make the trek to the mall to purchase items that they really want. Still, consumers have grown accustomed to shopping from the comfort of home when they can.\n“The prisoner’s dilemma of e-commerce is here to stay,” said Siegel. “Customers want it. But if you’re one of the select few that can get away with not having it, as a retailer, you want to hang on to that competitive advantage for as long you can.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/primark-throws-its-hat-into-u-s-ring-1441749943", "http://www.abf.co.uk/documents/pdfs/2015/abf_interim_results_2015_report.pdf", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-web-drags-on-some-retailers-1417477790"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:51:06.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
