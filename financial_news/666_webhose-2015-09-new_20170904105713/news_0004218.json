Consumer confidence and U.S. housing prices seem to have investors in the right mood today, but will it last? Some are preparing for more tumult and a negative year for Wall Street .\nGet the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App \nHere are some of the other stories Yahoo Finance is keeping an eye on today.\nTesla to unveil Model X SUV\nElon Musk tweeted this morning that tonight Tesla ( TSLA ) will unveil the details of the new Model X electric SUV. Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman says it's the right car (as consumers buy up SUVs) at the wrong time (gas is cheap -- why spend more on an electric vehicle?). Still, Tesla hopes sales help it reach a goal of moving 50,000 vehicles this year.\nAmazon and the gig economy\nUber and Postmates pay workers based on individual rides or deliveries. Now Amazon ( AMZN ) is joining the movement with a new program called Amazon Flex. The company will pay drivers $20 an hour to pick up packages at local \"mini-warehouses\" and deliver them to your door in as little as sixty minutes.\nCoke cuts ties with research firm\nAfter much scrutiny, Coca-Cola ( KO ) is ending its sponsorship of the health group, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. This move comes after critics accused Coke of spending millions to downplay the role of sugary drinks in obesity.\nHotel re-ivenstment boom\nHotel companies across the U.S. are investing at record levels to upgrade rooms. Capital expenditures by hotels will climb 7 percent to $6.4 billion this year, according to a new survey by a New York University professor. The upgrades include everything from rewiring rooms to installing smart TVs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:10:24.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
