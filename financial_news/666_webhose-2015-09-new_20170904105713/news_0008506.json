Photo: Louie Douvis\nOf the newly employed, 9,200 were in NSW, trumped only by Queensland with 11,200. Victoria, meanwhile, lost 6,600 jobs. However, the annual totals for the states also showed that the bulk of extra jobs have come in NSW and Victoria, which added 119,000 and 63,000, respectively.\nAdvertisement Although the ABS labour market survey is notoriously volatile, the latest in the series suggests NSW jobs growth has hit an annual rate of 5 per cent when measured over the past three months.\nThis pace of job creation was last seen in the late-1980s, and surpasses the 4.7 per cent peak registered during the frenetic build-up to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, according to research from Morgan Stanley.\nSo while the resources infrastructure boom of yesteryear continues to wind down, the services industries which dominate Australia's most populous state are doing more of the heavy lifting.\nMorgan Stanley researchers say apart from tourism and other services sectors benefiting from the lower Australian dollar, infrastructure, dwelling and commercial property construction are probably behind the hard-working NSW jobs market.\n\"The lower Australian dollar is no doubt helping the tourism-services economy – it was trading below US60¢ [in the Olympics lead-up], and leverage to manufacturing has fallen over the past 15 years,\" they said.\n\"Instead, we think the housing boom has been a large part of the NSW recovery, combined with strong leadership through an infrastructure agenda.\n\"Our concerns are more for the rest of the country, where the national vision has been less clear,and where fiscal policy remains a drag,\" the report's authors said.\nThere is, however, a caveat: attempts by the Reserve Bank of Australia, through the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to restrain more speculative segments of the buy-to-let and buy-to-flip property markets could ultimately crimp job creation in the state.\n\"We see the biggest risk to 2016 growth coming from macroprudential policy reining in the Sydney housing market and Melbourne, to a lesser extent,\" the report's authors say.\nThis, they add, will help apply the brakes further on Australia's already sluggish 2 per cent growth rate, and ultimately drive the national unemployment rate up to 6.8 per cent, despite slower immigration flows and a slowdown in labour force expansion. This, they say, will force the RBA to cut interest rates by another half-percentage point by the middle of next year.\nOthers disagree, painting a much brighter future for the state and the Australian economy.\n\"It now looks like the unemployment rate has stabilised just above 6 per cent,\" Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist John Peters said on Thursday.\n\"Overall, [Thursday's] resilient jobs number bolsters our view that the RBA will probably not cut rates again this cycle and that the current 2 per cent will be the low point.\n\"The sharply lower Australian dollar over 2015 has also reduced the need for another RBA rate cut this cycle,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/aussie-teen-takes-rubiks-title-6700754.html", "http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b90fW/2/"], "published": "2015-09-10T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T05:42:12.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
