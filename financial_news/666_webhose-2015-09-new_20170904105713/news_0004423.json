As it cut its growth projections and uncertainty over emerging economy is rising, it probably had to show that it is ready to take action,\" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Asset Management.\nThe bank tweaked the programme to increase the share of any sovereign bond issue it may buy to 33 percent from 25 percent, a move market participants interpreted as preparation for more bond purchases.\nThat pushed down German 10-year yields, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, to 0.72 percent, compared to a two-week high of 0.82 percent hit on Monday.\nThe euro also fell to a two-week low of $1.10875 and it last fetched $1.1120. Against the yen, the common currency hit three-month low of 133.135 yen.\nWhile the ECB tilts towards more easing, the U.S. Federal Reserve has so far stuck to its script that U.S. interest rates will likely be raised this year as the U.S. economy continues to expand.\nYet, many investors now think the Fed will refrain from hiking rates at its meeting on Sept 16-17 and could wait even until next year given how unstable financial markets have been in the past few weeks.\nThat uncertainty over the Fed's timing makes it difficult to predict exactly how markets will react to the U.S. jobs data due at 1230 GMT on Friday, traders say.\nA strong number could cement optimism on the global economy and boost share prices but there is risk it could rekindle speculation of an early rate hike, which could hurt risk assets, especially vulnerable ones in emerging economies.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have produced 220,000 new non-farm jobs last month, continuing the robust rate of employment creation of the past five years, while average hourly earnings are predicted to have risen by a modest 0.2 percent as they did in July.\nIn commodities markets, which had been battered by fears of hard landing in China, prices were generally supported though their trading remained highly volatile.\nBrent crude futures rose 0.2 percent in early trade to $50.80 per barrel.\nCopper surged to $5,314 per tonne on Thursday, its highest in over three weeks, as bearish investors closed out positions ahead of U.S. job data. It last traded at $5,235.\nAluminium also shot up, touching a one-month peak on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday.
