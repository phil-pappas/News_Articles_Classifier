David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Business representatives at The Australian Financial Review Tax Reform Summit in Sydney on Tuesday were under intense pressure after pollster and campaign strategist Mark Textor claimed the corporate sector lived with the delusion that tax reform would come from political bipartisanship.\n\"For years I have heard business say we need bipartisanship,\" he said during a panel discussion of the ingredients for successful tax reform. \"We have an adversarial system – harden up, get over it, it's not going to happen.\n\"We have an adversarial system that's a system where you have this idea, I have that idea, now let's have it out\n\"It comes down to not fantasies, teenage-style fantasies, about bipartisanship on reform but rather someone making the case well with a tight package where someone can make a decision on risk versus reward decision – it's pretty simple.\"\nTextor's challenge was embraced by the business representatives, Phil Edmands , who is managing director of Rio Tinto Australia, Kate Carnell, who is chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Peter Nash, who is chairman of KPMG, and Lisa Gropp, chief economist at the Business Council of Australia.\nThey put a strong case for cutting the corporate tax rate, an objective that was supported by shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen. The Tax Reform Summit, which was sponsored by KPMG, provided a template for attacking tax reform.\nIt ought to provide strong ammunition for new Treasurer Scott Morrison .\nEdmands put forward strong arguments in favour of cutting the corporate tax rate from its current level of 30 per cent to around 25 per cent.\n \"What we want is the lowest and most efficient taxes we can get because all overreach is going to be a drag on economic activity,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be a drag on growth, a drag on productivity and a drag on jobs.\n\"I don't think tax reform is about wealth distribution – if you redistribute wealth you kill the incentive to create it.\"\n﻿ Lack of engagement Edmands pinpointed the key reason discussion of tax reform has been confined to occasional summits and a series of government studies and white papers.\n\"I think the underlying problem is that I think the Australian community has not engaged in the underlying issues and trade-offs,\" he said.\nHe says the presentation of reform as being around general propositions such as efficiency fairness, equity and simplicity are not resonating in the community.\n\"The community need to know why the economy is in trouble, how it [tax reform] will affect them personally,\" he said.\nHe says it would be a mistake to outsource the reform package to a bunch of experts and present it as a fait accompli. \"That will drive division – and be seen as clichés and slogans.\"\nThis analysis was on the same page as the comments made by ACTU president Ged Kearney , who said the organisation's 2 million members were cynical about tax reform.\nShe said there is a feeling there is growing inequality, that a rise in the GST will make them pay more taxes while rich people won't.\nKearney says we need to change the narrative to discuss what taxes do for society.\n\"I think there is a danger in saying the only thing that makes a company competitive is the corporate tax rate,\" she said. But she later said that the corporate tax rate at 30 per cent was perhaps \"too high\". \"I will be in the argument there,\" she said.\nKearney said any changes to tax rates had to be neutral.\nGropp said the starting point of any discussion about corporate tax had to recognise that every dollar of tax was a drag on future investment, which was backed up by Treasury modelling.\nAssumptions questioned The assumptions underpinning that modelling were questioned by Richard Vann, Challis Professor of Law, University of Sydney. His concern is that cutting the corporate tax rate is a blunt instrument for improving Australia's competitiveness.\nHe believes one of the biggest beneficiaries of a corporate tax rate cut will be those Australians who have \"money stuffed in trusts and companies – you never hear about them in this debate\".\nNash said Australia had to realise it was operating in a \"new world\" and that we could no longer apply the same thinking about tax that has been applied in the past and which got the country relatively high on the GDP per capita league table.\n\"We are living in a time now where we have never had so much mobility in capital and skills,\" he said.\nHe said capital will find the destination that is most friendly to that capital.\nNash said KPMG is seeing this in operation all the time in its advice to clients.\n\"We know capital and investment is critical to our growth and employment aspirations,\" he said. \"Are we doing all we can to attract that capital to Australia?\"\nNash said that more than at any point in time many countries around the world are using their corporate tax rate as an economic weapon and Australia had to respond.\n\"It is naïve to believe we don't have to fight fire with fire,\" he said.\nThe person with the most experience of tax reform at the coal face was Greg Smith, who is a senior fellow at the Melbourne Law School and chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission.\nHe has been involved in tax reform since 1983 and was personally a member of the team that cut the corporate tax rate to 39 per cent in 1988 and to 30 per cent in 2000.\nSmith says the tax system has served the country well having \"made Australia one of the most robust economies in the world\".\nBut he questions whether cutting the corporate tax rate will deliver as much economic benefit as expected. The reason he is doubtful is because the middle market companies with revenue between $10million and $250 million account for only 17 per cent of our company tax base while manufacturing is only 6 per cent.\nThese are the two types of business Australia wishes to stimulate.\nIn other words cutting the corporate tax rate would deliver the most benefits to companies with location- or incumbency-based rents.\nHe said corporate tax cuts should be done gradually.\nHe also warned against trying to match the tax rates in countries such as the UK.\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that Australia cannot chase footloose investment as its strategy. To do that we have to get to 15 per cent [company tax rate] basically. Yes, you will get a growth rate. But you will blow your political equation way before that,\" he said. Also, he said that a rise in the GST would not be a politically sustainable way to go about paying for corporate tax cuts.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-22T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:42:20.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
