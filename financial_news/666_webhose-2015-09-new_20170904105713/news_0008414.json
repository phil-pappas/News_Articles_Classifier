They are taking advantage of the involuntary credit to HMRC,\" barrister Jeremy Bamford told the court. \nReferring to regular reassurances that Renault were poised to step in, he said the team's existing shareholders had nonetheless \"not been willing to put their money where their mouth is. \n\"The concern for HMRC is that the negotiations have been going on for some time and we keep on getting assurances that the deal is nearly done,\" he added. \nWith confidential documents passed to the judge to show how close a deal was, lawyers for Lotus said matters had progressed \"substantially\" since the last adjournment 11 days previously. \nThey said a letter of intent had been signed by main shareholder and team principal Gerard Lopez with Renault expected to sign shortly. \nThe court heard that West Oxfordshire District Council, in whose area the 400-strong team has its Enstone factory, were owed 483,000 pounds but had submitted a letter supporting the request for adjournment. \nLotus said a substantial payment was due from Venezuelan oil company PDVSA on Nov 1, with that sponsorship set to continue into 2016 after issues with Renault were resolved, but warned that would not be forthcoming if the team went into administration. \nFinbarr O'Connell, the administrator who led the now-defunct Caterham team at the end of the 2015 season and then oversaw the disposal of their assets, was among observers at the hearing.
