Louie Douvis by Olga Galacho A short-term outlook may not have done investing in public infrastructure any favours, but bankers are discovering there is a strong appetite overseas for long-term returns.\nThat appetite was teased out at the Commonwealth Bank's Austrapalooza 2015, which brought together dozens of US investors and corporate issuers to discuss funding of overdue Australian infrastructure.\nThe three-day conference's take-out was that the US private placement market was keen for business and willing to be a significant and stable source of term capital for Australasian companies, a CBA spokesman said.\nInfrastructure Partnerships Australia chief Brendan Lyon told the networkers that a steady supply of infrastructure-related deals between governments and the private sector was assured.\n\"The challenge we have is that political commitment to infrastructure sits at somewhat of an asymmetry to what can be afforded,\" Lyon says\nHe also says there is no option but to privatise public assets and refresh ways of delivering social services in conjunction with private capital.\nThis need was becoming more pressing, he said, because of growing traffic congestion in major Australian cities, the pricing of utilities falling behind performance expectations, and the stretched nature of state government budgets.\nAlso integral to the cost-effectiveness for the community of Private-Public Partnerships (PPP) was an obligation on private providers to ensure that infrastructure was good for the long haul, well beyond the years after it was returned to governments.\nRelated Lyon used the example of a highway built for the New Zealand government to highlight a public benefit of PPPs.\n\"The operator receives a hefty fine for every fatality on the motorway,\" he says. \"You can imagine how significant the change is in the incentives on the operators around safety of design and operation.\"\nLeon Allen, CBA's head of government, healthcare, education & social infrastructure (GHESI) told The Australian Financial Review that PPPs would become more viable if providers were incentivised to strive for longevity.\n\"PPPs should operate under a clear agreement that contractually obliges providers to deliver back to government at the end of the possession period assets of a certain quality that have been properly maintained,\" Mr Allen said.\n\"And if they don't they would be penalised. That's a pretty good way for governments to acquire assets, and PPPs can deliver this.\"\nMr Allen says that in the past, governments \"did a great job of building assets but a mixed job of maintaining some of the smaller assets, like social housing, which suffered from long-term maintenance programs\" thanks to annual budget cycles.\n\"They ended up being neglected and having expensive replacement costs associated with them.\n\"We have moved beyond the notion that governments can finance these things more cheaply than the private sector but we still need to ensure that the infrastructure built has longevity,\" he said.\nRather than run a mile from such a proposition, the US investors at Austrapalooza told forums that they \"welcomed PPP deals as an additional source of long-dated debt, particularly when the project was supplying a government client\".\nMr Allen said that the PPP model was not broken following the collapse of the proposed East West Link in Melbourne when Labor won the last state election.\n\"East West was a fairly unique political circumstance that did not produce a good outcome; it caused a lot of conversations in boardrooms at the time.\n\"But I still think Australia's track record of providing a stable investment environment, strong legal framework and good pipeline of projects remains intact.\"\nHe warned, however, that in many Australian cities, a growing population using ageing public infrastructure, such as social housing, education facilities and hospitals, was causing community and budgetary stress.\n\"The net migration flows we currently see will underpin a level of economic activity that would not otherwise occur given Australia's normalised birth rates,\" he said.\n\"Any uptake in migrant intake will lead to economic activity that delivers services such as health, recreation, housing, feeding people and business activity.\n\"However, the broader trend is the ageing population; we don't have a level of [financial] replenishment for that demographic with the current pace of birth rates.\n\"On the capital inflow side, there are a number of aspects that would support change in the medical sector to better accommodate the healthcare needs of all Australians.\"\nAllen says there was a great deal of international interest in the Australian healthcare model and a genuine regard for our providers.\n\"Be it a hospital, aged care, how we have developed companies that can service populations at a high level, how we manage chronic disease, and that can be a very expensive future, health budgets that are not growing as fast as demand for healthcare is growing.\n\"These are the issues that a lot of countries will have to deal with and in that mix we have an enviable blend of public and private providers, thanks to the high number of privately insured Australians.\"\nHe said because of all these factors, the world's eyes were turned on Australia and foreign investors were considering how they could transfer our health sector's expertise to other domains.\n\"The most effective way to do this is to invest in health services here.\n\"We have a well-regulated, attractive market, fundamentals that are pretty strong, growth in the consumption of healthcare. I think there will be a place for inbound investment that wants to capitalise on this and potentially transfer it around the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:28:37.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
