Photo: Paul Jones\nAt least $3 billion of debts are being shirked in the construction industry due to the insidious and illegal practice of phoenix activity, a Senate inquiry has heard.\nSo-called phoenix companies are businesses that collapse one day with a pile of debts then rise from the ashes with the same assets and customers to avoid their bills.\nThey rip people off, go broke and emerge debt-free. It is a practice that has become the scourge of the construction industry.\nIn the words of the Australian Taxation Office in a submission to the Senate: \"Where such insolvencies result from intentional or systematic planning to become insolvent, we see this as a serious threat to the integrity of our financial, employment, regulatory, taxation and superannuation systems â€“ harming both these creditors and all Australians.\"\nAdvertisement It is not hard to see why. Labor senator Doug Cameron spearheaded the inquiry into insolvency in the construction industry when it became obvious the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance, which was launched to \"clean up the industry\", didn't include insolvency because it was more about politics.\nCameron's concern was the growing number of insolvent companies in the construction industry and the profound impact it has on staff, customers, subcontractors and other creditors.\nTo put it into perspective, according to statistics from ASIC the construction industry is in the top three industries with the highest number of external administrators. Indeed, almost one quarter of all external administrations relate to the construction industry.\nVarious studies suggest that some of these company collapses have been deliberately confected to avoid debts.\nThe Senate has heard of cases where builders put in no margin bids for work on projects on the basis they will get the margin by not paying people when the job matures.\nIt has heard details of the lead-up to the collapse of Walton Construction in 2013 owing creditors tens of millions of dollars.\nAt the Senate hearing in Sydney on Monday, Senator Cameron asked what National Australia Bank knew about the Walton group before its collapse.\n\"NAB knew Walton was in a bad way and put Mawson [Group] in to protect the bank's assets,\" he said. \"Companies continued to trade with Walton as if nothing was wrong yet a bank in a strong financial position can get access to evidence that this company is in trouble yet there is no obligation on NAB to raise issues with the ATO or the other companies trading with it.\"\nHe makes a good point but in many cases of collapsed construction-related entities, there are no secured creditors.\nThe simple reality is phoenixing isn't hard to do because there is a gaping hole in the law which allows individuals to set up companies without any requirement to provide identification.\nThis means the date of birth, place of birth and spelling of names can be blatantly wrong, making it hard to pick if the same directors are involved. In addition, the fines don't act as a deterrent.\nDespite this, the statistics are still disgracefully high.\nThe Senate inquiry was told by the Australian Taxation Office that the number of \"potential\" businesses illegitimately building their wealth through \"fraudulent phoenix behaviours\" is 19,800 (72 per cent of which contain at least one building or construction entity).\nThe recent analysis found these businesses had links to a staggering 360,000 entities (17 per cent of which are building or construction entities), of which 1600 were rated high-risk.\nThe ATO estimates that these entities owe it about $1.8 billion in debt.\nIt says it has identified 3355 individuals with a history of insolvency in the property development industry.\nThey have been in control of more than 13,000 entities with more than $2 billion in debt written off by the ATO. \"These insolvent entities have also previously claimed $1.3 billion in GST credits in the past four years.\" Not surprisingly, these people are on the ATO's hit list.\nThere have been numerous attempts over the years to try and tackle the problem of phoenix companies. The first dates back to 2003 during the Cole Royal Commission, then a paper by Treasury in 2009.\nThe latest attempt to tackle the problem was back in 2012 when directors were made personally liable for the debts of the phoenix company in relation to non-payment of amounts withheld from employees' wages and super.\nTo date, the various inquiries and changes to the law and ATO and ASIC crackdowns have had little impact.\nWhat is most concerning is it is getting worse.\nThe Senate heard from ASIC and the ATO on Monday but Tuesday's hearing promises to be more colourful with Mawson Group director Patrick McCurry fronting the Senate to discuss the role of Mawson, NAB and Walton. Frank Nadinic, from Maxstra, is also scheduled to appear.\nNadinic appeared in a story last year in The Age where he told the newspaper at the time he was unaware of the involvement of Hells Angels bikies in a building industry dispute . He will be able to elaborate to the senators.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/hells-angels-threatened-to-bash-building-boss-20140715-ztc30.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:53:22.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
