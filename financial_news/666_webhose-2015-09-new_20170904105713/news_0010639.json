Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nThe world's biggest milk exporter, Fonterra, is expecting steeper-than-expected falls in production this year as New Zealand dairy farmers slaughter more cows to combat the global milk rout.\nThe New Zealand dairy giant is forecasting milk production volumes to sag 2 to 3 per cent in 2015-16 compared with the previous year.\nBut it said that number could slip further as more farmers slaughter cows in an effort to seek a better return from rising beef prices.\n\"Market data from several independent sources show that cows are being culled at higher rates than last season,\" said Fonterra corporate affairs director Miles Hurrell.\nAdvertisement \"However, it is still early in the season, and any forecast at this point is very dependent on weather conditions, which have so far been poor for production.\"\nAustralian milk processors have been waiting to see the response from Fonterra and New Zealand dairy farmers to a near halving of global prices for key dairy commodities.\nPAC Partners director and senior industrials analyst Paul Jensz said the forecast 2-3 per cent drop in production was \"a good start\" to helping stem the global oversupply of dairy commodities.\nBut he expected further drops in coming months, despite the last two global dairy trade (GDT) auctions delivering price rises of 10.9 per cent and 14.8 per cent respectively to an average of $US2226 ($3174) a tonne.\n\"We have had two rises in the GDT after 10 falls so we are not back to … sustained wholemilk prices of around $US3500 a tonne,\" Mr Jensz said.\n\"It needs to be a bit higher than that to get new production going.\"\nDairy Australia analyst John Droppert​ said similar cuts in production were needed from Europe and the US, the world's second and third biggest dairy exporters.\nDemand has waned for key dairy commodities after Russia slapped trade sanctions on most Western countries over tensions in Ukraine, and the world's biggest buyer China stepped out of the market to run down months of inventory it had stockpiled.\n\"At the moment demand is still sluggish,\" Mr Droppert said.\n\"A 2-3 per cent drop [in production] from New Zealand on its own isn't going to get commodity prices back [to sustainable levels] but it is a departure from the continuous growth we have seen from New Zealand over the past few years.\"\nRabobank dairy analyst Michael Harvey said Fonterra's forecast was conservative and the cuts to production this season could be \"more severe\".\n\"It comes down to the fact that the milk prices farmers are being paid in New Zealand are well below the cost of production. So they have to make adjustments on farm to cope with that and cut out cost,\" Mr Harvey said.\n\"That's why you are going to see a drop in the herd and we have already seen slaughter rates in New Zealand quite high. That's keeping in mind that beef prices are quite high so that gives farmers an added incentive to cull cows\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:08:48.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
