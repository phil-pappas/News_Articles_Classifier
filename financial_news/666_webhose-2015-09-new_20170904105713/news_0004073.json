Demand for the safest investments continued Wednesday, with Australian and New Zealand bonds tracking a rebound in Treasuries and the yen holding gains. Copper futures hovered near their lowest price this month with a private gauge projected to show a seventh straight month of contraction in China’s manufacturing sector.\nRenewed concern over China’s faltering economy, the source of last month’s market ructions, sank commodities on Tuesday, with equity volatility spiking from the U.S. to Europe as the scandal over car emissions standards engulfing Volkswagen AG also frayed nerves. Markets have been swinging since the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates last week, as officials proclaiming the strength of the U.S. economy and prospects for a hike this year muddy the waters. Japanese markets remain closed for holidays Wednesday.\n“There wasn’t much data out overnight but the focal point was the unfolding scandal at Volkswagen,” Con Williams, a rural economist in Wellington at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd., said in a client note. “This, alongside renewed commodity price weakness, led to risk-off moves in markets. Concerns over China remain.”\nEarly Movers S&P 500 futures dropped 0.3 percent by 7:43 a.m. in Tokyo, with New Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50 Index, the first major stock gauge to start trading each day in the Asian region, down 0.2 percent in its first hour. Yields on 10-year Australian debt fell six basis points to 2.69 percent after a seven basis-point drop in rates on similar maturity Treasuries, while the yen added 0.1 percent to 120.06 per dollar following Tuesday’s 0.3 percent climb. Copper futures were steady after sinking as much as 4.3 percent last session, while U.S. crude oil traded at $46.60 a barrel after seesawing the past two days.\nThe Chicago Board Options Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped 11 percent in New York for its biggest gain since Aug. 24 on a closing basis, while Europe’s volatility gauge surged 19 percent.\n“When you see a rise in volatility it leads to investor uncertainty and any bad news has the opportunity to shake things up,” Joseph Betlej, who helps oversee $33 billion as vice president of Advantus Capital Management, said by phone. “People are questioning the strength of growth in the domestic economy and second guessing that the Fed must see something.”\nDespite the yen’s strength, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was headed for a fourth straight day of gains, adding 0.1 percent after jumping 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The gauge, which tracks the greenback against 10 major peers, has gained 1 percent since the Fed held rates last Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T02:16:15.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
