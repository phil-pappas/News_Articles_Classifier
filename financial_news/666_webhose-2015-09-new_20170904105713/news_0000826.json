Census researchers said both changes were not statistically significant.\nThe Census data are a key indicator of the U.S. economic well-being, and they offer a glimpse into how people were faring five years into recovery from the 2007-2009 recession.\n\"In 2014, real median household income was 6.5 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the most recent recession,\" Census researchers wrote.\nA steady expansion has pushed the U.S. unemployment rate down to near 7-1/2-year lows, but wage gains have lagged and nearly 6.5 million Americans are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job.\nWith the economy regularly a top concern of voters, the findings are likely to add fuel for debate as 16 Republicans and six Democrats jockey for their parties' nominations ahead of the November 2016 presidential election.
