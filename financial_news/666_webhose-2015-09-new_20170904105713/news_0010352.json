During tough times, the corporate executives, celebrities and other guests who have assumed the ceremonial assignment can find themselves in an awkward position: putting the cap on a day of economic upheaval while smiling brightly.\n“I think we were bringing hope,” said Salome Gudmundsdottir, chief executive of a startup support group called Klak Innovit who rang the Nasdaq NDAQ 1.52 % Stock Market closing bell on Aug. 25, another down day. “A light in the dark.”\nPast closing-bell ringers with the bad luck of closing a down day can remember the anxiety, as well as the pressure to keep up appearances.\n“I hate those days,” said Matt Tuttle, a financial adviser who rang the Nasdaq closing bell on July 8, when the markets were rattled by an apparent technical glitch that had halted trading at the New York Stock Exchange. “You’ve got that feeling in the pit of your stomach.”\nAs the person officiating at the market’s close in a televised ceremony, however, “I was more worried to make sure I smile,” he said. “That was my focus: Remember to smile.”\nAt times, being upbeat feels incongruous with the market’s reality.\n“It was funny: On a down day, they’d all clap and cheer, but they had this fake plastic look on their faces, like ‘The market just lost 1,000 points!’” said Chris Foley, a stockbroker-turned-actor. “They’d go ‘yay,’ but if it’s down a lot, they know.”\nWhile he hasn’t rung the bell himself, he has some advice for those who do. The opening one “is safer,” he said. “You don’t know what the market’s going to do.”\nGuests on down days had varied takes on the experience. Some hoped to project calm amid financial fears. Others saw the glass half-full: On a bad day of newsworthy proportions, their appearance got more attention.\nMost vowed not to let a little thing like a market plunge get between them and their big moment.\n“Our focus was celebrating 25 years, and we weren’t about to let anything ruin that moment of history for us when we were smiling up on the platform,” said Cash America’s Ms. Walker, whose company has been on the exchange for a quarter-century. “It was just one of those moments of irony. I’m sure there were people watching closely, but we were caught up in the nostalgia of the day.”\nBrowse Recent A-heds ENLARGE Where Do the Indian and Atlantic Oceans Meet?

I was doing this play on Broadway, and the publicist said, ‘You can go and ring the closing bell,’ ” she said. Once the day arrived, however, “an hour beforehand, they were like, ‘You know what? We don’t want you to have to be associated with this terrible day.’ ”\nA NYSE official stood in for Ms. Pyle instead, but her affiliation with the close “is on my IMDb page now, it’s my top news story,” she said. “I can’t escape it!”\nBells came into use in the late 1800s to signal the start and end of the day, as continuous trading markets emerged and officials sought to maintain an orderly schedule. The first NYSE guest bell-ringer was in the 1950s, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that guest ringers became a staple at both Nasdaq and the NYSE. Though corporate executives are frequent bell-ringers, at the NYSE, ballerina Misty Copeland, singer Jordin Sparks, and astronaut Joseph Acaba have recently done the honors.\nMuch work goes into the ceremonies, market officials said, though they only last a fleeting few minutes. At the NYSE, the bell-ringer presses a button and pounds a gavel, while a digital bell is pressed on a tablet at Nasdaq.\n“I don’t think there’s a great amount of volatility between a day that’s up or down,” said Robert H. McCooey Jr., a senior vice president at Nasdaq. “It’s really about the company coming in and celebrating that milestone.” Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets for the New York Stock Exchange, said “bell-ringers are in that moment, taking in the experience. It’s less important what the markets are doing that particular day.”\nGeorge Arzt, a public-relations executive and former press secretary for late New York City Mayor Ed Koch, said even with the potential for a down day, ringing the bell holds a unique allure as part of a press tour.\n“It’s your 15 seconds of fame,” he said.\nBut he would prefer his client nab an opening-bell spot. “By the closing bell, people are just glad to get out of there,” he said, “especially in the last few days.”\nOn Wednesday, stocks rebounded after volatile days, and Ken Kannappan, chief executive of audio communications company Plantronics, rang the bell joyously at the New York Stock Exchange.\n“That’s an added boost,” he said afterward, of the market jump. “But it would have been a great occasion for us anyway.”\nWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT851_Bell_G_20150902180012.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:44:53.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
