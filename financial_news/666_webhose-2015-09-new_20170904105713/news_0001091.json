One Sotheby's Executive Vice President, Fernando de Nunez y Lugones comments on the agreement: \"We are excited to enter into this partnership with such an established player and look forward to working collaboratively together to create further value from this relationship. Working with Capital Assured allows us to use their impressive track record and gain global access to an audience of investors.\"\n\nNicholas Turner, CEO, Capital Assured Miami, says: \"We're honored to work in cooperation with Sotheby's to introduce investors to this incredibly exciting development.\"\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences have been designed by world-renowned architect and designer Piero Lissoni and are comprised of 111 stunning condominiums and 15 expansive family villas. Set in seven acres of lush tropical gardens and looking out over an ocean water enclave, the development brings exceptional modern design and resort-style amenities together with unmatched views of Miami Beach, Biscayne Bay and downtown Miami.\n\nThis opportunity to invest in US real estate comes at an ideal time for investors in the Middle East, as oil prices weaken and more established property markets such as London show signs of peaking. Capital Assured has been instrumental in helping MENA investors to diversify their portfolios, and as part of this can now offer the Ritz-Carlton Residences, the perfect opportunity for lifestyle investors. Robin Titus, General Manager of Capital Assured Dubai comments: \"We are very excited to be investing in a rare offering, unmatched in south Florida. Scheduled to open late 2016, there is already huge demand from the Middle East, as these properties will be exclusively focused on the rich taste of the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\nAbout Capital Assured: \n\nCapital Assured is driven by the desire to provide 'Wealth Protection and Income Generation' for future generations.
