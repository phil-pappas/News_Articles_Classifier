It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) kept the London-listed shares at neutral and those traded in Hong Kong at buy while adding the latter to its Conviction List. 1025: Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) has \"suffered a complete loss of confidence from investors following the recent dividend cut and equity placing,\" Credit Suisse (Other OTC: CDSSF - news ) notes.

However, \"earnings momentum in diamonds and platinum has surprised us to the downside and by virtue of GLEN's weak performance Anglo is no longer the obvious value or recovery play. Credit Suisse expects Anglo American to cut its dividend pay-out by 45% at year-end. It lowered the shares to neutral with a 900p target price. \n0834: Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) ups StanChart (HKSE: 2888-OL.HK - news ) to buy from neutral but lowers target price to 820p from 970p. \"Although we now believe Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) could enjoy a near-term rebound, we regard the case for the stock as somewhat speculative. We see much clearer upside for Virgin Money (Buy), RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) (Buy), HSBC (Buy) and even Lloyds (Buy) and Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) (Buy).\" 0830: Asia-focused lenders StanChart and HSBC are at the top of the leaderboard, swimming against the tide. Miners such as Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) and Kaz are lower on the back of negative comments out of analysts at Credit Suisse. Antofgasta and Vedanta were downgraded to underperform from neutral by Credit Suisse. Glencore stock is plumbing all-time lows.
