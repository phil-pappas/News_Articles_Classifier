Don't let your failure to understand financial jargon be one of them. In fact, be well-aware of the terms related to raising the capital to optimize your opportunity. Pre-money and post-money valuation Valuation refers to monetary value of a firm. When seeking angel financing, valuation can be whatever you are able to convince your investors to agree on. Pre-money valuation determines the value of your company prior to receiving funding. Additionally, post-money valuation is measured as the sum of pre-money valuation and new funding acquired. Both these terms are important since they decide the equity stake an individual will give up at the time of funding round. Convertible debt For a start-up company, calculating its valuation is certainly pointless. However, the need for capital raising do exist at this stage. Convertible debt refers to a financing vehicle that enables the start up companies to raise capital while postponing valuation decisions till the time company becomes more mature. Investors who are ready to make use of convertible notes usually receive discount as rewards for putting their funds in the early stages of business, when doing so can be a risky venture. Capped and uncapped notes When investors and business owners opt for capped round, they are placing a ceiling on valuation upon which the notes of investors convert into equity. On the contrary, an uncapped round means that the investors receive no guarantee of the amount of equity their convertible debt investments would purchase. Owing to this, these types of investments are deemed more beneficial for the entrepreneurs. Pro-rata rights A latin word for \"in-proportion\" is pro-rata and pro-rata rights describe the rights of investors that they have to participate in funding rounds so that they are able to maintain the total amount of equity they have in a firm. Option pool The term option pool refers to the part of equity reserved for future hires. The size of option pool, which is decided at the time of funding round, poses direct impact on the valuation of an organization and also on your ownership. Reason being, the option pool is usually included in the pre-money valuation of a firm. Vesting Although not directly related to capital raising, vesting is an important term to gain insight into. Investors expect to know the vesting schedules of your employees. Imposed on professionals who receive equity, a vesting schedule helps decide when can the employees access that equity. Usually, a vesting schedule takes four years and includes one year cliff, which means that shares of no employee can vest for minimum one year.
