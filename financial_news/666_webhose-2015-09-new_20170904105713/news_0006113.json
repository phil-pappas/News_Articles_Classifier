In this newly redefined role, Tarantine will fortify the university’s academic leadership in the nursing discipline and help advance CTU’s nursing degree programs to meet current and future demand for qualified nurses. \nDr. Tarantine is a widely-respected nursing industry leader, educator, and researcher. Recognized by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) for maintaining critical care certification for more than 20 years, her professional experience is underpinned by more than two decades serving as a nurse at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Fueled by her passion for continuous learning, Dr. Tarantine earned her doctorate in nursing practice from Chatham University and her master’s in nursing education from the University of Pittsburgh. \n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead the charge in expanding CTU’s nursing degree programs,” said Tarantine. “I look forward to leveraging what the university does best – providing quality curriculum that enables students to apply real world knowledge to grow their expertise and reach their education goals. This is an exciting time for nursing education and I am thrilled to join CTU’s progressive team.” \nDr. Tarantine joins CTU from Academic Partnerships, where she was the director of healthcare and responsible for driving the innovative design of new nursing programs for public universities. Prior to Academic Partnerships, Tarantine served as the chair of graduate nursing programs for South University where she oversaw the university’s online nursing program portfolio. Dr. Tarantine continually demonstrates her leadership, passion, and commitment to the healthcare field as one of a few national experts who have successfully scaled complex nursing practica through innovation. \n“Dr. Tarantine understands the demands of a nursing program from both an academic perspective and from firsthand experience in the nursing profession,” said Dr. Connie Johnson, chief academic officer and provost at CTU. “Her depth of knowledge and perspective will help to guide our nursing program to the next level and we are delighted she’s joined our team.” \nCTU has made a commitment to make nursing education more accessible and improve the delivery of online curriculum with intellipath™, a personalized learning technology that assess what students already know and helps them uncover new areas to learn. The appointment of Dr. Tarantine reinforces this pledge to being a highly relevant and credible nursing educator for both traditional and non-traditional students. With nursing careers projected to increase by nearly 20 percent by 2020 1 , the CCNE accredited nursing program at CTU is well positioned to help nurses pursue their bachelor of science in nursing degree; which further supports the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation that the proportion of nurses with baccalaureate degrees be increased to 80 percent by that same year. 2 \n“We are pleased to welcome a leader with Dr. Tarantine’s diverse healthcare background and expertise to our team,” said Andrew H. Hurst, CTU’s university president. “CTU is driving innovation within our nursing program and she shares our vision to prepare nursing students to become leaders in the nursing profession. We look forward to continued advancement in these programs under her leadership.” \nCTU is dedicated to building curriculum that supports the growing needs and demands of the country’s workforce. With nursing as currently the largest segment in the U.S. Health Care Workforce 3 , the university will continue to collaborate with employers to understand skills gaps and meet their current and projected workforce needs. The arrival of Dr. Tarantine is yet another addition to the real world faculty members and industry experienced deans that lead CTU’s other degree areas. \nAbout Colorado Technical University’s Nursing Programs \nCTU simplifies the advancement from RN to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and provide a fast, flexible, and affordable option for busy nurses in the workforce.
