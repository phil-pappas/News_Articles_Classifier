PUBLISHED: 10:32, Tue, Sep 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:56, Tue, Sep 22, 2015 REUTERS / GETTY Millions of British Volkswagens could be recalled \nEurope's largest car brand faces a criminal investigation and up to £11.6billion ($18bn) in fines after it rigged diesel vehicles to pass US emissions tests, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nAnd now the brand, which is in the same group as Audi, Skoda, Seat, Bentley and Lamborghini, has admitted that up to 11million of its cars could have cheated their way through worldwide standards, including Britain and Europe. \nThe company also revealed today that it's setting aside £4.7bn (€6.5bn) to cover the costs relating to the crisis. US head of VW, Michael Horn last night said: \"Our company was dishonest with the EPA, and the California Air Resources Board and with all all of you.\"And in my German words: We have totally screwed up.\"We must fix the cars to prevent his from ever happening again and we have to make this right. \"This kind of behaviour is totally inconsistent with our qualities.\"The carmaker is to recall half a million US diesel cars sold between 2009 and 2015 that were fitted a 'detect device' that allowed models to pass tests. However, during normal driving the cars give off between 10 and 40 times the legal pollution limit, according to the EPA.Volkswagen Passat, Golf, Beetles and Jetta, as well as Audi A3s, are thought to be among the affected models.

Shares in the Frankfurt-listed company sank by 19 per cent on Monday, and lost a further 20 per cent on Tuesday. In reaction to the US cheating claims, Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn said: \"I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. \"Volkswagen has ordered an external investigation of this matter.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:31:19.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
