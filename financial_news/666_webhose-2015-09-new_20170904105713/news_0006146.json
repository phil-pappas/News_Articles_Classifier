Once the iron ore price bottomed in July, it's been ticking up steadily, so that's solid for mining stocks.\" \nAt 1025 AEST, BHP was up 30 points, or 1.23 per cent, to $24.62, while Rio Tinto gained 36 points, or 0.73 per cent, to $49.63. \nFortescue gave up all its early gains to sit flat at $1.89. \nThe big four banks were subject to further selling following their turmoil on Thursday, when the quartet dragged the market down after investors sold following early gains. \n\"The banks have taken a pretty big beating lately,\" Mr Nicholson said. \nANZ rose briefly before dropping back to sit 19 cents, or 0.7 per cent, down at $26.77. Commonwealth Bank dropped 62 cents, or 0.86 per cent, to go to $71.35, while NAB was down 32 cents, or 1.07 per cent at $29.61. \nWestpac, whose chief executive is on Monday due to issue a strategy update that could involve cost reductions, was the biggest faller in percentage terms, declining 1.23 per cent, or 37 cents, to $29.82. \nEuropean markets gained overnight, but US equity markets gave up early gains as investors turned cautious ahead of the August jobs market report, which could weigh heavily the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. \nMr Nicholson said the probability for a September Fed rate rise still sits at 30 per cent. \nKEY FACTS \n* At 1025 AEST on Friday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 27.2 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 5,000.6 points. \n* The broader All Ordinaries index was down 26.7 points, or 53 per cent, at 5,022.0 points. \n* September share price index futures contract was down 30 points at 4,975 points, with 11,762 contracts traded. \n* National turnover was 266 million securities worth $671 million. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Aust shares open higher AAP \nThe Australian share market has opened higher.
