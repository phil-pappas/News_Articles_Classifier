The grocer does not pay staff for lunch breaks. \nMorrisons previously paid staff time-and-a-half for their Sunday hours. However, those who relied on the extra income from weekend shifts will be supplemented to ensure that all staff are 2pc better off next year, a spokesman clarified. \nThe move by the grocer has been supported by the shop workers’ union Usdaw. \nMorrisons follows Sainsbury’s, which increased pay for 137,000 staff by 4pc to a basic rate of £7.36 an hour. Sainsbury’s also said it pays 30-minute lunch breaks for staff on eight-hour shifts. \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , meanwhile, pays £7.39 an hour for established workers and additional benefits, while starter wages begin at £7.02. \nA Tesco spokesman said that the supermarket was in negotiations with unions about the level of increase for starter employees to comply with the living wage legislation next year. The supermarket chain said that it will also be handing out a bonus to all staff worth 5pc of pay if Tesco hits internal turnaround targets. \nMeanwhile, Asda currently pays £6.89 an hour and will increase this to £7 next month, although it also has a bonus scheme and paid breaks. \nGerman discounter Lidl was the first supermarket to pay the living wage and has said it will pay its 9,000 staff at least £8.20 an hour, although it does not pay for breaks (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:04:23.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
