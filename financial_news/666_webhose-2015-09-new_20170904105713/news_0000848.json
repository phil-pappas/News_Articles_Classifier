But these may charge retail clients as much as 1.5 percent of their assets a year for their services, compared with less than 0.1 percent for some funds which track blue-chip indexes.\nVW faces billions of dollars in fines and law suits after it admitted cheating to make its diesel cars appear cleaner. Since the scandal erupted on Friday, its share price has dived 33 percent and its chief executive has quit, leaving investors to wonder what will happen next.\nWith investors fearing the scandal might spread, some may want to avoid entirely the three big German motor manufacturers, which collectively make up around 14 percent of the German blue-chip DAX index..\nOn top of the VW dive, BMW has lost around 15 percent and Daimler around 16 percent since Friday - despite denying they have manipulated emissions tests - helping to drag down the DAX.\nThis fall has hit passive investors worse than those who paid more to a fund manager to pick winning bets actively.\nFrom the close on Sept. 17 to the close on Sept. 23, equity-focused exchange-traded funds with a focus on the DAX 30 lost around 6 percent, Lipper data showed, in line with the index.\nOf the $19 billion invested in DAX equity ETFs, the bulk, $9.4 billion, is in BlackRock's iShares DAX fund.\nWhile most of the ETFs track the market-capitalisation weighted index of the underlying DAX, other \"smart beta\" products have been created to exclude certain sectors, focus on other investment factors such as a stock's cheapness or use leverage to boost returns.\nThe biggest winners, though, were those ETFs which bet on the index falling. Such funds, collectively managing about $871 million, were up an average 10.5 percent between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23, data from Lipper showed.\nThe biggest of them, db x-trackers ShortDax Daily UCITS ETF 1C, which manages $435 million but without using leverage, counted VW among its top-10 holdings and returned just over 6 percent during the period.\nBALL AND CHAIN?\nAny investors who fear VW's troubles could become a legal ball-and-chain dragging down its performance for years - like energy firm BP experienced after an explosion and oil leak at its Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010 - have access to no passive product that specifically excludes VW or autos.\nBlackRock, which is the world's biggest fund manager, said it had no plans yet to launch such a product, although index provider FTSE said it could create indexes that excluded VW or the autos sector, should investors demand it.\nNew ETFs could be sold off the back of such an index, while if the scandal festers long enough, active funds could also seek to change their mandates to track it instead of the full DAX.\nAt present, though, the nearest investors can get to a VW-free passive product is through a dividend-focused ETF which currently includes VW but would evict the stock if the company stopped paying. VW has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to cover the cost of recalling affected vehicles.\nOne such fund is BlackRock's iShares DivDAX, which includes the 15 DAX stocks with the best dividend yield.\n\"It is highly likely that a deteriorating fundamental outlook for VW, such as a missed dividend payment, will significantly cut VW exposure in smart beta ETFs,\" said Hector McNeil, co-CEO at ETF provider WisdomTree.\nWhile index trackers are forced to hold the carmakers in proportion to their 14 percent DAX weighting, the average for all Germany-focused funds was just 11.8 percent, and many active funds did not hold any of their stock.\nOf the $67 billion invested in Germany-focused active mutual funds, $41.4 billion is held in 116 equity funds, which collectively lost 4 percent between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23, Lipper data showed.\nOf those, just 22 funds managing a combined $6.2 billion had VW in their top-10 holdings. They fell 5.3 percent on average during the period.
