We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?\nSince graduating with a double degree in economics and political science in 2007, I have been working in the public service in a variety of roles from economist, government relations adviser and now, a senior policy analyst. I have been fortunate enough to work in the more competitive and prestigious central departments with apparently interesting work. However, I have felt severely unfulfilled and demotivated for the full eight years of my career.\nAt 31, I have an overwhelming desire for a career change into medicine. I have sat the graduate entry test into the course four times, putting in various degrees of effort, but never to the best of my ability. My last attempt yielded a satisfactory score for entry, however due to my lower grade point average, I was not offered an interview.\nIn an effort to change my situation, I have also applied for Teach for Australia (which is attractive as it is more hands-on and closer to outcomes). My dilemma is, should I continue to pursue dreams of gaining entry into medicine? And if yes, should I begin a completely new undergraduate degree in order to be more competitive? Or, in the meantime, should I continue to sit the entry test and pursue Teach for Australia which pays close to half my salary (as the extracurricular activities and experience can improve your competitiveness for some universities)?\nThe biggest challenge is giving up my current career, which many may be envious of, only for an opportunity to pursue gaining entry into medicine.\nDo you need advice on a work issue?
