Like any other country in the world today, we are looking for opportunities across the world whether in our traditional allies markets or in emerging markets,\" said CS Mohamed. \nShe assured participants that Kenya valued its traditional development partners and is keen to preserve and consolidate relations with them even as it engages other players in the global arena. \nShe said the Barclays Africa Forum was timely since it presented a unique opportunity for investors to acquire insights pertaining to trade and investments in Africa. \n\"I thank Barclays for hosting this event and for continuing to assist not only investors already operating in Africa but also those looking to expand their operations in the continent,\" she said. \nShe said the huge presence of representatives of British businesses is an indication of the growing interest in Africa and a reflection of shared desire to forge a new agenda that will drive growth and prosperity for all. \nCS Mohamed said the there is a new narrative in Africa that is far removed from the Afro pessimist narrative of the 1980s and 90s, that today talks of an African continent on the rise. \n\"Today in Africa democracy, political and economic stability have taken root; economies have become more open, societies more tolerant; and macro-economic indicators more stable and predictable,\" said the CS. \nThe results have been higher economic growth rates and a majority of the world's fastest growing economies today are in Africa. Foreign Direct Investments in the continent have increased and more than almost all other regions of the world, Africa offers better rates of return for enterprises that are establishing new marketing networks, new brands as well as innovative products. \nCS Mohamed said it was now easier to register businesses in Africa; tax systems are clearer and simpler, investment protection laws are stronger, and fiscal management is more prudent. \nConsequently, Africa's doing business rankings and transparency indicators have improved remarkably. This has led to a tremendous increase in the number of companies racing to establish a foothold in the continent. \nShe urged the UK to be part of this 'invaluable' part of unfolding narrative of the African renaissance. \n\"You have the resources, the expertise and skills in sectors as diverse as the financial services and the knowledge economy to oil and gas, green energy, agriculture and infrastructure. These are all areas in which British companies can add value that would be mutually beneficial in the long term,\" urged Mohamed. \nWritten by EDWIN LIMO // September 9, 2015 // 0 Comments \nShe said the positive trend in Africa is perhaps best reflected in Kenya. \"As you discuss business opportunities in Africa and as you explore strategic ways of positioning the UK, I would urge you to pay closer attention to Kenya. This is more so because Kenya and the UK enjoy a unique and longstanding relationship. This relationship is based on mutual respect, partnership and shared interests and is underpinned by a shared history, language, legal system, culture and values,\" she said. \nShe said UK remained the single largest source of foreign direct investment in Kenya from Europe. \n\"Currently, there are more than 100 British companies based in Kenya with a portfolio of over £2.3 billion. Most notable British firms include Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, GlaxoSmithKline, ACTIS (formerly CDC Capital Partners), De La Rue and Unilever. In addition to the large number of British firms in Kenya, the UK is the 2nd largest export destination of Kenyan products outside Africa,\" said Mohamed. \nThe CS thanked the Government of the United Kingdom for positively reviewing travel advisories on Kenya in June, this year saying the tourism sector had suffered serious setbacks due to travel advisories that have discouraged visitors from the country. \n\"Following this review, the UK has lifted previous restrictions on visits to Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties due to improved security situation. I urge the UK Government to review the advisories altogether to further boost the sector which has already shown strong signs of recovery,\" she said. \nShe said tourism was one of the key sectors of Kenya's economy which also offers enormous opportunities for investment. \nShe assured investors that Kenya is secure for tourism and investments noting that Kenya was working closely with the United Kingdom and other international partners in enhancing security and especially containing terrorism. \nCS Mohammed is accompanied by her Treasury colleague Henry Rotich. Also present was Jeremy Awori, MD Barclays Bank Kenya.
