The U.S. Department of Justice has started a criminal probe, according to media reports.\nSuh Sung-moon, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said the scandal would hurt South Korean demand for Volkswagen and Audi cars and benefit local brands such as Hyundai and sister firm Kia Motors.\n\"South Korean consumers are very sensitive to news, and this emission news will have an impact on the import market,\" he said.\nGerman car sales in South Korea have soared since a 2011 free-trade deal eliminated duties on vehicles imported from Europe.\nVehicle imports from Germany rose 18.2 percent to $4.5 billion in the first eight months of 2015, South Korean customs data show, following a 42.5 percent increase to $5.8 billion for all of 2014.\nDiesel models accounted for 68 percent of all cars imported into the country in the first half of the year.\nVolkswagen and Audi accounted for 28.2 percent of all foreign cars sold the in the first eight months of this year in South Korea, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association.
