Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle \"It's not a revolution as much as a restoration,\" one Turnbull backer observed of this weeks dramatic events in Canberra.\nHe wasn't referring to Malcolm Turnbull's return to the Liberal leadership six years after he was deposed, but to the great hope those who moved against Tony Abbott hold that the change will allow a return to proper government processes, revived political fortunes for the Coalition and an end to revolving door prime ministerships.\nThe complexities of running a government can't be underestimated, and the new Prime Minister and his staff got a blast of the retail end of those complexities this week when they found themselves having to run the government without the machinery in place to do it, and facing three days of Parliament.\nIn the Prime Minister's suite in Parliament House, Tony Abbott's staff were shredding everything in sight. The Prime Minister's diary – a joint operation of the office and the department, which has to accommodate a range of official commitments often made months in advance – was not available to the new office holder. Neither, it seemed, was the \"blue room\" where press conferences are traditionally conducted.\nWhen Turnbull had to fill the first of one of those long arranged official engagements – the signing of agreements with NSW and Victoria on the National Disability Insurance Scheme – it was done in a parliamentary committee room.\nTurnbull and his staff ran the country from the Communication Minister's office – with a cramped reception area now bursting with people needing to speak to the PM and his advisers – at the end of one of the corridors in the ministerial wing.\nSome crossbenches had never met Abbott He went into question time for three days with little preparation, and a frontbench and party room still reeling and bruised from the leadership change.\n A few people have been crucial for getting Turnbull through these days. He has the advantage of the experience of two Howard chiefs of staff to tap into: Tony Nutt has been seconded from the NSW party organisation to direct the transition. He and Turnbull's acting chief-of-staff Drew Clarke (Turnbull's departmental head in Communications) have been seen scurrying through Parliament House from meeting to meeting. Arthur Sinodinos, Nutt's predecessor as Howard's chief of staff, is also able to give advice from his senatorial office.\nAll the things that have to be done in the daily course of government – organising to talk to crossbenches, negotiate on issues with the Opposition – have had to be organised in addition to trying to set up a new administration.\n(Just one sign that a new broom has been sweeping through the place is that Turnbull spoke to most of the Senate crossbenches within 24 hours of becoming Prime Minister. Some of them had never met Tony Abbott).\nBut with Parliament rising for three weeks, Turnbull and those around him can turn to the much more difficult \"wholesale\" restructuring of the government.\nThe extent to which the government and its agenda will be completely remade in coming months should not be underestimated. At least the ambition is clearly there.\nThis weekend, Turnbull will be working on restructuring his cabinet , balancing – as all prime ministers have to – the political tasks of rewarding backers and not alienating opponents, while at the same time making sure the best people are put into the right jobs. There is the need for some continuity too, in some areas.\nHow the cabinet is structured in a Turnbull/Abbott loyalists sense will get the biggest headlines, along with the biggest winners and losers.\nPortfolio reallocation pending But consider some of the issues that come with such a big shake-up. For example, the national security committee of cabinet is probably the most powerful part of the government these days. Until this week it has comprised Abbott as the chairman, Warren Truss, Julie Bishop, George Brandis, Joe Hockey, Kevin Andrews, and Peter Dutton, with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann coming in as needed.\nUp to four of those members could change as a result of this week's events, giving Turnbull the chance to contemplate which portfolios, and which members of the government, might provide the best contributions to the committee, while still maintaining some institutional memory of what it has done in the past.\nEven more important will be the steps Turnbull takes to remove political and/or ideological straitjackets that have shaped and deformed a range of policy issues and to unwind the culture of \"fear and loathing\" that fell on the public service when Abbott sacked four permanent heads, including Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson.\nOne senior bureaucrat said shortly afterwards that he had found himself at a loss to know how to respond to more junior officers when they observed that the clear message from the sackings was that you shouldn't stick your head up for any policy assignments that might later become contentious. Instead of being a place to make your name, new policy papers and areas were now a killing zone, it seemed.\nConsider climate change. When the Nationals announced this week they had received a written commitment from Turnbull that there would be no push for an emissions trading scheme or carbon tax during the life of his prime ministership there was outrage from the left, who greeted the news by arguing Turnbull was just the same as Abbott.\nClimate change debate more complicated But the climate change debate is a bit more complicated than that.\nClimate change is obviously one of the trickiest issues for Turnbull. It was, after all, the issue that killed his leadership last time, when he was replaced by \"axe the tax\" Abbott.\nHe pledged this week to maintain the party's current Direct Action Scheme, which he has in the past described as \"bullsh**\".\nBut there is actually a lot of room for him to manoeuvre despite this.\nJust removing the shadow of uncertainty that has hung over renewable energy under Abbott and his wind turbine-hating Treasurer, would make a huge difference to the investment climate in Australia. He could remove the restrictions placed on the investment options of the government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The constraining weight of mantras like \"coal is good for humanity\" have also just been lifted from the backs of the government's ministers.\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop spent months dragging Abbott inch by inch towards the emissions reductions goals that Australia will take to climate talks in Paris in November.\nThey were hemmed in by his refusal to consider allowing trade in international carbon permits part of the system. The likelihood that these constraints will hamper the government's position on climate change in the future seems to have dissipated with the change of leadership.\nFor example, if Australia's proposals are not seen to be compatible with the Paris conference's targets, there will be much more room to negotiate.\nSimilarly, it quickly became clear that the new team would drop Abbott's plans to excise a section of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to prevent third parties mounting legal challenges against mines and other developments.\nIn the defence portfolio, it was Abbott not Turnbull, that struck a deal with the Japanese Prime Minister about Australia buying Japanese submarines. Separate from any consideration of where the submarines will be built (for which you can now confidently say \"mainly in Adelaide\"), the political constraints on the submarine contract negotiations have now been removed. The Japanese bid can be assumed now to be on a new and equal footing with those from Germany and France.\nWhile the overall architecture of asylum-seeker policy is not likely to change, there is considerable anxiety among the ranks of Turnbull backers that the government now find a rapid solution to the fate of people stuck rotting on Manus Island and Nauru.\nEconomic discussion can start anew Finally, there is the economic debate itself where, once again, Abbott and Hockey had in conjunction, or at cross purposes, talked themselves into a corner on everything from fiscal consolidation to tax reform. All those discussions can start anew with new advocates.\nOn Thursday, in answer to the last question of the day from Bill Shorten about Abbott's \"$100,000 university degrees\" – and after three days of batting off Labor questioning about new policy directions – Turnbull let drop that all policies would now be up for review.\nThat leaves open the prospect of contentious policies such as the deregulation of university fees and plans to dump environmental laws to prevent legal challenges to big projects being dumped, shelved or amended.\n\"Every policy of any rational, constructive government is always under review, of course,\" Turnbull said.\n\"Our Cabinet will examine the challenges that we face, the policies that we have, we'll develop new policies.\"\nOne of the few policy areas Turnbull has already identified as up for change – in line with his optimistic message bout Australia's future – is innovation policy. He wants to refashion the way government and the bureaucracy think about supporting enterprise and innovation – as Catherine Livingstone and the Business Council of Australia advocated last year – instead of thinking about \"industry policy\".\nThat inevitably means fresh eyes on education, research and development policies.\nSome things are likely to continue. The royal commission into trade unions, for example, perhaps will not be pursued with quite the feral anticipation of delivering the scalp of Shorten that it once was.\nBut so much will also change, like the obsessive focus on national security and being perpetually photographed with policemen and defence personnel, replaced, it seems with the more optimistic message about Australia's great opportunities that we heard from Turnbull on Monday night.\n\"Hope not nope\" was how this week's shift has been summed up. Now we find out whether the hopes can be delivered on.\nLaura Tingle is the AFR's political editor", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:48:44.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
