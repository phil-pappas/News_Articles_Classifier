Besides higher indirect tax revenue, the government could use savings in fuel subsidies to step up public investment to boost economic activity.\nThe indirect tax collections stood at Rs 2.63 lakh crore in April-August, with 69.7% growth in excise duty collections, 21.6% in service tax and 21.1% in customs duties. Without additional tax measures, customs duties grew by 15.4%, excise duties by 9% and service tax by 11.9%.\nIndia’s economy grew at a slower-than-expected rate of 7% in Q1FY16, which Subramanian had said could be an underestimate. He expected the economy to grow by about 8% in FY16.\nThe additional measures taken in this year’s budget including hike in median excise duty from 12.36% to 12.5%, increase in excise duty on diesel and petrol, withdrawal of excise benefits for auto sector and increase in service tax rate from 12.36% to 14% from June helped the collections. The customs duty collections were helped by rupee depreciation.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 7:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:27:27.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
