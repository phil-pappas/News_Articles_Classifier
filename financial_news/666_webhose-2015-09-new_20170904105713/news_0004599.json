Bruce Mercer by Jeremy Chunn The chart here shows the frequency of daily returns for the S&P/ASX 200 for the past 12 months, divided into brackets of 0.2 per cent.\nThe data is bunched together in a symmetrical hump that tapers away on either side, similar to the \"bell\" shape of the normal distribution familiar to high school students.\nThe short red boxes along the bottom are the daily data for the past 26 trading days.\nThe flat distribution is ominous. Note that both extreme end points occurred in the past month.\nAFR Graphic For the past year, the index has lost an average 0.021 per cent a day. For the past month, it's lost an average 0.218 per cent a day.\nThe variance in returns, or standard deviation, has also increased dramatically. For the past year, it's been 0.986 per cent; for the past month, it's been 1.635 per cent.\nYes, the market is more volatile than is usual.\nIt's not twice as volatile, but it's not far off.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:03:45.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
