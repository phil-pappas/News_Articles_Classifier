The cuts will be announced as early as Monday, according to several reports.\nEarlier, daily Estado de S.Paulo reported that Rousseff had decided to cut at least 15 billion reais of next year's budget, which was sent to Congress with a deficit of about 30 billion reais.\nFolha, which tends to lean center-right, said deep budget cuts are needed for the government to gain credibility before demanding more tax hikes that will face strong popular opposition.\n\"The country, however, has no choice\" but to accept higher taxes, Folha said. \"Neither has President Dilma Rousseff: if she bends under the weight of the crisis, she will have no option other than leaving her presidential duties and, eventually, the position she holds.\"\nFolha also called for an end to some pension benefits and economic subsidies, as well as temporary cuts in health and education programs that are currently mandatory.\nA spokeswoman for Rousseff declined to comment on the editorial.\n($1 = 3.87 reais) (Reporting by Walter Brandimarte ; Editing by Paul Simao and Bill Trott)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T04:42:44.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
