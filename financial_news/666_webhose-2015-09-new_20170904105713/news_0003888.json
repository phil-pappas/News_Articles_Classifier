Water disruptions potentially can have a significant effect on a company’s supply chain. As a result, money managers, fund managers and individual investors are putting more weight on the potential for water shortages as a risk factor for investments.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Search for Low-Volatility Investments Beyond 9/11: Alger Comes Back Hulbert on Bear-Market Havens Can You Use a “529” for Airfare? U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month Four years ago, Daniel Wild and his team at RobecoSAM, a Swiss asset-management firm specializing in socially responsible finance, or sustainability investing, saw such a gap.\nFor instance, could a company like Nike Inc., NKE 1.88 % which uses water-intensive cotton, be hit by drought or water scarcity in regions where it produces shoes and clothing? How would utilities such as nuclear power plants cool their facilities when groundwater and reservoirs are low and earmarked for public consumption?\nChecking exposure “What we are trying to find out is whether companies are aware of their own exposure to water risks and whether they are taking appropriate measures,” says Mr. Wild, a former water engineer whose firm works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to publish the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. “We ask how companies address water, what do they know, how do they quantify what they know, what are their Plan B’s?” (News Corp’s Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, formerly had a stake in S&P Dow Jones Indices.)\nMr. Wild and his team ended up tweaking their existing assessment weighing environmental, social and governance factors to include a greater emphasis on water. These include how companies save water or how they deal with local water regulators.\nOthers have since followed suit, helping investors assess whether their portfolios could suffer, or benefit, from such environmental concerns as droughts, tighter regulatory environments and new infrastructure needs.\nThe fund-research firm Morningstar Inc. recently said it plans to start grading all mutual and exchange-traded funds on environmental, social and governance factors, not just funds that identify themselves as sustainable or socially responsible. The company cited as a main driver for the move a study by Morgan Stanley MS 3.25 % ’s Institute for Sustainable Investing, which found 71% of individual investors are interested in sustainable investing.\nDroughts in Brazil inspired Marcello Siniscalchi, chief investment officer at Brazil’s Itaú Asset Management, to design a stress test for global companies that assumes water will become scarcer, costlier and more regulated.\n“What we’ve done is suppose in the next 10 years that this [situation of shrinking water supplies] will be universal,” he says, adding that he can also forecast the impact that an event such as water rationing could have on a country’s GDP or inflation rates.\nMonika Freyman, senior manager of the Water Program at the Boston-based nonprofit Ceres, co-wrote a report titled “An Investor Handbook for Water Integration,” which looks at risks investors face from water scarcity and the need to incorporate water issues into their investment strategies. The report surveyed 35 managers and owners from around the world with assets ranging from $100 million to $950 billion.\nAmong other things, the report advocates incorporating water risk into analyst buy/sell decisions for specific companies and increasing corporate disclosure on water-management plans.\nThere can be ways for investors to benefit from water scarcity.

They should engage their money managers on these questions and ask if they have a water-risk filter,” says Ms. Freyman, who adds that investment firms are just waking up to concerns about global water risks. “Even if investors don’t have all the data, they can still make assumptions on exposure to water risks for specific sectors and locations with help from third-party research providers,” she says.\nThere are some free ways that investors can gauge if their portfolios are exposed to water risks. The World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct mapping tool shows what parts of the world are experiencing water stress and makes forecasts about water risks. London-based CDP produces an annual report using individual company data to assess whether and how companies are managing freshwater resources. And the WWF, or World Wildlife Fund, has produced a water-risk questionnaire that helps investors and companies identify water risks in supply chains and investment portfolios.\nThere can also be ways for investors to benefit from water scarcity. Funds in this niche invest in companies that provide solutions to global water problems, typically in terms of repairing or improving water infrastructure.\n“In the U.S. alone, a water main breaks every other minute, and it is increasingly being shown on TV,” says Matt Sheldon, co-portfolio manager of Calvert Global Water Fund (CFWAX). “While water infrastructure is generally ‘out of sight, out of mind,’ it is increasingly in sight, and usually in a bad way. Given its criticality, when water infrastructure breaks, it gets fixed.”\nMr. Davidson is a writer in San Francisco.
