Some have predicted another may be coming, but central bank governor Godwin Emefiele said in July that the currency was \"appropriately priced\". \nCurrency forwards, a derivative product used to hedge against future exchange rate moves, reflected expectations of a weaker naira with the 1-year non-deliverable forwards (NGN1YNDFOR=) on Nigeria's currency rising 2.79 percent to 268.50 \n\"The basic story is very clear the currency is too expensive ... The question now is, does the central bank devalue the currency to respond or tighten down even more on other capital measures to try and prolong the inevitable,\" said Arko Sen, director EMEA strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nBuhari has said he found the treasury \"virtually empty\", forcing him to deal with inherited problems, along with the impact of falling oil prices on Africa's top crude producer, which relies on sales for 70 percent of government revenues. \nBut investors and business leaders say the lack of a finance minister, and general uncertainty around the cabinet which Buhari has said will be appointed later this month, has resulted in a lack of clear policies that has hurt the economy. \nJP Morgan had warned Nigeria that to stay in the index, it would have to restore liquidity to its currency market in a way that allowed foreign investors tracking the index to conduct transactions with minimal hurdles. \nOn Wednesday, Buhari's spokesman Femi Adesina declined to comment on JP Morgan's decision beyond a government statement issued late on Tuesday saying liquidity for financial markets was improving. \nIn an indication of the dire state of public finances, the head of Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund said authorities had not made any payments to the fund this year. \nThe last contribution to the fund, worth $1 billion, came from the previous government in 2014, said Uche Orji, Chief Executive of the Nigeria Investment Authority, which rolls out infrastructure projects and serves as a future generation fund. \n\"We haven't got additional funds from the government but the fund is structured in a way that it can go through hard times,\" he told reporters in Abuja after meeting Buhari. \n(Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London, Ed Cropley and Alexis Akwagyiram; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram and Ulf Laessing; Editing by Anna Willard and Gareth Jones)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:22:05.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
