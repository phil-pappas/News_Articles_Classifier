Andrew Meares Abbott had a simple strategy to make a clean break from Labor's legacy and his own pre-election rhetoric. It was the 2014 budget which, with one king hit, would put the budget firmly on the road to surplus.\nIt was one of the oldest gambits in the politician's handbook: stuff all the tough decisions into the post-election budget and give the voters two years to calm down and see the benefits of your reforms.\nBut the strategy assumed that the Senate would pass the government's budget measures, just as it had passed the Howard government's tax and industrial relations reforms.\nDeterioration With the election of the Palmer United Party to the Senate the passing of the budget seemed a foregone conclusion. But of course it wasn't.\nMoreover, the deterioration of the outlook for economic growth that had dogged Labor's budgets now dogged Abbott. Even on the Monday of the spill you could still hear commentators and politicians talking about the deterioration of the budget deficit, as if it was some kind of profit and loss account.\nAs Abbott and his Treasurer, Joe Hockey, might have explained, the budget is designed to \"deteriorate\" when the economy temporarily weakens. By doing so, it acts as a shock absorber for the whole economy and saves businesses and jobs.\nOf course, if economic growth weakens permanently, our spending has to adjust to our new, less prosperous circumstances.\nThe problem is in distinguishing the temporary from the permanent deteriorations.\nSometimes, when your own economy is going through a major transition and the world economy is weak, there is a strong case for giving the economy time to find its true level. An advantage of having little debt is that you can afford to wait.\nIndeed, if the government happens to have a backlog of socially useful infrastructure projects, this can be a very good time to wheel them out. In fact, it can be a good time to increase spending on other programs that will increase the future strength of the economy, including education and health.\nBut this is real budget management, as opposed to the comic book version that Abbott used against Labor.\nAs prime minister he more or less implemented the former, but he has been judged according to the latter.\nTurnbull has promised a different style of leadership: one that is consultative, that respects people's intelligence, explains complex issues, and sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case of fit.\nBut, in the speech launching his challenge, he glossed over the difficulties that lie below the surface of those complex issues, and generally gave the public the impression that, with the right style, disruptive technical change will be our friend and everything will be much easier.\nThis is reminiscent of Abbott's mistake, and it is one that Turnbull should correct before it becomes built into the public's expectations.\nOne way to begin this process might be to explain the complex issues involved in industry and trade policy.\nFor example, he could explain the challenges and opportunities of exposing government procurement to the discipline of global competition.\nTurnbull no doubt will be shocked to learn that there are celebrations in Adelaide because people think some secret deal involving Christopher Pyne has been done to save the submarine industry.\nSurely that can't be true.\nAlan Mitchell is the AFR's economic editor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:03:20.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
