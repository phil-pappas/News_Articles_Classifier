Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has led one of the best company turnarounds seen in years. Quinn Rooney Share on twitter by James Thomson It seems obvious that the dream job for any executive who wants a big pay day would be to head one of the big banks. Or maybe a giant miner, or a conglomerate like Wesfarmers. Or maybe landing the chief executive's job at CSL, or Woodside would be the path to a big pay packet.\nBut if you really want to see your salary skyrocket, there is another, much more risky path to tread – a rescue job on a much-loved group that has become a bit of a basket case.\nOn Thursday evening, perhaps the best example of this trend, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, gave an address at the Turnaround Management Association conference being held in Melbourne.\nMr Joyce has been to hell and back rebuilding the fortunes of Australia's national carrier.\nLast month, just 1-½ years after Qantas was talking to the government about some sort of bailout, Joyce delivered an underlying profit of $975 million and even signalled that capital returns would again start flowing to Qantas' very patient shareholders.\nAs a result, Mr Joyce's pay packet tripled to nearly $12 million, with his take-home pay jumping from $2 million to $6.7 million and long term incentives hitting $4.6 million.\nIt's a big jump, but as chairman Leigh Clifford pointed out, Qantas' market value has grown to $8 billion from $2 billion over the past three years.\nAnother turnaround chief executive who has been well rewarded is Mike Clarke at Treasury Wine Estates, who took home $4.5 million for his first full year in the job. In the year ended June 30, Treasury swung to a net profit after tax of $77.6 million from the year-earlier loss of $101 million; more than half of Mr Clarke's pay was \"performance-related\".\n There are historic examples too. Nine Entertainment chief executive David Gyngell famously led the company from near-collapse to a (relatively) successful IPO in December 2013. In financial 2014, he took home $19.6 million, boosted by a massive, short-term incentive related to the float.\nPerhaps the most famous example – and arguably the best turnaround of recent times – is Ian McLeod, the former chief executive of Wesfarmers' supermarkets business, Coles. After leading Coles out of the wilderness and into the position as the fastest-growing grocer in the country, Mr McLeod was paid $14.8 million in fiscal 2012 and $10.74 million the following year. He would end up earning $44 million in his four years with Coles.\nTurnarounds are of course, never easy for a chief executive – they are high-stress, highly time consuming and high-risk. For every Qantas there's a Billabong, which chewed through a few chief executives before a turnaround really took hold.\nMr Joyce, Mr Gyngell, Mr Mcleod and Mr Clarke deserve to be well rewarded for what they've done. But they also show there are different ways to the top of the salary ladder.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-09-04T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:08:34.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
