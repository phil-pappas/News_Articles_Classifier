Learn when from CEO Kunal Bahl ZTEsoft Partners With KPN to Realize OSS Transformation Google on Monday announced the launch of a programme to offer Android Nanodegrees in India in partnership with Udacity. As part of the programme Google and Tata Trusts will offer 1,000 scholarships for the Android Nanodegree to deserving students across the country.\nThe programme is aimed to transform India into a hub of high-quality mobile developers for global and local apps.\nThe Android Nanodegree is an education credential that is designed to help developers learn new skills and advance their careers in a few months from anywhere on any device at their own pace.\nWith India being the second largest developer population in the world with 3 million software developers, India has the potential to become the #1 developer population by 2018, with 4 million developers. By providing easy and affordable access to a world-class skill and educational program to Indian developers, Google aims to help India become a global leader in mobile app development.\nThe Udacity Android Nanodegree programme comprises courses developed and taught by expert Google instructors from the Google Developer Relations team and will include project reviews, mentorship and career services from Udacity. The curriculum will be updated regularly with new releases and will provide developers with a certificate that will help them to become a more marketable Android developer.\n“While India has millions of software developers, we still lag behind in creating world-class apps. With the launch of this programme we want to bridge the gap by providing India’s developer community an easy access to learn and build high quality apps for the world. Today, only 2% of apps built in India feature in the top 1000 apps globally and our goal is to raise this to 10% in next three years. We’re pleased to announce, that Google along with Tata Trusts will offer 500 free scholarships each to developers for Android Developer Nanodegree program, ” Rajan Anandan, vice president & managing director, Google South East Asia & India said.\n“Our mission at Udacity is to democratize education for everyone to help people get the jobs they want and they dream of,” said Sebastian Thrun, founder and CEO of Udacity.\nThe Udacity Android Nanodegree programme is open for enrollment right now. The programme takes an average of 6-9 months and costs Rs. 9,800 per month with Udacity refunding 50 percent of the tuition upon completion. Google will also host a career summit for thirty of the top graduates from the Android Nanodegree programme in Bangalore by end of this year.\n 21, 2015 3:16 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:38:28.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
