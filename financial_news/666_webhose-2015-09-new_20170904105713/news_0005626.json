Its chief executive resigned , the stock price is plunging, and there’s the looming threat of prosecution and billions of dollars in fines.\nThe scandal surrounds Volkswagen’s admission that software on some of its diesel-powered cars manipulated U.S. emissions tests. As many as 11 million vehicles contained the software and are possibly subject to a global recall.\nThe irony, from an advertising perspective, is that Volkswagen has made fuel efficiency a hallmark of its U.S. marketing. And with good reason: diesel-powered cars tend to be highly fuel efficient. But as The Wall Street Journal reported, that comes with a trade-off in terms of emissions. Volkswagen is alleged to have used software that allowed its cars to appear less polluting during testing than they were in real-world driving.\nSo far this year, Volkswagen has aired 36 different television spots, and 14 are focused on “Clean Diesel” products, according to ad tracker iSpot.tv.\nThe various ads promote the brand’s fuel efficiency and diesel cars’ relative performance.\nFor example, iSpot.tv estimates that VW spent $13.6 million, or 8.25% of its TV ad spending, on a spot called “Mom,” which has aired 3,466 times. The ad features a group of children destroying a gas station convenience store while a mother fills up her vehicle’s tank. Another mom, in a Volkswagen Passat, drives by with well-behaved kids in tow -- the idea being that the car is so fuel-efficient she does not have to stop.\nAnother recent ad featured a group of old women riding along with a race car driver who dispels the myth that diesel cars are more sluggish.\nAccording to iSpot.tv, Volkswagen has spent about $164.7 million this year on TV ads.\nVolkswagen didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:30:25.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
