Now you can buy a simple smartphone attachment to reveal the widely varying temperatures of the people and things around you.\nMaybe you’re not up for hunting Arnold Schwarzenegger, like the heat-seeing alien hunter in the classic 1987 film “Predator.” There are many practical home uses for the latest thermal camera accessories from Flir and Seek, too: finding your missing cat hiding in the dark under the porch, diagnosing a blocked pipe in your bathroom or seeing how much propane is left in your gas grill’s tank. These cameras also allow you to peer into a previously invisible thermal landscape, revealing surprising views of the world around you.\nMuch like any super power, there are limitations to this extrasensory ability. Glass is good at letting through visible light, but filters out the kind of infrared radiation we know as heat. What makes them good for windows makes them nearly opaque to heat-sensing cameras. These thermal cameras will show the temperature of the glass surface, but if someone is standing just behind the window (and not touching it), that person will remain largely invisible—though you may see your heat reflected in the glass back at you. In fact, thermal cameras’ lenses aren’t made from regular glass, but require special materials such as germanium, which allow this range of infrared light to pass.\nENLARGE The Seek Compact thermal camera for iPhone. Photo: SEEK THERMAL These cameras are also very low-resolution compared to the many-megapixel cameras built into our phones today. Images appear blurry, and video frame rates are slow. Even still, the feeling you get—looking out into total darkness and seeing a vibrant thermal landscape—is incredible.\nFlir One Vs Seek Compact\nI tested two of these new thermal cameras on my iPhone 5S: The Seek Compact camera by Seek Thermal Inc. and Flir Systems Inc. FLIR -2.13 % ’s Flir One camera. Though both plug into my iPhone’s Lightning port, Seek’s camera has the edge in size. It is smaller than a 9-volt battery, while the Flir One is slightly wider than my iPhone 5S—and almost twice as thick. Both cameras come with rugged cases for throwing in your bag, though the Seek’s case is waterproof and seems much more sturdy.\nExploring the World of Thermal Vision The Seek Thermal camera has no power switch, no battery or port for charging, as it’s powered by your phone. This makes for a very elegant, simple design—no extra cables or chargers to worry about. But it does take a serious toll on your phone’s battery. Flir took a different approach, with an internal battery you must charge with the included mini-USB cable. In my testing, the Flir’s battery provided for just over an hour of continual use.\nThe other big difference, one that ultimately makes Flir the better choice for most people, is that the Flir One actually has two cameras on board, a low-resolution traditional one in addition to the thermal. The real-time image on your phone is a composite of the two camera feeds, with high-contrast “edges” from the full-color camera providing much-needed definition to all of the thermal blobs. This is most helpful when you go back to look at your images later. In many cases, you’d otherwise have no clue what you’re looking at.\nBoth cameras are available for either Apple iOS devices—using the Lightning interface—or Android devices using MicroUSB. They cost the same, at $250 a piece.\nENLARGE Their apps allow you to shoot stills or video, and tap any part of the screen for an instant temperature reading in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. The Seek has a greater range of temperatures it can sense, from -40° way up to 626° F. The Flir One only has a range of -4° to 248° F.\nBut Flir currently has the edge in software. When browsing its in-app gallery of still photos, you can swipe between the full-color image and the thermal one. Seek gives you a live side-by-side view, using the built-in iPhone camera, but the images don’t line up well, and the tools Seek does offer to make use of this don’t work very well. Besides, the full-color images aren’t saved with the thermals.\nFlir also has a cool time-lapse feature built in, so you can watch how your waffle iron heats up, or how the ground cools as the sun sets. You can even shoot a thermal panorama. On the technical side, Flir’s app provides more options, too, such as allowing you to lock in a temperature range as you would exposure settings on a camera.\nFlir’s framerate seems to be slightly higher than the Seek, and feels like it recalibrates to the current scene faster as well. Seek says that it is engineered for precision and range. It plays down these software perks, which may not be deal-breakers for people who will use thermal cameras in their work. In fact, the Seek’s biggest benefit is its superior, larger sensor which gives it that wider temperature range. It can be a better pick for more technical applications, albeit ones best wielded by people who know what they’re doing.\nEither way, connecting these devices quickly brings up a view of the world that you may never before have seen, despite being right there in front of your face.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CD189_THERMA_16U_20150901152414.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CD189_THERMA_9U_20150901152414.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB964_0901TH_H_20150831143912.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB964_0901TH_P_20150831143912.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KB964_0901TH_M_20150831143912.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:09:59.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
