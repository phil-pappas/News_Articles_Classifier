Simon Letch by Jemima Whyte Paul Taylor, who manages $4.3 billion on behalf of Fidelity Investments, clearly recalls when private equity swooped with a $430 million bid for Colorado Group in 2006.\n\"Private equity saved us,\" he says. \"We'd bought it and were getting a bit concerned about the situation, our thesis wasn't playing out.\"\nEqually, Arnhem Investment Management's George Clapham remembers how Swiss-based Hess Family Wine Estates moved on South Australian winemaker Peter Lehmann in 2003, delivering investors a record price on a per-case basis.\n\"We couldn't believe the price,\" he says.\nWhen bidders come knocking, it can deliver a windfall for investors in the target company, as holders of Oil Search, which operates oilfields in Papua New Guinea, discovered this week.\nShares are up 11 per cent per cent since Woodside Petroleum offered one of its shares for every four shares in Oil Search, and are trading above the implied offer price in anticipation there's more to come.\nIt's the latest mega-deal in the Australian market this year, adding to Japan Post's $6.5 billion takeover of logistics company Toll Holdings, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners' $8.9 billion offer for port and rail group Asciano and the $12 billion merger of retail property giants Federation Centres and Novion Property Group.\nM&A activity gearing up\n Australian mergers and acquisitions volumes are already higher than last year's, and the expectation is there is more to come. The hunting season is expected to last for a while yet.\nOr at least that's what investors are hoping.\nAfter an earnings season which proved to be a little less upbeat about growth prospects than the last half and with cost cutting regarded as almost having done its dash, investors could do worse than to think about how they can invest in the market's next corporate takeover target.\nIt's not that simple but it definitely pays off.\nConsider this. Shareholders in Asciano watched their shares surge more than 16 per cent on news of the Brookfield offer, while Toll Holdings shares jumped more than 32 per cent following the offer from Japan Post.\nGlobally, cheap debt and a lower earnings growth environment are helping to fuel a global boom in mergers and acquisitions as companies look to boost their earnings growth through deals.\nGlobal volumes in mergers and acquisitions is on pace to surpass $US4 trillion in 2015, the highest level since the financial crisis and the second highest on record.\nGoldman Sachs' head of mergers and acquisitions, Nick Sims, says Australian M&A is tracking \"pretty solidly\", pointing out that offshore companies buying up local groups has been the dominant theme for some time.\nAustralia viewed in positive light\n\"Offshore investors continue to see Australia as a great place to invest and are perhaps not as negative on the Australian economic outlook as we can be ourselves,\" he says, noting that while the lower Australian dollar is often cited as a reason for a spike in offshore companies going shopping locally, there's actually very little correlation on a historical basis.\n\"There are undoubtedly still opportunities for Australian listed entities to consolidate sectors and drive synergy benefits.\"\nSo the deals are coming. But who's next?\nProfessional investors all make the point that investing on the hope of corporate activity alone is a fool's game.\nConcise Asset Management's Andrew King, whose mid-market focused fund owned shares in Asciano before the Brookfield bid, says the trick is making sure the company stacks up as an investment on its own merits.\n\"You can never know when,\" he says.\n\"The fall back is if this stock does get too cheap, there's a backdrop. There's always balance sheet support, always dividend support and the earnings are sustainable. If the market doesn't recognise the value someone else will.\"\nBut there are companies where many believe it's only a question of when, not if, they receive a bid.\nSouth 32, which houses the aluminium, silver, lead, zinc and thermal coal assets that BHP Billiton spun off this year, consistently tops the list.\nIts balance sheet is well supported, with little debt, and with a market capitalisation of about $9 billion, is an attractive size for a major resources company looking to diversify its assets.\nTreasury Wines, spun out of Foster's, also fits the bill, and is the subject of endless speculation about when it will be taken out because of its brand portfolio, which includes Penfolds, and its market share.\nEarly this year, private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Private tabled an indicative offer of $3.4 billion which was rejected on the basis it was too conditional and undervalued the assets.\nIn both cases, the fact the companies have been spun out from larger parents only adds to the expectation that they will be on the radar of cashed-up predators.\n\"I'm a great believer in that management should spin out companies if they're not adding value, provided its in-specie and not so costly,\" says Arnhem Capital's Clapham, noting that Recall is a recent example, having been snapped up by Iron Mountain after being spun out of Brambles, although there have been plenty of others.\n\"Once you narrow the focus, get rid of the unwanted part of the businessâ€¦then they become takeover targets.\"\nIt also allows investors to determine the price at which they will sell the assets, rather than rely on management to time an asset sale to perfection, he says.\nSpotting a takeover target\nBeulah Capital chief investment officer Peter Mavromatis, who runs a managed account specifically screening between 15 and 25 takeover targets, says there are other characteristics that can signal a potential takeover target to investors.\nThese include at least two of the following: a strategic shareholding, a previous takeover bid, a monopolistic or dualistic industry structure, an underutilised balance sheet or strong cash flow; likely industry consolidation and/or substantial changes in the regulatory or legal environment.\nOn that basis, Melbourne-based Belulah, which has about $400 million in funds under management, had internet service provider iiNet in its portfolio before TPG tabled its bid, but Toll Holdings, Oil Search and Asciano did not meet its criteria.\nTwo companies that Belulah has recently decided to include in its \"takeover target\" portfolio are Qube Logistics, which is chaired by Chris Corrigan and is Australia's largest integrated provider of import and export logistics services, and rail operator Aurizon.\nIn both cases, Mavromatis says, the companies are well-placed for a takeover bid because of the industry structure and expectations of further consolidation.\nMavromatis expects takeover activity spread to other sectors. \"Despite the volatility that's happening overseas, companies still have this huge appetite for deals,\" he says. \"It hasn't really hit Australia just yet. We think there is going to be more activity in the telco and ISP space.\"\nOther speculated potential corporate targets include agribusiness Graincorp, which has former suitor Archer Daniels Midlands remaining on its share register after Treasurer Joe Hockey kyboshed a bid from the US-based group.\nIn the infrastructure sector, energy utility company DUET Group is a frequently speculated source of corporate activity. Possible suitors include Spark Infrastructure, which has a strategic stake in the company, and APA Group.\nHolding shares in a corporate target is a great start, but professionals say the game doesn't always end there.\nEven if the takeover doesn't close, says Fidelity's Taylor, investors can benefit.\n\"Sometimes even when a takeover doesn't happen it can be good for the target, because it definitely focuses the management,\" he says, citing Treasury Wines as one example.\nOthers move in to chase investment returns only after the takeover offer is first tabled.\nFailed takeover bids can still have benefits\nThis week, for example, Belulah has added Oil Search to its portfolio on the expectation there will be a higher, or competing, bid flushed out by Woodside's approach.\nFortitude Capital's John Corr runs an event-arbitrage fund, which trades around mergers and acquisitions activity and only ever starts to invest after an approach has been.\n\"We look at the transaction where we think the risks will be. To assess the downside, and not just assess the upside,\" he says.\n\"Of course not all deals are scrip transactions.\nCorr emphasises scrip-based deals can be very idiosyncratic, and often there is a big variation between the headline number and the final value.\nHe also says pricing regulatory risk isn't always well understood by the market, citing how long the Iron Mountain-Recall deal has taken to jump through the various regulatory hoops.\nCorr is betting that event-arbitrage trades will become more profitable as fewer investors look to trade them.\n\"What we expect now is wider margins as US rates start to go up, and there's a more volatile equity market, it will discourage people to do trades for very little money and low returns,\" he says.\nCorr isn't the only one who is cautious about scrip-based offers, which are expected to be favoured by companies over cash deals.\nGoldman Sachs' Sims says scrip-based bids will be a common feature of M&A deals.\n\"I think acquiring companies in this environment is when more want to use paper as consideration as the deals being done are strategic. Target shareholders can also benefit,\" he says.\nScrutinise scrip offers\nFidelity's Taylor says there's a clear signal when a company offers scrip, and warns investors to always start from the point that the majority of M&A destroys value for the acquirer.\n\"Your starting point is the acquirer will destroy value. Every time you see an acquisition you should be sceptical. Some companies do create value through M&A, [but] they are just the minority,\" he says.\n\"When you own the acquirer you've got to go in sceptical.\"\nTaylor also says that any scrip-based offers require a bit more thought, to understand why the acquirer is offering shareholders shares rather than cash.\nPutting aside the potential pitfalls, there's no doubt that professional investors are eager to see the return of mega M&A - and are confident it is on its way.\n\"I think the environment is right,\" says Arnhem's Clapham.\n\"You've got low interest rates, we don't have a GFC so there's no counterparty risk and balance sheets are pretty good. There's companies [in the US] that are just bolting on businesses because their organic revenue growth so is 1 per cent to 2 per cent, so they have to supplement with acquisitions. And you never know where private equity is sniffing around.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:05:22.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
