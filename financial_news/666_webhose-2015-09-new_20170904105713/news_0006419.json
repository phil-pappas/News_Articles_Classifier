Here’s what the deal, which still keeps tabs on Iran’s nuclear program, means economically.\nIran: Iran is clearly the top winner, with its $388 billion economy likely to reach 6 percent growth as early as 2016, according to Garbis Iradian, chief economist for the Middle East and North Africa at the Institute of International Finance.\nOil prices: As home to the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves, Iran is likely to increase its production as much as 800,000 barrels a day in 2016. Still, at 1 percent of today’s global oil supply, it may not have much of an impact on an already oversupplied market, according to a report last week from A.T. Kearney Inc. The firm is projecting that Brent oil prices in 2016 will probably stay in the range of $45 to $65 a barrel.\nThe U.S.: Even after the nuclear deal is implemented, sanctions preventing most U.S. companies from dealing with Iran will remain in place. The agreement won’t move the needle on U.S. growth as a whole in 2016, said George Abed, senior counselor and director for Africa & the Middle East at the Institute of International Finance. It won’t affect global growth either, he said. One significant exception is the aviation industry. The deal calls for the U.S. to grant licenses to allow the sale of commercial passenger aircraft, with Iran needing to invest at least $20 billion to update its aging fleet.\nThere are also American companies for which the deal might be a threat, such as California pistachio growers. Iran’s pistachio crop was worth more than $1 billion last year, comparable with what U.S. farmers grew, and the deal says the U.S. will allow Iranian pistachios imports to the U.S.\nEurope: For Europe, removing international sanctions against the Islamic Republic may mean regaining its pre-sanctions status as Iran’s biggest trading partner and restoring what was once $32 billion of economic links. Trade between Europe and Iran plunged to about $9 billion when sanctions began to be tightened, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As European exports of machinery and industrial equipment to Iran tailed off, China filled the void. By 2013, China was Iran’s biggest partner, with trade amounting to more than $41 billion.\nEuropean delegations began courting Iran well before the nuclear deal was reached, with business leaders seeing sources of cheap oil and a new market to invest in.\nIf recent history is an indicator, which European countries have the most business ties with Iran? Italy ranks as the biggest importer of Iranian goods, while Germany is the top European exporter to Iran, according to Eurostat.\nKasia Klimasinska\nand Sangwon Yoon,\nBloomberg Business News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:51:49.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
