The operators will share infrastructure and rules of engagement with each other and settlement of payments. \nRead: Equity takes on Safaricom with money transfer \nFSD is putting into operation the regulations and borrowing from the experience of South Africa, the UK and Australia, which already have such institutions operating. \n\"Central Bank will empower members of the association to self-regulate each other. The body is under formation and when institutionalised, it will create regulations that will manage interchange charges,\" said Kenya Bankers Association CEO Habil Olaka. \nThe changes come into play after a surcharge fight that has seen Equitel money transfer charges rise following Safaricom's decision to increase bank-to-mobile charges. \nThe changes, which are currently being reviewed, have prompted Equity Bank to demand an explanation from Safaricom. Equity Bank CEO James Mwangi said the charges that affected Equity transactions made from Equitel to M-Pesa took effect on August 1. Kenya \nSeptember 19, 2015 see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation.
