Aaron Bunch Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague Restaurateur Paul Henwood is unusually upbeat. His business Crema Café is in the heart of West Perth, the inner-city suburb once bursting at the seams as miners clamoured for office space.\nThe downturn in commodity prices crimping the nation's growth has triggered an emptying of office buildings as resources companies cull staff and cut costs .\nShops along the main Hay Street strip are closing. But rather than cut back his spending Mr Henwood, a business migrant who took ownership of Crema on July 1, is investing in his new business.\n\"I'm spending more based on the fact that things won't stay bad,\" Mr Henwood said.\n\"People still want to go out.\"\nMr Henwood, 53, got fed up with the grey skies of central London and left the pet store he operated for 26 years for Perth's blue skies and beaches.\n\"They [Perth residents] have seen what the rest of the world has gone through and that they have avoided it for so long and fear that now it's going to hit,\" Mr Henwood said.\n\"The country made money out of [the mining boom] but it was but it was never going to last forever. But it [the economy] will come back.\"\n Bottom of the downturn West Australian premier Colin Barnett called the bottom of the commodities downturn on Wednesday.\n\"I think there has been too much pessimism about the state of mining in Australia and I would be brave enough to predict we are probably at the bottom of the downturn in commodity prices,\" Mr Barnett said.\n\"I am saying we are probably bottom and the next 12 months will probably be pretty flat but I expect to see [commodity] prices gradually improve.\"\nBut he warned the nation's economic growth was \"slower than Australia can tolerate\".\nFigures released on Wednesday showed 0.2 per cent growth in the second quarter, putting the annual growth rate at 2 per cent.\n\"The Australian economy needs to be growing at a number with at least a three or preferably a 4 in front of it,\" Mr Barnett said.\nWestern Australian state final demand, which excludes exports, grew by 1.5 per cent in the second quarter but has dropped 1.8 per cent over the year. Queensland fell 0.8 per cent mainly due to falling business investment.\nCommonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Workman said Western Australia appeared to benefit from a one-off boost in construction investment related to a resources project.\n\"We expect construction in WA to trend downwards over the next few quarters,\" Mr Workman said.\nNew resources projects Mr Barnett said believes economic conditions will improve in a year, which would trigger new resources projects that could be in production in the early 2020s.\nMr Henwood's Crema Café continues to do a bustling coffee and lunch trade. In part, it's because Crema changed its menu to offer more meals under $20.\n\"Most people want to spend $20-$25 lunch, not much more than that,\" he said.\nMr Henwood said turnover was flat compared to a year ago, but was down 20 per cent from two years ago.\nHe warned Australians against significantly cutting their spending.\n\"Everyone panicked in the UK and they stopped spending,\" Mr Henwood said.\n\"You have to curb your spending but you don't stop. Don't spend more than you don't have but spend what you earn.\"\nHe said there were other areas of growth, including business migration.\n\"I'm renting a property and at some point I'll buy a property. That helps,\" Mr Henwood said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-09-02T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:06:07.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
