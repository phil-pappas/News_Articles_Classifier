(NAPS) Posted: Wednesday, September 2, 2015 4:44 am | Updated: 12:30 am, Thu Sep 3, 2015. The Easiest Way To Know If Your Child Is Eligible For Private School Choice By NAPS, North American Precis Syndicate Moscow-Pullman Daily News \n(NAPSI)—Getting a child the best education at the least cost may be easier than many parents realize. \nAll across the country, states offer school choice programs that help parents afford private schools and other learning services when their assigned public schools can’t meet their children’s needs. \nEducational options could include: \nPrivate Schools: independently run educational institutions. A private school can be secular, religious, academically intensive, or specialized by students’ unique needs. Private schools typically charge tuition but not always. There are more than 6 million students attending nearly 34,000 private schools in the United States. \nHomeschooling : an alternative form of education. About 1.5 million students are homeschooled . \nOnline Learning: students work with teachers over the Internet—in combination with, or in place of, traditional classroom learning. There are about 2 million children enrolled in distance-education online courses. \nThe school or combination of educational services you’d like to choose is just one of the factors that determine what kind of help, if any, you can get. Each school choice program has unique eligibility requirements. Some can be very complicated and hard for parents to decipher. \nFortunately, you can get help from the experts at the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, which promotes universal school choice as the most effective and equitable way to improve the quality of K-12 education in America. \nThe Foundation released a new online tool to help parents determine their program eligibility by answering simple yes and no questions. \nRegardless of whether your child is eligible for a particular program, the Foundation can offer options for next steps. \nLearn More \nYou can find school choice program eligibility tests and further facts, advice and helpful videos online at www.edchoice.org .
