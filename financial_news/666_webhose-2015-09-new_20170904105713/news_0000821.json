He says the new rules around keeping art in self managed super funds mean it will no longer be worth it. Rohan Thomson by Duncan Hughes The local art scene is getting the brush-off from changes to self managed super fund rules for investing in art and other collectables, according to collectors, dealers and financial advisers.\nCanberra-based Bernie Ayers, who has reduced his superannuation art portfolio from $500,000 to less than $50,000 during the past two years, is among collectors selling down their art holdings ahead of a July 2016 change that will make it prohibitively expensive to lease and store art collections.\nFinancial advisers and art dealers claim the sell-off is accelerating as former collectors put their works up for sale to beat the deadline for the next round of rule changes in the middle of next year.\n\"It has been absolutely terrible,\" said Paul Sumner, managing director of Mossgreen Auctions, a leading Australian auction house, about the impact on the art industry.\nIn the five years to mid-2014 the value of art and other collectibles in SMSFs fell by nearly 20 per cent to $458 million, or halving as a percentage of total SMSF assets, according to the Australian Taxation Office.\nOver the same period, tax-breaks allowed for limited recourse borrowing to buy property for super increased 17-times to $8.7 billion.\nThe SMSF rule changes, which have been promoted as safeguards for investors, involve regular valuations of artworks, external storage under contract with a storage facility and higher insurance costs.\nMr Ayers, a property and equity investor and former public servant, said: \"Trustees – who are responsible for ensuring the funds are maintained for the purpose of providing retirement benefits – see the changes as a major barrier to buying artworks within their funds. Instead, they are selling off their works.\"\n Art dealers claim the most heavily sold-off genre is indigenous works, which were popular when the bulk of art buying for funds was done about 10 years ago. Other factors impacting indigenous art include over-supply and falling confidence in its long-term prospects for capital growth.\nWayne Bolin, a director with MGI Joyce Dickson, a financial adviser and accounting group, said his clients are reviewing their portfolio art and are either selling or, if eligible, taking them as a benefit.\nMr Bolin blames the expense of storage and rising insurance plus difficulties of finding expert valuers.\nSophie Ullin, head of art for Leonard Joel Auction House, said it's \"not a flood\" of paintings up for sale but enough to reflect suspicions that expected returns no longer justify the amount of effort involved.\nOther costs include the Rudd Government's 5 per cent resale royalty scheme and high commissions for selling art, which are typically at least 20 per cent for the seller.\nThe art market is also being challenged from changing architectural trends involving compact apartments with more glass and less wall space; new forms of art, such as street art, video and increasing competition from overseas galleries and art fairs.\n\"Apart from the chance of leasing artworks, profits only come from capital gains on sales,\" said Mr Ayers. \"While there are costs, ranging from insurance, to storage and opportunity costs, there is no recurrent income flow,\" he said.\n\"I believe art in super is a risky investment compared to other investment choices, but to those of us who understood the art market and the risks involved, it did provide a positive financial experience,\" he said.\nAn ATO spokesman said it is ensuring trustees \"understand and comply\" with their obligation to build retirement savings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:10:14.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
