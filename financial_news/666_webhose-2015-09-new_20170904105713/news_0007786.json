Economists said if the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee did pull the trigger, it was likely to start with a jump of 0.2 to 0.25 percentage points — the first rate rise in the US since 2006.\nInvestors are edgy because lifting rates from practically zero will herald an end to cheap credit, and developing economies that have borrowed in US dollars will pay more to service their debts.\nConversely, signs of a stronger US will boost Australia’s export prospects.\nDr Debelle said the Fed had been preparing markets for an inevitable rate hike.\n“If you’re not ready for it, you sure as hell have been warned,” he said.\nFutures markets are pricing in a one-in-three chance of a move this week. It would be announced early tomorrow morning Melbourne time.\nThe chance of a move by December is rated as 62 per cent.\nBut Dr Debelle said he would be “surprised” if there wasn’t some post-rise volatility, especially given the protracted period of inactivity on rates.\n“There’s a decent chunk of people in the market that have never experienced an environment where rates actually go up, and most of them have never experienced an environment where rates actually change,” he told the Actuaries Institute’s Banking on Change seminar.\nWhatever comes this week, the Australian dollar is expected to gyrate and could hea swiftly below US70c should traders flock to the greenback.\nThe benchmark ASX 200 index climbed 1.6 per cent yesterday, reversing Tuesday’s losses and closing just shy of 5100 points, while the dollar was fetching US71.53c.\nIn statements accompanying previous meetings of the Fed’s rate-setting team, chairwoman Janet Yellen pointed out the importance of unemployment and inflation figures to the “lift-off” decision.\nThe US jobless rate is at a seven-year low of 5.1 per cent, while inflation remains the big question mark at a tepid 0.2 per cent as of July.\nCMC chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said the Fed had laid the platform to proceed immediately.\n“I’m calling lift-off now. They’re looking at the economy over the next month and years, not the next week, so a bit of immediate volatility will be of no consequence to the Fed,” Mr McCarthy said.\nwith AAP\npaul.gilder@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Be ready for US rate rise", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/rbas-guy-debelle-says-australia-should-ready-itself-for-financial-aftershocks-of-us-rate-rise/story-fnihsps3-1227530782801"], "published": "2015-09-17T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:40:56.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
