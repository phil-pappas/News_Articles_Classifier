They again blocked Bagramyan Avenue and police barred them from marching further on to the presidential headquarters.\nArmenia is closely allied with Russia, and its power grid is a subsidiary of a Russian electricity company. Organizers said they had no political motives but Moscow has watched the rallies with concern.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:01:23.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
