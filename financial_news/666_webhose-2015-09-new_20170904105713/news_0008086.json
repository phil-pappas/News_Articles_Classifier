Dow futures climbed 174.9 points, 20 points off their hour-earlier high. Nasdaq 100 futures were steady, up 58.3 points. S&P 500 futures showed a 20.7-point gain, sticking close to their earlier highs. Small caps were steady, with Russell 2000 futures hanging on to an 8.9-point advance. \nDespite the positive premarket vibes, the stock market today opens still clearly in a correction. The Nasdaq has dropped in the past six sessions. The S&P 500 has slipped in seven of the past nine sessions. For Q3, the S&P 500 opens Wednesday's session down 8.7%. The Nasdaq is showing a 9.4% decline. \nThe quarter has been particularly tough on small caps and growth stocks. The small-cap Russell 2000 starts Wednesday with a 13.5% loss for the quarter. The IBD 50 index is down 10.8%. \nThere are good reasons for optimism, but even though isolated rallies have launched a number of recent breakouts , most have either stalled or failed. Growth investors should treat the correction with respect, minding sell rules, taking profit and rotating to cash for now, until the market stages a valid follow-through session. \nIn economic news , the Federal Reserve's William Dudley and Janet Yellen are scheduled to speak during trading hours on Wednesday, which could affect the session. \nPayroll processor ADP reported U.S. nonfarm private employers added 200,000 workers in September. That was better than a downwardly revised 186,000 new hires during August and easily bested consensus views for 190,000 new jobs. Some 188,000 of the jobs were in the service sector, the report said. \nThe September Chicago purchasing managers index from Kingsbury International is expected out at 9:45 a.m. \nIn stocks, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) surged 11% after announcing that China's Tsinghua Unisplendour agreed to buy a 15% stake in the data storage company for $3.8 billion. The Chinese information technology company reportedly agreed to a five-year lockup that will allow it a limited number of shares to sell each year, and it is able to place one member on Western's board. \nWestern shares have been falling for nine months, ending Tuesday 40% below a December high. Shares of Western peer Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX ) climbed 6% in premarket trade. \nAdvanced Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP ) knocked out a 6% gain in premarket action. The stock has been battling to hold support at its 10-week moving average in the seventh week of a possible base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:28:25.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
