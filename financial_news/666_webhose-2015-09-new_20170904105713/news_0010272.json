But Short Side of Long blogger Tiho Brkan has highlighted a simple indicator now flashing a buy signal — the price-earnings ratio for Chinese H-shares HSCEI, -1.42% This has slid to the lowest level since 2001, as shown in the chart above.\n“Valuations are now as attractive as they were during the bottoming part of the Tech Crash in early 2000s and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008,” Brkan noted in a blog post on Friday.\n“I admit that valuations could get lower still, but savvy investors and contrarians alike know that the best time to buy is when others are panic selling and predicting ‘black swan’ events.”\nHis call comes as Chinese H-shares — stocks of Chinese companies traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange — have dropped in 14 out of the past 15 sessions. It is currently among the worst performing stock markets in the world this year. At the same time, the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.20% — mainland China’s equity benchmark — has more than halved in value since its June high and is no longer in positive territory for the year.\nWhat started earlier in the summer as a selloff after a rapid rally — the Shanghai Composite was up about 60% year-to-date — turned into full-blown panic in August, on concerns over China’s future economic growth and the potential impact on the global economy. That anxiety was exacerbated by the People’s Bank of China’s devaluation of the yuan, and a string of disappointing data in August only added more fuel to those worries.\nSome economists argue that China’s days of strong growth are past, while others maintain that Beijing has the ability to control the economy and lead it to continued prosperity.\n“While I admit that the Chinese economy is currently struggling and faces the hard time ahead, the prospect this nation has in the long run are significant on the world scale,” Brkan said. “Its stock market will be one of the best ways to express this long term potential, but the key always remains the price one pays for future growth.”\nThe Short Side of Long isn’t the only market observer going bullish on China. Goldman Sachs recently noted that the country’s beaten-down stocks look cheap and now is the time to buy.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/opinion/joe-nocera-the-man-who-got-china-right.html?_r=0", "https://shortsideoflong.com/2015/09/chinese-stock-valuations/"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T16:04:59.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
