Spanish unit Seat has said 700,000 of its cars were also equipped with the technology. \nA spokesman for VW's trucks division said that 1.8 million light commercial vehicles were involved. \n- Setbacks expected - \nThe carmaker, which in the first six months of this year overtook Toyota to become the world leader in terms of sales, needed to win back the trust it has lost, he said. \nA YouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) opinion poll revealed that VW's image among German consumers has taken a severe hit and is now no better than Daimler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) 's city runaround, the Smart. \nThe affair \"needs to be cleared up ruthlessly. We need courage and fighting spirit. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will be difficult and... there will be setbacks. But we can and will do it,\" Mueller said. \n\"Together, we can overcome this crisis and make Volkswagen an even better company.\" \nOn Monday, German prosecutors said they were looking to establish the exact chain of responsibility in the scam, opening an inquiry against the former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who insisted that he had not been personally aware of any wrongdoing on his part. \nIn addition to Germany, national authorities in several other countries have announced probes. Japan on Tuesday joined a long list of countries in ordering some of the country's biggest automakers to report on whether their diesel vehicles meet Japanese standards. \nLawsuits are also being filed, including class-action litigation in the United States. \nVW has already said it will set aside 6.5 billion euros in provisions in the third quarter. But analysts suggest one to three billion euros more could be needed. \nOn top of that, VW also faces onerous regulatory fines, including up to $18 billion in the United States, and the fallout on customer purchases cannot yet be estimated. \n- Hometown hit - \nThe scandal is also having repercussions in VW's hometown of Wolfsburg, in northern Germany, which has imposed an immediate freeze on spending and hiring in the public administration in case its finances are adversely affected. \nThe business tax VW has to pay, calculated on the basis of its annual turnover, is a significant source of revenue for the town's coffers. \nWolfsburg, located around 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Berlin, was founded in 1938 with the construction of the first factory to build the carmaker's iconic Beetle model. \nIt has a population of around 124,000, more than half of whom work for VW. And the town's skyline is dominated by the sprawling manufacturing plant and a massive version of the group's blue-and-white circular logo. \nVolkswagen also sponsors and finances a long list of sporting and cultural activities in the town, including its premiere league football club, VfL Wolfsburg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:18:49.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
