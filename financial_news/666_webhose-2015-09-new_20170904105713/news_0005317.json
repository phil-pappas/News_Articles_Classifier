This compared with a fall of 8.3 percent in July. \nImports dropped 13.8 percent, from an 8.1 percent decrease in July. \n\"This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,\" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP. \n\"China's economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,\" he added. \nThe data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the world's second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth. \nOil prices have come under pressure from concerns that China's slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades. \nThe devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels. \nOil prices are down almost 30 percent from this year's closing peak in May. \nAnalysts said dealers would next scrutinise the weekly US stockpiles report due Thursday. \nUS commercial crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak owing to high production levels despite tepid demand. \nDealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices since the middle of 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:55:06.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
