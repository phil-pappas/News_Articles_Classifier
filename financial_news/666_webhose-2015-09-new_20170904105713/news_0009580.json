There is one other area that homeowners, who usually have higher credit scores than non-homeowners, need to pay special attention to. That would be their homeowner's insurance , which can double in cost due to a low credit score. According to fresh data from Insurancequotes.com , \"homeowners with poor credit pay twice as much for homeowner's insurance as people with excellent credit.\" Additionally, American homeowners with median credit pay 32% more than those with excellent credit. Insurancequotes.com's senior analyst Laura Adams says the practice of linking homeowner's insurance to consumer credit scores is \"controversial,\" but that's not stopping insurance companies from doing so, as the industry claims there is a strong connection between credit scores and claims. \"In most states, insurers are putting more emphasis on credit scores this year,\" says Adams. \"The impact of a poor credit score is higher now than it was last year in 29 states and Washington, D.C., while it is lower in just 17 states. It's more important than ever for people to maintain a solid credit rating by paying their bills on time, keeping their balances low and correcting errors on their credit reports.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:25:31.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
