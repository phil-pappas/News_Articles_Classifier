Uncertainty surrounding the timing of higher rates contributed to the unprecedented market jitters seen in stocks over the past few weeks. Here are five ways higher interest rates could affect investors: \n1. Savers Will See a Boost \nA rate hike is expected to lift interest rates on savings accounts and money market accounts, boding well for cautious savers. More Headlines Vote: Will the Fed Raise Rates in September After Friday's Jobs Report? \n\"A rate hike will be good for savers,\" said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \"Although the benefit is going to be quite small because the Fed's going to go very slow here.\" \nExperts expect the Fed's to initially hike short-term interest rates by just 25 basis points. 'Investors should hold modest amounts of cash alternatives to meet near-term liquidity needs and emergency expenses,' he added. \n2. Retirees Will Be Able to Take Less Risk \nLow interest rates have made the stock market one of the most attractive investments -- by making other ones much less profitable. But stocks are also inherently risky. \"Before the global financial recession, income investors had the ability to buy low-risk certificates of deposit that provided returns above 5%,\" Rehling noted. \"Today, due to the Fed's easy monetary policies, traditional lower-risk, income-generating investments offer little in the way of income.\" \nBut that soon may change as safer investments like CDs and bonds start to yield greater income. Rehling said he's seen plenty of clients take on more risk than they normally would in this zero-interest-rate environment, just to generate income. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T23:14:53.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
