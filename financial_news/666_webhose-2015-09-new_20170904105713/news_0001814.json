Rob Homer by Duncan Hughes Banks are offering mortgage brokers lucrative cash incentives and improved terms to encourage home buyers to apply for their loans or switch lenders.\nMany lenders are also offering home buyers' lower rates across their range of mortgage products.\nThe spread between highest and lowest rates on offer across standard variable and fixed-term products up to five years is the widest in 18 months, reflecting growing competition for business, says Canstar, a company that compares borrowing and savings' rates.\nChris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of mortgage broker Capital Home Loans, said big lenders were keen to attract owner-occupiers with low loan-to-value ratios, typically below 80 per cent, a record of disciplined repayment and regular income.\nMr Foster-Ramsay said lenders were allowing marginally more discretion when negotiating the terms of a loan with borrowers after recent tightening.\nRegulators' concerns about overheating in the investment property market resulted in rising rates, increased loan-to-value ratios and stricter evidence of ability to pay, such as reviews of income from all sources, other debts and the impact of higher interest rates on family budgets.\nNational Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group are both offering mortgage brokers cash-back payments and other incentives for owner-occupier borrowers that switch from another lender.\nFor example, NAB is offering a variable rate of 4.15 per cent on its Homeplus mortgage products for new and refinancing loans between $250,000 and $750,000.\n It applies only to owner-occupied loans and principal and interest repayments.\nLenders are eligible for a $1500 cash-back offer if they have an existing transaction account and NAB credit card.\nANZ has countered with a $1200 cash-back deal that mortgage brokers can offer clients.\nIt also applies only to owner-occupier buyers and a lending minimum of $300,000.\nOther lenders are expected to make comparable offers as competition intensifies.\nAccording to analysis by Canstar, the spread between the highest and lowest mortgages on offer is the widest in 18 months.\nFor example, the difference for standard variable loans is 2.02 per cent, with the minimum 3.97 per cent and maximum 5.99 per cent. That compares with a difference of 1.89 per cent 18 months ago, when the lowest was 4.49 per cent.\nThe spread on fixed products ranges from 2.35 per cent on one-year fixed through to 1.80 per cent for five years.\nSt George Bank said there had been an increase in investors switching to owner-occupied in response to the changes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:06:14.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
