At the same time, we remain focused on minimizing dilution by carefully managing our operating expenses.” \nKey terms under the common stock purchase agreement include: Lightbridge will control the timing and amount of any sale of common shares to Aspire Capital; Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by Lightbridge but is obligated to make purchases when Lightbridge desires to sell shares of its common stock to Aspire Capital, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement; Aspire Capital has agreed that neither it nor any of its agents, representatives and affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling or hedging of the Company’s common stock during any time prior to the termination of the Purchase Agreement; There are no limitations on the use of proceeds, financial covenants or restrictions on future financings and there are no rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the purchase agreement; and The purchase agreement may be terminated by Lightbridge at any time, at its discretion, without any additional cost or penalty. \nA complete and detailed description of the purchase agreement and related registration rights agreement will be set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. \nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. \nAbout Lightbridge Corporation \nLightbridge is a nuclear energy company based in McLean, Virginia. The Company develops proprietary next generation nuclear fuel technologies for current and future nuclear reactor systems. Lightbridge's breakthrough fuel technology is establishing new global standards for safe and clean nuclear power and leading the way to a sustainable energy future. The Company also provides comprehensive advisory services for established and emerging nuclear programs based on a philosophy of transparency, non-proliferation, safety and operational excellence. Lightbridge consultants provide integrated strategic advice and expertise across a range of disciplines including regulatory affairs, nuclear reactor procurement and deployment, reactor and fuel technology and international relations.

In April 2015, nuclear fuel managers at Dominion Generation, Duke Energy, Exelon Generation and Southern Company asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to prepare to review Lightbridge's fuel design, in advance of an expected application in 2017 to use the Company's fuel in a U.S. reactor as early as 2020 ( http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1513/ML15134A092.pdf ). The NRC relies on communications from U.S. utilities to adjust Commission staffing levels and budgets in anticipation of regulatory review of licensing applications. \nTo receive Lightbridge Corporation updates via e-mail, subscribe at http://ir.ltbridge.com/alerts.cfm ? \nLightbridge is on Twitter.
