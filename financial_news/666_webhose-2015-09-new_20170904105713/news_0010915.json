AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl Former US general and Central Intelligence Agency director David Petraeus has forecast that the much vaunted Asian Century is being replaced by a renewed global alignment based around the US.\nHe says a new confidence is building in the US due to the \"recognition that that we are on the threshold of not the Asian or the Chinese Century but the North American decades.\"\nDelivering the Lowy Institute annual lecture on Wednesday night he said this point would be underlined by the fact that the US was about to deliver more real dollar GDP growth a year than China and would continue to do so.\nThe former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq rejected the idea that Australia might ever have to choose between the US and China as hypothetical and \"unlikely to materialise.\"\nInstead he argued China's \"land building\" activities were encouraging a bandwagoning movement towards the US amongst regional countries.\nMr Petraeus, a Republican who was appointed by President Barack Obama to the CIA, sought to redraft the Obama administration policy of pivoting to Asia by arguing that the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific were equally important to the US.\nHe said: \"Our security and prosperity are tied to what happens in both. We therefore cannot afford to disengage or withdraw from either.\"\nWhile many Australian analysts think the US involvement in Middle East wars distracted it from Asia, Mr Petraeus argued that the declaration of a pivot to Asia had been perceived in the Middle East as a pivot away from that part of the world.\n Instead he said the US should firmly state it \"considers itself to be a permanent resident power in both these regions, and that we are not going away.\"\nHe argued that the energy trade meant the Middle East and the Asia Pacific were really part of the same intertwined region which needed to be redefined with a new \"comprehensive concept – a grand strategy, if you will – that reconciles and integrates our interests across this space, which might be called greater Asia.\"\nWhile Mr Petraeus talked up the idea of the North American decades based on economic integration with Canada and Mexico and US success in life sciences, advanced manufacturing, information technology and energy production, he conceded some reservations.\nHe said: \"The sad reality is that we continue to be paralysed by partisan infighting in Washington.\"\nAnd he called for a big increase in US defence spending justified by a deterioration in global security over the past year and cited Australia as a role model for increased defence spending even though Australian spending is s much lower share of GDP than in the US.\nHe also confirmed that he had been urging the US military to seek out moderate militia elements linked to its old enemy al-Qaeda to help take the fight up the Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Syria and Iraq.\nHe said some members of the Nusra Front were not really jihadists and could be won over to support an expanded coalition effort against IS modelled on his successful recruiting of Sunni fighters to help the US fight al-Qaeda in 2007.\nMr Petraeus resigned from his CIA job in 2012 after revelations of an affair with his biographer which led to him pleading guilty to a charge of mishandling classified information.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-09-02T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:01:46.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
