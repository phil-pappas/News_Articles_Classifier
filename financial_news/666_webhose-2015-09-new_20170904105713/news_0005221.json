The vandalism has plunged parts of the town and its markets back into darkness. One of the solar stolen panels was at Koginga Pier, where the fishmongers used to operate. \nA solar mast was also knocked down at the Homa Bay main bus stage and its two panels, two solar lights and rechargeable batteries stolen. Roseline Auma, a fishmonger at Koginga pier market, says they are nowadays forced to close their businesses early due to lack of light. \"We felt very happy when the solar lights were erected. It lengthened our business hours and even income. However, at the moment we are forced to end our operations early since we do not know the intention of the thieves,\" said Auma. \nShe said in some cases the solar panels might seem intact, but actually vandals have already stolen the rechargeable solar batteries. Auma suspects the thieves steal the panels to make money, but also to create conditions to terrorise the terrorize traders. In Oyugis Township, a solar panel was stolen in a broad day light as the members of the public watched, since the thief, clad in overalls, pretended to be an expert assigned to repair it. \nMaurice Onyango urges people to be more vigilant and ensure the equipment is protected. \"Ever since we realised their trick, we have been more vigilant as youths even though I am told some areas they still continue with the trick,\" he said \"Before the installation of these solar lights, the latest we could operate as boda bodas was at 9pm but since then our operational time has been extended, it seems there are some individuals who are not happy with the project,\" added Onyango. \nHe however urged the County government of Homa Bay to ensure that all the installed solar lights are efficiently working until down. \"There are some solar lights which cannot stand the night cold and usually go off at around 11pm at night. Some do not function at all,\" he says The lights are equipped with a sensor gadget that when the sun goes down, they automatically light up. During the launch of the project in Mfangano Island this year, Governor Cyprian Awiti said they would improve the county's economic growth \"We are targeting a 24 hour economy and the launch of the project is a move towards that direction,\" said the Governor. \nHe added: \"We want to drive away the darkness that has restricted business hours in our towns. The boda boda operators and the mama mboga will extend their business hours without worrying about their security.\" The main townships in Homa Bay that have been lighted nclude Mbita, Ndhiwa, Sindo, Kadongo, Kendu Bay, Rusinga Island,Mfangano Island and Magunga. \nIn the first phase, 450 street light masts have been erected in market places while 350 others are supposed to be erected in the second phase. The solar masts are also being used to post advertisements in which the media company earns 50 per cent of the revenue while the remaining percentage provides low interest loans to women and youth traders. \nThe Sh240 million \"Okonyo welo\" lighting project targets more than 285 markets within the eight sub counties. Experts are hoping the vandalism will be stopped by new proposed law that proposes fining offenders Sh10 million. The Critical Infrastructure Protection Bill follows intense lobbying by utility companies which lose billions of shillings each year to vandals who steal cables and electricity transformers because of the lenient penalties prescribed in the law. \nICT Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i says the country directly losses Sh2 billion annually from vandalism. He says the law will help government plans to cut the losses to less than Sh500 million in less than two years. The vandals have targetted power cables and transformers, leading to disruption of sensitive Internet and data services. They also vandalise railway sleepers, road guard rails and manhole covers have also not been spared as theft of metal objects thrives on huge demand for recyclable materials from China. \nThe bill was crafted by 12-member taskforce chaired by the Airtel Africa Group Regulatory Director Alice Kariuki other members of the team include MTN Managing Director Kenya Business Tom Omariba, Engineer Silas Kinoti and Engineer Patrick Mwinzi among others. Kenya \nNairobi Senator Mike Sonko has said he is ready to take a 50 per cent salary cut to enable teachers receive their salary … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star. All rights reserved.
