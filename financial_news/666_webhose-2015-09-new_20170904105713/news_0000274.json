You cannot ignore Nigeria for too long. Let's get our house sorted and take a wise decision on the trilemma we face.\" \nAnalysts at Nairametrics believe the potential implications of this move are far-reaching as JP Morgan Index is currently tracked by over $200 billion Funds. \nBy taking Nigeria off the index, they continued, there would be little or no demand for her bonds by foreign investors, pointing out that since JP Morgan threatened to yank Nigerian off in January, foreign holding of the nation's bonds has dropped from a peak of $11 billion in 2013 to $3 billion. They warned that this is likely to shrink further thereby affecting demand for the country's debts. \nThe Ugodre Obi-Chukwu-led Nairametrics added: \"With Nigeria out of the scene, other emerging markets in Africa like Ghana, Kenya and even South Africa could now be more attractive to investors. They will simply now move their funds to competing countries leaving Nigeria in its wake. Since investors like to follow the money, it is also likely that other forms of investments may elude Nigeria because of this singular move. \n\"Nigeria will lose its prestige as not just the largest economy in Africa but the economy attracting the most foreign investments. This will be damaging to an economy that has been thumping itself as the destination to be for foreign investors. \n\"With the exit of most foreign investors, the long term plan of the Debt Management Office of ensuring that the nation's bond market is deep is now in jeopardy. With little demand, it is unlikely that the government and other private companies seeking foreign currency loans will use the bond market as a possible source. This will make the market shallow and unattractive and could even throw some companies out of business,\" they stressed. \nThe Nigerian stock market that has seen some bullish trends in recent days may also be negatively impacted especially as this announcement may hurt the confidence of foreign investors which make up about 45 to 50 percent of transactions in the Nigerian Stock Exchange. \nIn view of the fact that local companies and banks also borrow money from foreign investors by selling foreign denominated, as well as Naira bonds, now that the Federal Government is likely to see its borrowing cost go up due to this development, it is likely that banks and other corporates seeking to borrow may have to pay more in interest as well. \nAnalysts also said the development could lead to higher interest rate in the country since banks that are lucky enough to borrow will have to pass on that cost to someone else. \"Small businesses which rely on banks for small loans such as overdrafts, local purchase orders, letters of credit etc. may also see their borrowing rates rise even higher. For individuals with consumer loans they may also be expecting a letter from banks telling them that their loan rates have gone up,\" analysts noted. \nIn case this situation is not handled properly, fears were also expressed that it may trigger another massive devaluation because if the foreign investors pull out their funds, this will create demand pressure on forex and result in devaluation. \nReacting to the JP Morgan decision also on Wednesday, analysts at FBN Capital Limited, noted that the exit of these investors by end-October, \"would probably leave a maximum of $1 billion invested by the offshore community in all naira-denominated Nigerian government paper. \n\"This is a demotion for Nigeria and amounts to reputational damage. Since the FGN as well as the CBN are fire-fighting in the face of the global headwinds, we do not expect a dramatic response on their part.\" \nThe FBN Capital report noted also that \"Nigeria is not eligible for re-inclusion in the GBI-EM indices for at least 12 months. We can assume that JP Morgan would not lightly restore Nigeria.\" Nigeria \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari claimed recently that about 1 million barrels of crude oil were stolen a day under the last … see more » Copyright © 2015 Daily Independent.
