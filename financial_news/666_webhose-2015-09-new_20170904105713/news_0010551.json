The new location, Steamatic of Warren, will service Northern Detroit. The new owner, Kit Burgess, is a newcomer to the restoration and cleaning industry. This represents a major career shift for him, after several years working as an IT Systems Administrator. Burgess was looking for a change and selected Steamatic as a path that will make the most of his relationship-building skills and marketing abilities.\nBurgess looked at multiple restoration companies when setting out on this new path, but ultimately selected Steamatic as the best opportunity and the one that most closely matched his needs. “I’m tired of working for other people,” said Burgess. “I’m looking forward to getting out and succeeding on my own.” He points out that despite the change in industry, there’s a core component to both jobs. “They’re both about helping people,” he said.\nBurgess recently attended a two-week Steamatic University training at the corporate offices in Fort Worth, Texas and has now returned to open the Warren location.\n“We are very excited about adding another location in Michigan, especially in the Detroit area. In addition, Kit’s IT background perfectly aligns with Steamatic’s initiative to continually improve our technology solutions for our clients, our partners, and our franchises,” said Steve Willis, President of Steamatic, Inc.\nAbout Steamatic\nSteamatic offers restoration and cleaning services in franchise territories throughout the United States and worldwide. Steamatic’s highly trained and certified technicians work with insurance agents and adjusters as well as residential and commercial clients to offer restoration services, including fire and smoke restoration, water mitigation, mold remediation, and contents recovery.
