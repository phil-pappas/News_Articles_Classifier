Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith Labels such as bull or bear don't really apply to Sean Fenton. As the portfolio manager for Tribeca​ Investment Partners' Alpha Plus Fund – the best performing long/short fund last year – Fenton can make profits in almost any environment.\nThe fund's mandate enables the manager to take 50 per cent of the value of the portfolio short, meaning he's betting at any given time that half the stock under his watch will lose value.\nThe long/short approach makes Fenton a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character when he's explaining his view of the world: the conversation may start with an outlook on where value and potential earnings growth reside, but can spiral into a doomsday scenario in which the world falls in on itself and traps everyone under its weight.\nHaving bet the mining services segment would be crushed, he now waits for the next downside theme to start playing out and he has his eye on housing construction companies, which, following a long-awaited recovery, he believes now appear poised for a fall.\nSupplied He admits he's not overly comfortable speaking about betting against individual companies because of the perception that short traders are responsible for destroying shareholder value, he provides some rare insight into his investment process.\nCan you explain how the long/short approach is applied?\nUp to 50 per cent of the portfolio can be shorted. There is a range of long [positions] and shorts in there, and that opens up a huge amount of potential in terms of the investment universe – you can make money on the short side, whereas long-only investors might only have underweight positions and give up a lot of potential in their ideas. Also shorting a stock releases cash that allows you to invest more in long positions you like.\nHow do you express your short positions in your portfolio commentary and to investors?\n People get very sensitive about the word \"short\". The way we express our positions and the way we think about it is, \"what's our relative position to the index?\" That's what drives active risk and what's going to drive your returns relative to your benchmark. If it's a big stock, we might never be outright short, we might just be underweight.\nWhere are you invested at the moment?\nYou've seen some big thematics on the short side play out over the last year or two, starting with China's [GDP] deceleration. Since then you've seen a lot of pressure coming in, with iron ore and commodity pricing in general coming down, so resources have fallen and we have some underweights there, particularly at the leveraged end of the iron ore sector. Resolute Mining and Fortescue Metals among other names.\nMeanwhile, all the mining companies have been focused on getting costs out and all the mining capex budgets have been cut, so mining services are more at the pointy end. That's started to play out and some shorts across the mining services space have been good. You're getting into the territory now but you've made a bit on that theme. It's still ongoing but market caps have fallen a long way – there's not the same opportunity there.\nWhich were the main shorts in mining services?\nAusdrill, Mineral Resources, Monadelphous Group, WorleyParsons. Some are actually well-run companies with solid balance sheets and great management and it's not necessarily a view on how they're being run. But they're in a position where the macro cycle is so huge.\nWhat we saw out of China is the most rapid industrialisation ever likely to occur in anyone's history. That created a lot of opportunities and wealth on the way up and a lot of companies were positioned to take advantage of that and grew in revenues and margins. But once that cycle rolled over and capex started going the other way, [it] doesn't matter how well you run the business, there's just no fighting a cycle that big.\nHave the mining services sector reached rock bottom?\nI'm not saying we're at the end, I'm saying it's the 80/20 rule – we've had the big drop in share prices. There's a little bit of pain to go, but the risk/reward of having short positions in mining and mining services isn't the same today as it was a few years ago because what we thought was going to happen has happened and share prices have fallen. The risk/reward is not as good as it was.\nWhat's the biggest danger in a short situation?\nTakeovers. Always the biggest risk for a short seller. That's why it's always dangerous trying to squeeze that extra bit of blood out of the stone. Being in a short idea once it's played out is a real danger, too: as soon as the market starts recognising the idea, valuation falls on the short side, you're exposed to a stabilisation of earnings and a re-rating of the [price-earnings] multiple, actions boards might take, change of management. Or you get a private equity fund come in thinking it can fix it. So there's a risk you play it too far on the way down.\nWhere do you earn most excess returns, on the short or the long side?\nProbably a little bit more from the short side, maybe 60 per cent averaged over the life of the fund. It is a very worthwhile endeavour and does add value. But you can't just pick the shorts and then invest terribly on the long side as well.\nWhat about your long positions? Where have you found returns?\nThe Australian dollar trading above parity – as every central bank in the world wanted to diversify away from the USD – provided a fair opportunity to go and buy Aussie stocks with US dollar earnings on the long side. That's been beneficial over the last year or so.\nThat has been a successful strategy for many investors.\nThat's true, but that's one thing about investing, if you are contrarian at the right time and your calls pay off, you can make good returns. But if you are going with consensus, going with the momentum or taking the obvious trade when it is the obvious trade and it pans out, that works too. The crowd doesn't always get it wrong. When [the Aussie dollar] is clearly structurally mispriced, going with everyone else wasn't the wrong thing to do.\nSo what's next? Where are you spending most of your time?\nIt's a little too early to go short but it's definitely time to start thinking about how long you want to be playing the housing cycle. It will take a while for that to play through; it's just a matter of how far the market anticipates that. If people start to anticipate that peak, you'll see a bit of selling coming into some of the stronger-performing building material stocks.\nCan you roll straight off a long position into a short position?\nYou can do but that's pretty gutsy. There has to be a clear catalyst. We did that well with Fortescue Metals – we were long Fortescue until early last year, second quarter. Then you just started to see the iron ore market break down structurally and then the big players responded by increasing production and that was a tipping point.\nWe don't usually look to flip [our view] that aggressively, but if the market does change rapidly enough we certainly have the capacity to do that. If something happened and we suddenly started to see building approvals down 20-30 per cent [year on year], we might flip a lot more quickly.\nTell me more about how you're positioned in housing construction.\nYou have two sources of demand – household and investors. Through this period I don't think you've seen strong growth from that owner-occupier segment in terms of building demand. I think it's fair to say a lot of housing activity has been driven by investors and developers. We're looking to capitalise on that and we're also looking capitalise on some of that hot money flowing out of China as well.\nHow do you capitalise on that?\nWe've been long CSR over the last couple of years. It's probably time to move out of stocks like these, although some of the retailers are still benefiting from housing demand. You're starting to see some of the indicators already, the level of housing approvals are quite high and they're going to start rolling over [declining].\nWho's going to suffer the most?\nDepends how far it's going to go and what else is happening in the economy. Housing construction has been a key source of demand, keeping the economy moving along the last couple of years, which has been a pretty deliberate move by the RBA because it has a multiplier effect through retailing and everything else.\nThe obvious losers of the housing cycle rolling over are building materials companies: CSR; the developers: Mirvac Group and Stockland, Lend Lease and the like. Some of the retailers down the track, some that have been doing well, like Harvey Norman.\nIf you're then talking about a hard landing for the economy, if this is a recession, then you're thinking about a harder landing as mining investment is collapsing at the same time. You have to ask at that point, what's happening with growth in the rest of the world. Will those multiplier effects begin to reverse? Does this lead to more unemployment and job losses? Does the banking system start experiencing losses? It depends how deep and how far does it end up going.\nWhere are we in relation to that potential scenario and how long could it take to play out?\nWe're right at the top of building material stocks, and maybe starting to think about broader retailing, media and maybe banks if it starts to get really ugly. You're talking about entering a recession next year some time and it deepening materially in 2017.\nDo the macro conditions support that?\nIt's a possibility. It's just as likely we sail through it without any problems. Unemployment has been drifting up but it looks OK. Consumer confidence is a bit patchy but OK, too.\nThe biggest negative has been mining capex investments. There's a huge amount of investment that's been disappearing out of the economy – it's very difficult to replace that and that investment has a multiplier effect in the economy. It's hard to see housing contributing to growth from here.\nOn the upside, you've got interest rates at historically low levels and the Aussie dollar will provide a fair bit of relief to industries.\nOVERWEIGHT Aristocrat Leisure (ALL) 4.44%\nQantas Airways (QAN) 3.69%\nIncitec Pivot (IPL) 3.61%\nRecall Holdings (REC) 3.18%\nChallenger (CGF) 3.03%\nUNDERWEIGHT Woodside Petroleum (WPL) -3.83%\nRamsay Health Care (RHC) -3.31%\nOrica (ORI) -3.02%\nCommonwealth Bank (CBA) -2.51%\nMineral Resources (MIN) -2.30%", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mercer-names-tribeca-as-top-fund-20150115-12qtcv.html", "https://twitter.com/@Matt_JS", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts"], "published": "2015-09-16T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:04:23.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
