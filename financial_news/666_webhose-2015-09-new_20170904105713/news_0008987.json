But we will urge people to vote for a party which will fulfil their promises”.\nThe veterans, whose agitation entered the 81st day today, said government has sent seven mediators to talk to them but all had come with “different concessions”.\n“Where do we go for negotiations. People from the government offer one thing and the next day another person comes up with another statement. They are constantly shifting goalpost. There is no clear signal of intent from the government or any concrete proposal,” said Anil Kaul, media adviser to the United Front of Ex-Servicemen.\n“We are not asking for three per cent increment. This is a misnomer being floated,” he said.\nKaul said that cost of implementing OROP will come to around Rs 8,294 crore which he said was worked out by “three service pay cells and figures estimated by the Ministry of Defence. Why is there ambiguity now. Something must be wrong somewhere.”\nHe claimed that the pension equalisation will only cost around Rs 33 crore annually.\n“The total amount of Rs 33 crore annually is nothing and our basic demand is that no junior should draw more pension than his senior,” he said.\nThe OROP has been stuck for a while despite hectic back channel talks between the government and the veterans.\nThe veterans have been insisting on pegging the base year at 2013-14 with implementation date of April one, 2014.\nBut government had initially wanted the pay out date be pushed forward from April 1, 2014 to April 1, 2015, a proposal rejected by the veterans.\nIn subsequent talks, the government had pushed the payout date from April 1, 2014 to September 1, 2014,the veterans had said.\nClose to 26 lakh retired servicemen and over six lakh war widows stand to be immediate beneficiaries of the scheme, which envisages a uniform pension for the defence personnel who retire in the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of their date of retirement.\nCurrently, the pension for retired personnel is based on the Pay Commission recommendations of the time when he or she retired. So, a Major General who retired in 1996 draws less pension than a Lt Colonel who retired after 1996.\n 03, 2015 7:20 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:11:46.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
