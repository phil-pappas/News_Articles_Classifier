The agreement calls for holding a public meeting on the causes of the leak and the company's government-supervised response work. \nTaylor Energy also agreed to donate $300,000 to a Louisiana marine research consortium and pay an additional $100,000 for research on the ecological effects of Gulf oil pollution. \nThe Waterkeeper Alliance sued the company in 2012 over its secretive response. In April, an Associated Press investigation revealed evidence that the leak is worse than the company or the federal government has publicly reported. \nFederal regulators recently estimated that the leak could last a century or more if left unchecked. \n\"It does amaze me,\" Waterkeeper Alliance president Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of that estimate. \"But it's an important variable for the public and for the regulators to understand because it contradicts what the industry as a whole is saying about the safety of deepwater drilling.\" \nTaylor Energy president William Pecue said in a statement last week that the company is proud of its response efforts. Kennedy, however, said the company's work has been \"an inadequate Band-Aid repair job.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:04:48.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
