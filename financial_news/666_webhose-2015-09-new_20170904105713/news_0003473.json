Taken together, the latest numbers offered no clarity on what the Fed will decide to do at its Sept. 16-17 policy meeting.\n\"Based on the performance of the U.S. economy alone, the Fed should raise rates but they do not operate in a vacuum,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.\nConsidering volatile global equities, a dovish European Central Bank and actions by other central banks, it will be difficult for the Fed to act, she said in a note to clients.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, edged up about 0.1 percent to 95.530.\nThe dollar inched about 0.1 percent higher against the yen to 120.74, while the euro was nearly flat from U.S> levels at $1.1279.\nThe greenback came under pressure overnight as China's yuan shot higher in offshore markets on what was suspected to be rare intervention by Chinese state banks, likely taking aim at speculators betting against the currency.\nIn commodities trading, U.S. crude oil futures gave back some of their overnight gains, after rallying 4 percent on U.S. Energy Information Administration data that showed strong demand for gasoline.\nU.S. crude was down about 0.7 percent in Asian trading at $45.61 a barrel. Brent, which gained 2.8 percent in the previous session, was down 0.5 percent at $48.67.\nSpot gold was steady from U.S. levels at $1,111.15 an ounce, but on track to drop about 1 percent for the week.
