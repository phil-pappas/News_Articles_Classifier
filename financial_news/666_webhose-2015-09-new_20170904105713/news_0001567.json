The Treasury official said China's decision to loosen restrictions on currency trading last month, which prompted a sharp fall in its value, appeared to be seen in markets as having the intention to prop up its economy, sowing further doubts among investors.\nThe official said China should not feel like it needs to step in and stop declines in financial markets every time investors send it signals about the economy, and urged Beijing to allow the currency to rise and fall freely.
