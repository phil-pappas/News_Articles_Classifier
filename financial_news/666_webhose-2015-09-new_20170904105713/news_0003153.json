We will continue to add even more features, banks and store locations in the coming months, making it even easier to pay with your Android phone.\" \nSimilar to the Apple Pay system unveiled last year, Android Pay will allow consumers to store their credit card information on their handsets along with loyalty cards and other data. \nFor extra security, Android Pay will generate a one-time \"token\" or virtual account number so the actual credit card data is not revealed in a transaction. \nGoogle said in February it was teaming up with the mobile phone payment firm Softcard to ramp up its efforts in the emerging sector. This will allow Google Wallet to become a pre-installed \"tap to pay\" app on Android smartphones (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:30:22.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
