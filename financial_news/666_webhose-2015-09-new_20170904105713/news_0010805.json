James Davies Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Big polluters will be fined up to $1.8 million for breaching carbon limits but critics say the new rules are so soft 80 per cent of the largest polluters will be able to increase their emissions without penalties.\nCritics said the baseline for penalties is not tough enough and should be lowered to force companies to change their behaviour and cut their emissions.\nGrattan Institute's energy program director Tony Wood said the new rules would do nothing to curb emissions.\n\"It's called a safeguard mechanism but it's not an environmental safeguard. Greg Hunt is not actually constraining emissions. If it's going to work it's got to have teeth but all we've got are gums,\" Mr Wood said.\nGreg Hunt: \"It has always been our commitment and we continue to budget zero revenue. It is our clear expectation that no businesses will pay penalties.\" Christopher Pearce The so-called safeguard mechanism, which is supposed to stop rogue companies from increasing emissions to counter reductions elsewhere in the economy, will affect 330 facilities owned by 140 companies, whose emissions top 100,000 tonnes of carbon each year.\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt said the new regulations struck the right balance between tackling climate change and allowing businesses to have flexibility in their operations.\nMr Hunt said it remained the government's priority that the safeguard mechanism not be a revenue raiser and he hoped no companies would be fined.\n\"It has always been our commitment and we continue to budget zero revenue. It is our clear expectation that no businesses will pay penalties,\" Mr Hunt said.\n Mr Hunt released the draft details of the safeguard mechanism on Wednesday for industry consultation ahead of the final plan to be locked in next month. It will start on July 1 next year.\nGlobal permits decision in 2017 He has also confirmed the government would leave open allowing companies to purchase international carbon permits following accounting rules that will be determined by outcome of international climate talks later this year.\n\"A final decision on business access to high quality, prescribed international units under the safeguard mechanism will be reviewed in 2017-18 subject to the accounting rules established following the Paris climate conference later this year,\" Mr Hunt said.\nUnder the proposed new rules, the baselines will be based on a facility's highest carbon emissions over the five-year period between 2009-10 and 2013-14.\nThe agriculture sector is effectively exempt with methane from livestock not covered by the new rules, while the energy sector will have its own industry-wide baseline.\nCompanies have the option to increase their emissions if opening a new facility or if there is a significant expansion or major change in their sector.\nAlso if a facility exceeds its emissions baselines but the emissions intensity decreases , the excess emissions are exempted through a temporary increase in the baseline for that year.\nIf a power company breaches the industry-wide baseline, they will be re-assessed the next year like any other company under the safeguard mechanism.\nThe financial penalty – which is not based on a per tonne basis – starts at $18,000 a day for breaches and increases to a maximum of $1.8 million for a 100-day breach.\nCritics of the scheme say the nation's 20 largest polluters, such as coal-fired power stations, will be able to increase their carbon emissions without penalties under the Abbott government's scheme.\nA study by Melbourne-based carbon consultancy RepuTex in August found that only 30 of the largest 150 polluters will be required to actually reduce their carbon emission under the existing safeguard mechanism .\n'Significant disconnect' RepuTex director Hugh Grossman on Wednesday said the emissions baselines were set too high to have any genuine affect on reducing carbon pollution.\n\"The design of the new scheme indicates a significant disconnect between emissions growth and the government's new post-2020 emissions target,\" Mr Grossman said.\n\"We project emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism will grow by about20 per cent through to 2030, which will put the new emissions target well out of the picture.\"\nAustralia has committed to reduce its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent based on 2005 levels by 2030.\nMr Grossman said new and expanding coal and liquefied natural gas facilities will also be granted \"get of jail free cards\" to re-set their emissions and not face penalties.\nThe Climate Institute's chief executive, John Connor, said the safeguard mechanism was riddled with loopholes that allowed big companies to keep polluting.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-02T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:06:23.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
