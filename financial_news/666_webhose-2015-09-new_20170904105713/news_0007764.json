And welcome to the LifePoint Health second-quarter 2015 earnings conference call.\nOn today's call LifePoint will be making forward-looking statements based upon management's current expectations. Numerous factors could cause LifePoint's results to differ from these expectations and LifePoint has outlined these factors in its filings with the SEC. The Company encourages you to review these filings.\nLifePoint also asks that you please review the cautionary language under the caption important legal information in the Company's press release issued this morning. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or make any other forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAlso, please visit LifePoint's website for links to various information and filings.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, the conference is being recorded on Friday, July 31, 2015. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bill Carpenter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LifePoint Health. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [2]\n\nThank you and welcome everyone to LifePoint Health's second-quarter 2015 earnings call. We hope you've had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning.\nI'll begin by taking you through some of the highlights from the second quarter and then I'll hand the call over to Leif Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer for a closer look at our financial performance. Following our prepared remarks Leif and I as well as David Dill, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will be available to answer your questions.\nAs we begin the call this morning I'm pleased to note that this marks our first quarter with the Company's new name, LifePoint Health. LifePoint is not just a hospital operator but a healthcare provider across a full continuum of care including physician practices, post-acute services, and outpatient centers.\nAs LifePoint Health we are better reflecting our portfolio of healthcare service providers as well as our strategic direction. We're excited to continue making communities healthier by offering a range of health services and look forward to maintaining our high-quality standards.\nNow for our second-quarter results. The second quarter of 2015 was in line with our expectations and underscores the confidence we have in our growth strategy. For the quarter revenues from consolidated operations were $1.27 billion, an increase of approximately 21% over last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $175 million, up by approximately 10% from a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $1, an increase of approximately 19% over the second quarter of 2014.\nFor the quarter, same store equivalent admissions increased by 1.8%. Our performance once again demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy. We have many exciting initiatives underway that are driving growth while continuously improving quality of care.\nOver the last several years we have completed acquisitions as LifePoint, as part of Duke LifePoint and through other partnerships we have established around the country such as our partnership with Norton Healthcare in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. We've added $1.2 billion in acquired revenue over the last two years. We've entered into new and growing markets such as Warrenton, Virginia and Johnstown Pennsylvania as well as enhanced our position in markets such as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and states like North Carolina.\nWe have in place integration processes that are scalable. Our practice is to bring acquired hospitals in line with Company margins over three to four years. Given our recent acquisitions and active pipeline, we have the opportunity to grow EBITDA and cash flow substantially in the coming years.\nWith respect to our recent activity we expect to close on our acquisitions of Clark Memorial Hospital in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Fleming County Hospital in Flemingsburg, Kentucky later today. We also expect to close on Watertown Regional Medical Center in Watertown, Wisconsin at the end of August. These assets will add approximately $300 million in annual net revenue to the Company.\nAdditionally, as has been reported in local markets, we have signed letters of intent to acquire St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, Georgia and Providence Hospitals in Columbia, South Carolina. These two would add an additional $600 million to annual net revenue upon closing. Our ability to acquire, integrate and expand margins is reflected in our financial results and our ability to continue to grow our pipeline gives us confidence in the future.\nThe Affordable Care Act continues to be a positive for LifePoint. We ended the quarter with $1.5 million in incremental EBITDA contributions from healthcare reform. We're pleased with the outcome of King v. Burwell which should settle the question about the survival of the Affordable Care Act and we believe will translate into further Medicaid expansion.\nWe expect states that were waiting on the sidelines to once again evaluate the opportunity. Although not a LifePoint state, for example Alaska announced that it will move forward with Medicaid expansion and Utah which is a LifePoint state reported that it will participate this year.\nLifePoint remains a strong proponent of expansion including in our home state of Tennessee where we will continue to encourage our state legislature to demonstrate leadership. This is an important opportunity to provide coverage to some of the most at-risk citizens across the country.\nIn addition to our successful growth strategies, our commitment to quality and safety has become a differentiator for us. LifePoint designed a national quality program in collaboration with Duke University Health System to build upon our recent accomplishments in patient safety through the hospital engagement network.\nAs part of the LifePoint National Quality Program, hospitals are eligible to receive the designation as a Duke LifePoint Quality Affiliate when they meet rigorous standards of performance, leadership and patient engagement. We're proud to recognize Clark Regional Medical Center in Winchester, Kentucky as the first hospital to receive this designation. Through the LifePoint National Quality Program we're providing essential leadership in making communities healthier, establishing us as the partner of choice for many hospitals.\nI want to knowledge the departure of Marilyn Tavenner from our Board of Directors. Shortly after becoming a LifePoint Board member Marilyn was offered the opportunity which resulted in her appointment as CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans.\nWe certainly understand her need to divert her full time and attention to this new rule. The healthcare industry remains fortunate to have Marilyn as a leader during this time of change and we wish her well.\nIn conclusion, our teams across the organization are performing well and delivering superior care to our patients, executing on our acquisition and integration plans and managing costs. Our differentiated strategy makes us the partner of choice for many community hospitals and will continue to provide value for our shareholders.\nI'll turn the call over to Leif now for an in-depth review of our second-quarter results as well as an update on our guidance for the second half of the year. Leif?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [3]\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. As Bill said we had another solid quarter in line with our expectations. I will start with an overview of the main drivers of our second-quarter results and then finish with an update to our guidance for the year.\nStarting with volume, while same hospital admissions were down 4.2% for the quarter, for the second-quarter 2015 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year, equivalent admissions were up 1.8%. This increase in same hospital equivalent admissions was driven primarily by a 4% increase in emergency department visits, partially offset by 1.3% decrease in total surgeries.\nOur same hospital total surgeries declined primarily as a result of a decrease in certain low acuity outpatient surgeries. On a same hospital basis, our Medicare case mix index increased by 2.9% to 1.41 for the second quarter of 2015.\nSame hospital one-day stay admissions continue to decline, down 7.3% during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year. We continue to believe that the reduction in one-day stays is generally reflective of industry trends toward outpatient services and not the result of the two-midnight rule.\nTurning to pricing, during the current quarter as compared to last year net revenue per equivalent admissions was up 2.6% on a same hospital basis and up 4% on a consolidated basis driven primarily by higher reimbursement rates from commercial payers. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 healthcare reform contributed an incremental $1.5 million approximately to revenue over the second quarter of 2014. We believe the total impact of new coverage under healthcare reform in the second quarter was between $13.5 million and $15.5 million in EBITDA with the low end of the range including only patients we treated previously as self-pay and the high end of the range also including new patients to LifePoint covered under health insurance exchange products.\nOur results for the second quarter of 2015 were in line with our expectations for reform and consistent with our previously issued guidance for 2015. Our revenues from consolidated operations in the quarter were up $223.4 million, or 21.3% to $1.27 billion as compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year.\nSame hospital revenues in the quarter compared with the second quarter of the prior year were up $44.6 million, or 4.5% reflecting strong same hospital volumes and improvements in reimbursement rates. Same hospital self-pay admissions were down approximately 13.5% and represented 4.5% of total admissions, down from 5% of total admissions in the second quarter of 2014. Same hospital self-pay emergency department visits were down approximately 8% and represented 14.7% of total emergency department visits, down from 16.6% in the second quarter of last year.\nIn our states that have expanded Medicaid we had seen self-pay emergency department visits continue to decline, down 16.7% and self-pay admissions continue to decline, down 20.5% when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. As we have discussed in previous quarters, although we continued to experience declines in our same hospital self-pay volumes during the second quarter of 2015, we have seen an increase in revenue related to co-pay and deductibles in our markets as the number of patients enrolled in insurance plans with higher patient responsibility has increased.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, co-pay and deductible revenue before our provision for anticipated bad debts increased by $6.4 million, or approximately 12.2% to $58.6 million. Because these are difficult to collect, we have increased our provision for doubtful accounts on this revenue from approximately 52.5% in the second quarter of last year to approximately 55.7% in 2015. It's down slightly from 56% sequentially in the first quarter of 2015.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015 after deductions for bad debt, our co-pay and deductible revenue represented 2% of net revenue compared to 2.4% of net revenue in the same period of 2014. We remain focused on effective cost management in the quarter. As a percentage of revenues same hospital salary wage and benefit costs were flat at 46.4%.\nSame hospital supply costs improved by 50 basis points to 15.1% while same hospital other operating expenses increased by 30 basis points to 24.6% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. For the three months ended June 30, 2015 we recognized $14.2 million of meaningful use payments, consistent with our expectations. This is in comparison to $21 million of meaningful use payments recognized during the same quarter of last year.\nIn our second-quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA increased 10.3% to $175 million, an increase of $16.3 million from the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by our strong operating performance including the results of our recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an expected reduction in meaningful use income of approximately $6.8 million as previously discussed.\nOur second-quarter 2015 EBITDA margin declined by 140 basis points to 13.8% as compared to 15.2% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline was primarily the result of margins for many of our recent acquisitions which as a group had a combined margin in the mid single digits in the quarter.\nAdditionally, we had an expected 90 basis points dilution from reductions in meaningful use income. Diluted earnings per share were $1 in the quarter, up $0.16 compared to $0.84 in the same quarter of the prior year. Our diluted earnings per share growth was driven by our strong operating performance during the quarter as well as the impact of our repurchase of approximately $25 million in shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2015 under our Board approved repurchase plan and the full impact of all shares repurchased during 2014.\nAs of June 30, 2015 there were $75 million in shares remaining under our current authorization which expires in October of this year as well is $150 million under a new plan approved by our Board of Directors in June. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $188.4 million, beating our all-time record set in the first quarter earlier in the year. This represents an increase of $120.4 million or 177% from the same quarter of last year.\nOur operating cash flows in the quarter were positively impacted by increases in the amount and timing of cash receipts related to certain Medicaid DSH programs as well as decreases in the amount and timing of payments for interest in income taxes. We invested approximately $53.1 million in capital expenditures in the quarter and funded $12.5 million in acquisitions including working capital settlements.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was $135.3 million and after $18.8 million of cash proceeds received in connection with our sale of a hospital in Palatka, Florida that we announced last quarter cash increased by $140.9 million to $422.8 million as of June 30, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $8 million or 13.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions.\nFinally, and consistent with our historical practice of updating guidance midway through the year, we have revised our guidance for full-year 2015 as detailed in our press release. Our updated guidance is adjusted to incorporate the following.\nFirst, it removes eight months of revenue and EBITDA estimated at $41.3 million and $2.7 million respectively for the divestiture of Palatka, Florida on May 1, 2015. Second, it incorporates our expectations for our recent acquisition in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania and our anticipated transactions in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, Jeffersonville, Indiana and Watertown, Wisconsin. Annually we expect these transactions to generate approximately $320 million in revenue.\nProrated for their partial-year contributions in 2015 we expect them to generate approximately $140 million in revenue for the balance of the year and contribute less than 1% of revenue at the EBITDA line. We have not included our anticipated results of Providence Hospitals in Columbia, South Carolina or St. Francis Health System in Columbus, Georgia which we expect will ultimately contribute $250 million and $350 million respectively in revenue.\nConsistent with past practice we will wait to update our guidance until the transactions become definitive. As a result of these adjustments, we are increasing our revenue guidance to be in a range of $5.15 billion to $1.25 billion for the year. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $695 million to $720 million.\nWe now expect depreciation to be up to $290 million and we expect interest expense to be approximately $114 million. Finally, we expect earnings per share to fall in a range of $3.75 to $4.06 for the year. Depreciation expense associated with new acquisitions, operating at less than 1% EBITDA margins, results in an approximately $0.08 dilutive effect on EPS for the balance of the year. With regard to volume we are increasing the low end of our same hospital equivalent admissions guidance to be in a range of up 2.0% to up 3.0%. Finally, we expect our revenue per equivalent admissions to now be in a range of up 1% to up 2%.\nIn summary, we are making the right strategic moves, becoming more efficient operators and using our strong balance sheet to drive shareholder value. Additional information regarding our second-quarter results is available by reviewing our SEC filings including our 10-Q which we will file later today.\nWith that I will turn it over to Bill for some closing remarks.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [4]\n\nGreat, thanks Leif. We're pleased with the quarter and confident we are taking the right steps to continue to drive enhanced shareholder value.\nBefore we open up the call for questions I want to take this opportunity to thank all of LifePoint's talented employees and physicians who work hard every day to help us achieve our strategic objectives. I also look forward to welcoming our new employees, physicians and partners from Clark Memorial Hospital, Fleming County Hospital and Watertown Regional Medical Center in the very near future.\nWith that we'll take your questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nOperator [1]\n\n(Operator Instructions) A.J. Rice, UBS.\n\nA.J. Rice, UBS - Analyst [2]\n\nThanks, hi everybody. First, maybe on the volume trends, on the adjusted admission side you continue to show strong positive results right in line pretty much with what we were hoping and thinking. The inpatient side is a little softer this quarter relative to last and I know that's been more of a challenging area for non-urban hospitals.\nI know part of it is you've been making a lot of investments on the outpatient side and part of it is just maybe the underlying dynamics of the business. Can you just give us a little bit more of a flavor for how you delineate or how you think about that divergence in trend there?\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [3]\n\nYes, A.J., you're exactly right and I'll ask David to hit each of those points. Volumes have continued to be challenging in certain of our communities and David can walk you through what we saw and also some of the things that we're doing to improve volume on the inpatient side. But as we noted we saw good growth on the outpatient side and as you point out many of the investments that we've made have been on the outpatient side of the business which coincidentally is typically our highest margin business.\nNow I am proud that our teams continue to produce results even in this soft volume environment. Our strategy is the right strategy to achieve results long term. David, cover the rest of this.\n\nDavid Dill, LifePoint Health, Inc. - President & COO [4]\n\nSure. A.J., this is David. We have experienced strong outpatient volumes consistently now for six to eight quarters really across all the service lines.\nSurgical volumes that we can talk about a little bit were soft on the outpatient side this quarter but every other service line continues to remain strong. And that's overcoming what has been inpatient volumes flat to down 1% and obviously this quarter that we reported this morning had inpatient volumes down a little bit more down 4%.\nAnd so let me walk you through three main areas that are driving the volume decline that we saw this quarter and to Bill's point some of the things that we're doing operationally to mitigate it. As we have discussed on prior calls we continue to see a shift from inpatient surgeries to outpatient surgeries. That continues.\nThat doesn't have an effect on our overall surgical volume, it's just a moving from a site of care and there are always physician gaps, coverage gaps that exist and operationally we work hard to fill those gaps. We've got strategic plans in place, we've got physician recruiting initiatives in place. And I see those gaps as very short term in nature, no major closures of service lines or anything like that.\nSo operationally I think we are in good shape there. As we expected when we moved into 2015 and this was built into the guidance that we issued coming into 2015 around our adjusted admissions or equivalent admissions, we have experienced a decline in some inpatient volumes as a result of competitors and a couple of markets. And in one of those markets it's a new market that has now moved into same-store operation.\nYou can imagine hospitals that see the competitive landscape changing and are looking for partners, that is exactly what happened in this case where a new hospital in a fast-growing market has been contemplated to open for a long time. The hospital got open toward the end of last year, a very slow start and it ramped up as we got to the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, and the volume declines as a result to that are right in line with what we had expected and we expect those to continue. That is built into the guidance for the second half that Leif just walked through.\nThere are a couple of other of those competitive situations in different markets but the one in particular is a hospital that recently rolled into our same-store operations. The remaining decline -- so that's two.\nAnd finally the remaining decline is a result of declines in our admission rates from our emergency departments. Our observation visits are growing. The patients are staying in the community and staying in our hospitals for care.\nBut as we navigate the regulatory environment through extensive training and education led by both our compliance departments and our case management teams, we stay focused on ensuring that patients are in the right setting of care. And that is clearly having an impact on the admission statistic that we show but not from a marketshare standpoint and not from an outpatient standpoint. And you can see the adjusted admission still holding right in line with our expectation.\nSo those are three broad buckets of what drove those declines in the quarter. We will build out outpatient clinics in some of these competitive markets, bringing physicians to the market to set up broader boundaries to try to mitigate those competitive threats.\nThe inpatient to outpatient shift on the surgical volume I think we will continue to seek. But we will backfill with physicians and then finally more training and education, working closely with our hospitals to ensure that we lower denials, get patients in the right setting of care going forward.\n\nA.J. Rice, UBS - Analyst [5]\n\nOkay, thanks, and maybe just one follow-up. The pace of acquisitions continues to be very robust obviously. We've just noticed that more recently I guess you've had a string of either announced deals or deals that have been commented on in the press where it's LifePoint on a standalone basis buying them and not as much the LifePoint Duke JV that we've seen had such a steady stream there for a while.\nIs there anything to comment on about that? Or is that just a normal ebb and flow?\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [6]\n\nA.J., the timing of any acquisition is based on the timing of that particular acquisition. As you know hospital boards of trustees make their decisions in their own time frame and we have seen Duke LifePoint deals, we've seen a deal this quarter announced with that we're closing today that is part of the Norton joint venture up in Jeffersonville, Indiana and I'm pleased that there are deals that we are continuing to announce that are LifePoint deals. There are more deals in each category that are in our very active pipeline and you should expect to see more deals in Duke LifePoint in the future, I hope in the very near future.\n\nA.J. Rice, UBS - Analyst [7]\n\nOkay.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [8]\n\nSo we will keep you posted.\n\nA.J. Rice, UBS - Analyst [9]\n\nThat sounds like stay tuned. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator [10]\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert Baird.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [11]\n\nHey, thanks. Bill, sorry Marilyn had to resign, I was hoping she was coming to work as a double agent for you.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [12]\n\nWell, she's still a good friend but I certainly understand that her board felt that she needed to devote her full time and attention to her new job.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [13]\n\nIt was a good hire and a bad loss. But I guess I wanted to first go back to the volume discussion and maybe just for David, you cite a couple of different issues going on, some competition in markets, just general market declines, outpatient shift. How much of the weakness do you think is coming from maybe these idiosyncratic issues, just general market weakness and then these identified gaps that you've discussed?\n\nDavid Dill, LifePoint Health, Inc. - President & COO [14]\n\nIf I were to put these into those three broad buckets that I talked about I'd say half the decline is the decline in the admission rates, patients moving into a different status of care. So that's the biggest one and the one that we spend a lot of time training and educating on but the patients are still staying right there for care. And it's across all payer mix, so it's not just Medicare patients, it's very consistent with the payer mix that we see inside of our EDs.\nAnd that's why Bill mentioned and Leif mentioned we just still don't see an impact of this being just the two-midnight rule. The inpatient, outpatient shift on the surgical volumes, I think that is just the type of cases that we're doing in our hospitals and that shift will continue to happen.\nAnd that's probably 10% or 15% of the volume decline that we saw this quarter. And then the rest, the other third roughly are these competitive markets in two or three places with the biggest one being the one that I referenced where we have a competitive hospital that's opened up toward the end of last year and has ramped up this year.\nNow the good news is part of the acquisition story that Leif and Bill have talked so much about is moving into faster growing markets. And this is a market that will absorb that new hospital and we'll grow right through it over time, I have no doubt about that.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [15]\n\nGot it. And just the gaps that you've identified where you're going to be addressing this through some strategy, is it simply just a physician relationship issue? Does it require some capital?\nIs it recruiting a doc into a market where you lost someone? Is there any common theme there?\n\nDavid Dill, LifePoint Health, Inc. - President & COO [16]\n\nThere really isn't a common theme but it requires very little capital. It does require human capital to recruit the physicians in and provide the coverage that's needed but that will take time but not any significant capital investments to make that happen.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [17]\n\nOkay and Leif, can you just remind us what hospitals are going to be rolling into the same-store count in the second half? Just trying to keep track of that.\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [18]\n\nYes, so the only hospital that rolled in right now is Wilson that rolled in so far into the same-store category. In the back half we'll have Rutherfordton, we'll have the Haywood Hospital WestCare and then in the fourth quarter we will have the Conemaugh Health System.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [19]\n\nGot it. And do you happen to have your self-pay allowance as a percent of your gross self-pay AR? I can follow up if you don't have it.\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [20]\n\nIn terms of the balance sheet side of it I don't have it right in front of me but we'll file the Q here shortly.\n\nWhit Mayo, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [21]\n\nThat's fine. And maybe just one last one for Bill, just the quality designation program I want to get a sense of what you're accomplishing with that initiative, just any successes and what the importance of that designation is in the local markets and how you potentially marry that with some of the development efforts? Thanks.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [22]\n\nWell without question I think the focus on patient safety and quality has been a real differentiator for us. And I think back to A.J.'s question about the ebb and flow of partnerships that are in Duke LifePoint and that are LifePoint hospitals, in every hospital we are implementing a LifePoint National Quality Program arm in arm with Duke. And the impact of the National Quality Designation really allows us to in a better way objectively measure quality and patient safety standards.\nSo it is a big deal and I expect this to become a very prestigious designation for our hospitals to achieve. The National Quality Program is focused on measurable areas of creating a culture of safety, leadership and continuous improvement within our hospitals. So it's a significant place where we have joined with Duke to improve care all across the country.\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [23]\n\nAnd while Bill was answering that I went ahead and pulled the line from the Q that will be filed here in just a little bit. And the allowances for doubtful accounts plus certain contractual allowances and discounts related to self-pay patients as a percentage of self-pay receivables were 87.6% for June 30, 2015 versus 88.4% for 2014.\n\nOperator [24]\n\nKevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [25]\n\nGood morning, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the question.\nSo I appreciate the comment around the three hospitals that you included in the guidance and that they were only out of 1% of EBITDA, I mean percentage of revenue to EBITDA line. And then I guess did I hear right, you talked about three- to four-year time frame for margins to improve to your same-store level, is that the right characterization of what you said before?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [26]\n\nThat's very accurate, yes. So the hospitals that we are acquiring or operating at less than 1% EBITDA margins and over the course of three to four years our investment, strategic planning, etc., will bring those up to Company appropriate margins.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [27]\n\nRight, so then is there a sort of metric you look at in terms of maybe the bucket of acquisitions you did of the years? And where they are now can you talk about the deal that you've done so far and where they stand in terms of compared to that three- to four-year outlook for margin improvement where they stand on that?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [28]\n\nYes, Joanna, so as we make that statement about acquiring things really in the low single digits in the year of acquisition, these are particularly low as we roll in taxes, state and local taxes. We also will lose some of the benefits that not-for-profits have benefited from in certain of these markets. So these in particular are starting at the low end of that low single-digit range.\nBut then we are typically able to go from low single digits to the high single digits to the very low double digits and then the Company margin. As we've talked about that I've been very careful to look at it and evaluate it going into each reporting period to ensure that we're still performing consistent with that. And although each individual market doesn't, in aggregate the transactions do.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [29]\n\nOkay, so you're saying that the deals you have done, for example the $1.2 billion or million you talk about in acquired revenues sort of performing that way you would've expected in the aggregate maybe some are taking longer but that maybe some cost flows are faster, so you just feel like you're on track with the margin progression you would have normally expected?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [30]\n\nThat's correct.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [31]\n\nAll right. And then on the policy front can you comment or give us any color you're willing to give at this point?\nBut the CMS proposed mandatory bundle for joint replacement, can you comment about the Company exposure positioning for that and what it would mean? Or even for the industry if you're not ready to talk about your own projections at this point. And then just broadly about your view of around the BPCI involvement of your hospitals?\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [32]\n\nWe have three markets that will be inside of that mandatory group. As we evaluate the impact of that we're not anticipating any material impact at all on the results as a function of it.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [33]\n\nAnd then about your involvement in the existing BPCI, the bundling demonstration project from CMS?\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [34]\n\nI'm sorry, Joanna, could you repeat that?\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [35]\n\nYes, so are your hospitals participating in the BPCI, the CMS bundling demonstration?\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [36]\n\nThey are not.\n\nJoanna Gajuk, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [37]\n\nAll right, thank you. That's all for me. Thank you.\n\nOperator [38]\n\nMatthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs.\n\nMatthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [39]\n\nHi, yes, I just wanted to come back to the volume question because it looks to me like things are on track for your stated strategy and yet you see a negative market reaction today. That's obviously short-term relative to a couple of other provider Company stocks that are up a lot on a stronger volume results I think reflecting urban markets. I think some of the things you've talked about shifting to outpatient and reducing one-day stays are things that the others are working on as well.\nSo can you maybe address the lag if it is a lag in rural markets that is creating softer volume environment for you? And how long do you think that will continue? And maybe if you think we investors have too much of a focus on the same-store volume side relative to LifePoint's strategy?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [40]\n\nSo I will take that one, Matt. And if I step back and look at the equivalent admissions on a year-to-date basis up 3.9% we're feeling pretty good about that. And inpatient moving to observation reflects in that adjusted admission number, although it also reflects in the year-to-date admission number down 1.1%.\nBut in the face of markets where we still haven't seen population growth and we still haven't seen job growth, it feels very good in terms of the execution on our strategic planning and the investments that we're making in our service lines. So as we look at and measure each individual quarter we're going to see some noise especially from the operational gaps that David mentioned but we've got physician recruiting plans behind those and those are just an ordinary part of quarterly transitions.\nSo we feel good about the volumes. I think that's reflected in our guidance for the back half of this year. And if we could see some benefit to our economies that's lagging the urban markets that will be wonderful tailwind.\n\nMatthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [41]\n\nOkay, fair enough. And maybe just one last question, I realize it's too early to say at this point but do you see any reason right now why you might expect your pace of acquisitions to be more or less than they've been looked to have been for this year, in 2016?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [42]\n\nWith the transactions that are closing today and then with Watertown that just received attorney general approval and will close at the end of next month, and then Nason earlier in the year, it's a little over 300 -- pushing $325 million in revenue.\nAs Bill talked about Providence and St. Francis it's another $600 million and at any time boards that we have been strategically engaged with could make the determination that the time is appropriate. So it is hard to predict exactly when these transactions will come through. I think we're all excited that so much has come through here over the course of the last 30 days.\nBut the same headwinds are out there for local operators. We continue to bring the same advantages. Our focus on quality and safety has been extremely well received and I think our pipeline is very promising.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [43]\n\nI think it's also important to recognize that where LifePoint sits in north of $5 billion of annual net revenue, the acquisitions that we had announced before these two pending that we talked about today can meaningfully move the needle for our Company. So the law of big numbers hasn't caught up with us and we have the ability to move the needle on a few million dollars, a few hundred million dollars of annual net revenue and the fact that over the last several years we've been able to significantly exceed that and now as we've discussed today we will significantly exceed that again today, again this year, when you take those hospitals at the low single-digit EBITDA margin and over the course of the next three or four years grow them toward the Company average we have the ability to sustain that growth trajectory that we're all looking for. And so I think that's the message that's really important to understand as we look at it.\n\nMatthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [44]\n\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n\nOperator [45]\n\nSheryl Skolnick, MS USA.\n\nSheryl Skolnick, Mizuho Securities USA Inc. - Analyst [46]\n\nGood morning, thank you very much for letting me ask a question on this. I really appreciate it. I have to drill back down into this volume question without risking beating a dead horse but there are certain things that I -- there is a dynamic here I clearly feel like I'm not understanding.\nOn the one hand you mentioned that you have some coverage gaps. So that seems to be Company-specific, in terms of physician coverage of service lines you haven't abandoned them but clearly you're not capturing all the volume.\nIs that A is that correct? B, I'm concerned about your comment about the new hospital that's come in to the same-store base with respect to the competitive positioning of another hospital. And whether or not that's representative of the new markets that you're getting into, frankly that feels uncomfortable because it seems like it's a throwback to some of the less than positive acquisition experience we've seen in some of your markets historically.\nSo I would like you to characterize the rest of the acquisition population that is coming into the same-store base, in terms of whether or not we should expect this kind of competitive impact.\nThe derivative question there is at what point do these positive impacts that you're making on these acquired hospitals begin to stir the inpatient growth, not just outpatient but inpatient growth, in your acquired markets? Or do you anticipate closing down inpatient capacity as inpatient growth continues to be negative?\nThen the final question that I have here is how do we think about the continued pressure on inpatient stays when it's such a high dollar of revenue activity? And given your numbers, you need basically 2.64 outpatient visits to get to 1 inpatient admission. Don't we need to see a more rapid acceleration of your outpatient growth rate than we've been seeing in order to stay even? Thank you.\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [47]\n\nThanks, Sheryl. I wish I had been writing them down as you went, but let me take a good shot at the four questions. The first in terms of the operational gaps, yes, those are primarily physician specific. They relate to things where we have recruiting strategies in place, and sometimes you wind up where you have timing differentials. But there is not a long-term service line that has been closed or compromised as a function of that.\nSo those are things that we think are transitional, but I like to look at things over a longer period of time, hence my reference to the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the specific quarter.\nIn terms of the new market competitor and being uncomfortable with the acquisitions in specific markets, this particular market is one where this hospital as you can imagine has been planned for a very long period of time. The board of directors in this particular hospital was well aware that it was coming.\nAnd there was a decision around that that market, the board, the management team, wanted a strategic partner to help it develop more complex service lines and to develop a competitive footprint so as new market entrants came, there would be a choice where patients would elect to go to this hospital and to LifePoint for care. And to make it a place where physicians wanted to go to practice and make it a place where employees want to work.\nSo we won that transaction in the face of that opening. I don't think that will be unusual. As we look out across different markets it is all of these headwinds.\nThe cuts coming around reform, it's competitive impacts in marketplace, it's the new reimbursement dynamics that are causing these folks to seek partners and we believe strongly that we can fill in where those hospitals have had difficulty on their own. So importantly on this particular hospital it is operating well ahead of its pro forma EBITDA target.\nIt's also operating well ahead of its historical margins. So although we're seeing some softness on the admit number there, we're seeing real strength in the performance of the investment and real strength in the underlying market itself.\nSo I expect we will see that particularly in a couple that we know are in the pipeline but places where we think we will be very well positioned for growth, service line investment, etc. Then in terms of at what point is the inpatient growth stirred, in these acquisitions that takes some time, so in the strategic planning side David's teams spend the first six months with the community, with the medical staff, with the board, the administrative teams, defining what we're going to do over the next three years.\nThen the investments in those higher end service lines are really starting to take root at the end of the second year and into the third year along with the physician recruiting that has to come behind that. So stability in the admissions line absent a market like the one we've been discussing where there is a new competitive entrant but what we would expect to see on the inpatient side with real strong growth on the outpatient services just as a function of market shift. In terms of the pressure on inpatient stays I'm going to look at David there because his team has done a lot of work on that.\n\nDavid Dill, LifePoint Health, Inc. - President & COO [48]\n\nSo thank you, Leif. I mentioned earlier in a comment, Sheryl, around the payer mix that's moving from more into observation. It's very consistent with payer mix we've seen in all of our emergency departments.\nIf it was just Medicare business that was moving you're right it's hard to overcome that because if you look at our financial statements you'll see that we've been able to overcome this shift. And it's dropped through and margins have extended as a result of it.\nBecause as Bill mentioned in one of the opening questions around our outpatient business is typically our highest margin business, our commercial payments are geared toward this and actually benefit us when that happens on the commercial side. So if it was just the Medicare business shifting it would have more pressure but when it's the overall payer mix shifting we feel it a lot less and we're less dependent upon replacing that 2.6X visits on the outpatient side to offset that one historical admission that moved Medicare over to outpatient visits.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [49]\n\nAnd, Sheryl, let me add one thing here, too, that I think is important to note. It is, Leif is exactly right, we're hitting or exceeding our expectations with respect to these new acquisitions that are coming in. But it's important to recognize that we are the partner of choice on the basis of our commitment to patient safety and quality as well as the strength of the balance sheet will allow us to continue to make those good solid investments in those communities in order to allow them to be competitive over time. And we fully expect to be able to do that and it's important to note that the price we're paying gives us room in order to have those hospitals be very successful over time.\n\nSheryl Skolnick, Mizuho Securities USA Inc. - Analyst [50]\n\nI understand and appreciate all of that and I can understand why a seller would be comfortable with LifePoint especially given the way you very carefully managed the balance sheet and you are showing year-over-year growth in EBITDA. But as much as you're positioning the Company appropriately for outpatient and appropriately for other healthcare services the bulk of the investment of this Company and the shareholders' wealth is tied up in your hospitals and when those empty out there's a drag. Because it's still high dollars of revenue that disappear even though your margin percentage on the outpatient is higher.\nSo that's why am really focused in these new markets my thought was in these new markets you were going into situations that offered a lot of upside. They were in markets presumably where you have beneficial exposure to a better payer mix, beneficial exposure to a better acuity mix and the opportunity to take an asset from underperforming to in line to outperforming relative to its historic goals. All of that is really good.\nThe problem is that we're certainly not seeing it in the inpatient volumes. And as inpatient volumes go I think so goes stock prices and therefore I need to understand how much of what you've acquired is going to start impacting the inpatient volumes and when? Because as you've said the legacy markets you're in and the rural markets that you're in are still suffering from the impact of a weak economy and population contraction.\nSo the question is when should we start seeing it in inpatient? And then basically sometime over the next two to three years we might start seeing it other things equal in the inpatient. But we're not getting the kind of benefit from reform on the inpatient side, we're getting some benefit on the outpatient side I think.\nAnd so that's a little bit different from if not a little disappointing relative to where I think investors' heads were about the progress of LifePoint in its capital deployment strategy. That's what you've begun to clarify it for me but I think that's really the question is when do we start seeing it firing on all cylinders?\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [51]\n\nSo there is a statistic that you'll see here later today as we file the 10-Q which I think is very important as we talked about where investor capital is tied up, etc. Our outpatient factor in the business is going to show up as 2.66 times. And so as we think about that on a gross basis we've got for every $100 in inpatient we have $166 in outpatient revenue.\nSo the investor capital is very much tied up in our outpatient services and where we have been investing capital here over the last many years. That's everything from the primary care access points, it's the ambulatory surgery center, it's the outpatient surgery and diagnostic facilities, it's things on the post-acute side.\nThere are services that we are investing in across the continuum of our market which will allow us to take care of patients not just inside the building but outside the building in other points and access points for care. As we look at the margin profile and our ability to manage those patients the inpatient component is very important in the continuum but it is not as important as we look at it from a driver of margin and growth for the Company.\nSo specific to your question on when should you expect to see inpatient volumes move, in the larger hospitals that we're acquiring that are focused on the higher end tertiary services, so orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, neonatology, those markets we should see firmness to growth on the inpatient side. But we're going to continue to try to put those patients in the right place for care and that doesn't as David pointed out translate to a deterioration in profitability.\nIt translates to better outcomes, higher safety levels and ultimately same-store EBITDA margin growth which you can see in the numbers I relayed today. If you look at salary, wage and benefit numbers, you look at our same-store supply costs and you look at the very, very small piece we saw from our form we're up 30 basis points on those numbers. That is a meaningful movement and helps reflect that dialogue I laid out for you.\n\nSheryl Skolnick, Mizuho Securities USA Inc. - Analyst [52]\n\nI appreciate that explanation very, very much. Thank you.\n\nOperator [53]\n\nFrank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets.\n\nFrank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [54]\n\nYes, I think most of my questions were just answered in that last question. But are there any geographies that you could specifically call out where volumes are better, where inpatient admission volumes are better?\nOr can you emphatically say that these new larger markets have better volumes right here, right now than your classic legacy rural markets? Thanks.\n\nDavid Dill, LifePoint Health, Inc. - President & COO [55]\n\nI think of those two questions definitely the larger hospitals more stability, less volatility, a bigger mix of surgical volumes versus medical volumes happening in those larger markets, so larger, faster growing markets for sure to Leif's point will create stability. The expansion state seem to have more stability as well from a volume standpoint. That's not just inpatient volumes but outpatient volumes as well through the ED and through our physician practices also.\nSo states are more mature in that like the state of Kentucky where it was one of the early adopters that got off to a quick start, some places like West Virginia. I think it's too early to say that there is a definite difference between expansion and non-expansion but trends are starting to emerge that that appears where there is a little more stability, at least here four quarters into the expansion.\n\nFrank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [56]\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator [57]\n\nAndrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley.\n\nAndrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley - Analyst [58]\n\nThanks for squeezing me in here. Just real quick on your leverage levels you remain kind of underlevered versus maybe your historical and your peers here. So maybe thoughts on uses of cash and it looks like maybe you're preparing for more acquisitions than you had maybe historically, on top of that you did share repos in the first quarter but not the second quarter, so any update there would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [59]\n\nAndy, it's a great observation. I think as the Q comes out and you can calculate on the press release we're well under three times leverage as we finish up the quarter. But as we complete the pipeline that we have defined here we're likely going to see leverage that's north of 3.5 times and depending on certain other transactions that come through could approach 4.0 times EBITDA at least on an LTM basis from an EBITDA perspective.\nSo we are consistent with our past practice of being very judicious about when and how we deploy the stock buyback program. So as you think through those numbers and Bill mentioned valuation, we are still in terms of valuation here the transactions that are closing today and through the end of the month have an average multiple of revenue that's less than half a turn. Even with the addition of the two larger transactions we'll finish 2015 with purchase price less than 50% of revenue but it will still drive leverage up to the 3.5 to 4 times range.\nSo we will be thoughtful about the balance sheet and we will be thoughtful about the pipeline and utilize stock buyback as a use of our cash when the pipeline is thinner. And we'll utilize acquisition as the pipeline is as strong as it is right now.\n\nAndrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley - Analyst [60]\n\nOkay. Maybe just following up to the ones here, one is on the divestiture side I think it looks like you should be probably settled now in the stability of your portfolio. Just want to confirm that.\nAnd then secondly we have seen two hospital companies partner with REITs. I know you own a lot of your real estate, any thoughts on those types of transactions? It sounds like you obviously don't need the capital just today.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [61]\n\nSo Andy, with regard to the divestitures that we did recently those are all of the divestitures that are expected at this time. Our decision to sell a hospital comes only after a great deal of consideration.\nWe don't take those decisions lightly. Ultimately we came to the conclusion that those hospitals fit better with our provider with a stronger regional presence that could devote resources that were needed in those communities. So to be clear these are the only divestitures that we have in mind, always recognizing that we have an obligation to constantly look at everything and along that line with regard to your second question we're very focused on creating value for our stockholders.\nWe've studied these REIT structures over the years. It's not new. We have certainly refreshed our analysis as they have become more popular, apparently recently.\nBut this structure is just one of many options that are available to attract capital and we have great access to capital. So I think that's the answer for that.\n\nAndrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley - Analyst [62]\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nOperator [63]\n\nThat's all the time we have for today's question. I'll turn it back to Mr. Carpenter to continue or for your closing remarks, sir, thank you.\n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [64]\n\nGreat, thank you very much. In conclusion let me just say our teams are executing on the priorities that have and will remain our focus, delivering high-quality patient care and service, growing in existing markets and through acquisitions, continuously improving our operating efficiency and developing high-performing talent.\nAs we've said on our call today our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our integration processes are effective and scalable.\nWe have the opportunity to build on our momentum, grow EBITDA and cash flow and create meaningful shareholder value in the coming years all while making our communities even healthier. So thanks to all of you for joining our call today and thank you for your interest in LifePoint Health.\n\nOperator [65]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:49:24.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
