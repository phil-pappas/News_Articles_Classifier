The study shows that men who earn most of their household's income were most likely to want to work less. \nThe sociologists Shireen Kanji and Robin Samuel also found that for male breadwinners the attraction of spending time with a partner was as strong as children's company. \nDr Kanji, of the University of Leicester, and Dr Samuel, of the University of Bern, analysed survey data on the working lives of more than 4,000 men in 12 European countries, including Britain. \nThe findings, published in the journal Sociology, show that 58 per cent of male breadwinners - those who earned more than their partners - were more likely to want to spend more time at home, and 15 per cent wanted to work longer. \nBreadwinners with a partner and no children were as keen to work less and spend more time at home as were men with children. \nDr Kanji said: \"We show that male breadwinners are at a higher risk of overwork and this is related to the job interfering with family life, a form of work-life conflict.\" \nMany workers find themselves under pressure to work longer hours today. \nA study earlier this week by the TUC found the number of people working more than 48 hours a week had risen by 15 per cent to more than 3.4 million since 2010. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the country risked \"burnout\", with at least one million people wanting to cut their hours (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:58:35.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
