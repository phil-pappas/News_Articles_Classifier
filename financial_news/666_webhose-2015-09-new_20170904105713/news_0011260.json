That is much more than in previous months, though no official statistics are available.\nOthers signs also point to a shortage of tanks. Midstream players Buckeye Partners LP and NuStar Energy LP say they have basically run out of space. And some producers with terminals in the zone say now is a good time to put barrels into tanks and wait for U.S. crude prices to rise from $40-a-barrel doldrums.\n\"All tanks are subscribed,\" said the storage broker. Things have not looked this tight in six years.\nCrude inventories have been building up in recent months in most terminals, leaving limited space for subleasing, which could imply higher rents, he said.\n\"We are at 100 percent capacity\", said a spokesman from NuStar Energy, referring to bookings at the company's terminal in St. Eustatius, with tankage for 13 million barrels.\nNustar, which in 2014 gained Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA as a customer, is already in discussions to extend a contract set to expire in early 2017, he added.\nBuckeye Partners, which has about a third of the region's storage capacity excluding tanks for refineries, has already leased out tanks it is adding in St. Lucia. It is also converting product tanks for crude in the Bahamas.\n\"We expect those growth projects to be fully operational later this year. And those are all contracted under term agreements,\" Khalid Muslih, head of Buckeye's terminals business, said on the company's July results call.\nPDVSA, Brazil's Petrobras and Royal Dutch Shell regularly use Buckeye's terminals in St. Lucia and the Bahamas, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.\nThe companies did not comment.\nCONTANGO INCENTIVE\nThe oil market's contango structure <0#CL:>, where barrels for delivery later in the year are priced higher than prompt supplies, is providing a financial reason to store and hedge. Traders bet prices will rise after a 60 percent slide.\n\"The observable forward market provides a good indication of the incentive to store physical barrels,\" said a spokesman for Statoil, which manages a terminal in Bahamas.\nStorage is such a good business right now that owners of the shuttered Hovensa refinery, Hess Corp and PDVSA, are making moves to sell it for use as a terminal, local media reports say, while U.S. Valero Energy confirmed that tanks at its shuttered Aruba refinery are \"active\" as well.\nA Hovensa representative did not comment.\nTerminals in Bahamas, Bonaire, St. Lucia and St. Eustatius that do not serve refineries received some 15.25 million barrels of crude from June, when prices started to fall, through July, according to Thomson Reuters data. They shipped out 12.16 million barrels in the same period, showing a rise in inventories.\nU.S. IMPORTS FROM CARIBBEAN SOAR\nA bigger amount of those inventories in the Caribbean have arrived in the United States since the middle of the year, attracted by low freights costs.\nIn July, the United States received 8.37 million barrels of crude from the Caribbean, a 37 rise from May, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.\nBrazilian crude exports from the Caribbean to the United States more than tripled in that period. At the same time, Colombian, Angolan, Trinidadian and even rare Belize grades arrived on U.S. Gulf, East and West Coasts, the data shows.\nTrading firms Vitol, Gunvor and PetroChina have also actively been moving Latin American and African oil to and from the islands, the data show.\nMuch of the storage demand comes from PDVSA, which uses five spots in the area to blend heavy and light crudes into more marketable ones.\nPDVSA has been blending and storing more in Curacao and Saint Eustatius while buying Russian and Nigerian oil, according to internal reports and vessel tracking data.\n(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Editing by Terry Wade and Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:21:14.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
