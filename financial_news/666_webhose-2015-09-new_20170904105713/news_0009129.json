During 2015, colon cancer is expected to cause about 49,700 deaths nationwide.\nA good amount of research has already shown that oneâ€™s diet can alter the metabolism and composition of colon microbiota, which has major implications for disease prevention and treatment, Turner said.\nThe research explored the potential cancer-protective properties of dried plums using a well-established rat model of colon cancer, she said, adding that dried plums contain phenolic compounds, which have multiple effects on the health, including their ability to serve as antioxidants that can neutralize the oxidant effect of free radicals that can damage our DNA.\nAnother observation made was rats consuming dried plums had significantly reduced numbers of aberrant crypts, aberrant crypt foci and high-multiplicity aberrant crypt foci compared to control rats.\nShe said while additional research is needed, particularly in human studies, the results from this study are exciting because they suggest that regularly eating dried plums may be a viable dietary strategy to help reduce the risk of colon cancer.\n 26, 2015 12:15 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:22:40.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
