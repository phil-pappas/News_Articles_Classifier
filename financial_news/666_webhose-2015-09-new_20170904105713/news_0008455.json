Corporate finance partner and head of transaction services Ian Turner said the 2014 wave of market listings, fuelled by pent up supply as companies capitalised on improving markets, has some way to run. \"A strong pipeline still exists as managers and financial sponsors prepare their companies for the public markets,\" he said. \"Despite global volatility, we are seeing strong investor confidence given the quality of IPOs. \"You only have to look at the listings for the first half of 2015 and their impressive performance.\" The combined share price performance of companies to list in 2015 is a gain of 7.2 per cent, compared to a fall of 4.1 per cent for the ASX200 index.
