Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal also bought Origin Asset Management in 2011 to push into emerging markets.\nInsurers have been moving beyond bonds in recent years to improve returns on their own funds or attract third-party clients looking to diversify risks. XL Group Plc’s CEO Mike McGavick said in May that his company was turning to infrastructure investments to boost yields . TIAA-CREF started a $667 million timber venture in June.\n“We’re looking for certainty and we’re looking for something that allows people to sleep well at night,” Houston said. “Not a lot of volatility.”\nPrincipal has expanded its operations into nations including Chile, Mexico and Brazil, and more than quadrupled its assets under management since going public in 2001. Houston, who joined in 1984 and took over as CEO in August from Larry Zimpleman, said Principal will focus on strengthening its position in international markets where it already has a foothold.\n“On the next dollar we invest, is it to go deep where we’re at, and make sure that we secure the fort? Or do we dilute ourselves and go to these other markets?” he said. One of his priorities is “certainly making sure that we have secured our position.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:30:26.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
