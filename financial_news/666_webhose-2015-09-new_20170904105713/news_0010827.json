Biotech Amgen Inc. AMGN -1.28 % was working on the bear research to get a better grip on the biology behind diseases like obesity and diabetes.\nRelated Reading\nTo Learn About Obesity, Researchers Turn to Grizzly Bears (Dec. 15, 2013) FDA Approves Amgen’s Cholesterol-Lowering Drug Repatha (Aug. 27) Amgen Reaches $71 Million Settlement With States (Aug. 18) Amgen Files for U.S. Approval of Therapy for Dialysis Patients (Aug. 25) But Amgen said it discovered late last year, in reviewing the computer files of one of its researchers, that some experimental data cited in the Cell Metabolism paper had been changed in a way the company said made some of the results look stronger.\nAmgen and its collaborators at Washington State University and the University of Idaho said they quickly asked Cell Metabolism for a retraction. The journal then reviewed the matter, resulting in the paper’s retraction.\nAmgen, along with researchers at Washington state’s bear-research center and the University of Idaho, said the data manipulation was the work of a lone company scientist and didn’t affect the paper’s overall finding about the bears’ metabolisms. Neither Amgen nor the university researchers would identify the scientist, who has been fired.\n“We know data were actually manipulated and that just cannot stand,” Alexander Kamb, Amgen’s research chief, said in an interview. Dr. Kamb wasn’t an author of the paper.\n“Amgen holds our scientists to the highest standards of ethical research. Amgen has internal policies and practices in place to prevent and detect this type of activity and we deeply regret this circumstance. We extend our sincere apologies to the scientific community,” the biotech company said.\nENLARGE Biotech group Amgen had been working with the Washington State University and the University of Idaho on the grizzly-bear study. Photo: Associated Press Lynne Nelson, one of the paper’s lead authors who is a professor of cardiology at Washington state, said its bear-research center was stunned to learn of the doctoring from Amgen and is now repeating the research itself to confirm the findings.\n“We did nothing wrong, and we’re still going to pursue the hibernation physiology in bears because we think it’s an important thing to do,” she said.\nThe paper had 12 authors, six of whom had worked for Amgen while conducting the research. The senior author was Kevin Corbit. Dr. Corbit said he was let go from Amgen for fabricating research “on another matter.” He said he fabricated that data to help a co-worker in what he said was an isolated incident and a regrettable decision.\nHe said he stands behind the grizzly-bear paper, and he believes that “if independent experiments were conducted, as dictated by proper scientific discourse, the work would be reproduced.” He says his co-authors have no involvement in any dispute over the work.\n‘ We did nothing wrong, and we’re still going to pursue the hibernation physiology in bears because we think it’s an important thing to do. ’\n—Lynne Nelson, one of the paper’s lead authors who is a professor of cardiology at Washington state Dr. Corbit’s and Amgen’s work was the subject of a 2013 article in The Wall Street Journa l about how bears could offer clues to the mechanism of diseases like obesity and diabetes in humans. Grizzly bears gain considerable weight and fat before going into hibernation, but don’t develop diabetes like some humans whose fat mass increases.\nThe Cell Metabolism paper concluded the bears turn on and off their sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that controls how much the body stores for energy from the sugars in food. As they gain weight in preparation for hibernation, the bears are much more sensitive to insulin. Then during hibernation, they switch off their insulin responsiveness.\nThis “metabolic switching” isn’t in doubt, according to Drs. Kamb and Nelson, and it could inform how bears are able to utilize their fat stores during hibernation and prevent the onset of diabetes. But the data manipulation calls into question the paper’s explanation of how the bears do this, involving a protein called PTEN.\nThe protein still could be responsible, or it could be something else, Dr. Nelson said. “It’s hard for me to say at this point what’s real or what’s not.”\nWrite to Jonathan D.
