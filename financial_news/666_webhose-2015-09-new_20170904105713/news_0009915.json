Like-for-like store sales, which excludes the impact of these new outlets, grew 3.4pc. \nChief executive Will Adderley, who is the founder’s son, said Dunelm was undergoing several important changes as it prepares for its next phase of growth - which includes ambitious plans to boost sales by 50pc over the medium term and increase its store portfolio to 200 in a bid to become a household name in the UK. \nOne of the most significant changes this year will see CEO-in-waiting John Browett take the helm in January, at which point Mr Adderley will return to his former position as deputy chairman. \nThe board changes follow former CEO Nick Wharton’s resignation in September last year . \nLast year Dunelm invested heavily to expand its online shopping platform and delivery service. A new website went live in July and a warehouse and distribution centre are set to become operational next spring. \nThe online effort appears to be paying off: last year home delivery sales soared 55pc, accounting for 6.1pc of total business, up from 4.4pc the year before. \nMr Adderley said London and the South East offer huge growth potential for Dunelm and that the retailer would continue to invest in its stores, which are earmarked for a major revamp this year. \nSince the financial year-end, Dunelm has opened one store and has a further nine in the pipeline, with six scheduled to open their doors this year. \nDespite the investments in stores, online, distribution, IT (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) and marketing which resulted in an 18pc hike in operating costs and higher capital spending - the retailer still managed to report a 5pc rise in pre-tax profits to £121.4m. \n\"It has been a busy and very successful year at Dunelm and the business is in better shape than ever with good momentum and clear plans for further growth,” said Mr Adderley. \n• Downton Abbey (LSE: ABBY.L - news ) boosts Dunelm \n• Dunelm fails to pay thousands of staff \n\"Customers continue to respond well to our specialist homewares offer and we have made strong progress in all elements of our growth strategy. \n\"I look forward to supporting John Browett, when he takes over in January, and the whole executive team to deliver Dunelm's full potential.\" \nSince it listed on the stock market in 2006, Dunelm has enjoyed 11pc compound annual sales growth. \nThe business was founded in 1979 by Bill and Jean Adderley from a market stall in Leicester where they traded in home textiles. \nDunelm’s success is built on offering a wide choice of products over a broader range of prices to its competitors, attracting shoppers from all walks of life, from frugal consumers to discerning middle class housewives (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:32:18.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
