The action \"only exacerbates the strike because parents and children have now officially joined the strike and demonstrations will be bigger than in the last three weeks.\" \nKuppet national chairman Omboko Milemba said in a statementbexams should be cancelled, Education CS Jacob Kaimenyi should take responsibility for chaos and resign and no laymen should teach children. \n\"The strike moves to the next level. It's now a people's strike, not a teachers' strike anymore,\" he said. \nSome 288,060 teachers have been on strike since the first day of the term, pressing for a court-ordered salary increase of 50-60 percent over four years. The Labour Court and Court of Appeal ruled for the award, while the Supreme Court stayed out, saying it had no jurisdiction. \nThe award this year would be Sh17 billion, but the government says it has no money and refuses to pay. \nTwo unions Knut and Kuppet say the strike will continue until the pay demands are met. \nThe Teachers Service Commission has failed to have the Labour Court overruled. \nYesterday the Education ministry said the revision of term dates and closure was necessary because education had come to a standstill since the third term opened three weeks ago. \n\"As a result, tension has been building up among learners, who have been left idle under care of very few teachers,\" Rotich said. \nSome insecurity and accidents have been reported by heads of institutions and field officers. \nYesterday, the Kenya National Association of Parents opposed the closure of private schools but supported closing public schools. \n\"We support the move because of the safety of our children. We don't want intruders to blow up our children in schools,\" said KNAP secretary general Musau Ndunda. \nHe said schools must refund third-term fees because children were not taught. \nSpeaking to the Star on the phone, Ndunda said Kuppet advises private school owners to sue the government for closing their schools. \nIn announcing the exams would be held, PS Kipsang said all arrangements are in place and circulars and instructions are ready for dispatch to all education officers. \n\"Security being central to a conducive examination environment, I assure the candidates and their teachers the government has put measures in place to secure the candidates, the examination materials and all personnel involved,\" he said.
