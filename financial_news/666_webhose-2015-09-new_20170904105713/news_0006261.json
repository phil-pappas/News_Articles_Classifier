If you came up short in saving, voila! You had enough money to retire. That may no longer be the case.The reason is fairly simple: Millennials won't be flooding the market to buy homes from Baby Boomers who are downsizing for retirement. They don't have the money, are largely renting (or lodging with parents) and are burdened with crushing student debt.This is by no means a judgement on an entire generation -- one that I admire and respect. Perhaps it's more of an indictment of Baby Boomers, their parents and the government for letting college and home prices get out of hand.Let me explain.I've been watching home prices before and after the 2008 meltdown. I even wrote a book about U.S. real estate, so I've had my eye on this subject for more than a decade.The upshot is that home sales are not the same as they were before the market peaked in 2006, nor should they, because cheap credit and mortgage securitization created an epic bubble.The real story is that home prices aren't doing all that well, and new home sales are sluggish. This trend may continue for some time.According to the latest S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index report, there are some telling numbers. Although year to year increases (through July) ranged from 10% (Denver) to 1.3% (Washington), that's to be expected because home sales always pick up in the summer months.But if you look at the seasonally adjusted numbers -- accounting for the warm-weather boost -- you see a different story.The composite index covering 20 major U.S. cities is flat. Major metro areas like Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and San Diego are in negative territory. Should this be happening in a general economic recovery?You could argue that these markets are taking a breather from a significant run-up over the past several years.The housing market took a long time to reboot after the 2008 credit and stock-market crash.Potential home buyers, stung by job loss, foreclosures, huge sell-offs in overbuilt markets (California, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Florida) and a general economic malaise, stayed away from home purchases.Yet there was something more troubling happening that threatens the long-term health of the U.S. home market, one that will impair growth in home equity. I see it happening in my own neighborhood north of Chicago, where all but one of the homes sold in the past year declined in value (the difference between listing and selling prices).In residential real estate, home prices rise because buyers are willing to bid up selling prices from listing prices. Local supply of homes and buyer demand largely drives that.What if new buyers aren't coming into the market, those from a younger generation getting married, having children and \"establishing households,\" in the lingo of economists? That seems to be happening.About half of millennials surveyed by the National Association of Realtors said they weren't buying homes because of college debt. And many fell into default on their student loans, which further hampered their chances of getting a mortgage and buying a house.Since there are some 40 million Americans carrying some student debt -- loans that they may carry for decades -- that doesn't bode well for the U.S. home market. These folks won't be able to buy homes and bid up prices. What You Can Do There's not much you can do about the $1.3 trillion student debt leviathan, unless you want to lobby Congress to have some of these debts forgiven (either through bankruptcy or a blanket amnesty). This debt burden is clearly hurting the economy and home values.If you're planning to move, you have to do some homework to ensure that you can have a chance to build home equity. * Choose a market in which there's strong job growth, influx of population and demand for new and existing housing. This would knock out most of the \"Rust Belt\" states with the exception of perhaps Minnesota. I would strongly consider places like Denver, Miami, New York and Seattle. You probably won't find any bargains there, but people still want to live there. * Take some risks in where you relocate. You're not going to find any bargain-basement pricing in hot markets like San Francisco. If the location suits you, consider off-the-radar areas like Buffalo, Detroit, Minneapolis or Nashville. Keep in mind that every Sunbelt locale has been blistered by the crash and may have recovered: These are prime epicenters for the real estate boom and bust cycles. * Stop thinking about your home as an investment. Anything that needs to be financed, has a roof and can be taxed in a big way, is not an investment. If most of your wealth is tied up in home equity, you need to diversify. Invest in stocks from all over the world. Fully fund your 401(k) or IRA.The most important takeaway: Your home is not some sexy tech stock. It's more like a bond that could lose value. But its principal is never guaranteed.", "external_links": ["https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/212743_cshomeprice-release-0728.pdf?force_download=true", "http://time.com/money/3984498/student-debt-keeping-millennials-from-life-events/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047091808X"], "published": "2015-09-11T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:42:25.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
