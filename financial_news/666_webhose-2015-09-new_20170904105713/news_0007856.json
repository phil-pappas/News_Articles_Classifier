High mobile and internet penetration: Mobile and internet penetration in the UK were 131% and 84%, respectively, in 2014. That internet penetration rate is among the highest in the world, while mobile penetration is one percentage point lower than EU frontrunner Germany. Early adopters of e-commerce: In 2012, the UK's consumer e-commerce spend per capita was $1754, higher than other developed nations like the US, France, and Germany. Faster adoption of new payment methods: The UK launched the UK Faster Payment service in 2008, allowing UK citizens to receive mobile and online payments within minutes. Other developed countries like the US, meanwhile, are still debating how to implement a real-time system. Europe is the next big market for P2P lending: The alternative finance market in Europe reached nearly €3 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2014, a 144% jump, and small-business P2P loan volume in France grew almost 4,000% last year, to reach €8.2 million ($10.6 million). Although the industry is flourishing, there are serious risks that could derail it: Interest rate hikes, new regulations, frayed bank relationships, and other factors could put a stop to the industry's current surge. \nIn full, the report:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:03:59.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
