Supplied Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The man who could be chief of staff to the next prime minister of Australia is well-versed in the cut and thrust of Labor politics.\nBut the appointment of Cameron Milner – the former Queensland ALP state secretary turned lobbyist – to run Opposition Bill Shorten's office, has ruffled quite a few feathers in the ALP's powerful right wing faction in his home state.\nAlthough credited with delivering two landslides state election victories for former Labor premier Peter Beattie in 2001 and 2004, Mr Milner has had an ugly split from the Australian Workers Union faction in Queensland, including former treasurer Wayne Swan, after two recent failed attempts at entering parliament.\nMr Milner, a father of four, has been working as a lobbyist since he stepped down as state secretary in 2004. His firm, Next Level Strategic Services – co-owned by former conservative staffer David Moore – has a range of clients, including Visy and Indian energy giant Adani which has been trying to build its controversial $16.5 billion Carmichael mine in Central Queensland.\nBut Mr Milner had been eyeing a return to politics for several years, especially a move to Canberra.\nA late tilt for senate pre-selection against another former ALP state secretary, Anthony Chisholm – who successfully secured the position at the top of the party's senate ticket for next year's federal election – has lead to major falling out with union and party powerbrokers in Queensland.\nParty insiders said Mr Milner had not maintained a close relationship with key unions over the past decade which was why he was beaten by Mr Chisholm who had the clear support of the ALP right.\nMr Milner's move to attempt to oust long-serving ALP veteran Mr Swan – who is godfather to one of Mr Milner's children – from his Brisbane seat of Lilley has further soured relationships.\n Key figures in the ALP right in Queensland are not happy with Mr Milner's appointment, but will have to learn to live with it considering the power the former state secretary will soon yield as Mr Shorten's gatekeeper.\nOthers in the party are equally angry at Mr Swan – whom they describe as yesterday's man – saying the former treasurer should have stepped aside to let new talent through, like Mr Milner.\nBut parliament's loss is Mr Shorten's gain, according to Mr Beattie, who said Mr Milner's tactical skills as an election campaigner were unrivalled.\n\"He is very good, he is strategically very clever. He works hard and he's good on policy. He's got all the attributes and will be a great asset to Bill Shorten,\" Mr Beattie told The AFR Weekend.\n\"You have to remember Queensland is largely going to help determine who wins and he knows Queensland backwards. In 2001 it was the biggest number of seats Labor has even won and he was the campaign director.\"\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also praised Mr Milner, saying he could help Labor replicate its success in kicking conservative premier Campbell Newman out of office after only one term.\n\"He brings experience, as well as background in community, business and politics to the role,\" she said.\n\"Most importantly, he understands the impact that Tony Abbott's policies have had on Queensland.\"\nMr Milner did not return calls to AFR Weekend .\nDespite being out of political machine for the past decade, Mr Milner has stayed in touch, most importantly with his ALP colleagues in NSW and Victoria.\nMr Shorten said Mr Milner – who attended Scotch College in Melbourne - would be an effective replacement for Ken Macpherson who quit as chief of staff two months ago due to ill-health.\n\"Cameron is determined to help deliver a Shorten Labor government at the next election, which will be in less than 12 months,\" he said.\nMr Milner may end up having the last laugh as he may soon a similar power base as Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin. Although Mr Milner is expected to have a much lower profile than Ms Credlin had in the Abbott government's first two years in office.\nMr Beattie said there would be plenty of time for Mr Chisholm to have a crack at parliament down the track.\n\"But for the moment, this is a better use of talents because he has the organisational skills and his history. And he will work with everybody because he is a team player. The past is the past,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-11T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:43:41.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
