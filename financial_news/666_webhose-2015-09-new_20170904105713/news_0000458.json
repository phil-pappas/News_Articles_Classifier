Keep a close eye on tax planning too making full use of your allowances could take you out of the tax net altogether. \nBased on our postbag and inbox of questions from readers we have put together a typical scenario of a couple in their sixties who are about to retire. \nPension freedoms: 101 questions answered \n= ‘We want £36,000 a year’ = \nPeter and his wife Louisa, our hypothetical couple, are planning for his retirement. They would like an income of at least £1,500 a month or £18,000 a year to meet their basic needs, but would prefer £3,000 a month. \nPeter, a management consultant, earns £75,000 a year. He has been winding down his business and expects to retire next year at 65. His wife is 63 and has already retired. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has just started to receive her state pension of £5,200 a year and also receives a teacher’s pension of £4,100 a year. \nPeter expects his state pension to be £6,000 a year, as he was “contracted out” of the system for a while. He also has a private pension pot of £200,000. \nBoth Peter and Louisa have built up savings and investments outside their pensions, worth £232,000 and £220,000 respectively. Peter has a stocks and shares Isa worth £145,000 and a cash Isa worth £12,000. He has £7,000 in a Santander 123 current account and £5,000 in a Nationwide e‑saver account. He also owns various shares worth £60,000 and £3,000 of premium bonds. \nLouisa has £85,000 in a stocks and shares Isa and £45,000 in a cash Isa. She has £30,000 in her Santander 123 current account and £50,000 in her Nationwide e‑saver. In addition she has £10,000 worth of shares. \nThey are both happy to accept stock market risk and describe themselves as experienced investors. \nThe couple live mortgage-free in their £450,000 cottage in Northamptonshire. Both are in good health. Financial security is their primary goal, but they would also like to maximise the legacies for their three children and five grandchildren. \nHere, Danny Cox of Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , which provides financial advice, sets out a precise pension plan for how they could achieve their financial goals. \n= The pension plan = \nPeter and Louisa will have an annual guaranteed index-linked income of £15,300 from next year. This is made up of   (£6,000 plus £5,200) and Louisa’s £4,100 teacher’s pension. \nAll of this income will be tax free because it will fall within their personal allowances for income tax. \nThe couple need to secure only another £2,700 a year in guaranteed income to meet their basic needs (£18,000). \nWhen Peter retires, he should take his 25pc tax-free lump sum, which from a £200,000 pension pot will be worth £50,000. \nHe should then use some of the money left in his pension to buy an index-linked annuity, with a 50pc spouse’s pension if he dies first. This would pay him £2,700 a year and is likely to cost around £80,000. Louisa would receive £1,350 a year if Peter were to die first. \nThe remaining £70,000 should be put into a “flexible drawdown” plan, which would generate an additional income of £2,500 a year. The table above shows the funds that Mr Cox recommended for this plan. \n= Tax-free cash = \nAs neither of the pair has used their £15,240 Isa allowance for this year, Peter should invest £30,480 of his £50,000 tax-free cash split equally across their stocks and shares Isas. This would bring their combined investment Isa values to £260,480. \nThe £19,520 balance should be put into their savings accounts. \n= Stocks and shares = \nPeter and Louisa should invest their stocks and shares Isa portfolios predominantly in “equity income” funds professionally run portfolios invested in shares that pay good dividends for an income starting at £9,600 a year, a figure that should rise over the coming years. For a detailed breakdown of Mr Cox’s recommended funds, see the second pie chart above. \nPeter and Louisa’s share portfolio, held outside their Isas, should provide an additional income of around £1,500 a year. \n= Cash = \nThe couple have £171,520 in cash savings, of which £57,000 is already in Isas. They should use the remaining £114,520 to fund their Isa contributions in future years. \nIn the meantime, some of Louisa’s cash savings should be moved into Peter’s name from April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016 to maximise their use of the new £1,000 “personal savings allowance”. \nFrom the start of the next tax year, basic-rate taxpayers will be able to earn up to £1,000 interest from bank accounts tax-free, while higher-rate taxpayers will be able to earn up to £500. This allowance is in addition to tax-free returns on cash Isas. \n= Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) income = \nBy following this plan, Peter and Louisa will have a tax-free retirement income of £31,600 a year, or £2,633 a month, from April 2016. \nThis consists of £18,000 worth of guaranteed, index-linked income to cover their basic needs, with £2,500 of variable income from drawdown, which should be sustainable and should rise over time. An additional £11,100 a year of variable income is from their stocks and shares Isas and other shares. This too should be sustainable and should rise over time. \nTheir combined personal allowance, personal savings allowance and dividend allowance (£5,000 a year each), plus their use of Isas, will mean the couple should pay no income tax. \nThe total is a little short of Peter and Louisa’s ideal monthly income of £3,000, but they have plenty of cash savings to spend if they want to. \n“The foundations of this financial plan are to meet all their basic income needs with guaranteed, inflation-proof income,” Mr Cox said. \n“Regardless of what happens in the markets, to interest rates or to inflation, Peter and Louisa will always be able to pay their bills. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will be important for them to apportion their assets between them to maximise tax-free allowances and to continue to use their Isa allowance to minimise the tax they pay.” \nPlanning your retirement income \nThe pension freedoms that came into force in April have seen demand soar for financial advice about how to handle retirement savings. But sitting down with a financial adviser, and paying the associated fees, is just one way to devise a sensible plan. A number of online tools have been launched to allow savers to map out their own financial future, based on their assets and income requirements. \nWhen Richard and Naomi Collinson struggled to determine how long their money would last them in retirement, they developed their own software tool to help. \nThe site, RetireEasy.co.uk, is free of charge and allows you to input your assets and liabilities, as well as forecasts for variables such as inflation, average returns and house price growth. It then predicts how far your money will stretch. The aim is that you don’t spend too much in retirement, or curb your spending unnecessarily. Users can factor in specialist assets such as yachts, fine art and classic cars and can continually revise their plan as their circumstances and forecasts change. \nMany of the major pension providers and investment companies, including Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) , Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) and Fidelity, offer retirement income tools, as well as programs that will work out your estimated life expectancy to give you an idea of how long your money will need to last. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:12:54.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
