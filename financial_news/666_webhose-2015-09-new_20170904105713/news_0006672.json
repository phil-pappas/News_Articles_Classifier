Some are withdrawing their money from all fossil fuel companies, while others are beginning with firms involved in coal or tar sands. \nA papal pronouncement issued by Pope Francis in June demanding swift action to save the planet from environmental ruin has influenced religious institutions, experts say. \n\"The pace of fossil fuel divestment within faith communities worldwide, combined with the growing commitment to investing in clean energy, particularly for the world's poor, show that the world's spiritual and moral leaders grasp the urgency of the climate crisis and are ready to act,\" said Rev. Fletcher Harper, executive director of GreenFaith, a U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .-based interfaith coalition for the environment. (Reporting by Megan Rowling; editing by Emma Batha.
