Photo: AP\nThe Federal Reserve still intends to raise its benchmark interest rate this year, barring unpleasant surprises, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said Thursday.\nYellen, speaking a week after the Fed announced it was not ready to raise interest rates just yet, reiterated that the central bank was not planning to wait much longer. She said labor market conditions were improving and the Fed expected inflation to follow.\nBut she cautioned that if the Fed's expectations for growth were disappointed again, it might again delay lifting rates.\n\"Achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter,\" Yellen said in a speech. \"But if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\"\nAdvertisement The text of Yellen's speech echoed recent comments by other Fed officials who have sought to frame the outcome of the September meeting of the committee as a pause in the march toward higher rates, rather than a signal that the Fed's intentions had changed. She also played down the likelihood that slower growth in other countries would cause the Fed to delay raising rates.\n\"The committee is monitoring developments abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,\" she said.\nThe committee next meets Oct. 27-28, and then again Dec. 15-16.\nYellen's speech was largely devoted to explaining why the Fed expects inflation to rise back toward the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as most healthy. Since the recession, inflation has generally stayed under that pace, and prices have barely increased over the last year.\nWhile acknowledging that economists do not entirely understand the movements of inflation, Yellen said the Fed remained most confident in the longstanding view that inflation in the long term was determined by public expectations. Economic slack, changes in import prices and other events can affect it in the short term, but eventually inflation returns to trend.\nYellen said that model suggested inflation would soon begin to do that.\nYellen said there were risks to the Fed forecast that could push liftoff into next year. So far, however, she said the Fed's plans had not changed.\n\"To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation expectations remaining near their prerecession level,\" she said. \"Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. economy generally appear solid.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:20:09.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
