It was also blamed for helping fuel the asset bubble that crashed the country’s economy.\nInitially, Japanese outflows increased at a faster pace than inflows as investors snapped up offshore assets after the capital account was liberalized in 1980. That wave was reversed following the 1985 Plaza Accord when a gathering of international finance ministers agreed to weaken the greenback.\nThe dollar tumbled against the yen over the subsequent two years. That move drew money into Japan and inflated real estate and stocks into the bubble that eventually burst in 1989.\nLike Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, China is working to ease restrictions on money entering and exiting the country and has loosened its grip on the yuan.\n‘Question marks’ “The lesson is you have to be very, very careful,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia Economics Research at HSBC. “Japan did it from a position of strength whereas China is doing it at a time when local financial markets face challenges and there are question marks over its growth prospects. That’s the key difference.”\nOfficials in Beijing are already seeing that the process won’t be smooth as the Chinese economy expands at its slowest pace in 25 years. Meanwhile, global investors are growing wary of a stock market rout that erased $5 trillion from the nation’s stock markets.\nA sudden move by the People’s Bank of China on Aug. 11 intended to give the market a greater say in setting the yuan’s value triggered the unit’s biggest loss in two decades and prompted a flood of capital to leave the country.\nIt also highlighted China’s new potential as a source for global financial instability. Like Japan in the late 1970s, China is now the world’s second-biggest economy and accounts for more than 13 percent of global growth.\n‘Side effects’ “The experience of Japan then and China now show just how challenging it is to do financial liberalization without unintended negative side effects,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia -- excluding Japan -- at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.\nAuthorities in Beijing are campaigning for the renminbi to be included in the International Monetary Fund’s reserve basket as a key part of increasing the currency’s use around the world.\nThat has similarities to what happened in Japan decades ago. As Japan’s global economic influence rose, so too did the yen, from almost zero percent of global foreign exchange reserves in 1975 to 7 percent in 1989, according to analysis by DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Yen-denominated bonds and loans were sold offshore and foreign investors were allowed to access the stock market.\nThe push to internationalize the yen lost momentum after Japan’s economic slump. The yen’s share of reserves, after peaking at 9 percent in 1991, have fallen back to between 3 percent and 4 percent, according to analysis by DBS in Singapore.\n‘Asset bubble’ “One major reason why the pro­cess of yen internationalization­ lost momentum in the 1990s was the bursting of its asset bubble,” said Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS.\nIn some ways, the challenge for China today is bigger than it was for Japan decades ago. The scale and size of international capital flows is much greater and more volatile. Already, the volume of money leaving China is forcing the central bank to burn through reserve holdings to support its currency.\nIf authorities open up the capital account too soon, China runs the risk of losing control of its domestic financial system. Analysts say the government needs to first liberalize its domestic market and deepen its architecture of regulation and supervision before fully opening up to the outside world.\nOfficials also must clamp down on inefficient lending and cut loose zombie companies that depend on state support for survival.\n“Japan’s experience of ‘lost decades’ shows that delays in reforms dimmed growth prospects,” said Cui Li, deputy director of the International Finance Forum Institute, and a former economist at the IMF. “China should learn from such mistakes, allowing insolvent companies to exit and boosting overall productivity growth through reforms.”\nPotential growth Still, China remains at a much lower stage of development than Japan when it began to open up, so it has significant potential for growth. It’s also some way from allowing its currency to fully convert. Individuals are limited to moving $50,000 overseas annually and corporate investments need government approval.\nIn the past year, though, overseas investors have been given more access to Chinese stocks through a trading link with Hong Kong.\nThe People’s Bank of China has plans to sell yuan-denominated debt in London, marking its first issuance overseas. Other moves are under way. One example: the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which will partly use the yuan to fund development loans overseas.\n“There is prestige associated with having your currency as an international currency,” said Shang Jin Wei, chief economist at the Asian Development Bank in Manila. “But there is also a cost; if the internationalization of a currency comes with financial instability, it is probably not worth it.”", "external_links": ["http://www.ifforum.org/en/\\"], "published": "2015-09-30T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:14:43.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
