Rents dropped 14 percent in Gisborne in the past year. Median asking rents in Wellington eased in August to $380 per week, down from a peak in January of $440 per week, unchanged from the same time last year. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T05:18:11.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
