He picks up one of the dainty treats—a “bald cupcake” in his lexicon—pops it into his mouth and lets out a long “mmmm.” Still, he scoffs at its size, saying it’s so small it’s really only a “muffin vitamin.” Food often comes up in his acts (in one popular routine, he confesses his love of McDonald’s ), and he clearly enjoys the subject.\nMr. Gaffigan, 49, has become popular for his riffs on hot pockets , avocado toast and “kale propaganda” in specials such as “Jim Gaffigan: Obsessed” and “Jim Gaffigan: Beyond the Pale.” He’s starring in “The Jim Gaffigan Show,” a comedy that made its debut in July and that he co-writes with his wife, Jeannie. (Its network, TV Land, just agreed to pick up a second season of the series.)\nThe show is a fictionalized version of Mr. Gaffigan’s own life, raising five children in a small New York apartment, and comes off as a cross between “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Seinfeld.” He includes some of his own foibles, such as overeating, and ventures into topics like fatherhood, friendship and religion.\nMr. Gaffigan and his family—his children range in age from 2 to 11—are Catholic, and he will be performing in front of Pope Francis during his visit to Philadelphia. Mr. Gaffigan is always careful when he makes jokes about religion. “The weird thing about religion jokes is in the end no one really wants to hear them,” he says. But they can work “if you can do a joke where the atheist and the evangelical think it’s funny.”\nMr. Gaffigan has become known for the lack of profanity in his routines —a rarity in the world of comedy. That forces him to be more creative, which has its benefits. “I’m so [expletive] angry,” he says, isn’t as expressive as, “I’m so angry I could strangle a puppy.”\nMr. Gaffigan grew up in Chesterton, Ind., with five siblings. His father was a banker and his mother a homemaker. When he was younger, he says, “I was the class clown.” Yet he didn’t decide that he wanted to be a comedian until much later. “When I was in eighth grade, I wanted to be a farmer,” he says. “I had a garden.”\nMr. Gaffigan graduated from Georgetown University in 1988 with a degree in finance. His first job was in advertising in New York—a role that required him to do some public speaking. To practice, he took improv classes, which piqued his interest in stand-up. Within a few years, he had quit his job and was trying to make a living as a comedian, performing in local bars and eventually getting a slot on his longtime idol David Letterman’s show.\nSoon after, he made appearances on Comedy Central and recorded his first special, “Beyond the Pale,” in 2005. Since then, he has filmed three other stand-up shows and has had small acting roles. Mr. Gaffigan has also written two humor books, “Dad Is Fat” (2013), a title inspired by his son’s first written sentence, and “Food: A Love Story” (2014).\nHe has seen his business change over the past 20 years. “I think comedians used to be the real edge of society, like people [who] should be in therapy,” he says. “Now it’s far more college-educated.” He used to be considered the “suburban college guy,” but now he sees a lot more comedians who fit that description.\nComedy has become more accepted as an art form today, he believes, in part because it’s more accessible. “You can be really well educated in stand-up comedians by the age of 11,” he says. Kids “can just go to YouTube. But when I was that age, you’d have to buy an album, and you couldn’t even go to the library and find it.”\nSocial media has also extended comedy’s reach. Mr. Gaffigan has nearly 2.5 million followers on Twitter , where he often ridicules contemporary culture: “I’ve been busy. What are we unnecessarily outraged about now?”\nWhen we met, Mr. Gaffigan had just returned from one leg of a national tour , and his family had been with him on the bus. His last stop was Alaska, where he took his 9-year-old son hiking for a few days. It wasn’t out of his own love for the outdoors. “I would never go outside if I didn’t have kids,” he says. It’s similar to his attitude to healthy food around his children. “Now it’s time to pretend to like vegetables!”\nMr. Gaffigan still felt like “a bit of a zombie” from his time on the road. On his first day back in New York, he and his wife took their children to Central Park. “We were ‘obtaining summer,’” he says, making fun of his wife, who wanted to take advantage of the end of the season. But he wouldn’t be home for long, with Oklahoma as his next stop.\nWhen touring, he has made it his ritual to go to a steakhouse after the show with the comedian who opens for him. Going straight back to his hotel room right after a performance, he says, is “anticlimactic.”\nWhen he wants to find good restaurants in a new city, he’ll ask whoever picks him up from the airport a question: If they had been out of town for six years and were to come back, starving, for only an hour, where would they eat? “There are going to be people who are like, ‘Bennigan’s!’” he says, but usually he gets a good answer. On a recent visit to Newark, N.J., someone recommended a place that specializes in deep-fried hot dogs.\nHe is now at work writing the second season of his show and preparing his material for the Sept. 26 Festival of Families, which Pope Francis will attend. Along with performers like the Philadelphia Orchestra and Andrea Bocelli, Mr. Gaffigan will be on for about 20 minutes, and he admits that he’s a little intimidated. For one, he worries that he doesn’t know enough about his religion’s history. “I’m mumbling through some of the prayers at church because I don’t know them,” he says.\nMr. Gaffigan has mentioned the pope in his jokes in the past, with lines like, “Being the pope must be a tough job, because the last one quit.” This time it’s different, of course: “How do you tell pope jokes in front of the pope?”\nHis plan is to embrace his fear in his routine. “I think I am just going to be like: What am I doing here? Why me? You can’t go wrong with humility, right?” he asks. “You can’t be like, ‘He was humble—I didn’t like him.’”\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JimGaffigan", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YDTfEhChgw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-i9GXbptog"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:40:28.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
