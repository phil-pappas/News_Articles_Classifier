The withdrawal, the most since August 2014, followed three days in which they added $7.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nSticking with anything is proving impossible when daily swings are averaging more than 1 percent and stocks just capped their first 10 percent correction since 2011. During the three days of withdrawals from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the index traded as low as 1,911.21 and 1,975.01, a 3.3 percent range.\nThe S&P 500 lost 3.4 percent last week, the second-biggest retreat since December behind the 5.8 percent plunge it suffered in the five days through Aug. 21. A 2.5 percent advance on Tuesday following a long weekend wasn’t enough to stem the flow of money out of the ETF.\nThe fluctuations have sent volatility skyward.
