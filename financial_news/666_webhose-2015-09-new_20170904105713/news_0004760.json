Didi also said it has invested $100 million in Lyft.\nEach service will collect payment from its own users in their native currency, so passengers can avoid the hassle of paying for rides in foreign money. For example, Chinese visitors to the U.S. can open their Didi app to order and pay for rides on Lyft, after which Didi will remit that money to Lyft.\nThe companies announced the partnership at an event Wednesday in New York, where Lyft President John Zimmer and Didi President Jean Liu discussed their alliance with the media. In a sign of the startups’ growing base of support, the gathering was attended by well-known investors including activist billionaire Carl Icahn and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -1.49 % ’s chairman of U.S. investments, Michael Zeisser.\nLyft and Didi are also in discussions with two other big car-hailing services, India’s Ola and Singapore’s GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd., to expand the alliance, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAt the Wednesday event, Ms. Liu said the Lyft and Didi apps won’t be compatible with each other until next year. The companies are considering including a feature that would allow American users of Lyft to request an English-speaking driver while visiting China.\nMr. Zimmer said the partnership came about after he approached one of Didi’s investors for advice on expanding in China. Instead of navigating the country’s regulatory hurdles and cultural differences on its own, the investor recommended that he team up with Didi.\nThe deal could help drive more international users to Lyft when they visit the U.S., given the convenience of being able to rely on the same app they use at home. Many users in Asia pay via other methods than credit cards, and those with credit cards may have concerns about fees for overseas charges.\nJoining with the Asian ride-sharing players could be a first step toward a broader international expansion for Lyft. Though the company said in March it would expand to its first city outside the U.S. by year-end, it has yet to announce specific plans for international expansion.\nThe deal is the first concerted effort to battle Uber across continents after four years of the ride-hailing leader expanding aggressively outside the U.S. Uber is now available in 60 countries, has honed a playbook for expanding to new markets and built a global brand name that has in many places given it an advantage over homegrown rivals.\nUber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick also has proved to be a prolific fundraiser, raising over $8 billion in equity and debt financing, more than any other private venture-backed firm.\nRelated\nBlaBlaCar Valued at $1.5 Billion Uber vs. City Hall, Round Two Uber faces its greatest competition in Asia. Dense urban populations and widespread smartphone adoption have made Asia particularly fertile ground for ride-hailing startups. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.88 % and investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC have led a clutch of investors pouring billions of dollars into local Asian ride-hailing companies. That funding has allowed local startups to offer subsidies to drivers and riders. As a result, they have grown quickly and built a big market share.\nChina’s Didi Kuaidi, formed earlier this year by the merger of two local rivals, shares many of the same investors as India’s Ola and GrabTaxi, the top Southeast Asia competitor to Uber. A cooling of stock markets in Asia has done little to slow their fundraising efforts. Didi Kuaidi closed a $3 billion funding round last week, the largest ever for a venture-backed startup in a single placement. Didi Kuaidi was valued at $16 billion including the fresh capital, according to people familiar with the round. India’s Ola recently raised almost $226 million in its latest funding round, giving it a valuation of $5 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nDidi Kuaidi and its two biggest backers, Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -2.26 % , invested in Lyft’s most recent round of funding in May, along with Mr. Icahn and Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. 4755 2.88 % As a result of that deal, Lyft began discussing ways to work with its Chinese investors to compete strategically against Uber, including sharing product plans, one of the people said. In August, Didi Kuaidi also invested in GrabTaxi.\nWhile Lyft looks to forge deals with its Asian peers, it isn’t clear if it is trying to do the same in Europe. There, the competition for Uber is more fractured between markets. Uber faces the some of the strongest challenges in the U.K. and France, where there are several active competitors. The U.K.’s Hailo and Israel’s Gett are both popular in London, while in France, the firm battles with ChauffeurPrivé, SnapCar and other apps.\nBut the marketplace is also less hospitable in many European countries to these car-hailing apps. Pushed by taxi drivers who have at times mounted violent strikes, regulators have cracked down against Uber, in particular in Germany, Spain and France. Criminal charges are pending against two of Uber’s top executives in Paris for violations of transportation and data-protection laws, with a trial date set for the end of the month.\nUber wasn’t a focus in Didi and Lyft’s hourlong news conference. A spokeswoman for Uber didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWrite to Douglas MacMillan at douglas.macmillan@wsj.com and Rick Carew at rick.carew@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T18:39:40.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
