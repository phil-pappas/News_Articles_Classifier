This matter cannot continue to disrupt the education of our children. Hard decisions must be made to bring it to an end, once and for all,\" the statement sent to newsrooms after the Cabinet meeting said. \nTraditionally, Cabinet meetings take place on Thursday unless there is an urgent matter to be considered. \nState House's Senior Director of Public Communications Munyori Buku, however, said the claims that the Cabinet has not met in a long while was \"a classic case of deep sea fishing.\" \n\"The person saying so is most likely fictitious and does not sit in Cabinet,\" he said. \nThis also comes at a time the government has been operating without a substantive Secretary to the Cabinet after the National Assembly rejected President Uhuru Kenyatta's nomination of Internal Security Principal Secretary Dr Monica Juma. \nDr Juma had been nominated to take over from Francis Kimemia who was fired while serving his suspension from the government over corruption allegations. \nIn the absence of a substantive Secretary to the Cabinet, President Kenyatta's Chief of Staff Joseph Kinyua with the help of a Principal Administrative Secretary in the cabinet office has been overseeing the functions of the office. \nThe Secretary to the Cabinet arranges the business and keeps the minutes of Cabinet as well as conveying the decisions of the Cabinet to the appropriate persons or authorities. \nPresident Kenyatta suspended five cabinet secretaries and a host of Principal Secretaries, including Deputy President William Ruto's Chief of Staff Maryanne Kittany and chief executives of State corporations over corruption allegations. \nThe CSs who have been on suspension since March are Charity Ngilu (land), Michael Kamau (transport and infrastructure), Felix Koskei (agriculture), Kazungu Kambi (labour) and Davis Chirchir (energy). \nWith the suspesion of the five cabinet secretaries, the government had been running with only 13 CSs, one short of the constitutionally provided for 14, and the Attorney-General Githu Muigai. \nThis was until Eugene Wamalwa was appointed the Cabinet Secretary for water and irrigation in July. \nHowever, even with 14 cabinet secretaries, it is rare to get all of them in the country.
