THE MONEY WILL BE FURTHER SPENT ON ACTIONS TO IMPROVE CIVIC AND VOTER EDUCATION, STRENGTHEN THE ELECTORAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND TO ENGENDER SUCCESSFUL CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS. \nUnder the arrangement, the EU will contribute 10 million Euro (approximately USD$11.4 million) and the UNDP USD$1M to support the Liberia Electoral Cycle for 2015 to 2017. \nAt the signg of the agreement, the Minister of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) Mr. Amara Mohammed Konneh signed on behalf of the GoL, the the Resident Representative of the UNDP, Antonio Vigilante singed on behalf of UNDP and Madam Tina Inttelma, Head of the EU Delegation in Liberia, signed for her organization. \nSpeaking at the occasion, Minister Konneh said the ceremony is crucial because it seals the joint commitment of the Liberian Government, the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to strengthen the electoral institutions, stakeholders and processes to ensure the credibility of future electoral cycles. \nAccording to him, this is more important now than ever, as Liberia aims to sustain the good record of peace and democracy that has been built together over the last decade. \n\"The investment of EUR 10 769 000 that we will make in good governance and rule of law, in fulfilment of this agreement, will result in the efficient and transparent conduct of elections, especially in 2017, leading to a smooth transition for the new Liberian Government and the people,\" said Minister Konneh. \nThe Finance and Development Planning called on other Liberia's development partners to rally around the country with resources and expertise that would position the National Elections Commission (NEC) to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections. \n\"I also want to use this occasion to emphasize again the importance of supporting our security institutions to maintain the security of the state and our fragile peace that is gradually gaining strength and the trust of our people. Democracy is soft but very expensive! The 2017 elections will be the first time that we see one living President constitutionally turning over to another living president since 1944, when President Barclay turned over to President Tubman,\" he said. \n\"So, in a special way, the 2017 elections are very special in Liberian history. By conducting it peacefully and transparently, all of us will be sending a message to the world that never again will we submit to unconstitutional governance. The GoL must now show the will to support this transition,\" he added. \nAlso speaking, Mr. Vigilante of the UNDP noted that the Election Support Project would help to strengthen the credibility and capacity of NEC to ensure free, fair and democratic elections. \n\"Election is the foundation of democracy and democracy is the foundation for peace\", he stated.

Intelmann, in remarks, stated that the EU is well known for, and is a strong supporter of democratisation in the world. \nShe explained that one of the essential elements of the partnership between Liberia and the EU is the promotion of democratic principles, together with the respect of human rights and the rule of law. \n\"Concretely promotion of democratic principles is discussed in the regular political dialogue between Liberia and the EU and it is also part of the agreed support of the EU development cooperation in Liberia,\" she stressed. \n\"The EU also conducts electoral observation of national electoral processes in agreement with the countries' institutions, is a financial supporter of ECOWAS and the African Union in their mandate to support and observe national electoral processes. \nAmbassador Intelmann expressed her wishes of a successful project that can help the NEC, the Judiciary, security forces, political parties and civil society in the conduction of free, fair and peaceful electoral processes in the coming years,\" the EU Head stated. \nFor her part, the Co-chair of the Board of Commissioners of NEC, Madam Sarah Toe, said the commission appreciates the support it gets its development partners. \nShe said these kinds of support would in turn help to make the Liberian elections processes very successful as it has been in the past. \nMeanwhile, the signing ceremony graced by Liberian government officials and other stakeholders.
