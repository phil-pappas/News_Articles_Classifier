(MarketWatch) — Volkswagen’s very survival may now be on the line.\nThat’s because the huge legal fines the automobile giant faces because of its emissions cheating scandal could be just the tip of the iceberg. One academic study of the average company involved in fraud, for example, found that the financial punishment imposed by the market was 7.5 times greater than its legal penalties.\nVolkswagen’s VLKAY, -14.95% VOW, -14.80% market cap prior to this weekend’s revelations was $88 billion, and the potential fines it faces under the federal Clean Air Act are reported to be in excess of $18 billion.\nVolkswagen in crisis after EPA accusations (3:15) Volkswagen is halting American sales of popular diesel-powered cars and issued an apology for violating consumers' trust.

The key, according to Gerald Martin, a finance professor at American University and one of the study's co-authors, will be the extent to which Volkswagen’s internal culture was to blame for creating the cheating software in the first place and then allowing it to be used over several different model years.\nIf only a few people were involved in the malfeasance, Martin told me, then the hit the company’s stock will take because of the scandal is likely to be temporary. But if it turns out that the sickness in the company’s internal culture is more widespread, then the financial costs could be huge.\nFor example, Martin predicted that the “K Street lawyers” that other auto companies employ in Washington, D.C. will be unable to resist the temptation to urge lawmakers to aggressively investigate Volkswagen. Said Martin: “Has the company bribed foreign officials, for example, or violated other provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act? Has it been cooking their books?”\nIt’s too early to know for sure, of course. But there’s certainly reason for concern, according to ratings maintained by MSCI ESG Research . Even before Volkswagen’s scandal broke over the weekend, the firm’s “Accounting and Governance Risk” was rated to be higher than 80% of companies in Western Europe. \nVolkswagen also scored low on MSCI ESG Research’s “GovernanceMetrics” ranking — which, according to MSCI, “looks beyond governance structures to evaluate regional context, interaction between metrics, and patterns of corporate behavior.” Even before Volkswagen’s recent scandal, it received a ranking of 4.6 out of 10 compared to sector peers, which put the company in the 28th percentile — worse, in other words, than 72% of comparable companies in its sector.\nEven if the company is able to survive in its current incarnation, it’s a good bet that its stock will lag the market in coming years. The last time I referred to the study by Professor Martin and his co-authors was in April 2012 , in the wake of Wal-Mart Stores’ WMT, -0.16% scandal involving bribery in its Mexican operations. Since then, Wal-Mart’s stock has lagged the S&P 500’s SPX, -1.32% annualized return by a margin of 5.7% to 11.0%.\nOne way to exploit Volkswagen’s market-lagging potential would be to create a hedge that simultaneously invests in the S&P 500 (though ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, -1.37% ) and sells short an equal dollar amount of Volkswagen stock. Regardless of whether the broad market goes up or down, this hedge will turn a profit so long as Volkswagen stock underperforms the S&P 500.\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes. \nMore on the Volkswagen scandal: VW says 11 million cars affected globally, will take $6.6 billion charge Volkswagen shares plunge 20% for second day EU regulator to discuss VW with national bodies Volkswagen emissions probe expands to Asia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:37:23.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
