That shook already jittery stock investors. \n\"If they move in September, it's going to cast a lot of doubt about where they will stop,\" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 114.98 points, or 0.69 percent, to 16,528.03, the S&P 500 lost 16.69 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,972.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.82 points, or 1.07 percent, to 4,776.51. \nThe Dow, down 6.6 percent for August, registered its worst monthly percentage decline since May 2010. The Nasdaq, off 6.9 percent for August, and the S&P 500, down 6.3 percent, both posted their worst months since May 2012. \nMSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's all-country stock index lost 0.7 percent and was down 7 percent for the month, also the worst monthly drop since May 2012. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index closed down 0.2 percent and registered a monthly loss of 9 percent - its worst monthly performance since August 2011. \nThe dollar eased against the safe-haven yen and the low-yielding euro as investors sold equities and pared bets against currencies popularly used to fund risky carry trades. \nBut Fischer's comments limited the dollar's losses. The dollar shed 0.4 percent to 121.19 yen, while the euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.1236. \nOIL JUMPS \nU.S. crude oil prices have risen more than $10 a barrel in three days, erasing the month's declines. \nU.S. crude jumped $3.98, or 8.8 percent, to settle at $49.20 a barrel, taking three-day gains to 27.5 percent, the most over three days since August 1990. In dollar terms, it was the biggest three-day gain since February 2011. \nBrent October crude climbed 8.2 percent to settle at $54.15 a barrel. \nIn the U.S. bond market, longer-dated U.S. Treasuries prices fell after lower U.S. oil production and OPEC's readiness to talk with other producers heightened inflation fears. Fischer's comments hurt shorter-dated prices. \nU.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were last down 31/32 in price to yield 2.96 percent, up from a yield of 2.91 percent late Friday. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 8/32 to yield 2.21 percent, from 2.18 percent late Friday. Yields move inversely to prices. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) steadied, with spot gold up 0.04 percent at $1,134 an ounce.
