Tony McDonough Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Malcolm Turnbull's fledgling leadership is off to a solid start with a comfortable win to the federal government in the Canning byelection.\nWith over 60 per cent of the vote counted on Saturday night in the Western Australian seat, Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie was leading Labor's Matt Keogh by 56 per cent to 44 per cent after preferences had been distributed.\nThis represented swing towards Labor of more than 6 percentage points which is less than the 10-point swing the polls were predicting as late as Monday, the day Tony Abbott was removed in a lightning coup. However, if a 6-point swing were replicated nationally on election day, the Coalition would still lose office.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten will also be content with the swing. He was at pains before the byelection to point out that the average swing in a byelection caused by the death of a sitting member was 2.4 per cent.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was given a warm welcome in Sydney's Paddington on Saturday. Christopher Pearce The byelection was caused by the death of Liberal MP Don Randall. Mr Randall had held the seat by a margin of 12 per cent.\nThe primary swing towards Labor was more than 9 per cent which came at largely the expense of the Liberals and the Palmer United Party, and to a lesser extend the Greens.\nMr Turnbull rang Mr Hastie on Saturday to wish him well. The Prime Minister spent the day in Sydney finalising his new ministry which will be announced Sunday. Scott Morrison will replace Joe Hockey as Treasurer while junior ministers and Turnbull supporters Mitch Fifield, Michaelia Cash and Marise Payne are all expected to be promoted to the Cabinet.\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a West Australian who voted for Mr Abbott in the leadership ballot, said the leadership change may not be the reason for the better-than-expected swing.\n Tony and Margie Abbott pack their cars before leaving Kirribilli House on September 18. Janie Barrett \"We will never know what the result would be if there wasn't a change\".\nHe said the local party and Mr Hastie ran a strong campaign.\nThanks for Abbott and Turnbull Before the polls closed, Mr Hastie said the tumult this week in Canberra had not hurt his campaign. Mr Keogh said it had \"made people sit up and think 'what on Earth is going on over there in Canberra?'.\"\nIn claiming victory, Mr Hastie said he had big shoes to fill as he paid tribute to Mr Randall. He thanked Mr Abbott for his support and acknowledged his service as prime minister. He also thanked Mr Turnbull for the \"great support\" he had shown, both as a minister and Prime Minister.\n\"I look forward to working with him to deliver for the people of Canning,\" he said.\nHe said the campaign as about local issues, such as the drug Ice, not what had happened in Canberra.\nIn his concession speech, Mr Keogh said the swing was a great achievement.\n\"People want to see a Labor Party out there arguing for Australian jobs,\" he said.\nDeputy Leader Julie Bishop, a West Australian who backed Mr Turnbull, said she had rung Mr Turnbull who extended his congratulations to Mr Hastie.\nIt will be some time before the final result is known given about 10 per cent of the seat's 113,000 voters cast their ballot before election day using pre-poll and postal votes.These are likely to not favour the government given Mr Abbott was prime minister when they were cast.\nABC analyst Antony Green called the election with 16 per cent of the vote counted.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-19T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T22:48:32.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
