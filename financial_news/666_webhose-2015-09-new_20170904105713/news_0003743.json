These offerings are designed to securely work with an ad seller’s unique and proprietary first-party data to offer a more robust audience monetization solution. \nRocket Fuel formerly served its community of more than 100 publishers and ad networks through its Audience Accelerator sub-brand. Ad sellers can now access a broader range of products and services through the Rocket Fuel platform to activate and monetize their first-party data. Rocket Fuel has appointed John Ferraro as vice president of publisher partnerships to lead the business unit. \n“Ad sellers are an important business unit for Rocket Fuel and we are pleased to offer additional products and services designed to help them activate and monetize their first-party data,” said John Ferraro, vice president of publisher partnerships at Rocket Fuel. “As an early Rocket Fuel client, I’ve long maintained that the technology underpinning Rocket Fuel’s offerings is in a category of its own; as a leader of the publisher team, I continue to be impressed by the company’s commitment to the ad seller community and the training and support infrastructure in place to make our clients successful.” \n“These expanded Rocket Fuel offerings are a great addition to our NCM Cinema Accelerator product, which allows advertisers to reach moviegoers as they extend their movie-going experience with social, display, mobile and video,” said Ian Owen-Ward, Senior Vice President of Digital with National CineMedia (NCM). “With several successful campaigns by major brands completed and more underway, Rocket Fuel’s augmented resources – including a robust self-service audience extension program available within the DSP for our regional sales efforts and a terrific detailed training program to help make our team even more successful – have been a significant benefit to accomplishing everything we set out to achieve.” \nIn addition to the self-service DSP and DMP, ad sellers can also leverage a private marketplace offering introduced earlier this year to get better performance from their premium owned and operated inventory, as well as leverage its longstanding audience extension programs currently available to clients in the US and Europe. In conjunction with the expanded offerings, Rocket Fuel is also introducing a comprehensive sales training program and new go-to-market planning tools which enable our partners’ sales teams to hit the ground running in bringing consultative value to their advertisers and generating maximum sales revenue. \nJohn Ferraro Leads Publisher Partnership Team \nJohn Ferraro is a proven sales leader with over 20 years of experience in the media industry spanning digital, radio and television. As Vice President, Publisher Partnerships at Rocket Fuel he leads the publisher team focusing on platforms and services that enable ad sellers, including publishers and networks, to activate and monetize their first-party data. \nBefore joining Rocket Fuel, John spent over six years as VP, Advertising Sales at Whitepages, where he championed the expansion of programmatic services for advertisers.
