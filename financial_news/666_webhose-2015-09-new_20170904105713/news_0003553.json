About 10% of its USA egg supply has been cage-free since 2011.\nThe company’s MCD, +2.03% egg purchases may soon increase, following a decision this month to offer breakfast items all day at its more than 14,300 U.S. restaurants. The company is offering a limited number of core items, including sausage burritos, hot cakes and, depending on the region, Egg McMuffins.\nThe move also follows decisions by McDonald’s earlier this year to source only antibiotic-free chicken by 2017 and to serve hormone-free milk.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-to-source-cage-free-eggs-in-u-s-canada-1441798121/?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:01:35.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
