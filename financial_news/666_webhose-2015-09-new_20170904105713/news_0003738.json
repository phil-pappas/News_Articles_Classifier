He added that the company's margins could be vulnerable to foreign exchange movements, as Card Factory sources many of its products in Asia. \nStill, Mr Hayes said the retailer's vertically integrated business model put it in a strong position to withstand these forthcoming cost pressures. He added that the group was tackling these \"margin headwinds\" by looking at ways to take costs out of the business. \nCard Factory, which sells greeting cards for as little as 29p, is, quite literally, a card factory, designing and printing most of the products in-house. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) therefore enjoys higher than average profit margins, which remained flat year-on-year at 20.1pc. \nThat was despite making improvements to the quality of many of its greeting cards while introducing fresh product ranges. Meanwhile, a new website underpinned by more effective technology has resulted in a \"step change\" in revenues, according to management. \nElsewhere in the group Getting Personal, Card Factory's online personalised gift and card store, enjoyed a 25pc jump in sales to £6.9m and an 8pc increase in profits as margins widened. However, management has warned that the business faces tougher comparatives in the second-half. \nPrivate equity group Charterhouse, which bought the business for £350m in 2010, listed the greeting cards retailer on the stock market last year, valuing it at £766m. \nIn June, Card Factory's senior management made almost £50m from selling shares in the retailer. \nMr Hayes collected £9.6m, while Darren Bryant, the finance director, received £4.7m. The rest was shared between nine other senior managers, sending the share price down 8pc on the day it was announced. \nTo allow for the special dividend payment, the company has refinanced its existing £200m debt facility, which also gives it an extra £100m wiggle room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:11:07.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
