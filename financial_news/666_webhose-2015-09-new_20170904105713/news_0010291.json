Whichever story you want to tell about the economy, you can generally find a number to suit.\nFancy a headline about the lowest economic growth since the 1961 recession, worse even than the 1990-91 shocker? It's yours – nominal GDP from the June quarter 2014 to June quarter 2015 grew 1.8 per cent.\nProductivity is hard to measure, with any one year's data best taken with salt.\nIf that looks a little uncomfortably low, you can move up a step by quoting the seasonally adjusted chain volume GDP growth of 2 per cent – what most people do. On this basis though, the June quarter was up just 0.2 per cent on the March quarter. Ouch. And that's the figure the Australian uses as the headline for today's media release.\nWhile the productivity indicator is dodgy, the vital missing figure is a count of non-mining investment. Photo: Reuters\n(If you wanted to paint the darkest possible picture – if, say, you were part of a media jihad against the government and wanted to highlight the economy's slide – you'd annualise that 0.2 per cent for a miserable 0.8 per cent. But that would be dishonest and the sort of behaviour best left to politicians.)\nAdvertisement Further improvement can be achieved by going with the trend version of the above figure, which delivers 0.5 per cent growth for the quarter and 2.2 per cent for the year as it smooths out some of the one-off factors on the high side on the low side for the latest period. It's the first figure Quote: d on the ABS national accounts summary page.\nBut you can do better again. In the finer print of the release is annual real chain GDP growth of 2.4 per cent. This, rather confusingly, is the four quarters' growth over the previous year's four quarters, or a through-the-year average number. It's also what Treasury uses for its headline budget guess – which back in May was 2.5 per cent for the 2014-15.\nGiven how hard it is to forecast such things, that was actually a pretty good effort. Or lucky. Or both.\nIt's the number Joe Hockey should be running with in the face of the alternatives, but he preferred to highlight the seasonally adjusted figure three months ago when the March quarter surprised on the high side, so he should only be talking about that low 0.2 per cent figure now – if he was consistent.\nWhich still leaves everyone wondering what the national accounts actually tell us about what the economy is doing now.\nFor mine, the best sense of it comes through the trend number. The cooler heads at the Reserve Bank didn't buy the high March quarter number at the time, warning there were one-offs that wouldn't be repeated in June. Similarly, the fall in exports this quarter should show some bounce when we have the September figures.\nThe trend count fits in with the story the RBA was telling last month in its quarterly statement on monetary policy, which, by-the-way, had the seasonally adjusted 2 per cent figure exactly right.\nThe RBA's story is that we're facing more of the same for the next year or so – growth in the low-to-mid 2s, a bit lower than Joe Hockey has been promising. And on that basis, it's hard to see Australia getting back to what used to be considered good trend growth in time for the 2016 election, which is what Hockey forecast in May.\nAs to what matters most to break out of this range, some of the suggested figures in the national accounts don't match with the reality of the Australian workplace while another key number simply isn't there.\nWhere the figures don't reflect the real world is the implied modest improvement in labour productivity as glimpsed in a thing called \"gross value added per hour worked market sector\". It shows annual growth of only 0.9 per cent – about what we were doing in the lazy early years of the resources boom when the money was rolling in without much effort and the numbers were distorted by the investments being made in mines.\nFor the first four years of this decade our labour productivity growth has actually been pretty good at 2.1 per cent, or 1.7 per cent excluding the resources sector.\nWhich is why the suggested plunge doesn't make sense as the message from workplaces around the nation is that the drive for greater productivity is close to universal. The resources sector itself is has skyrocketing productivity growth as those expensive new mines come on stream with the latest equipment and produce much more with fewer miners.\nAs RBA types like to remind us though, productivity is hard to measure, with any one year's data best taken with salt.\nWhile the productivity indicator is dodgy, the vital missing figure is a count of non-mining investment. That doesn't turn up until October 30.\nThe budget promised non-mining private investment growth of 2 per cent for 2014-15 rising to 4 per cent this financial year and a whopping 7.5 per cent next financial year. From what can be divined from the national accounts, that 2 per cent figure didn't happen and the 4 per cent isn't looking likely.\nAs previously suggested, there are some encouraging but non-concrete signs of the animal spirits stirring , especially in the export sector as the impact of a weaker currency is felt.\nWhile we're waiting (and hoping) for them to fire up, it would be nice if there was a dependable, non-politicised flow of government infrastructure investment to help underpin the economy along with dwelling construction and household consumption growth (which is coming from reducing savings).\nUnfortunately, there's not. The June quarter national accounts record a surge in government investment, but it's another of those one-off figures that need smoothing. Over the financial year, it was flat. And it looks like staying that way.\nPick a figure, any figure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:50:04.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
