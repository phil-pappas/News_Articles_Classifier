Dominique Cherry by Paul Best On his own in Buenos Aires, a then 20-something Erez Gordon headed out to eat, a copy of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano under his arm for company, picking a parilla restaurant seating 180. Little did the restaurateur realise he'd not only have a table to himself, he'd have the entire restaurant.\n\"When I walked in at 7.30 for dinner … the formally dressed waiters looked at me strangely but didn't baulk at me ordering a mixed grill and Argentinian red,\" the Restaurant Revolution judge recalls, admitting he'd chosen an uncustomary early hour to dine. When he passed later, the joint was packed and pulsating.\nLuckily Gordon has never shied away from dining alone, happily taking just himself off to places.\n\"My [Argentinian] dining experience could not have been more solo. Or more enjoyable.\"\nGordon is not alone, either. Solo dining has become increasingly fashionable. New figures from online reservation site Dimmi show solo bookings catapulted 59 per cent on the previous 12 months and, the year before, were up 83 per cent. And that does not count walk ins.\nDining on your Jack Jones affords solitude, a chance to people-watch, bury yourself in a book or, these days, a Kindle. In fact, electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are driving its popularity, says Dimmi founder Stevan Premutico, keeping younger solo diners especially engaged on social networks or business folk with work. At the same time, attitudes have changed – there's less stigma, less fear of being judged a social pariah, a Scot No Friends or Billy No Mates. There's even a restaurant in Amsterdam, Eenmaal, catering solely for solos.\nMany clients Here, it's not only bistros and cafes, but increasingly hatted restaurants where the cultural appreciation of food and wine is arguably savoured better alone than in a group. Sydney's Sepia, for example, has many who dine alone regularly and one every week since the restaurant opened six years ago.\n \"Dining as a leisure pursuit has taken hold,\" explains Gordon, who's noticed a spike in singles at his own Sydney establishment Bishop Sessa.\nMelbourne restaurateur David Mackintosh, too, has noticed an upswing in corporate diners at his Pei Modern, fifth on Dimmi's Victorian list, whether coming from nearby hotels or office towers. \"Across the board, people are more interested in food and wine … [and] that's building in the corporate community,\" says Mackintosh, who, when travelling, enjoys dining alone \"in the vibe of the place\".\nSimilarly, chef/co-owner of Sydney's Sixpenny, Dan Puskas, cherishes the chance. In Paris recently with his family, Puskas ate by himself at Alain Passard's three-Michelin star L'Arpege. \"I watched the dining room, how everyone worked, and focused on what I ate and drank,\" he says. \"I wasn't concerned what people thought.\"\nThe rise of restaurants with bars, theatrical open kitchens and communal tables is also catering for, and spurring, lone repasters. Melbourne fine-diner ESP recently reopened with 18 front-row seats around its kitchen, a third of all places. And joints like Andrew McConnell's Supernormal or L'Hotel Gitan have both bar and open-kitchen seating. These set-ups also encourage singles to interact with staff, who provide local knowledge for out-of-towners or a good conversation. It can avoid singles occupying a table for two or more.\nMany restaurateurs, however, see value in solo diners (per capita they spend more than doubles) and embrace them. \"I've worked for people who think they're missing a sale,\" says Ben Willis, whose two Canberra restaurants, Temporada and Aubergine, were one and four on Dimmi's ACT list. \"Anyone prepared to go out on their own on Friday night and choose us, we give them a table.\" The pick too is the most comfortable and private.\nPuskas is the same: \"We give them a glass of champagne … because they've made the effort to come out and eat your food. We give that extra effort.\" At Pei Modern, soloists are offered a banquette with prospect across the Sofitel's porte-cochere. McConnell offers half-serves of most shared plates or curates medium-sized courses.\nMerivale's food and beverage director Frank Roberts says solo diners across the hospitality group take priority. They are allowed to skip queues or get personalised service. \"There's no more real way to build a relationship than with a lone diner,\" says Roberts. \"At est. alone, we have 15 regulars … these people are your best advertising.\"\nChef-owner of Brisbane's e'cco Philip Johnson agrees singles generate word of mouth, bring back family, friends or business groups. George Kasimatis, owner of Adelaide's Georges on Waymouth (which topped South Australia), even accepted one single's invitation to share his Barolo. \"The Darwin-based banker's now looking to book some corporate events later in the year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:08:26.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
