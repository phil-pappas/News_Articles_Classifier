Then we received a letter from Royal Mail saying that, as we had previously been advised, our parcel had contained dangerous goods a small bottle of perfume. \nIt said the perfume had been destroyed and the remaining items, a cup and saucer, returned to us. We had not had any earlier correspondence. \nWhen we rang Royal Mail we were told the department was extremely busy but the parcel would soon be on its way. AM, Somerset \nPerfume cannot be sent abroad via Royal Mail although, with restrictions regarding packaging and volume, it can go to addresses within the UK. \nIt later transpired that the cup and saucer had, like the scent, been destroyed. This was on the grounds that the parcel had not included your full address. \nA claim you put in for £40.50 for the missing items, including the perfume, was turned down. \n'We paid Royal Mail promptly and now we're being penalised' \nAfter I intervened, Royal Mail, accepting that it had wrongly promised to return the cup and saucer when, given the circumstances, they would inevitably be destroyed, said it would reimburse you after all, but needed a purchase receipt. I said this might be too much to expect given the relatively small sum and the time that had passed. \nWith no further ado it has now sent you £30 for the cup and saucer. It is not compensating for the perfume, which should never have entered the mail in the first place. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T13:19:57.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
