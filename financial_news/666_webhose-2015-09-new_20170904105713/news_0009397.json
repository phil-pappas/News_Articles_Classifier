Reductions would include cuts to schools, its university and healthcare, while revenues would include a recent sales tax increase to 11.5 percent, implementing a 4 percent services tax as of Oct. 1 and transitioning to a value-added tax in April 2016, the paper said at the time.\nGarcia Padilla shocked investors in June when he said the island's debt, totaling $72 billion, was unpayable and required restructuring. The island has been in recession for nearly a decade.\n(Reporting by a contributor in San Juan; Writing by Megan Davies; Editing by Chris Reese )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:16:20.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
