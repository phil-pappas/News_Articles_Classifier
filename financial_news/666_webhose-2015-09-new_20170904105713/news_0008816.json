As it knows full well, Parliament doesn't vote on the FTA.\" Edwina Pickles by Phillip Coorey Tess Ingram Opposition leader Bill Shorten has stressed that Labor does not want to make any changes to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It just wants the government to enshrine in legislation its claimed safeguards for Australian jobs.\nWith pressure growing on the Labor leader to give the FTA the green light when the legislation comes before Parliament next month, Mr Shorten said there were clear benefits of an FTA with China \"which is why Labor wants to make it a reality\".\n\"But it can't be at the expense of Australian jobs, which is why it's important Labor works to ensure safeguards like labour market testing and workplace skills and safety standards are maintained,\" he said.\n\"The Abbott Government doesn't need to change the FTA to make this happen. As it knows full well, Parliament doesn't vote on the FTA.\n\"It can provide the assurance in the enabling legislation. The Government needs to show that its assurances about safeguards for jobs under ChAFTA stack up and that is what Labor is pursuing.\"\nTwo weeks ago, The Australian Financial Review reported that Labor only wanted such safeguards - such as requiring Chinese companies to source local workers on big projects before importing labour - enshrined in legislation and was not seeking any changes to the FTA per se.\nBut the government is reluctant to do this and pressure continues to build.\nOn Wednesday, Western Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett said it was \"absolutely essential\" that the deal not be delayed.\n \"What I fear is if this is delayed, it will damage the Australia-China relationship in terms of trade and business,\" he said.\n\"China has plenty of choices. We don't have so many choices. China is our number one customer.\"\nBut Mr Barnett claimed WA would be largely immune should the FTA collapse.\n\"I think WA has been very successful in having its own relationship with China. So therefore we can distinguish ourselves if we need to,\" he said.\nA raft of former Labor figures, as well as sitting Premiers Daniel Andrews and Jay Weatherillâ€‹, have expressed their support for the deal. NSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley said on Tuesday the FTA was of net benefit and he urged federal Labor to not \"throw the baby out with the bath water\".\nFederal Treasurer Joe Hockey used Tuesday's weak growth numbers for the June quarter to demand Labor pass the deal when the legislation comes before Parliament in October.\n\"If you want faster economic growth, you won't get it if you drop the FTA with China,\" he said.\nFormer labor Trade Minister Craig Emerson repeated that labour market testing was not mandatory but discretionary and the government should fix that to end the political row", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:06:53.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
