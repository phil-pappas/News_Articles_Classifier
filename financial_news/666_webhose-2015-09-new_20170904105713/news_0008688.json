C is reducing its footprint in Hungary. The bank has entered into a definitive agreement with Erste Bank Hungary Zrt. and its subsidiary Erste Befektetési Zrt. (Erste Investment) to vend its consumer banking business in Hungary.Regulatory pressure over Citigroup’s global operations and concerns of weak returns forced the bank to make this move. Aimed at increasing the efficiency of the company’s overall business, the initiatives include streamlining operations and optimizing footprints across geographies. Terms of the Deal As per the agreement, Citigroup would sell its retail banking, consumer loans and cards businesses along with the transfer of consumer banking employees. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2015 though it awaits certain regulatory approvals. Terms of the transaction were undisclosed while customer accounts are anticipated to get transferred in fourth-quarter 2016.However, Citigroup will continue to service Hungarian corporations, financial institutions and public sector clients. The bank will also persistently offer services to its multi-national clients with operations in Hungary. “Since 1985 we have proven our commitment to the country and will continue to grow and invest in our Institutional and Commercial Banking businesses to better serve our local and global clients. We believe this transaction is a positive outcome for our Hungarian consumer banking customers and employees. We recognize their contribution to the rich heritage of Citi Hungary and thank them for their longstanding support and partnership” said Jon Wiggins, acting CEO for Citi Hungary.Banks in Hungary are operating in a difficult market burdened with huge taxes. Easing the situation, in February the government announced a cut in bank tax to increase lending. In light of this scenario, Erste’s move seems to be a strategic one. Background Citigroup operates in numerous markets worldwide. Concurrent with the third-quarter 2014 earnings release in October, in continuation of the streamlining of its international operations, Citigroup announced “strategic actions.” The company stated that it proposes to exit the consumer banking business in 11 markets. The global footprint will now cover 24 markets that represent more than 95% of the Global Consumer Banking’s (GCB) current revenues.The 11 markets include Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Guam, Guatemala, Hungary and Japan. Citigroup expects to complete a significant part of its strategic actions by the end of 2015. The move comes in line with the company’s strategy to focus on markets where it has a strong presence and long-term growth prospects. Similar Moves by Other Banks In 2012, as part of restructuring of its global operations, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC started reducing private banking in Japan and finally closed down all six of its remaining Japanese branches in July.Further, Societe Generale divested its wealth management unit in Japan to SMBC in July 2013. It followed Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s move to permit Mitsubishi UFJ to take over the private banking joint venture completely, which was announced in 2005. Notably, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a unit of Bank of America Corporation BAC. Conclusion Amid troubled tides, while Citigroup is encountering issues from various fronts, the deal will give the company some financial flexibility. We believe the company is well positioned to resolve its internal inefficiencies and setbacks. Further, we believe these streamlining initiatives will bolster the company’s capital position, reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies.Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another major regional bank worth considering includes The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK with a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
