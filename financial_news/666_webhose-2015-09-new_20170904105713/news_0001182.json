Photo: Glenn Hunt\nMr Stevens said the US economy was continuing to improve and that \"everyone knows that eventually this has to be reflected in less accommodative US monetary policy\".\nAdvertisement \"If they get to the point where they can see their way clear to just lift off, as they put it, from zero and go to something that is still very low – still remarkably accommodating – I think that is a good sign,\" he said.\n\"The argument is that as the vehicle is starting to speed up you do not need the foot right on the floor any more – you are not jumping to the brake, you are just easing off the gas a little bit, which I think is essentially the argument they would run, makes sense. There will now be furious debate for the next eight or 10 weeks, till we get up to Christmas, on whether they will go in December.\"\nMr Stevens poured cold water on the idea of a further cut in Australian interest rates, saying he was \"pretty content\" with a cash rate of 2 per cent.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\"For us, for some time the question has really been, is this interest rate appropriate to promote growth without running undue risks in the financial space? We think we have got that balance right,\" he said.\nOutside of the mining industry there were signs things were gradually improving.\n\"I think we are pretty content where we are right now, but we are not in the same phase of the cycle that the Fed is in.\"\nThe Australian dollar was \"doing what it normally would be expected to do, after a period where we were not sure that it was doing what it should do\".\n\"Exchange rates have a habit of overshooting, frankly, so it could easily be that it goes down further from here. I am not particularly forecasting that or calling for it.
