Hlekane will be paid his outstanding leave pay-out and pension pay-out, said Lushaba. \n\"We welcome this development, as it enables the board to commence the process of sourcing a replacement,\" said Lushaba. \n\"The role of CEO is supremely critical, more so for an entity like the SA Post Office, which is currently involved in major re-engineering initiatives for the sole benefit of its customers,\" he said. \nLushaba, whose role as post office administrator was extended to 30 September, briefed Parliament on Tuesday about progress made in the turnaround strategy. \nMillions of rands have been paid to top officials at Sapo for settlements over the last five years, The Star reported on 3 August 2015. \nMinister of Telecommunications and Postal Services Siyabonga Cwele told Parliament last month that his department paid out R5.02m in settlements to six Sapo executives since 2011. \nThese payments include: \n- R404 615.93 to Sapo company secretary Bessie Bulunga who was paid out in March 2014 after her dismissal. \n- R370 000 in an arbitration settlement to Maphutha Diaz in November 2013. \n- R1.7m to Marietjie Lancaster who received a voluntary retrenchment package in March 2013. \n- R1.47m to group chief executive officer, Motshoanetsi Lefoka, in January 2012 in an arbitration settlement that followed his resignation. \n- R532 000 to group manager RM Neshunzhi in an arbitration settlement in November 2011. \n- R548 058.25 to chief operations officer John Wentzel in July 2011. \nSapo was put under administration in November last year after a protracted four-month illegal strike that dented postal services. \nDeputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was assigned by cabinet in December 2014 to develop turnaround strategies for parastatals, including Sapo, Eskom and SAA to enable them to play a meaningful role in contributing towards South Africa's growth and development. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:37:46.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
