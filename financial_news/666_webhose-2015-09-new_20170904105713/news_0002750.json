But with the influx of digital ad dollars, the industry has been plagued by major problems .\nThere are concerns that the rise of ad-blocking software is hampering marketers’ messages and costing publishers revenue, questions over whether ads can actually be viewed by humans on a page, and reports of widespread fraud that rips off advertisers online.\nCMO Today discussed these issues and more with Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade organization which represents companies across the advertising industry and helps establish standards and guidelines for digital ad sellers and technology companies.\nCMO Today: The talk of ad blocking has reached a fever pitch lately. So how bad is it?\nMr. Rothenberg: Without minimizing the fact that there’s a problem, this is following the pattern we’ve seen for every crisis du Jour in our industry over the past 10 years. You have well-funded vendors come in with lots of money, marketing their solutions to a problem that has actually been there for years, and the marketing money finds its way into PR and the media. The sky hasn’t fallen.\nCMO Today: Are you worried?\nMr. Rothenberg: There is a real issue. I’m not worried because the marketing and media value chain has shown remarkable resilience. There is a natural human need to have businesses proposition you with goods and services and vice versa. You need to have that communication. I’m really not worried about whether advertising will be able to find its way through digital channels. I am concerned -- very, very concerned -- that costs of ads will go up and up and up from this unethical obstruction.\nCMO Today: So, is it the industry’s fault? Have publishers loaded too many ads on Web pages , for example?\nMr. Rothenberg: There is a fair amount of shared responsibility here. We have definitely, definitely over time gummed up the advertising experience and Web pages with all kinds of analytics and pixels and tags and all kinds of things. The more we are able to do with advertising on the Web, the more it contributes to the problem. So this is absolutely something the industry can address and should address.\nCMO Today: You hinted that the ad blockers are not ethical. There’s been talk that you may sue some companies .\nMr. Rothenberg: We’ve examined this, and there are some pretty good legal principles here. So that might be a course of action. Maybe. Certainly nothing aimed at consumers. That would be a bad idea. In terms of the software companies, nothing is imminent.\nOne thing that frustrates the hell out of me is that these companies are ad-blocking profiteers. They are trying to divert a portion of brands’ spending to line their own pockets.\nCMO Today: Are you frustrated with Google and Apple on this, since in some cases their software may be facilitating ad-blocking?\nMr. Rothenberg: I’m not happy about browser makers offering up ready-made accessibility to unethical software providers. I think that’s foolhardy and harmful to consumers. Advertising supports an enormous amount of content on the Web, and browser makers are basically telling consumers that their costs are going up, they may have to pay for more content, because a bunch of browser makers are more concerned with competing with each other than helping consumers.\nCMO Today: What should the industry do about ad blocking?\nMr. Rothenberg: I don’t think we know yet. But we may have to change the way we do advertising. We have to be craftier or clever.\nCMO Today: There is a sentiment out there that the IAB has so many dues-paying members who are either perpetrators of ad blocking and fraud or stand to benefit from these trends that you guys can’t actually do much to change things--or that you’re conflicted:\nMr. Rothenberg: That’s BS. We’ve called out everybody on everything. None of the companies in this industry are profiting from fraud. Maybe their technology was part of the problem before it was recognized. But nobody actually really does well by driving the value of ads in this industry down.\nCMO Today: What’s a bigger challenge--viewability, fraud or ad blocking?\nMr. Rothenberg: With viewability , the debate side of that is over now. It’s the currency now. It’s done. The argument is on the fine points of implementing the standards. With fraud, I’ve always believed that once we established a real compliance program with teeth across the industry, it can be contained relatively quickly. It’s in its early stages now.\nAd-blocking is more complicated. It has a real component of user experience [at play]. That’s very subjective.\n*This interview was edited for length and flow.\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en", "http://adage.com/article/digital/iab-surveys-options-fight-ad-blockers-including-lawsuits/300228/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ627_iab_TOP_20150918162848.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:38:46.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
