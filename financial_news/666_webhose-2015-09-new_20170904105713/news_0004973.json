You go through these old towns established by farmers, and the landscape is stunning, which is hard to see when you're on a highway or flying. These luxury, slow-travel train journeys are from a bygone era when people dressed up to have dinner and high tea was in vogue.\" \nWhich makes me wonder when the Scottish kilt and bagpipe tradition was added to the mix, because that's how my recent journey began. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:17:50.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
