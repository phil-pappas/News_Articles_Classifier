Remember the IGF is part of the budget and, therefore, the controller or the minister of finance going to parliament must account for the gross revenue.” \nMr. Terkper maintained that an electronic system has been put in place to streamline monies that end up in a suspended fund. \nMonies paid into those accounts would not go into the general consolidated fund, Mr. Terkper clarified, “but into a suspended fund so that the portion that has to go to government will then go straight into the consolidated fund and the portion that goes to institutions that have IGF will go to them. \n“The next step is that we are going to require that they use the release system and others to pay for those IGF,” the Finance Minister said \nBut former Chief Executive of DVLA Joe Osei Owusu told Joy News the workers must oppose the directive because it contravenes the law.
