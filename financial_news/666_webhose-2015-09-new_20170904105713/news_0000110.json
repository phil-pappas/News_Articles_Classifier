By Rupert Hargreaves | Fool.co.uk â€“ 1 hour 26 minutes ago 16.30 -1.700 \nInvestment company Tern (LSE: TERN) is falling today despite the fact that the company's largest investment, Cryptosoft Ltd, issued a relatively upbeat trading statement this morning. \nCryptosoft is Tern's most substantial investment, accounting for 95% of the company's potential portfolio return. Tern's other investments are Flexian, Push Technology, and Seal Software. The company owns between 1% and 0.5% of each of these businesses. So in many respects, Tern's long-term success is dependent upon the success, or failure, of Cryptosoft. \nUpbeat update \nToday's trading update from Cryptosoft is full of good news. The company's new management team has been in place since 1 July 2015 and is pushing forward with a new strategic plan. \nManagement's focus during the past three months has been on marketing, strategic partnerships and finding sales opportunities, several of which have been identified. And over the next four months, Cryptosoft will focus on turning these opportunities into concrete sales. \nWhat's more, since the beginning of July Cryptosoft has launched a new product, the V3 Data Centric Security Platform, and has developed strategic partnerships. The V3 Data Centric Security Platform is an updated version of the V2 version, which is already in commercial use with major UK and US companies. \nCryptosoft claims to be the only supplier with a peer-reviewed, market-proven software security product, for Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine applications. \nFour-month watermark \nWithin today's trading update, Cryptosoft tells investors that the company will be looking to convert sales opportunities into bookable revenues over the next four months, giving investors a clear-cut time frame for growth. Indeed, now that the company has laid out this goal, investors have a benchmark to judge management's performance. \nAnd a clear-cut goal is exactly what Tern needs to build investors' trust. Since coming to market, the company has been shrouded in controversy, despite the fact that it has rapidly become one of AIM's hottest stocks. \nLike all early-stage investment businesses and small-caps, Tern needs to prove to investors that it can be trusted to hit growth targets, make sensible investment decisions and build shareholder equity. So Cryptosoft's progress over the next four months will be a crucial factor in determining whether or not Tern is set for the big time. \nHigh-risk, High-reward \nUnfortunately, Cryptosoft's success isn't guaranteed. The company is a small player in an industry dominated by large tech giants. There's nothing to stop these competitors muscling in on the company's target market while it tries to secure contracts. The tech sector is notoriously competitive and firms need to have deep pockets to fend off the competition. \nCryptosoft doesn't have the financial firepower to take on the likes of Vodafone , Blackberry , and Symantec , which has already secured more than 1bn IoT devices. \nOverall, the next four months will be a critical time for Cryptosoft and Tern. Investors could have a lot to look forward to. \n\nNot for the faint of heart \nTern certainly isn't for the faint of heart and if you're not willing to risk everything with the company, the Motley Fool's top analysts have recently identified a company that they consider to be one of the market's \"top small caps\" . \nThe company in question has signed deals with some of the FTSE 100's most successful companies, has a strong cash balance, proven advantage, and unlike Tern is already profitable. Our analysts reckon that the shares of this company could have a potential upside of 45%! \nIf you'd like to find out more, download the free report today . \nRupert Hargreaves has no position in any shares mentioned.
