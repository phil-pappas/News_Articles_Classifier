Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of car giant Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) tumbled 19 percent after it was found to have cheated U.S. emission tests. \nInvestors cheered an unexpectedly clear election victory for the Syriza party in Greece on Sunday that boosted hopes its bailout program would stay on the road. \nIn Asia, equity markets slumped, with 1.5 percent to 2 percent falls in Australia, Korea and Malaysia . China defied the region's downtrend, with the Shanghai Composite index up 1.9 percent and the CSI300 rising 1.75 percent. \nOil rose, with U.S crude surging around 4 percent on signs of declining stockpiles and less drilling that could reduce future output. \n\"The economic environment has changed since the Fed last hiked rates (in 2006),\" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets in London. \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is not just the U.S. central bank ... It is wearing the mantle of the global central bank, and markets are struggling with that.\" \nThe U.S. dollar strengthened more than 1 percent against a basket of major currencies on hopes the Fed was still on track to hike rates this year while the European Central Bank may ease further. \nThe euro \nThe Fed's decision last week may lead other central banks, including the ECB, to ease further, said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) in New York. \n\"The Fed's talking a little bit more hawkish; the ECB's talking a little more dovish,\" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. \nU.S. Treasuries prices fell as U.S. equity markets rallied and three top Federal Reserve officials spurred sales of debt by suggesting that a year-end U.S. interest rate increase was possible. \nGold retreated from a near three-week high as strength in stocks and the dollar dampened a rally. Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,132.80 an ounce.
