Ben Rushton Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Labor has failed to have the Senate call on Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove to sack royal commissioner Dyson Heydon after key crossbenchers refused to back the move.\nThe motion proposed by Labor's Senator Penny Wong was defeated, when the vote was tied 34-all.\nCrossbenchers Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie sided with Labor and the Greens to support the motion.\nBut crossbenchers Nick Xenophon, John Madigan, Ricky Muir and Bob Day voted with government senators against the motion. Crossbenchers David Leyonhjelm and Dio Wang abstained.\nLabor had moved the motion after Justice Heydon last week refused an union application for him to disqualify himself after his initial acceptance of an invitation to speak at a Liberal Party event.\nOpposition workplace relations spokesman Brendan O'Connor said the Senate motion was \"crucial\" because \"Tony Abbott has hand-picked a commissioner, with a clear affinity to the Liberal Party, to conduct this witch-hunt\".\n'Base political ends' The government's Senate leader and Employment Minister, Eric Abetz said on Tuesday the Senate had \"voted down Labor's disgraceful attempt to misuse Parliament for their base political ends to protect corrupt unions\".\n \"The Labor Party has repeatedly made baseless allegations against a respected royal commissioner that even the lawyers for the ACTU and CFMEU have refused to argue,\" Senator Abetz said.\n\"It is because the Labor Party knew that its claims would never stand up in court that they sought to circumvent the courts by asking the Governor-General to sack the royal commissioner.\"\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said on Tuesday that the \"tied result is hardly a resounding endorsement of the government's biased royal commission\".\n\"The ACTU has always maintained that the royal commission is a political witch-hunt by Tony Abbott designed to weaken his political opponents,\" he said.\n\"The only thing Tony Abbott should do – in all good conscience – is shut it down.\"\nChallenge downplayed The ACTU has yet to publicly reveal if it will pursue court action to try and remove Justice Heydon. But unions have downplayed the prospect of a legal challenge, fearing a court defeat would undermine their attacks on his credibility.\nUnion officials said they believed unions had been successful in eroding Justice Heydon's public standing and the Abbott government would seize on a court loss to try to restore the commission's credibility.\nUnion leaders said a legal victory could prove counter-productive as the government might be forced to extend proceedings which are likely to finish in about two months, before Mr Heydon's report in December. They said the forced replacement of Justice Heydon could extend the commission into an election year.\nThe commission is due to resume public hearings next week when its focus on allegations against officials of the Queensland branch of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:27:34.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
