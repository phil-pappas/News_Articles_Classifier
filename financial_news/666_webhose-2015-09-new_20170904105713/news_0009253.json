What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about the advisability of taking six months of retroactive benefits after waiting until 70 to file for retirement benefits. Question : If I want to take my retirement benefit at 70 and Social Security personnel offer 6 months of retroactive benefits, should I take those extra 6 months of retroactive benefits? Answer : The more I talk to people, the more I understand how easy it is to make major mistakes in taking Social Security benefits if you don’t know exactly what you’re doing or, equally important, don’t know exactly what Social Security is doing to you.Let me tell you about a doctor I saw last week. I’ll call him Gene. This was my fourth visit to see Gene and since he looked to be of age to take Social Security, I thought I should make sure he was getting the most from it. So I told him I was a bit of an expert on the subject and wanted to make sure that he was following the best strategy. He said he was 71 (I thought he was younger) and that he had waited to take his retirement benefit until 70. He also said his wife, who didn’t have much of an earnings record, had taken a spousal benefit at 66, her full retirement age, when the spousal benefit would start at its full value. Gene also said that his wife’s own retirement benefit will never exceed her spousal benefit so this would be all she’d collect while he was alive.I said, “Well, you two did the right thing.”He said, “Yes, I think I did. By waiting I got the highest retirement benefit for myself, and by waiting my wife got the highest spousal for herself.”Then we talked a bit about Social Security’s financing and complexity. At the end of this discussion he said, “You know, the folks at Social Security were really nice. They even gave me six months of retroactive benefits when I went in to file for my retirement benefit.”“Oh, gee,” I said, “when did you file?”“Three months before turning 70.”“Uh oh,” I said.“Uh oh?” Gene said.“Uh oh,” I said.“Did I do something wrong?” Gene asked.“You were trying to wait until age 70 to start taking your benefits in order to get the highest possible retirement benefit, right?” I asked.“Yes,” said Gene.“Well,” I said. “What Social Security did was to start your retirement benefit 9 months before your reached age 70. This means your retirement benefit is 6 percent lower, on a permanent basis, than it would have been had they not given you the retroactive benefits. It also means your wife’s widow’s benefit, if you die, will be 6 percent lower than it would otherwise have been.”“What?” said Gene, clearly concerned. “Nobody told me taking retroactive benefits would lower my retirement benefit.”“I’m not surprised,” I said. “Social Security has a long history of pushing people to take their retirement benefits too early.”“But why is the benefit 6 percent lower?” asked Gene.“Because waiting an extra year between full retirement age and 70 to collect your retirement benefit, raises it by 8 percent per year. So if you went in three months early, they surely treated you as not waiting till 70 in the first place and then, in giving you benefits six months in arrears, they pushed your retirement benefit filing date back another six months. That’s nine months in total. Nine months is three quarters of a year, so you lost three quarters of the 8 percent yearly benefit increase (called the Delayed Retirement Credit). This is how you got stuck receiving a 6 percent (three quarters of 8 percent) permanently lower retirement benefit.“They never told me,” said Gene.“I’m sorry,” I said. “I wish I had talked with you sooner.” My weekly Social Security column appears on PBS NEWSHOUR’s website .", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/"], "published": "2015-09-10T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:59:36.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
