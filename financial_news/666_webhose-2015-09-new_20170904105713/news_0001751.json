Consumers are becoming ever more dependent on their smartphones, but planes are one of the few places where they cannot access emails or take urgent calls. \nTaking the lead in the phone final frontier will allow Inmarsat to dominate the market in Europe. \n= Over land and sea = \nInmarsat and DT will work together to develop the phone systems, with connectivity initially coming from the FTSE 100 group’s satellites before 300 ground-based stations, each with a range of 50 miles, take over. Flights out of range will still use the satellites to deliver a connection. \nThe service is expected to match domestic high-speed broadband connections. \n= Commercial questions = \nAlthough the deal is a positive move that confirms demand for inflight connections, yesterday’s announcement was light on detail. \nTalk time: Planes could no longer offer sanctuary from mobile phones \nJefferies analysts noted that while Lufthansa coming on board “validates the commercial and technical proposition, [and] DT’s presence validates our view that Inmarsat is positioned as a ‘strategic’ cog in the final frontier of wireless”, they added that “fundamental” questions remained, including how the companies would share revenue from the phone system and who will pay for what. \n= Time (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) to get on board = \nAlthough questions about costs remain, Inmarsat is confident that airborne broadband will be a large part of its future and Questor does not dispute this. It’s time to get on board. \n= Not cheap but worth it = \nAt a price to earnings ratio of 30.2, rising to 34.5 next year, Inmarsat is not cheap; and the yield of 3.2pc, rising to 3.3pc, is not great. But the mix of Inmarsat’s newly completed Global Xpress network of satellites, offering high-speed broad-band, and the prospect of the company being a leader in inflight connectivity, means it deserves an upgrade.
