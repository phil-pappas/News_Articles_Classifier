In contrast, high quality care not only produces a larger brood, but individual offspring with a higher mass. This is consistent with previous studies.\nHowever, the team also found that offspring pay a cost for receiving high quality care, because it makes them vulnerable to exploitation if they pair up with a lower quality partner. This may explain why animals often choose a mate that is willing to put in a similar amount of effort as them as a parent. In this way, they are less vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides, uses the carcass of a small vertebrate such as a mouse as an edible nest for its young. As its name suggests, a breeding pair buries the carcass and preserves it with an antibacterial secretion. The mother lays eggs nearby in the soil, and the larvae crawl to the carcass when they hatch. Although the larvae can feed themselves, they also beg both parents for partly-digested food from the carcass.\nIn the current study, when males were paired with females that had received no post-hatching care as larvae, they had significantly shorter lives than those whose partners had received more care. The most likely explanation is that males with low quality partners put more effort into parental duties to compensate for the shortcomings of their mate, and paid the price by dying younger.\nThe research appears in the journal eLife.\n 23, 2015 2:54 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:49:29.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
