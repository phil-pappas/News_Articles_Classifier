Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Competition regulator Rod Sims warns that Australia Post's plan to jack-up the price of stamps to $1 is \"not a done deal\", as unions gear up for a concerted campaign before a final decision is made in December.\nCommunications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has backed the beleaguered mail service's plan to introduce a two-speed mail service, with a regular service operating two days slower than the current delivery speed and the addition of a premium-rate priority service which could cost as much as $1.50 per letter.\nBut before Australia Post can increase the price of ordinary stamps for their standard, slower service from 70 cents to $1, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission must approve the increase. Chairman Rod Sims said they would carefully consult with industry, unions and the public before making their decision with any prise rise proposed to apply from January 4, 2016.\nThe ACCC issues paper questions whether it is appropriate to hit consumers with a 43 per cent price rise in one-hit and whether a \"price path over time\" is \"more appropriate\".\n\"It is not a done deal, it is extremely complex because of the cost allocation, falling demand and question of which service you focus on,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims told The Australian Financial Review. Bradley Kanaris \"It is not a done deal, it is extremely complex because of the cost allocation, falling demand and question of which service you focus on,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims told The Australian Financial Review . \"If you just look at stamps, they are still losing money in 2016-17 but does stamps underpin the bulk mail price, which [when] combined with stamps they are making money in 2016-17.\"\nAustralia Post said that its monopoly letter service (stamped and bulk business mail) made a $269 million loss last financial year but claims that if the price of stamps was increased to $1 from next year, that loss would reduce to $70 million this financial year and turnaround to a forecast $84 million profit in 2016-17 – based on its target that 80 per cent of users take-up the slower mail service.\nUnder the plan, Australia Post plan to freeze the price of a concession stamp (60¢ for a small letter) and will not increase the Christmas card rate from 65¢.\nBut the ACCC warn that while $1 stamps could return Australia Post to profit in the short term, \"stamped letter services would continue to face losses and there is uncertainty around the longer-term rate of decline in letter volumes and a risk Australia Post's overall monopoly letter services could return to net losses\".\nRelated \"You can't just let the dwindling number of people on the service keep paying more as demand goes down,\" Mr Sims said. \"There comes a point where you can't do that, now I don't think we are at that point yet … but I accept its a potential problem.\"\nThe ACCC consultation comes as union groups gear up for a concerted campaign to lobby the government with a protest planned outside Australia Post's headquarters on Wednesday and a convoy to Canberra planned for the weekend.\nThe groups have commissioned a report from ACIL Allen consulting, which shows the mail industry employs 131,709 full-time jobs and contributes $14.2 billion to the economy.\n\"It's ridiculous to increase the price of stamps by 43 per cent without considering the full ramifications on the total industry,\" Bill Healy of the Printing Industries Association of Australia said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-releases-issues-paper-on-price-increases-proposed-by-australia-post", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-09-07T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:27:57.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
