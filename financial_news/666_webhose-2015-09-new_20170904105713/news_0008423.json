Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Former Freehills lawyer Michaelia Cash has been elevated into Cabinet as Employment Minister, replacing Eric Abetz who has also been dumped as the Liberal Party's Senate leader.\nSenator Cash, who has been the assistant minister for Immigration and Border Protection, also becomes Minister for Women and Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service.\nBefore entering into Parliament in 2008, Senator Cash, 45, was a senior lawyer with Freehills â€“ the national legal firm loathed by unions.\nShe is expected to take a tough line against unions while seeking to convince the Senate crossbenchers to support the government's workplace relations agenda.\nSenator Abetz said on Sunday that while he was disappointed not to retain his Cabinet position, it was the \"prerogative\" of Mr Turnbull to choose his ministry and he wished them well. Alex Ellinghausen During his two years as a Minister, Senator Abetz failed to get any of the coalition's industrial changes passed by the Senate.\nSenator Abetz said on Sunday that while he was disappointed not to retain his Cabinet position, it was the \"prerogative\" of Mr Turnbull to choose his ministry and he wished them well.\nHe did not state whether he intended to leave politics, saying he looked forward to continuing to \"put my role as a Liberal Senator for Tasmania first\".\nA looming challenge for Senator Cash will be to try and steer through changes to the Fair Work Act, which are due to be voted on by the Senate next month.\n Labor and the Greens last week denied Senator Abetz a rare legislative victory after he reached agreement with six Senate crossbenchers to support changes that include new limits on union bargaining power on new projects.\nTo face a fresh call Senator Cash will also face a fresh call from former ACTU president Martin Ferguson for the government to go further on the changes to stop unions holding major resource projects \"to ransom\".\nIn a speech on Monday, Mr Ferguson, a former ALP MInister, said unions were able to threaten legal industrial action to push their demands for more generous rosters on the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project.\n\"This will no doubt set a precedent for other enterprise bargaining agreements,\" he said.\n\"The fact that a union campaign for more time off can emerge at this late stage of a project proves that change is needed.\n\"The Fair Work Act, as it stands, can make it impossible to deliver major resource projects on time and on budget.\n\"Requiring enterprise bargaining agreements for major projects to be renewed during the construction phase, as has happened on Gorgon and at Gladstone, allows unions to hold developments to ransom.\n\"That is too much power to be in the hands of a few union leaders.\"\nMr Ferguson, chair of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's advisory board, said the Government and the ALP should support the Productivity Commission's recommendation that enterprise agreements be extended to cover the life of greenfields projects, from construction through to handover.\n\"It is not a radical proposal. It is a sensible and responsible reform that will help our oil and gas sector stay competitive.\n\"I urge the government and opposition to accept the Productivity Commission's recommendation and send a positive signal to international investors that we are determined to reduce project costs in this country and become more competitive.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-20T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:47:15.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
