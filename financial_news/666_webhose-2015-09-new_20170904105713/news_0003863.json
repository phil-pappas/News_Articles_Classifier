PUBLISHED: 13:02, Fri, Sep 4, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:43, Fri, Sep 4, 2015 GETTY More than a million people with interest-only mortgages could lose their home \nTime is running out for the homeowners who have made no arrangements to pay off remaining debt when their mortgage term ends, said the charity.More than one in three of the estimated 3.3 million mortgage holders could be forced to sell their properties or risk having their homes repossessed, as they won't have necessary funds when they are due. More than 432,000 have not even thought about how they will repay the capital, according to Citizens Advice. Widely available before the financial crisis when rules were tightened, the products only require repayment of interest until the end of the loan when the capital must then be repaid.

However, Citizens Advice now estimate the figure is almost four times higher at 934,000. Charity chief executive Gillian Guy said: \"It is good that rules around these mortgages have changed, but there are many people who previously took out these products and face losing their home.\"Lenders have to exhaust all other options when borrowers get into arrears. It's time to level the playing field so that interest-only customers get the same protections when their mortgages mature.\"It is also important that people can get independent advice, guidance and support about how they can plan and manage their finances.\"The FCA has previously called on banks to contact all borrowers with interest-only mortgages due to end before 2020 to discuss how they plan to repay, but only 30 per cent of borrowers responded.
