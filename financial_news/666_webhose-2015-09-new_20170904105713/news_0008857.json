Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe inquiry was announced by 7-Eleven within 48 hours of a joint Fairfax Media- Four Corners investigation that unveiled rampant wage fraud and an apparent cover-up at head office.\nAdvertisement Professor Fels will be joined on the panel by Consumer Affairs Victoria director and ACCC commissioner David Cousins.\nA company statement said the pair would start work in the next week and be supported by an independent secretariat with a team of forensic accountants from professional services firm Deloitte.\nDeloitte will provide accommodation and other support for the review as well as a hotline service and website for claims.\n\"The bottom line is, what has happened with franchisees not meeting their employer obligations has happened on our watch, and we are going to make this right,\" 7-Eleven chairman Russ Withers said.\n\"There is no doubt that Allan Fels, whose position on this issue is well known, will fulfil this role without fear or favour. He is staunchly independent, and with the support of Deloitte's forensic accountants, I am confident that his involvement to help ensure 7-Eleven pays all approved claims promptly.\"\nThat statement said Professor Fels had insisted the panel's independence be protected.\n\"While Professor Cousins and I finalise the panel arrangements, we have broad investigative parameters, with the clear aim to rectify underpayment of staff as quickly and efficiently as possible,\" Professor Fels said\n\"We have insisted that extensive efforts, including advertising, be made to encourage those who believe they have been underpaid to contact the panel. The overall results of the panel's work will be made public but the names of individual claimants will not be made public by the panel.\"\nProfessor Fels said the panel would seek the support of the Fair Work Ombudsman, who has regulatory oversight, but its aim was solely to correct underpayment of past or present staff.\nSince the scandal erupted, 7-Eleven has been in panic mode, trying to downplay the wage fraud and get it off the front pages by announcing a series of reforms.\nThey include a panel to assess wage fraud and the franchise model. It has also offered to help franchisees sell their franchise by refunding the franchise fee, and on Wednesday it agreed to extend income support to stores that earn $310,000 or less a year in gross income.\nThat represents an almost tripling of the previous regime's threshold where 7-Eleven previously guaranteed income support to stores earning $120,000 or less.\n\"To ensure stores in lower-volume bands have more certainty about their financial capacity we are increasing the minimum gross income guarantee to $310,000,\" Mr Wilmot said in a memo.\nA series of explosive internal documents obtained during a joint Four Corners -Fairfax Media investigation shows 138 stores earned $300,000 or less in the year to June 30, 2015, which now makes them eligible for some form of financial lifeline.\nAn insider revealed 7-Eleven had been reeling amid a media investigation that found a massive cover-up by head office and contracts that saw many of the company's 620 stores struggle to break even if they had to pay proper wages. \"Panic set in,\" the insider said.\nHe said if franchisees were forced to pay the correct wages, at least 140 of the 620 stores would be unsustainable.\n7-Eleven generated earnings before interest and tax of $143 million in 2015, helping boost the wealth of co-owner and chairman Russ Withers and his sister Bev Barlow to $1.5 billion.\n\"Nobody needs $143 million dollars in EBIT a year,\" the insider said.\n\"If we had a little bit less and the staff had a little bit more, I think that everyone could still win. The only reason why we take such a big slice is because we can and we get away with it and we make more,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:45:48.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
