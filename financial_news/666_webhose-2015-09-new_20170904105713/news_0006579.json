With this critical step complete, QuickBooks® merchants can use integration-encrypted terminals for the transaction security required by EMV. “We are very excited to bring not just an EMV-ready QuickBooks POS solution to all merchants, but to also minimize their PCI scope with this out-of-scope solution,” said Philip Holan, CEO of PaymentCollect ™. \"This means that for a store owner using our QuickBooks® integration products, an infected computer does not result in compromised credit card data. That’s a big relief for merchants and their customers.” Not only does an out-of-scope terminal bring peace of mind to PaymentCollect™ merchants and reseller partners, it also allows for cost savings, liability reduction and more flexibility of payment types such as pin debit and Apple Pay ™.\nAbout PaymentCollect: Founded in 2010 due to an overwhelming demand from the QuickBooks market for better payment processing options, PaymentCollect™ provides savvy merchants with best in class integration to QuickBooks POS and Financial Products, matching and improving on the existing payment processing experience with a real time embedded plug-in solution and allowing merchants the flexibility to choose preferred payment processors. Merchants report PaymentCollect’s solution as the easiest and most reliable QuickBooks plug-in, as evidenced in a 20 minute setup, installation and training of extremely satisfied merchants.\nFor more information, visit http://www.paymentcollect.com or call 828-214-5550.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXltZW50Y29sbGVjdC5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGUtcGF5Lw=="], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:23:35.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
