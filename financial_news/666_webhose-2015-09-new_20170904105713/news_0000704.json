Mobile devices are no exception. Currently, there are some very good—in terms of hardware and design—handsets below the Rs10,000 price barrier. Which ones are worth considering? The criteria I have used for selecting Android-based devices include HD or full HD screen—of at least 5 inches or more—2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory and main camera with minimum 8MP. The operating system (OS) must be KitKat or Lollipop and, for Windows phone, it should be 8.1 or above. Here is my shortlist: Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL | Rs9,999 It features Android Lollipop, 13MP camera with dual LED real tone flash (5MP secondary), 5.5-inch HD (Corning gorilla 4 glass) screen, 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (64-bit) quad core (QC) processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory and last, but not the least, an expandable storage of 128GB! The ‘Laser’ tag in the name is for its capability for auto-focus using laser technology while clicking images. Lenovo K3 Note | Rs9,999 This device has a full HD, 5.5-inch screen, while the OS, camera, RAM, internal memory is the same as Asus Zenfone 2 Laser. It features a 64-bit octa core (OC) processor (1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 -MediaTek). Its expandable memory capacity is limited to 32GB. It has a built-in Dolby Atmos for a better sound experience. YU Yureka Plus | Rs8,999 This is the successor to the Yu Yureka. It supports 4G LTE, comes pre-loaded with CyanogenMod 12 OS that is based on Android Lollipop. Most of the features of Yureka Plus are similar to Yureka, except the full HD screen that provides a better viewing experience. But, for normal usage, it is hardly noticeable. The CyanogenMod OS offers more customisation and security features like privacy guard, compared with plain-vanilla Android OS. YU Yuphoria YU5010 | Rs6,999 This, again, is a handset from the stable of Yu Technologies (a unit of Micromax). It comes with 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 QC processor, 2 GB RAM, 16GB internal memory, expandable up to 32GB and dual SIM support. It features 8MP primary and 5MP secondary camera and 5-inch HD screen. The rest of the features of Yuphoria are similar to Yureka Plus, except that this device provides a fast-charging option. Go for it, if you are short of funds. Redmi 2 Prime 4G | Rs6,999 This device from Xiaomi is a successor to the Redmi 1S. It comes with Android 4.4.4 (KitKat) with MIUI interface. It features Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 QC 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory (expandable to 32GB), 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary (front) camera, 4.7-inch HD screen. Redmi 2 Prime also features fast battery charging (30% in 30 minutes). A worthy contender for Yuphoria. Microsoft Lumia 535 (black, dual SIM) | Rs7,249 It comes with QC processor and supports dual SIM. It has Windows phone 8.1 OS and a document editor. It features 5-inch qHD display, 5MP cameras as primary and secondary, 1GB RAM, 8GB internal memory (expandable up to 128GB), Corning gorilla glass 3 and 1905mAh battery. Microsoft Lumia 540 | Rs8,960 It comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 QC 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 processor and supports dual SIM. There is Windows phone 8.1 OS with Lumia Denim and a document editor. It has 5-inch HD display, 8MP primary and 5MP secondary, 1GB RAM, 8GB internal memory (expandable up to 128GB), Corning gorilla glass 3 and 2200mAh battery. With Microsoft Office included, you can view or edit documents on the go.
