The governor was among the majority of officials who voted this month to keep the benchmark at 0.5 percent, with Ian McCafferty maintaining his call for a quarter-point increase.\nWhile reiterating that monetary policy was a matter for the independent central bank, Osborne said talk of removing stimulus was an indication of economic success.\nThe BOE and the U.S. Federal Reserve are getting close to withdrawing the emergency measures put in place to counter the financial crisis, with rate-setters in both countries weighing slow inflation against solid labor-market data.\n“The general signal coming from the Bank of England, the general signal coming from the Federal Reserve, is because the British and American economies have been growing robustly in the last couple of years,” Osborne said. “The exit from very loose monetary policy is going to come.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T11:44:35.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
