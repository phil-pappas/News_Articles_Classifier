And we are showing, clearly, that there is a problem,\" she said at a news briefing. \nRousseff's government delivered the proposed budget to Congress Monday predicting a primary deficit amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP, or 30.5 billion reais ($8.4 billion). \nThis was the first time a Brazilian government has unveiled a plan that would mean government spending outstrips revenue. \nThe news follows last week's prediction that Brazil has just entered its worst recession since 1931 and a host of other downbeat economic news, coupled with political turmoil. \nA primary budget reflects the government's ability to manage savings and debt. The worry for Brazil now is that its debt load will lead to a loss of its investment-grade credit rating, which would be a serious blow to the economy. \n\"We want to meet the goal that we set,\" Rousseff told reporters. \"So we are going to get that deficit down.\" \nAmid the tough economic climate, inflation also is high at 9.56 percent and unemployment has risen to 7.5 percent. \nRousseff's popularity, with the economy so weak and major corruption scandals swirling, has skidded to single digits. \nBrazil saw boom years peaking with 7.5 percent economic growth in 2010. But Latin America's biggest country -- the host of next year's Summer Olympics -- has been brought down by plunging commodity prices and political instability.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:35:24.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
