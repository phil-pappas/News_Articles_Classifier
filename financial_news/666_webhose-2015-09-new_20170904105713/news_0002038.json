PUBLISHED: 17:46, Fri, Sep 11, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:59, Fri, Sep 11, 2015 GETTY Football fans need BT Sport to watch the Champions League matches \nFans of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City - plus neutral fans - will miss out on the matches if they're not a BT customer, as for the first time no live games are available for free in Britain. Dan Plant, consumer finance expert at MoneySupermarket, said: \"Since the football season got underway last month, many fans have looked to score new TV packages, and those following the Champions League will need to move sooner rather than later if they want subscribe to BT and catch live games from their living room.\"However, there are an array of different TV sports packages available, which include phone and broadband depending on your household needs. \nOverall, you'll pay less to watch Champions League games on BT Sport if you also take out broadband through the provider. \nIf you are already a BT broadband customer you can add the BT Sport Pack, which includes the UEFA Champions League and Europa League for £5 a month (£60 a year). \nOr BT broadband deals start from around £22.99 a month (£275.88 a year) to take the entire cost including Sport to just over £335 a year. \nHowever, you can currently get a deal through cashback site Quidco, which would take the price for BT Broadband plus TV (including sport) to £215.88 a year. \nThe deal includes unlimited fibre broadband use and weekend calls and costs £27.99 a month (including line rental), plus a £35 activation fee, taking the total to £370.88 - however you'll also get £120 in cashback from Quidco to bring the toal cost down to £215.88. \nIf you wish to, you can then add Sky Sports for an additional £22 a month (£264 a year) to bring the total cost to £479.88. \nAlternatively, comparison site MoneySupermarket has now launched a useful broadband and TV sports package tool, which helps people find the best prices bundle based on the sports or games they want to watch, plus services needed. \nMr Plant added: \"Fans can select their favourite events – including the Champions League – and the tool shows you which channels they are being televised on, free or paid-for, and then shows the best packages for you, based on the events you’ve selected.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T17:03:10.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
