Yes.Venture capitalists at the recent Silicon Dragon event in Shanghai agreed that winter is clearly on the way even as autumn season colors appear. High valuations of recent months for larger size financings are falling, and deal makers are cherry picking deals and sectors.Gary Rieschel of Qiming Ventures noted that startups better be prepared to figure out how to make money to weather the storms. \"It will require patience,\" he said.\"I was born in winter, and my mother always told me that kids who are born in winter will be stronger and live longer. So winter is good,\" added David Wei, a founder of Knight Vision Capital.A positive factor is that companies that shouldn't survive will be weaned out, agreed lawyer Patrick Loofbourrow of Cooley.\"It's better to have the weaker startups die quickly as opposed to go for a long period of time and soak up a lot more capital,\" said Loofbourrow. \"The kindest thing investors can do is give them an early death instead of continuing to wallow along.\"He sees deals getting done with terms that are more protective of the investor. \"Deals will still get done. they will just get done on different terms.\"Ramon Zeng of DCM said he sees the pace of investment for deals over $50 million round slowing. \"But if look at Series A or B, it is still at a normal pace, he added.The impact on business-to-business startups could be stronger, however, Richard Gu of Chengwei Ventures, pointed out.As the winter months approach, LP investors in VC are already questioning firms on their investment returns as valuations come down.But if survival of the strongest is in play -- which it probably is -- then it's the strong entrepreneurs who will make it, will raise money and be prepared for battle. Ending on a positive note, Ronald Cao of Lightspeed China Partners said, \"we look forward to that as an early stage investor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:13:29.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
