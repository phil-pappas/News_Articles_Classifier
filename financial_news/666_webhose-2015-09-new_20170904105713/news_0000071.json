Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open up by 20-23 points, or 0.3-0.4 percent higher. Germany's DAX was seen opening up by 56-58 points, or 0.6 percent higher, while France's CAC 40 was expected to open up by 15-17 points, or 0.3-0.4 percent higher. Asian shares followed Wall Street higher on Wednesday, albeit in thin volume, and short-term U.S. bond yields held near 4 1/2-year highs as investors braced for the possibility of the first interest rate hike in the United States since 2006. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday. Although the benchmark index is up more than 5 percent from a low hit late last month, it is down about 14 percent from its peak two months ago, mainly on concerns about the pace of economic growth in China and the prospects of a U.S. rate hike. On the macroeconomic front, there is UK employment and euro zone inflation data later in the day.
