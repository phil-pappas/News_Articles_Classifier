Toronto, San Francisco and Washington were also in the top 10.\nThe only other European city to rank among the world's 10 leading financial centres was Zurich while Frankfurt was the European Union's second highest ranking city in 14th place.\nChris Cummings, chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, said a successful renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the euro zone was \"critical\" to sustained growth of its financial industry, often described as the world's gateway to Europe.\n\"London faces stiff challenges from other established centres, not just New York and the likes of Singapore, but also emerging centres in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But it is the future of the UK's relationship with the EU which is arguably the most pressing issue,\" he said.\nZ/Yen's Mark Yeandle told newspaper CityAM that London's future status was also threatened by government efforts to control immigration.\n\"You can't have an international financial centre without an international workforce,\" he said.\n London regains finance hub crown", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:35:14.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
