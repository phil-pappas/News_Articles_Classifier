Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Labor leader Bill Shorten said it was \"a good thing for this country that Tony Abbott is no longer prime minister\" despite the latest Newspoll confirming a sharp boost for the Coalition and Malcolm Turnbull .\n\"I would have liked to have been the one who replaced Tony Abbott because whoever did that was going to get a boost in the polls,' he told the ABC's Q&A program.\nA Newspoll to be published in The Australian on Tuesday shows the Coalition leading Labor by 51 per cent to 49 per cent, a 5-percentage point swing to the Liberals as a result of the leadership change .\nThe Coalition's primary vote rose 5 points to 44 per cent and Labor's fell 4 points to 35 per cent.\nMr Turnbull is beating Mr Shorten as preferred Prime Minister by 55 per cent to 21 per cent, which is an 18-point improvement over Mr Abbott's last rating by Mr Turnbull, and a 20-point fall for Mr Shorten.\nMr Shorten's approval rating was 29 per cent and his disapproval 54 per cent whereas Mr Turnbull had an approval rating of 42 per cent and a disapproval rating of 24 per cent.\nMr Shorten said Labor deserved some credit for the ousting of Mr Abbott because it had stood firm against him, especially the 2014 budget measures.\nUnder questioning over his trade union past, Mr Shorten said he would not take seriously any adverse findings that might be made against him by Tony Abbott's Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption because of its political bias.\n \"The Royal Commission, in my opinion, was set up for a range of motives. On one hand it is to look at particular arrangements in the construction industry, and also I believe it was set up to smear its political rivals,\" he said.\n\"I do not believe automatically that because...if they are to make an adverse finding, no, I don't accept automatically I am going to allow that Royal Commission which is set up on a political basis to start dictating what the Labor Party does or how we run our politics in this country.\n\"If there is criminality found by this Royal Commission, well then that is a matter which needs to be looked at, but I don't accept that everything that this royal commission is doing is started with the best of motivations, nor do I believe that this process has been entirely fair.\"\nMr Shorten said he accepted scrutiny \"but what I don't accept is that it's worth $60 million to second-guess whether or not you pay someone a casual rate or a penalty rate on a Sunday and have every sort of industrial negotiation second-guessed by barristers who are paid $3.5 million\".\n\"It is nonsense,\" he said.\nMr Shorten had agreed to appear on the show before Mr Turnbull rolled Tony Abbott for the leadership.\nTurnbull learned 'many, many things' He said Mr Turnbull needed to demonstrate that the Liberal Party was a party of the centre and not of the right. So far, his stated views on climate change and same-sex marriage were the same as Tony Abbott's. There needed to be a change of direction, not just a change of leader of the government, he said.\nEarlier Monday night, Mr Turnbull told the ABC's 7.30 program he had learned from the mistakes he made as Opposition leader and was a reforged, regalvanised, wiser, and better person.\nMr Turnbull said he had learned \"many, many things\" from his first period as Liberal leader between 2008 and 2009.\n\"I'm wiser about people,\" he said.\n\"I feel much more confident and centred in myself. But not in a sort of ebullient way, I just feel quietly confident and settled. I'm at peace with myself and I feel that the leadership I can provide to Australia will make a difference.\"\nHe said his key priorities were to ensure Australia remained \"a high-wage, first-world, generous, social welfare-net economy.\"\n\"That requires strong economic growth,\" he said.\n\"Government has to provide the leadership, the sense that we know what we're doing, that we have a vision, we have a clear direction and that builds up business confidence.\n\"Interest rates have never been lower so it's a fair question to say, why is business not investing more? The answer is lack of confidence. So everything I can say to inspire confidence is going to help the economy.\"\nAlthough all policies were under review, Mr Turnbull said it was not his aim to use the mid-year budget update, due in December, as a mini-budget.\nHe said tax reform would be a big part of the agenda and he would not be ruling anything in or out.\n\"Clearly there are practical limits as to what you would do, but the important thing is to be open-minded, consult, engage intelligently, explain the challenges to the public in a manner that respects their intelligence and then make a decision and having made a decision, then argue, advocate in other words why your decision is right.\"\nHe also flagged changes to industrial relations to increase flexibility, employment and business activity in a way that would not threaten conditions.\n\"In other words, the challenge for us is not to wage war with unions or the workers that they seek to represent, but really to explain what the challenges are and then lay out some reform options,\" he said.\nIn his first comments on foreign affairs , he chided China for its counter-productive policy in the South-China Sea.\n\"The pushing the envelope in the South China Sea has had the consequence of exactly the reverse consequence of what China would seek to achieve. You would think what China would seek to achieve is to create a sufficient feeling of trust and confidence among its neighbours that they know longer felt the need to have the US fleet and a strong US presence in the western Pacific,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-21T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:08:02.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
