The researchers studied data from the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study of 1997 to 2000 in which 3,316 people had participated. Trans-fats acids are used in almost every fried food like burger. Taking it in large amount can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart stroke, diabetes, and cancer. “Our results show that the low levels of industrially produced TFA we found in the LURIC study did not pose a health risk, and therefore could be regarded as safe,” lead researcher Dr. Marcus Kleber said. The study was published in European Heart Journal .

This means people with heart issues can take coffee in moderation without any fear. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat. This is the largest prospective study to date and involves data from about 42,000 men and nearly 35,000 women who were participating in two long-running studies, the Cohort of Swedish Men and the Swedish Mammography Cohort. However the researchers have warned that the study is limited to Atrial fibrillation and drinking coffee may increase other types of irregular heartbeats. The study comes on the heels of an earlier study from this year, which suggested that coffee may lower the risk of heart attacks. The research was published in the journal BioMed Central .

The researchers studied the National Youth Risk Behaviour Survey of 13,583 high school students and found that being physically active four or more days per week can reduce suicidal tendencies by 23% in bullied students. Students who reported exercising 4-5 days a week had lower adjusted odds of sadness, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts than students who exercised 0 to 1 day a week. The researchers said, “Considering the often catastrophic and long lasting consequences of bullying in school-aged children, interventions for victims of such conduct are sorely needed. The results show that exercise can be a salient option in response to bullying in schools.” The research was published in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry .

Researchers from Carnegie Melon University conducted a field experiment in which employees at Humana, a large health-care company, were asked to place lunch orders through an online platform designed especially for the study. A control group was given no calorie information. In the experimental group, employees were given either the number of calories, a traffic light indicating the approximate number of calories (a green light, for instance, meant the few calories), or both. They found that providing calorie information, either through numbers or icons such as traffic lights, encourages diners to take in fewer calories. “For those consumers, traffic light labels can communicate basic ‘eat this, not that’ information regardless of their understanding of the underlying nutrients or ability to use numeric information,” said one of the authors.
