He said EDF would remain in its key countries of France, Britain and Italy, but wanted to build up its international operations. \n\"By 2030, we want to have a significant presence in three to five countries outside Europe, notably in solar and wind,\" Levy was quoted as saying. \nHe added that this meant EDF would have to make choices, which was why it had placed all of its fossil fuel-based assets outside France under review. \nHe also said there was no plan to review EDF's contract with the British government to build two nuclear plants at Hinkley Point. \"There is no need whatsoever to reopen negotiations,\" he said.
