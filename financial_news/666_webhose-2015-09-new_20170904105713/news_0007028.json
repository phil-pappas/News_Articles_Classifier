However, credit card cashback will be capped for new customers. The 123 credit card pays 1% cashback on supermarket shopping, 2% on spending in department stores at 3% on transport. From January, each element will be capped at £3 a month. \nAccording to Santander's latest annual report, some 3.6 million people in the UK held at least one 123 product in 2014 and Santander increased its current account users by 47% over the year. \nHannah Maundrell, editor of money.co.uk, said: \"It seems this 'venus fly trap' was a great catalyst for the current account switching market but now it's got people on board it's becoming less of an attractive deal from January 2016.\" Moneywise Verdict The current account is now much less attractive for smaller balances. Interest on deposits of less than £3,000 won't cover the monthly fees, even for people who don't pay tax on their interest. \nThe cashback scheme remains attractive and people with large balances will still get plenty value from the account. Someone with the optimal £20,000 balance will get £540 interest before tax, after paying fees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T21:37:04.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
