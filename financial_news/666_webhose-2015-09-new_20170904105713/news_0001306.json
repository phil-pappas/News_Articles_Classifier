I think it's probably the best thing for all investors, where excess capital goes back through buy-backs,\" Ross McEwan told the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Banking & Insurance Conference in London. \nMr McEwan said the bank, rescued by a £46bn government bailout during the 2007/09 financial crisis, was on track to meet key financial targets. \nRBS has said it is aiming for a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 13pc and plans to return any capital above that level, with share buy-backs an option. \nMr McEwan also said the bank continued to be affected by issues relating to past misconduct. \n\"The potential conduct and litigation settlements have to be factored into this progress,\" he said. \"We're dealing with these as quickly and as prudently as possible but they will continue to be a drag on this business for the next six to 12 months.\" \nAuthorities in the US are investigating claims the bank misled investors in mortgage-backed securities in the United States.
