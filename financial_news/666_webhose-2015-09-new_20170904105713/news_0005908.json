In the meantime, we now have more ideological distance between the two major parties in Parliament than ever before. \nAnother question is whether that will drag the Conservatives to the centre, as they attempt to win over moderate Labour supporters, or push them further to the right, in the absence of strong centrist opposition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:49:17.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
