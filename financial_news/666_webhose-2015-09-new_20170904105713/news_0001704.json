Lawyers for the trust did not respond to requests for comment.\nWestwood Global Investments LLC, a Boston-based firm, manages investments for the foundation and the WGI fund.\nPetrobras' market value has plunged more than 90 percent from nearly $300 billion seven years ago.\nIt took a $17 billion writedown in April for overvalued assets. Prosecutors have said more than $2 billion of bribes were paid over a decade, mainly to Petrobras executives from construction and engineering companies.\nThe case is WGI Emerging Markets Fund LLC et al v. Petroleo Brasileiro SA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-07568.
