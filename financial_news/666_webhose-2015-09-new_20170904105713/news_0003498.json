Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Stevan Premutico looked across the gleaming table, directly into the eyes of the multimillion-dollar competitor trying to buy his fledging start-up, and panicked as quietly as he could.\nHis restaurant booking app, Dimmi, was three years old, and he and his team of five had done the hard yards, pitching their technology solution thousands of times and signing up a sizeable base of 1000 restaurants.\nIt was large enough to have attracted the interest of US-based Livebookings, which had millions in venture capital dollars to burn, whereas Premutico was still trying to work out how to tell his team their seed investor had defaulted on a final instalment of $100,000.\n\"If you want to feel your heart stop, try getting taken out to coffee by guys who list every reason why you're going to fail, for hours on end,\" Premutico says.\n\"These guys kept hammering on about how great they were, and how small and weak we were and why we needed to partner with them or they'd squash us. They kept staring me down over the table and, to be honest, it was terrifying.\"\nThe Dimmi team didn't want to sell. In their eyes they were just getting started and, in the rare moments when they stopped panicking, it was validating to have a much bigger company making such an aggressive play for them.\nDecision time Backhanded encouragement aside, Premutico knew he had to make a decision. As he escaped the meeting, he fled home, his guts churning as his mind raced through his options and the unavoidable fact he had only $25,000 left in the bank – barely enough for another month of wages.\n \"I still remember getting home and freezing. I had no one to talk to about this, I didn't want to scare the team, and my family and mates were supportive but wouldn't understand.\"\nA few days later, Premutico walked into the Dimmi office, gathered his team and told them the offer. Their response was to insist they still had plenty left to achieve, and it was exactly what Premutico needed to hear.\nHe took a mentor in former Yahoo chief executive and now LinkedIn's managing director, Cliff Rosenberg, and contacted the company's would-be new owners to tell them – as politely as possible – that it was \"thanks but no thanks\", with a distinct sub-note of \"bring it on\".\nAfter another three months, Livebookings had struggled to establish the rapid growth it needed and packed up in Australia to focus on more promising markets in Europe, where it continues to flourish.\nEmotionally battered but grinning, the Dimmi team continued. The takeover attempt had reminded them about the importance of developing strong relationships with the restaurants they served with their booking app, and they poured even more resources into keeping their existing clients happy, while continuing to grow.\nSecond rival arrives Then another, even larger rival, called Restalo, turned up from Spain. It spent millions in customer development in the first few months in Australia, and flew in its founder, who soon was also pushing hard to purchase Dimmi and its network of customers.\nThis time, Premutico went on his own to the meetings and said he was surprised they were using exactly the same \"negotiating\" approach as the earlier acquisition attempt.\n\"They kept saying, we're big and international and you're small and just Australian, so partner with us, or we'll squash you,\" Premutico says.\n\"I don't know where they learn this stuff, but I can tell you having sat through it twice, it's not a way to bring people on board.\"\nBut Dimmi wasn't quite so small anymore. It had grown to a team of 20 and had 2000 restaurants on its books. They were well funded by backers, including Telstra and Village Roadshow, and had run partnership campaigns with Google, Qantas and TripAdvisor.\n\"But most importantly, we had worked hard to build good relationships with our clients. They spent six months trying to scoop them out from under us with free memberships, and we were so proud we didn't lose one customer in that time.\"\nWhile there were a few tearful conversations in the office and a tense board meeting or two, Premutico told Restalo to \"move along\" as well. After almost a year of trying to establish a foothold, Restalo also retreated from Australia to focus on larger markets.\nIn May this year, Premutico finally did sell Dimmi. It was bought by online travel giant TripAdvisor for an undisclosed multimillion-dollar sum. Premutico still serves as its chief executive and the team remains intact.\n\"Selling Dimmi felt a bit like a father walking his daughter down the aisle,\" Premutico says. \"I always felt at some point I was going to pass my start-up to someone else. It just had to be an excellent partnership, which it has been so far. It was about finishing a chapter, and beginning a new, bigger and better one.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/116041942547218769712/posts"], "published": "2015-09-14T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:10:20.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
