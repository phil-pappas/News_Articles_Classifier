China has got to come much further with its offer.\" \nSunday's Washington Post quoted Zhang Xiangchen, China’s deputy representative for international trade, as saying that positive progress could be expected during Xi's visit, which will start with visits to tech firms in Seattle. \nHe declined to comment on when a deal might be reached, noting only that China’s entrance to the World Trade Organization took 15 years and that this treaty was “no less important or complex.” \nBrilliant said it was important that both Xi and President Barack Obama renew their commitments to the treaty in their Washington meetings on Thursday and Friday and urge officials to move \"with more speed and seriousness of purpose.\" \nThis was particularly important given the fragile state of the global economy, the slowdown in China, and growing distrust of Beijing's plans among U.S. businesses, especially those in banking, agriculture and technology, Brilliant said. \nHe said there were particular concerns about the threat of technology theft through hacking, as well as about China's proposed national security law and one that would restrict activities of non-governmental organizations - including business lobbies. \nOne area where the U.S. side hoped for progress was in biotechnology. Brilliant said there were hopes that China would agree to license seven biotech products, and there was also likely to be discussion on market access for U.S. pork and beef, although it was not clear if China would give ground on this. \n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:54:43.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
