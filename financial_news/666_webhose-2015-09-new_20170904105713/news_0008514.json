Alex Ellinghausen Senior Liberal frontbencher Peter Dutton has urged his colleagues to focus on winning the Canning byelection amid ongoing leadership speculation about Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nMultiple sources have told The Australian Financial Review that the plan is to mount another leadership challenge regardless of the outcome of next week's byelection in the Western Australian seat of Canning.\n\"I'm not going to speculate on party-room activities,\" Mr Dutton said told Sky on Sunday.\n\"The Prime Minister has the strong support of the party, and he does that because he's a better man than Bill Shorten.\"\nMr Dutton said he was confident the Liberals can hold Canning on September 19, as a Galaxy poll showed the government faces a swing of up to 10 per cent against it.\nHe said the government \"can get there\" in Canning, but not if they're talking about themselves.\nDeputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said it wass \"odds on\" that the Liberals will change leaders, it was just a question of when and who would replace Mr Abbott.\nBut she doesn't think it would make much difference.\n\"It's extraordinary that they think a change of leadership is going to fix all of that because they're all part of the same team that made the same bad decisions on the same product,\" she told ABC TV on Sunday.\n Dutton apologises for joke Mr Dutton also apologised for joking about the plight of Pacific island nations facing rising seas from climate change, saying he was disappointed it distracted from the government's announcement on Syrian refugees.\nHe was overheard making a quip about \"water lapping at your door\" in Port Moresby at a media appearance with Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday.\nMr Abbott was forced to defend Mr Dutton on Saturday after his minister was called \"vulgar\" and \"morally irresponsible\".\nThe comments offended Pacific island leaders, and Mr Dutton acknowledged on Sunday that he had made a mistake.\n\"Obviously it was a private conversation - I should have realised the mike was there,\" Mr Dutton told Sky.\n\"I didn't; it was directly behind me. I made a mistake and I apologise to anyone who has taken offence to it. It was a light-hearted discussion with the PM and I didn't mean any offence to anyone.\n\"If anyone has taken offence they should accept my apology. I'm disappointed that it allowed for a distraction from what was a very good policy announcement.\"\nMs Plibersek said the minister's apology doesn't go far enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T09:10:13.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
