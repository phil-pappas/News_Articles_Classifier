Zefr says it tracks 31 billion views a month of these sort of videos featuring everything from unboxing Adidas sneakers and iPhones to fans showcasing the cleaning power of Swiffers.\nThe company plans this week to roll out a new interface that will help ad buyers locate specific videos that feature marketers’ biggest fans, or people that are simply enthusiasts of a particular product category. Zefr claims this new offering, called BrandID Suite, will let it dig through millions of videos of YouTube, find the ones most relevant to an advertiser, and then bundle those all together into ad packages that will reach sizable audiences. The company has already been working with a handful of marketers on this sort of targeting over the past few months, but the new interface should help make it easier for numerous advertisers to buy ads this way.\nZefr—which has raised over $60 million in funding to date—has says it can, for example, identify 355,000 fan-created videos for car brands and another 448,000 videos featuring mom-targeted brands. And now it can deliver ads just to those individual videos.\n“We’ve evolved from being primarily a listening company to now also an ad-targeting company,” said Zefr co-founder and co-Chief Executive Rich Raddon. “We think this is absolutely the best content for brands to advertise against on YouTube.”\nUnboxing video from YouTube Photo: The Wall Street Journal Of course, there are many other companies in the YouTube ecosystem who would likely make that claim, starting with YouTube itself. The past few years YouTube has been siphoning off the top 5% of its ad space for big marketers under a program dubbed Google Preferred.\nPlus, there are multichannel networks like Maker Studios and Fullscreen who promise brands the ability to reach specific YouTube influencers, as well as other analytics firms like OpenSlate and Pixability, which help ad buyers laser in on specific demographics on YouTube.\nAccording to Jordan Bitterman, chief strategy officer at the media buying firm Mindshare, Zefr is set apart by the fact that it can deliver ads in front of videos that will be viewed by people with a particular affinity for products.\n“There is plenty of social data out there, but not a lot of ways to apply it like this for advertising,” he said. “We’ve been upping our spending significantly with them.” Mr. Bitterman suggested that Zefr has a shot at pulling in a portion of advertisers’ budgets typically devoted to TV because of traditional TV’s declines in live viewing. That’s definitely Zefr’s ambition.\n“This is really about brand advertisers, and helping them buy YouTube ads the same way they buy TV,” said Dave Rosner, Zefr’s senior vice president of marketing. “This product is aimed directly at TV buyers.”\nHowever, those marketers might not be the perfect target, said Helen Lin, executive vice president, digital and magazine activation, at ZenithOptimedia.”It’s definitely an interesting proposal -- the idea of elongating the network of influencers you can buy ads against on YouTube,” she said of Zefr’s BrandID offering.\nMs. Lin said that Zefr showed her data for one of her clients. That brand’s produced videos were generating 80 million views on YouTube during a given period. But fan-created videos featuring that brand were generating more than twice as many views. Thus, those fan-produced videos would seem to be a good place for that brand to run ads.\nStill, she sees that sort of move as being complementary to an advertiser’s core media spending.\n“The challenge will be in trying to get budgets from TV buyers,” she said. “ Google has really already done that with Preferred . This seems geared for more niche tactics.”", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQQOIBbg0VM", "https://www.youtube.com/user/EvanTubeHD", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KM474_unbox_F_20150925161502.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:07:27.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
