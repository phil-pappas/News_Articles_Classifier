In fact, IBM found that 30% of a city's traffic is attributed to drivers looking for parking. Fortunately, there are a number of apps available to help you find and compare spots, save money every time you park, and even reserve a parking space right from your phone. This will help you get out of traffic and into a safe spot in a fraction of the time and effort. 1. BestParking \nBestParking is a top parking app, and has been featured in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Magazine, Forbes, ABC, FOX, CBS, and NBC. It locates all the available parking spots in your area so you can quickly compare and save. Available in 105 cities and 115 airports throughout North America, it will find you the best spot, no matter where you are. It even sorts spots by price, so you can instantly visualize where the most affordable (and most expensive) spots are. The app has 850,000 monthly users and is backed by outstanding reviews from people who have saved time and money . 2. Parker \nParker can help you find available parking spots, prices, and hours for 24,000 garages and lots. You can also filter parking spots by space, payment type, and more. Built-in GPS navigation can even guide you to the nearest open spot, so you will never have to drive around confused in a new city again. It can help you find a spot in a parking lot or garage, or it can help you navigate local street parking. It will also run a timer, so you don't have to worry about parking tickets. Parker has outstanding online reviews and was voted one of the most highly recommended apps by Forbes and Mashable. 3. SpotHero \nSpotHero is an app recommended by Forbes because it can help you find and compare parking and reserve a spot for up to 50% off the drive-up rate. The app has its own dedicated unsold spots from parking facilities in the area. You can quickly reserve one of those spots from your phone and enjoy a discounted rate in the process. Not only will you save money, but you also won't need to worry about losing your prized spot to another driver. It is available in most large cities and is introducing new locations everyday. 4.

The app can even tell you where to find parking up to two weeks into the future. 5. Parking Mate \nParking Mate shows you where the closest and safest places are to park. It also keeps a log of where you've parked and how much time you have left in your spot, notifying you when you are getting close to expiration. You can even add parking rules to the app to inform others of neighborhood parking regulations. The app is also highly reviewed online and recommended by Mashable. 6. ParkingPanda \nParkingPanda is recommended by Forbes because it sets itself apart from the rest. It partners with stadiums, family attractions, and other events so that you can find a spot close to the action without wasting time searching for parking. There is also a referral program, which will allow you to earn free parking. 7. ParkWhiz \nParkWhiz is another app recommended by Forbes because it promises to help save you more money than all the rest. While most apps can only promise savings of about 50%, this app promises savings of up to 60%. The app will help you compare, reserve, and pre-pay for parking in no time. 8. City Specific Apps \nThere are several options for city specific apps, which are ideal when you live in a large, heavily populated city. Some of the apps for big city parking that you may want to check out include: VoicePark — San Francisco Can I Park Here? — New York PrimoSpot — New York, Boston, Seattle Chicago Parking — Chicago Avoid Driving Altogether \nIf you're still having trouble finding parking, consider alternative transportation.
