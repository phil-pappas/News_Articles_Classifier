Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Philip Baker Government bond yields have fallen to such record low levels since the financial crisis that some experts have questioned if it is still appropriate to use them when working out the \"risk-free rate\".\nGuy Debelle, from the Reserve Bank of Australia, says the answer is yes, they are .\nIn financial theory, a lot hinges on the risk-free rate.\nAll assets are priced off it, companies can end up paying more for their money if the spread over the risk-free rate widens, while shares offer a \"risk premium\" in the form of a higher long-term return to make up for any short-term volatility.\nGenerally, it is the government bond that constitutes the risk-free rate and low bond yields over the past few years, for example, have gone a fair way to making shares look good value, enticing a range of buyers to get on board.\nLow bond yields have also made the dividend yield on shares look attractive.\nDistorted the yield But central banks have distorted the yield on government bonds around the globe to such an extent that they have fallen to record lows and even at times into negative territory.\n It has meant that some actuaries have wondered if the government bond rate is still the appropriate risk-free yield?\nIn a speech on Wednesday Debelle said ultimately the risk-free yield should be something that approximates the growth rate of the economy.\n\"On that basis, the government bond yield is still doing a pretty good job. Yes, policy actions in some of the major economies might have pushed the yield lower than it might otherwise have been. But those policy actions reflect the growth circumstance in which we find ourselves,\" he said.\nFor example, offshore investors have been large buyers of Australian government bonds since the crisis and it's one reason our yields are so low. However, Debelle doesn't see these purchases as distorting the yield, instead it just reflects \"the reality of the world we live in\".\nSecular stagnation is another reason offered as to why growth rates will be lower than they used to be and in turn that will keep bond yields low.\nThere are a few theories of secular stagnation but in essence it means the rate of technology and innovation will slow down.\nNo reason to give up But Debelle finds that \"very defeatist, and ultimately speculative. We simply don't know what the future will bring. There have been quite a number of times in the past where such a claim has been made which has subsequently been proven wrong. Maybe it's right this time, but I don't see any reason to give up yet.\"\nSo overall he still thinks the government bond yield is the best measure of the risk-free yield in the economy.\n\"There are some reasons to believe that it is now structurally lower than it used to be, but I find the proposition that the future rate of technological progress will be lower too pessimistic.\"\nThe other event having an impact on bond yields is of course the US Federal Reserve meeting this week.\nOn Tuesday night the US two-year bond yield, the bond most sensitive to a change in interest rates, hit 0.8 per cent, its highest yield in more than four years.\nEven 10-year US bond yields rose to 2.3 per cent, the highest level in almost two months. Bond yields rise as prices fall.\nPoised to go higher All will be revealed by the end of the week but after keeping interest rates at close to zero since 2008 the Federal Reserve is poised to raise them .\nThat means investors drunk on too much cheap money after a seven-year binge are on the cusp of starting their long, hard journey back to credit sobriety.\nAlthough the move just has to be the most flagged rate rise of all time, it looks like the sharemarket is fighting it.\nNot that the Federal Reserve should pay too much attention to the sharemarket but the S&P 500 has taken investors on such a rollercoaster ride since early July that there have been alternating returns for the past 10 weeks. That is one week up, the next week down.\nThe Federal Reserve has been warned not to raise rates now because of the wild ride on shares that some say is a signal that all is not well in the US economy.\nBut it's a small move, 25 basis points, and if not now, when? Just before Christmas?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-09-16T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:07:38.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
