Millennial entrepreneurs may be delusional, new study finds By Rebecca Burn-Callander | Telegraph – 41 minutes ago Print \nWith little or no regard for business planning and inflated growth ambitions, the under-35s display a worrying lack of common sense \nYoung entrepreneurs may be twice as ambitious as their older counterparts about the growth potential of their businesses, and four times as likely to hire staff, but this could mean they are delusional rather than talented. \nThe latest Albion Growth Report, an annual poll of Britain's small businesses, which is now in its third year, found that entrepreneurs aged 35 and under - the \"Millennials\" - were bullish on the growth prospects for their new ventures , with 14pc predicting \"dramatic\" expansion compared to just 8pc of 45 to 54-year-olds. \nBank managers and financiers don't see eye-to-eye with Millennials on growth and revenue forecasts either. \nWhile a third of these young entrepreneurs have attempted to raise finance, compared to just 14pc of middle-aged business owners, they were five times more likely to have their applications rejected. \nProven entrepreneurs are likely to find it easier to raise finance than first-timers but the research from venture capital investor Albion Ventures, which polled 1,000 people from across the UK, found that Millennials were worryingly overconfident about their business prowess. \nSome 77pc claimed they did not require mentoring to help hone their entrepreneurial skills. Just 16pc said they would benefit from better financial management and fewer than one-quarter said that they needed to improve on their business planning skills. \nJust 17pc would be willing to trade equity for more experience on their management team, suggesting complete confidence in their own capabilities. \nYoung entrepreneurs are also big spenders, and are more likely to seek finance to pay for research and development and new staff than their older counterparts, who prefer to grow organically . \nSome business experts say that Millennials' super-charged growth ambitions may benefit the economy in the long-term. \n\"The younger generation is by far the most optimistic and ambitious about the future,\" said Patrick Reeve, managing partner at Albion Ventures. \"This pro-growth sentiment is excellent news for the UK economy as the under-35s will become increasingly influential over the years to come.\" \nMillennials in the UK are looking increasingly like the start-up whizz-kids over the Atlantic, he added: \"We're shifting towards a more entrepreneurial model as seen in the US.\" \n\"You would expect to see Millennials setting up businesses in the tech, software, and media industries where there has been huge growth in recent years and so they may well be projecting that in their forecasts,\" added Deniz Ucbasaran, professor of entrepreneurship at Warwick Business School. \n\"Older start-up owners may well be in more traditional sectors where the growth returns are not as good. There is also a tendency for younger entrepreneurs to be over-confident as they have not failed yet, whereas older start-up owners might well be trying out their second or third venture, so are more cautious.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:11:32.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
