The categories are based on the age and location of the building and the era in which they were built.\nDemand for new technology has also forced many office blocks to undergo significant upgrades. The new properties are said to be of the highest IT standard. Of course, the new buildings also give the owners the ability to charge higher rents.\nAny new building is considered super premium or premium and, as they get older, fall into the other categories of A, B,C, and D grade buildings. It's safe to assume that the C and D grade properties are 20 years or so old. They are the ones that are being refurbished into strata offices.\nThe retail sector is also a confusing place for the non-professionals.\nAs one colleague once asked, \"is a mini major\" a short person in the military?\nNo. Its a stand-alone retailer that is more than 400 square metres and is not a department store, supermarket, cinema or bank/service retailer. Some examples could be a Priceline or a JB HiFi store.\nSize is also an influencer, rather than location.\nAccording to the Shopping Centre Council of Australia, regional shopping centres are those that include at least one department store; sub-regional centres include at least one discount department store as the major anchor tenant and neighbourhood or supermarket-based shopping centres include at least one supermarket as the major anchor tenant.\nThe humble shed (industrial) sector is also riddled with new terms from the basic warehouse and distribution centre to third party logistics, mainly being an outsourced courier such as DHL, which lease the property as their headquarters.\nThen there are the business parks, being a combination of office and an adjoining warehouse.\nGetting universal language into valuations is also an issue on the table.\nAs part of the International Property Measurement Standards Coalition (IPMSC), 66 professional and not-for-profit organisations around the world are working to devise a single property measuring system.\nOne is the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), which is advocating for a universal system.\nThe IPMSC has already launched a new national standard for measuring office property – a system which effectively mirrors the Australian measurement standards.\nReal I.S. Australia is the first Australian corporate owner to join. Vishant Narayan, managing director, Real I.S. Australia, said as cross-border investment increases globally, the industry has a duty to ensure our markets operate with absolute transparency, \"homogenised standards will increase transparency, which is a great thing\".\n\"The new standards have benefits well beyond the reach of pure property investment. For example, our tenants seeking to rent space in global markets will benefit from greater market transparency and consistency,\" Mr Narayan said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:24:12.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
