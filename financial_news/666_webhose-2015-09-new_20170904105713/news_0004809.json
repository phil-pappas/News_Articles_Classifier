Chris Pearce by Ben Potter Co-operative research centres must work more closely with the federal government's industry \"growth centres\" to ensure their work helps make firms more internationally competitive and boost commercial returns.\nIn his first speech as Industry, Innovation and Science Minister, Christopher Pyne re-committed the new Turnbull government to his predecessor's $225 million \"growth centres\" program and confirmed co-operative research centres would be brought under their wing.\nMr Pyne told an advanced manufacturing conference at RMIT University in Melbourne that a CRC review commissioned by former industry minister Ian Macfarlane had recommended change \"to align CRCs more closely with the goals of the Industry Growth Centres\".\n\"In fact, I expect that in future, CRCs will carry a major part of the research load for growth centres,\" Mr Pyne said.\nHis remarks are consistent with comments by Andrew Stevens, the chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre and former IBM Australian chief executive, last month.\nMr Stevens told The Australian Financial Review that making Australian firms globally competitive should be a higher priority for $9.5 billion of annual public research funding, and scientific curiosity less influential.\nHe said federal research spending was mainly driven by research priorities and the curiosity of individual researchers, and only \"a very small proportion\" was driven by the competitiveness of a given industry sector.\nBalance shift The government wants to shift that balance.\nMr Pyne said the Innovative Manufacturing CRC would work with the advanced manufacturing growth centre under a recently signed memorandum of understanding.\nThe IM CRC had to sign the memorandum of understanding to get its hands on $40 million of federal funding pledged by Mr Macfarlane in the May budget as part of a $731 million budget funding package for CRCs.\nMr Pyne said the five growth centres were a central plank of the government's innovation and competitiveness agenda, which aimed to drive growth by concentrating concentrating investment on five key sectors with strong growth potential.\nAs well as advanced manufacturing, these are energy and resources, agriculture, medical technology and pharmaceuticals and mining equipment and technology.\nEach growth centre will set long-term strategies to boost productivity, skills and jobs, cut red tape, engage with international markets and link between businesses, industry, science and research.\nThe idea of picking high-growth sectors was dismissed by an expert from israel – the world's most innovative nation – on Monday.\nManuel Trajtenberg, a member of the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) and professor of economics at Tel Aviv University, said nobody knews what the growth industries of the future would be, least of all governments.\nHe said the best thing government could do was provide support for universities and research and development in a \"neutral\" way and then get out of the way and allow professors and entrepreneurs to choose the best way forward.\nIsrael outperforms Australia on most measures of innovation and entrepreneurialism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:48:32.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
