Just in August, they pulled $1.8 billion out of Pimco's Total Return fund, Gross' former signature fund. Today it has less than $100 billion in total assets, the lowest level since 2007, according to the company. \nAt its height in 2013, the fund managed $293 billion. In May, Vanguard surpassed Pimco as the world's largest bond fund manager. \nPimco's fall from grace is a lesson in what happens when a firm's fortunes are so closely linked to one person's identity. \nGross was synonymous with the Pimco name and it's no surprise that the firm's fortunes have suffered after his departure. \nRelated: Wall Street bombshell: Bill Gross out at Pimco \nGross allegedly left after clashing with other execs over how to manage the company. Gross had developed a reputation of being a little strange towards the end of his tenure. He once wrote an ode to his dead cat named Bob in an investment outlook note to clients. \nHe left Pimco last September to work at Janus Capital Group ( JNS ) . The fund had been losing money before Gross left, but his departure appears to have led to an exodus of funds. \nRelated: Bill Gross blames media for Pimco troubles \nIn March 2014, before Gross left, Pimco's total return fund had $231 billion under management. By March it dropped to $116 billion and it continues to dwindle. \nPimco announced earlier this year that former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke would serve as an adviser to Pimco . That star hire hasn't helped the cause yet though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:46:24.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
