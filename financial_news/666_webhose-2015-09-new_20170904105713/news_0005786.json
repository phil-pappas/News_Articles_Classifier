We intend to get those answers.\" \nThe lawmakers have not announced witnesses yet for the session, but there is a long tradition on Capitol Hill of inviting embattled executives to appear for tough questioning. \nLaw firms are also lining up to take on the German company, the world's largest automaker by sales in the first half of 2015. \nThe Seattle law firm Hagens Berman has filed a class-action suit against Volkswagen with clients in more than 20 states alleging fraudulent concealment, false advertising and violations of federal and state laws. \n\"I paid premium for a Golf TDI because I was promised that it was 'Clean Diesel,'\" said a claimant cited by Hagens Berman. \n\"I was told that the emissions were better than a standard gas automobile. In addition, I was also promised high fuel economy. I now feel I have been defrauded by these claims.\" \nThese cases will also undoubtedly weigh on new sales for Volkswagen as it battles for market share with GM, Ford, Toyota and other giants. \n\"I think there is a basic violation of trust here and a violation of trust for Volkswagen buyers who are basically very loyal here in the USA,\" said Jack Nerad, analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \n\"It is in Volkswagen's best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good,\" said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto website Edmunds.com. \nThe emissions debacle will also likely hinder Volkswagen's ambitions to make diesel cars a bigger share of the US auto fleet. \nThe cheating device is on nearly 500,000 diesel cars in the US market, and Volkswagen admitted Tuesday it was on 11 million cars worldwide. \nVolkswagen's slate of diesel offerings includes Passat and Jetta sedans and compacts like the Golf cars. \nThose are among the nearly 50 diesel models currently available on the US market, according to Diesel Technology Forum, a lobbying group. \nBut diesel currently accounts for just three percent of US vehicle sales, according to JD Power. \nDiesel \"will stay a niche market,\" Kelley's Nerad predicted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T01:21:52.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
