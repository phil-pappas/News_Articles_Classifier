Fortescue dropped 7.5 cents, or 3.92 per cent, to $1.84. \nThe big four banks were also down, with Commonwealth losing $1.04, or 1.41 per cent, to $72.76, Westpac falling 45 cents, or 1.38 per cent, to $30.66, NAB dropping 35 cents, or 1.15 per cent, to $30.16 and ANZ shedding 31 cents, or 1.11 per cent, to $27.52. \nNufarm was one of the only stocks to enjoy a positive morning, rising 61 cents, or 8.63 per cent, to $7.68 after the crop spray maker and seeds supplier lifted full year profit 15 per cent to $43.2 million. \nKEY FACTS \n* At 1030 AEST on Wednesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 65.1 points, or 1.28 per cent, at 5,038.5 points. \n* The broader All Ordinaries index was down 61.2 points, or 1.19 per cent, at 5,069.6 points. \n* The December share price index futures contract was down 76 points at 5,020 points, with 13,497 contracts traded. \n* National turnover was 296.9 million securities worth $649.8 million. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T04:06:51.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
