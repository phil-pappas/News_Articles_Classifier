Just look at the announcements that two huge franchises, “Fast & Furious” and “Men in Black,” will go on with at least three more movies -- without one of their key stars.\nThe latest “Fast & Furious” installment, “Furious 7,” had to be finished without leading actor Paul Walker after his death in a fiery car crash in 2013 . “Furious 7” raked in a whopping $1.5 billion in box-office sales worldwide -- which led to widespread expectations that the show would continue to go on without Walker.\nThere have been rumors that no one wants to direct the next Furious movies , but the franchise’s other leading star and producer Vin Diesel announced on his Facebook page : “I promised the studio I would deliver one last Trilogy to end the saga. I will announce the directors on my next post...” So stay tuned for that.\nColumbia Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in 2012’s “MIB 3,” which had the worst box-office take in the series. Meanwhile, the producers of the “Men in Black” franchise told the Hollywood Reporter that the series would be “reinvented as a trilogy,” but “most likely” without star Will Smith.\nHollywood’s reliance on sequels and pre-existing intellectual property may be at an all-time high, which some analysts think spells trouble for the industry’s profitability .\nBut you can’t blame the “Fast & Furious” producers for wanting to extend what has been a furious and furious-er acceleration in box-office take. The last three movies in the series were all blockbusters, each seeing more ticket sales than the last. “Furious 7,” perhaps benefiting from fans’ desire to see how the film would handle Walker’s death, saw a 43% increase in domestic box-office gross (adjusted for ticket price inflation) from the sixth installment in the series:\nFilm Box office gross (adjusted for ticket price inflation) Date Furious 7 $342,063,400 April 2015 Fast & Furious 6 $238,964,700 May 2013 Fast Five $218,458,400 April 2011 Fast and Furious $181,196,300 April 2009 The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (did not star Vin Diesel or Paul Walker) $80,075,700 June 2006 2 Fast 2 Furious (did not star Vin Diesel) $176,920,300 June 2003 The Fast and the Furious $214,247,300 June 2001 Source: Box Office Mojo While “Furious” shows just how powerful a franchise can be, “Men in Black” hasn’t seen the same growth -- which may underscore the profitability risks of a franchise-dominated Hollywood that analysts fear. In fact, every movie in the series saw less box-office take than the previous:\nFilm Box office gross (adjusted for ticket price inflation) Date MIB 3 $184,973,500 May 2012 Men in Black II $274,976,500 July 2002 Men in Black $458,233,900 July 1997 Source: Box Office Mojo Though “MIB 3” was no box-office laggard -- it grossed over $624 million world-wide -- its domestic performance compared to the previous films in the series speaks volumes.\nHowever the series winds up being “reinvented” -- in the same story line that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones populated, or a different universe entirely -- ticket sales indicate it’s in need of a refresh, but whether that task will be easier to accomplish with or without Will Smith is up for debate.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel/photos/a.101465923312.101581.89562268312/10153751943423313/?type=3&theater", "http://www.geek.com/news/vin-diesel-announces-fast-and-furious-8-9-and-10-1635156/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/walter-parkes-laurie-macdonald-new-826142", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/men-in-black-producers-reboot-will-smith"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:49:42.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
