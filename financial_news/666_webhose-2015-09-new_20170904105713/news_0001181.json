Photo: Jesse Marlow\nClients of collapsed stockbroker BBY will receive detailed information on their position early next week, allowing them to decide whether they want to participate in legal proceedings ahead of a further NSW Supreme Court hearing in October.\nJudge Paul Brereton on Friday ordered BBY's liquidator, KPMG, to make further but minor amendments to an explanatory memorandum for clients ahead of it being resubmitted to him and widely distributed early next week. A spate of other documents and affidavits are also to be made available via KPMG's website.\nJustice Brereton expressed discontent at the way the circular had been redrafted, asking for it to be further simplified so that a layperson would properly understand their position.\n\"I think it still remains difficult for a layperson to understand all of this,\" he said. \"I have become quite frustrated with the process.\"\nAdvertisement Stockbroking and advisory firm BBY collapsed in May after a number of run-ins with regulators over its capital requirements and failing to repay an intraday loan to St George Bank. The company was majority-owned by BBY executive chairman Glenn Rosewall and his father, tennis great Ken Rosewall.\nThe firm's demise sent shockwaves through the industry. Exacerbating the matter, KPMG found that clients faced a combined shortfall in their accounts of $16 million.\nJustice Brereton also noted that KPMG had made minor revisions to the range of outcomes clients might expect in their attempts to retrieve funds. He outlined an anticipated range of 35¢ to 70¢ in the dollar.\nThe revision took into account additional client entitlements relating to cheques to clients that had been issued by BBY but not presented at the date of administration. The prior estimated range was 37¢ to 73¢ in the dollar.\nThe range of outcomes take into account various scenarios such as whether client funds across different product areas are pooled, receipt of funds held by counterparties, and the impact of post-appointment deposits into and out of accounts by receivers PPB Advisory. About $3.4 million has already been received from the ASX and placed in a separate liquidator trust account.\nThe numbers have caused friction across different client groups, including equities, exchange-traded options, futures and foreign exchange. While pooling of the entire client funds means all parties would likely receive the same proportional amounts, outcomes would be much more varied and more favourable for equities clients if pooling does not occur.\nDaryl Williams, QC, for the equities and exchange-traded-options clients, underscored the point that clients were not creditors of BBY but beneficiaries of a trust. The hearing will resume on October 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:08:13.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
