Photo:\nHigher share trading volumes helped the country's biggest online broking firm, CommSec, deliver a $77 million profit and solid revenue growth last financial year.\nRebounding from a loss in the previous year caused by one-off factors, the Commonwealth Bank's broking arm reported revenue was up 6 per cent, to $759.7 million, in the year to June.\nIts bottom line result was a net profit of $77 million, according to accounts lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nThis compared with a loss of $37.3 million in 2014, which was caused by the company recognising impairment losses from investments in subsidiaries.\nAdvertisement With brokers benefiting from better market conditions, CommSec's brokerage revenue rose 12 per cent to $139.4 million.\nBy far its biggest source of revenue is management fees paid from its parent company, CBA, which were worth $570.9 million.\nExpenses up CommSec's total expenses rose 7.5 per cent, but this had little impact on the bottom line result because, unlike last year, there were not hefty impairment losses booked.\nIt recognised $122,000 in bad-debt expenses, compared with the previous year when it recovered $303,000 in bad debts.\nIt did not pay a dividend to CBA during the financial year.\nThe lift in profit came in a year of high volatility on the local sharemarket, which reached a seven-year high in April, only to fall sharply amid concerns about slowing in China and the prospect of interest rates being hiked in the United States.\nWhile revenue was up, profits are still lower than two years ago, underlining the tougher environment for brokers since the global financial crisis.\nCommSec is by far the biggest online stockbroker in the country, with a market share of 44 per cent, says according to research firm Investment Trends.\nCompetition growing But there is growing competition in online broking, as rivals eye a bigger piece of the market serving small investors, including the near $600 billion held by self-managed superannuation funds,\nANZ's E-Trade is second largest with 14 per cent, followed by Nabtrade with 10 per cent, and Westpac Online Investing, which has 9 per cent of the market.\nIn recent years several banks have overhauled their online trading platforms to allow easier access to the sharemarket for inexperienced investors and to increase access to international shares.\nAside from the banks, specialised stockbrokers such as Bell Financial Group have also invested in online share trading businesses to capture a slice of the growing retail share investor market.\nAt Bell's half-year financial results last month, when it delivered a net profit of $5.7 million, managing director Alastair Provan said its majority-owned online trading arm, Bell Direct, was profitable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:25:16.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
