Andrew Meares by Fleur Anderson Misa Han Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer says the Turnbull government will treat Australians as intelligent people who understand the complexities in restoring fairness to the tax system but does not want to undermine their confidence in the superannuation system through constant change.\nWhile Ms O'Dwyer echoed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying various options should not be ruled in or out in the push for tax reform, a senior Treasury official confirmed the Turnbull government was looking at the tax breaks on capital gains and superannuation .\n\"I'm not going to be draw into specifics in the portfolio at the moment, what we need to do first to make sure Australians understand that their superannuation is their savings for their retirement future,\" Ms O'Dwyer told the AFR Weekend .\nPaul Tilley, head of the personal and retirement income division, told a parliamentary inquiry into home ownership on Friday that Treasury had spent a lot of time looking at capital gains tax exemptions on investment properties.\n\"The new Prime Minister and new Treasurer have indicated they're areas, together with superannuation, that we'll look at,\" Mr Tilley said.\nMr Tilley said the focus of Treasury thinking on tax and investment properties, and the extent to which they might drive property prices, was on the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount. He said there was no consideration of taxing the family home.\n\"We take our steer from the government on things like this and we're not looking at direct, commonwealth-level taxation of the family home,\" he said.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison told the Financial Review on Wednesday he will push the case for tax reform including incentives to encourage retirees to unlock and spend the billions of dollars locked up in their homes and other assets.\n Ms O'Dwyer said Australians were intelligent people who could follow complex debates but it was politicians' job to be persuasive in building a case for reform and provide the necessary transition to ease the introduction of difficult changes.\nShe said the government would \"very carefully, very methodically\" go through the areas of \"unfairness\" in taxation policy so that if change was needed, the government could build a compelling economic case and take into account the fact people make long-term investment decisions based on long-held tax policies.\nKeen to avoid unnecessary stress \"It needs to be well understood, you have to bring people with you on the journey and if you are going to make change to long-term policy settings, you need to be able to make that change with a period of transition because there are people who have made decisions on the basis of long-term policy setting,\" she said.\nHowever Ms O'Dwyer said a Turnbull government was keen to avoid the anxiety caused by changes to people's retirement nest eggs under Labor superannuation changes.\n\"The previous Labor government super changes resulted in a very real anxiety that the super system was not seen to be stable because of the constant changes to it,\" Ms O'Dwyer said.\n\"We need to give people confidence that superannuation is their savings for their future.\"\n\"We're not in the position today in any of these areas to be ruling things in or out but we are very conscious of the undermining of confidence that occurred under that previous government.\"\nThere's an emerging consensus from senior government ministers that the tax reform push has moved from an argument among economic \"elites\" to retail politics and the political sales pitch for economic reform is about to begin.\nDavid Pearl, a senior Treasury official on a 12-month secondment to PwC as part of Treasury's growing engagement with the private sector, has warned of a \"trust deficit\" in the public's confidence in whether governments can introduce difficult changes properly.\n\"It gets back to politicians leading the debate, not being led by it,\" Mr Pearl said.\n\"And not letting highly confusing technical analysis to confuse the real issue which is the link between tax reform and the economy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:08:44.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
