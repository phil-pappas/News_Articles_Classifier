This is a new job at the bank. \nWhile credit trading market share is difficult to define accurately, Daiwa does not have a large market share of the primary sterling market, ranking outside the top 25 bookrunners for the first half of this year, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) Eikon data. \nHibbard will report to Paul Osborn, who heads the bank's fixed income trading team. \nBefore joining Daiwa, Hibbard was head of sterling credit trading at Lloyds Bank. He also spent 20 years at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) .
