The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -2.19% rose less than half of a basis point to 0.720%. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.\nThe Beige Book, a compilation of economic anecdotes from the central bank’s individual districts, offered a mixed bag for policy makers ahead of a Sept. 16-17 meeting of Fed policy makers.\nEarlier, investors digested a rise of 190,000 in August private-sector payrolls reported by Automatic Data Processing Inc. and a large upward revision to second-quarter productivity data.\nBond traders were likely taking cues instead from the U.S. stock market, which bounced back from steep losses scored on Tuesday as China market turmoil subsided.\nThere is a “very strong correlation between equity markets and the front end of the U.S. rate curve,” wrote Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale. “The leader, on a daily basis, is the equity market — any weakness in equities is immediately reflected in speculation that the Fed’s rate-hike liftoff will be delayed yet again,” driving yields lower as debt prices rise.\nEconomists surveyed by MarketWatch forecast August nonfarm payrolls to rise 213,000 after an increase of 215,000 in July. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 5.2% from 5.3%.
