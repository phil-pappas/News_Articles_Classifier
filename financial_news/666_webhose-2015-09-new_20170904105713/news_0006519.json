Understanding the challenges in the lives of people in crisis, DeNeve Insurance is helping Claudia to drive the necessary resources for getting back on her feet.\nHouston, TX (PRWEB) September 24, 2015\nWith its agency in Houston, TX, DeNeve Insurance Agency celebrates the beginning of a new charity campaign as part of its ongoing Community Program, now raising funds to help a local woman begin again. A devastating flood left Claudia with virtually nothing. Her home is now an unsafe shell, unable to house her at night. Her possessions are gone. In the spirit of neighbors helping neighbors in times of crisis, the agency hopes that those with compassionate hearts will support a new beginning for Claudia by joining the agency’s efforts and contributing through the designated donations page at https://www.crowdrise.com/givingclaudiaanewbeg/fundraiser/deneveagency .\n“We were truly touched by Claudia’s untenable situation,” attested Wes DeNeve, the agency’s principal, who has helped touch the lives of so many other people in the community. “Today it’s Claudia’s crisis. Tomorrow it could be one of our own. Our community is so great about rallying around those in need, and we wanted to help in whatever way possible.”\nThe agency has set a goal of $500, which will assist Claudia in paying her current expenses and put her on the road to recouping her losses. To help achieve their goal, the agency’s network of customers, business partners, friends, family and staff are invited to actively participate not only contributing financially, but also by helping spread the word to others in their own circles of influence.\nDeNeve Insurance Agency continues to employ its own resources to ensure the success of their Community Program. The current campaign is being promoted through the agency’s social media channels, email and text message communications, as well as through their monthly magazine, delivered to thousands of households in the greater Houston area. Our Hometown magazine reserves a full page to feature the current campaign, including all of its details. The electronic Flipbook version of the current issue may be accessed here: http://www.deneveinsurance.com/Our-Hometown-Magazine_46 .\nThe donations page at https://www.crowdrise.com/givingclaudiaanewbeg/fundraiser/deneveagency is currently active for anyone who wishes to contribute to this worthy cause. The agency will acknowledge all of those who donate a minimum of $5 in their monthly magazine.\nDeNeve Insurance Agency will continue to work with individuals and nonprofits in the area to identify new worthwhile opportunities to support the community, every 30-90 days. Through the agency’s website, any member of the community may also submit information on families, persons or groups who could use some help: http://www.deneveinsurance.com/Add-Community-Cause_45 . Entries are diligently reviewed, and the selected worthy causes are properly contacted by a representative of DeNeve Insurance’s Community Program.
