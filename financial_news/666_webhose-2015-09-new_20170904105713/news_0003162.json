Graham Jepson by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell One of the few investments that has been worse than buying Chinese equities in recent times is beleaguered local taxi outfit Cabcharge.\nCuts to surcharges on card payments for taxi fares and competition from the likes of Ingogo, goCatch , and ride sharing service Uber are not exactly tailwinds for the company.\nHundreds of cabbies in Sydney and Melbourne held rallies on Thursday urging the government to crack down on Uber, a sure sign the service is thriving.\nInvestors appear to think that Cabcharge's Australian taxi operations are on the way out sooner rather than later.\nThe book value of Cabcharge's investments, which is primarily made up by the CDC busses business, is $2.43 a share.\nConsensus earnings per share estimates for Cabcharge in 2015-16, excluding investments, ranges from 25 cents to 30 cents.\nCabcharge shares closed at $2.90 on Thursday, down 46 per cent in the past 12 months.\nThat suggests the market is betting all the taxi-related businesses will be dead in the next two to three years.\n Some fund managers might feel there are a few more puffs left even if the cab business is a cigar butt.\nA potential curve-ball is whether joint venture partner ComfortDelGro, which owns 9.6 per cent of Cabcharge, has any interest in taking out all or part of the company.\nThe Singapore-listed transport group has stated it is interested in acquiring offshore.\nAside from the tough business conditions, new Cabcharge chairman Russell Balding's decision to take an office and a personal assistant could cause some grumbles in the market.\nLate founder and long-time executive chairman Reg Kermode had a notorious disregard for governance and other shareholder concerns.\nInvestors no doubt hoped the Kermode culture vanished with the new chair and Balding's perks send the wrong signal.\nThis is one of the few companies that has received three strikes against its remuneration report.\nMajor shareholders Lazard and Aberdeen showed their displeasure late last year by refusing to back Rodney Gilmour's appointment to the board, prompting Gilmour's resignation before a humiliating vote at the AGM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:06:08.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
