Photo: Nicholas Rider\nANZ Bank has been hit hardest by the plunge in major bank share prices this year, as investors fret over its exposure to a slowing China.\nAfter hitting a record high of $37.25 in April, they were trading almost 26 per cent below this on Wednesday, while the other major banks were 22 to 23 per cent below their 2015 peaks.\nWhenever there is such a sharp change in the share price of a business as profitable as a big four bank, it raises questions about whether the market has overreacted.\nThis is what some analysts are arguing about ANZ Bank, as the lender also tries to quell fears about how it would be affected by a downturn in China.\nAdvertisement Figures from Deutsche Bank analyst Andrew Triggs show all the banks, especially ANZ, are now trading below their historical average by one key valuation measure: the price-earnings ratio.\nDeeper discount Mr Triggs said that over the past five years, the major banks had traded with a price-earnings ratio that was a 20 per cent discount to industrial stocks (not including the banks or miners). Now, however, this discount was deeper, at about 25 per cent.\nANZ's discount to its five-year average on this metric was the deepest of the big four, said Mr Triggs, who has a \"buy\" rating on ANZ.\nChief executive Mike Smith has also sought to dampen concerns about the risks to the bank from slowing in Asia, this week saying it could wind back its exposure to China quickly if needed .\nAnother reason why ANZ shares have been sold off more sharply than others is because it revealed the largest increase in its bad debt charges in the latest round of bank profit results.\nANZ increased its provisions for bad debts to $366 million, up 32 per cent compared with the previous three-month period, mainly because of weakness in mining and agribusiness lending.\nThis has been enough to make many investors remain cautious towards the bank, even when its stock is discounted.\nA recent note from Macquarie's Brendan Carrig, who is \"neutral\" on ANZ, argued there was value emerging in the banks after the recent share price plunge but reminded investors about ANZ's credit quality and Asian loan book.\n\"Even at current levels, we remain cautious on ANZ due to their greater exposure to a slowing Asia and risks around asset quality,\" Mr Carrig said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:30:46.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
