items lying right in front of your own eyes could make you a quick buck.\nBuying and selling goods on popular websites including Gumtree are easy ways to snare bargains or make yourself some handy cash.\nJust ask do-it-yourself specialist Natasha Dickins who found a broken classic Swedish designer chair on the site for $25.\nAfter she gave it a little spruce it’s since been valued at $4000.\nMORE: How to build a budget\nLOOK AROUND\nDickins says every Australian garage has a chair or piece of furniture in it that’s unloved and of some value.\nNew research by Gumtree showed 89 per cent of the population have unwanted items lying around the house.\nSo start by hunting around your home and garage and see if there’s any unwanted items that you think someone else might pay some money for.\n“It’s just a matter of keeping an eye out, if you like it someone else would like it,’’ Dickins says.\n“There’s also an opportunity to look around your house and give it a clean out.”\nThe data showed 61 per cent of respondents are open to the idea of selling second-hand goods online to make money to help with costs such as saving for a house deposit.\nPHOTOGRAPHS\nCelebrity second-hand expert Adam McDonald says having the best photographs online as possible is critical for both buyers and sellers.\nHe also says having the more photos the better and urges users to be honest in what they show.\nIf a piece of furniture has any nips and tucks on it be transparent and show this or otherwise it could result in problems down the track.\nBE REALISTIC\nLook online and see what prices the same or similar items are selling for.\nSet a price point that you think people would be prepared to pay, don’t be greedy as you’re probably just wasting your time.\nMcDonald says millions of items are posted online every week so if you don’t find what you are looking for in the first instance, be patient.\nFor those who are buying set a price limit and don’t go over it.\nThis reporter is
