Global Maritime Investments Cyprus Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection Sept. 15 and said it would wind down its business.\nFollowing the bankruptcy announcement, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the shipper’s shares will be delisted from the bourse’s first section on Oct. 30.\nTrading of the company’s shares was halted Tuesday. But shares of Mitsui O.S.K . 9104 -7.40 % Lines, which holds a 21.8% stake in the company as of March 31, were hit hard by the news, and are currently down 8% to ¥286.\nThe company also filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Tuesday in New York under chapter 15, the section of the bankruptcy code dealing with international insolvencies. Shipping companies restructuring overseas often file for chapter 15 to protect their vessels and other assets in the U.S. from being seized by creditors.\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:19:36.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
