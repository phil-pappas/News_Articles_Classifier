As Apple AAPL, -0.27% gears up for this year’s product event, attention has turned to potential products such as a new Apple TV.\nAlso read: What to expect at Apple event: iPhone 6S, Siri-infused Apple TV\nHere’s a quick look at where Apple Pay is after its first year on the market.\nApple wasn't the first to market with its mobile payment system, but it did light a fire under its competitors, taking full advantage of near-field communication technology and putting an emphasis on the system’s tokenization and Touch ID security. That system uses a chip in the phone called the secure element to store financial information and push out a one-time 16-digit code during transactions.\nSee also: Apple, Google, eBay step up mobile payments arms race\nWhile Apple hasn't disclosed how many users are using Apple Pay, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company works with Visa Inc. V, -0.04% MasterCard Inc. MA, -1.82% and American Express Co. AXP, +0.05% credit and debit cards, and has partnerships with more than 450 banks in the U.S.\nMore than 100 U.S. stores and apps accept Apple Pay, including Nike Inc. NKE, -0.75% Whole Foods Market Inc. WFM, +0.57% Uber and Pinterest, with Regal Cinemas Corp. RGC, -2.23% Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.’s DNKN, -1.82% Baskin Robbins and Dunkin’ Donuts and about 25 other merchants still to come.\nMore than 700 colleges and universities, including Auburn University, the University of Kentucky and the University of California Irvine will begin accepting Apple Pay this fall.\nIn July, Apple took Apple Pay overseas, launching in the U.K. with eight banks, including one of the largest retail banks, HSBC Holding PLC HSBA, +2.92% which has around 16 million U.K. customers. Apple paired with more than 250,000 retail locations and made its payment system available to the London transit system.\nThe toughest challenge for Apple Pay and other systems is mainstream adoption by consumers and smaller merchants. Industry experts expect that to pick up in October, when fraud liability shifts from banks to retailers, pressuring them to upgrade to more modern terminals with NFC and EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) chip capabilities.\nChief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company’s most recent earnings call that he expects Square’s new NFC-capable reader will boost Apple Pay’s reach to small- and midsize businesses.\n“It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day, from your corner coffee shop to your local farmers’ market, bolstering the 80,000 small- and medium-size businesses we’re already adding every month,” Cook said on the call. “We’re on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over 1.5 million U.S. locations by the end of 2015.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:22:18.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
