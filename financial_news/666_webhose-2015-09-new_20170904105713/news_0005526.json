But when interest payments move off the bottom you might find you're struggling to stay afloat. Louise Kennerley by Sally Patten No wonder wealthy Australians talk about property prices more than just about anything else.\nThey are more exposed to property prices than just about anybody else.\nA survey by management consultant Capgemini shows that high net worth Australians, defined as investors who have more than $US1 million in assets outside the family home, have a much higher propensity to invest in property than their global counterparts. Property accounts for 30.8 per cent of wealthy Australians' portfolios, against just 21.4 per cent for wealthy Asian investors. Globally, high net worth individuals invest just 18.2 per cent of their portfolios in property.\n\"Wealthy Australians think that property will give them the maximum return on investment,\" says Dipak Sahoo, director of financial services at Capgemini Australia. \"In the rest of Asia, real estate does not rank as highly because property prices have cooled off,\" he says.\nSomewhat counter intuitively, wealthy Australians' exposure to shares is lower than the global average. Despite the ongoing criticism that self-managed superannuation funds invest too much in equities, local high net worth individuals have 26.5 per cent of their portfolios invested in shares, against 27.9 per cent for wealthy investors globally.\nThat said, the message from professionals that Australians need to diversify their portfolios away from the local market appears to be taking effect.\nSahoo says that despite the dramatic fall in the Australian dollar over the past year, the proportion of wealthy investors' share portfolios that is invested offshore rose to 30.7 per cent in 2015 from 30.4 per cent in 2014.\nGiven Australians' penchant for property, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures will come as some relief. The ABS said on Tuesday that the weighted average of the eight Australian capital city property prices soared 9.8 per cent in the three months to June, compared to a year earlier. House prices in Sydney surged 18.9 per cent in the June quarter , the fastest rate on record in the current series.\n The Capgemini survey showed that wealthy Australians' top three concerns were whether they would have enough cash to last their lifetime, whether they could afford to maintain their lifestyle in retirement and the rising cost of healthcare.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/property_loveaffair_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-23T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:10:43.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
