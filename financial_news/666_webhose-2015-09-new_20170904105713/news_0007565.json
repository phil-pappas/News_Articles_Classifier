PUBLISHED: 16:09, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:57, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 GETTY Santander is changing 123 bank accounts and credit cards \nAbout 3.6million customers signed up for the 123 bank account will see their monthly charge rise from £3 to £5, costing a total £60 a year.The fee on the popular 123 credit card is also rising from £2 to £3 a month for both new and existing customers. The changes will take effect on January 11 2016. \nBefore that, cashback payments for new customers are being capped on the card. Money back is earned at a rate of 3 per cent for petrol and rail spending, 2 per cent on department store purchases and 1 per cent on supermarket spending. But from September 16 new customers will have cashback spend on travel capped at £100, department stores at £150 and supermarketers at £300. Santander blamed the price rises on the increased cost of running a bank in Britain. In a small piece of good news, foreign exchange fees on the 123 credit card are being reduced to 0 per cent, from 2.95 per cent, on January 11 for existing customers, and September 16 for new users. The amount of cashback earned with the 123 current account is to stay the same at 1 per cent on Santander mortgages, council tax and water rates; 2 per cent on energy bills; and 3 per cent on TV, broadband and phone bills.The other popular benefit of the account - interest paid at a rate of 3 per cent on cash up to £20,000 - remains intact.

Savers using the 123 account to get a return on large cash balances could be best staying put, but those with smaller sums may get a better deal elsewhere.Andrew Hagger, savings expert at Moneycomms, said: \"The increased fee takes some of the shine off this deal, particularly for those customers with smaller credit balances.\"Someone with the maximum £20,000 eligible credit balance earning 3 per cent will still earn £600 per year (pre tax) in credit interest and compared to savings accounts is still getting a good deal despite the extra £36 in annual charges from January.\"\"For those with smaller balances it could be more of a game changer – if you have a £3,000 balance you’ll earn £90 per year pre tax - £72 after 20 per cent tax, but will be paying out £60 in fees – thus giving you just £1 per month benefit.\"For those with a smaller savings balance, TSB's 555 is an attractive option.The account pays 5 per cent on balances up to £2,000 and customers have access to a regular saving account also paying 5 per cent on monthly sums up to £250 a month. Added with cashback on contactless debit card spending, and customers can earn up to £238 a year.
