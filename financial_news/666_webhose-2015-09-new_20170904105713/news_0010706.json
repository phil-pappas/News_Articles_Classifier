We did get a little bounce, but two problems today are keeping buyers sidelined. \nThe first problem is that the payroll numbers did little to clarify the interest rate situation. The chances of a September rate hike actually ticked up -- but remain quite muddled. No one seems to know for sure how much the Fed will take into account economic weakness around the world. \nThat brings up the second problem, which is the upcoming long weekend. China markets will reopen on Sunday night and there will be two days of trading there before we reopen on Tuesday morning. The risk of more ugly action in China is very high and that is going to keep some buyers in cash today. \nDespite the sea of red out there, I am seeing some relative strength in biotechnology names such as bluebird bio , KaloBios Pharmaceuticals , Trevena and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals . I'm nibbling at a few things and feeling quite optimistic about the potential buys that are starting to set up. It's a matter of vigilance and patience at this point. If you are positioned with a high level of cash then you should be feeling pretty good.
