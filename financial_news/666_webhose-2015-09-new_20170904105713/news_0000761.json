As the white paper explains, a large majority of businesses are still using paper invoices and checks, but this is beginning to change as more companies realize the increased risk of paper processes; in fact, recent studies show that 85% of fraud cases are related to paper checks. The document further explains that paper-based processes increase the time and costs of invoicing, and often delay payment considering all of the steps the customer has to take to receive the invoice, submit it for approval, create the check, and send it back. The process can take even longer if there is a question or dispute related to the invoice.\n“With electronic invoicing and payment processes in place, all of those barriers are removed to eliminate paper, cut costs, reduce labor, and help businesses get paid faster,” explained Bill Henslee, CEO of e2b teknologies. “We authored this white paper not only to highlight the commonly recognized benefits of automation, but to answer the questions we are asked most frequently by companies who want to learn more about moving to electronic invoicing and payment processing.”\nIn addition to the benefits of online bill presentment and payment, the white paper covers other crucial topics such as:\nUnderstanding PCI Compliance Underwriting & Rate Quote: s How the credit card payment process works Working with ISO/MSP Merchant Service Provider Value of Customer-Self Service for B2B Invoice Payments More The white paper is available here for complimentary download with additional information available at http://www.anytimecollect.com or by calling 440-352-4700.\nAbout Anytime Collect\nAnytime Collect (anytimecollect.com), published by e2b teknologies, is a leading cloud-based accounts receivables management system integrated to leading ERP accounting systems.
