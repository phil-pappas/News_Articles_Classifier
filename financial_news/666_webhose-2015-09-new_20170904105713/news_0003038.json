It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) wants to find new ways to deliver gas to Europe bypassing its neighbour. \nGazprom, E.ON, BASF/Wintershall , OMV (Amsterdam: OM6.AS - news ) , ENGIE (Other OTC: ENGIY - news ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) formed the new consortium for the project, a spokesman for the consortium said on Friday. \nGazprom is fighting to defend market share in Europe in the face of oversupplied gas markets, betting on rising long-term demand as Europe's indigenous gas sources are declining. \nLed by Gazprom, which has put the cost of the plan at up to 9.9 billion euros ($11 billion) and maybe less due to savings, the group is to build a third and fourth pipeline to transport up to 55 billion additional cubic meters of gas a year. \nIt would double the capacity of lines 1 and 2, which take the same route. The new pipelines are due to start transporting gas by the end of 2019.
