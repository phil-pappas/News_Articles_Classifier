The RBI has already eased the policy rate by 75 bps so far this year.\nBut another rate cut may depend on how food prices impact consumer inflation starting in September, given India could be facing its driest year since 2009 as monsoon rains have fallen below their long-term average.\nA favourable base effect seen in the previous two months is also expected to wane.\nThe RBI is also likely to err on the side of caution as US interest rates are expected to rise by the end of this year for the first time since 2006, potentially putting pressure on emerging market currencies, including the rupee.\nRBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is expected to express that cautiousness as he looks to manage expectations, and counterbalance the calls for aggressive easing from government officials and corporate executives.\n\"I expect the RBI to cut the repo rate and sound a cautionary tone on the deficient monsoon's impact on food prices and the Fed,\" Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, said.\nExpectations for a rate cut surged after the release of data showing consumer inflation at a record low of 3.66% in August. Inflation looks set to undershoot the government's projection of 6% inflation by January 2016.\nThe economy expanded at a slower-than-expected annualised rate of 7% in the April-June quarter. That is faster than China, but well below the government's target of 8 to 8.5% for the year ending in March.\nThe stuttering recovery in the growth rate lies behind the calls for the central bank to lower interest rates, but the RBI is worried about the potential for inflation to flare up again.\nRajan this month pointed out that without a favourable base effect, August inflation would have been around \"mid-5%.\"\nLooking ahead, analysts expect Rajan to set a new target to bring consumer inflation down to 5% by January 2017, as part of his longer-term objective to keep inflation at around 4%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:18:08.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
