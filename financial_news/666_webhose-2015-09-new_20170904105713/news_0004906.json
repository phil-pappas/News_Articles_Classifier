Buyers and sellers this spring will need to work harder. \"You need to be considered,\" says Ken Jacobs of Christie's International. \"Think carefully about price. There are no stock answers.\"\nOne of Australia's best-known agents, Jacobs was reportedly behind the recent sale of James Packer's Vaucluse mansion to a Chinese businessman – it changed hands for a record-breaking $70 million. This measured piece of advice from such an experienced and successful agent provides us with the perfect template in an environment where there simply aren't any bargains left – just good assets at fair prices, if and wherever you can find them.\nLow interest rates and benign economic conditions have propelled prices in some areas to giddy heights, led by Sydney where the median house price breached the magic million-dollar barrier in July. Median prices in Melbourne haven't quite reached seven-figure status, but to describe conditions as buoyant wouldn't adequately capture the frenzied bidding seen at the auction capital every weekend either.\nThe city-wide yardsticks use for measurement are more muted elsewhere, with Brisbane eking out some mid-range single-digit growth, while the remaining city centres are producing a mixed range of growth. However, median metropolitan prices are a blunt instrument and don't accurately reveal the intense activity taking place in the most sought-after suburbs in every state. That is why we've produced this helpful guide to the spring property market, which lists suburbs to target in every major centre around the country. You will also find tips for buyers and sellers, as well as a series of snapshots that tell you what to expect when it comes to financing.\nThe top 10 lists are provided by Australian Property Monitors (APM), which is owned by Fairfax Media. These lists comprise an indispensable set of data for any investor. With rising prices compressing yields in many markets, investors need to prioritise long-term capital growth above all else. Luckily for us, APM has come to the rescue and done all the hard work.\nTricks for selling your property and deal-breakers\nAdvertise effectively; how to get your reserve right\nInvestor loans are tightening; do you need bridging finance?\n The long-term trend methodology is arrived at by calculating the average annual percentage change of every suburb in the area over 10 years. The largest and smallest percentage changes are discarded in order to smooth the averages. Suburbs that do not produce enough sales to be statistically reliable over the period have been removed from the analysis. After much discussion between APM and the team at Smart Investor , we feel this is the best risk-adjusted method for approaching the current market. As in any other asset class, bull markets don't last forever. By concentrating on the regions that have exhibited strong growth and holding for the long term you are less likely to be wrong-footed by a sudden change in sentiment – however unlikely that might seem now.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/spring_property_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:09:00.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
