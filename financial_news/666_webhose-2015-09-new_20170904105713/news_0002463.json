Picture: Norm Oorloff Source: News Corp Australia\nPram-pushing parents and a woman in a wheelchair have been forced to dangerously exit the building on to a road, as the fence completely blocks access to the main entrance.\nOccupants can only get in and out of the building via an underground carpark or a door off a back lane, which does not have a footpath.\nThe council has said the fence was not approved and is seeking legal opinion to find a “common sense outcome”.\nMr Smith claimed Marne Properties had previously told residents it would bring the fence down if they bought the land leading to the property’s entrance, which they have used for 10 years.\nFort Knox: residents have been asked to fork out more than $800,000 just to get in their front doors. Picture: Norm Oorloff Source: News Corp Australia\nOccupants in the Bradford Yarra Falls Austral Silk (BYFAS) building were informed of the price hike on Friday.\nMr Smith said he wanted the council to force Marne Properties to bring the fence down.\nHe said it was unlikely residents and the developer would be able to broker an agreement.\n“Our best hope is if the council steps in because without the council it is going to be extremely difficult,” Mr Smith said.\nMarne Properties has been contacted for comment.\nA spokesman for the building company LU Simon has told Melbourne Leader previously the fence was erected within the property boundary and was required by the building and planning permits.\nPlanning Minister, state Richmond Labor MP Richard Wynne said he hoped common sense would prevail.\nMr Wynne said the council could initiate enforcement action if it believed the fence was illegal.\nOriginally published as $850,000 to remove a fence?
