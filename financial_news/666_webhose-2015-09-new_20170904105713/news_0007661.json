Our portal, ‘waughglobal.com’ will help them find the right property in a transparent and hassle free manner,” company’s Chairman Steve Waugh told PTI here today.\nThe company currently has 91 properties listed on its portal of 10 developers across seven cities — Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata.\nWaugh Global has partnered with leading developers like the Lodha Group, Godrej, Shapoorji, K Raheja, Kalpataru, Kolte Patil and Sobha Developers among others.\nExplaining the business model, MD Dean Honan said the focus of the portal will not only be limited to listing properties but also to offer a comprehensive range of additional services.\nServices like property management and rental solutions, land advisory services, NRI qualification and activation services, as well as Australian property sales and market entry will also be provided.\n“Currently there are thousands of property portals in India. We want to emerge as the global leader in this segment by catering to the demands of NRIs who are keenly looking at this market as an investment destination. We will not only list properties but also provide services that will lessen the hassles of buyers,” Honan said.\nHe further said the company will initially focus on the seven markets and will slowly penetrate into other regions.\n“Currently our focus will be on these seven markets and we will try to crack the best deals. Gradually we will bring some more developers on our board,” he said.\nHe added, “We will charge a certain percentage of the transaction from both the developer as well as the buyer if they asks for specialised services.”\nAsked if the company is looking at raising funds for spreading its presence, Honan said, “We are a self-funded firm and we do not need funds now.”\n 09, 2015 9:45 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:49:45.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
