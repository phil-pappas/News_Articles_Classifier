The Wall Street Journal reports that Google will let marketers target ads to specific people using their email addresses . In other words, if your favorite shoe company knows your email address, it can use that to target you with ads when you use Google’s search engine, Gmail or YouTube. The approach, plans for which were first reported by The Journal in April , comes alongside another program to be called “Similar Audiences,” which will allow marketers to target ads to people who “look alike” to their existing customers. A similar feature has been popular among advertisers on Facebook.\nMARCH OF THE MACHINES : Even with all the concerns about shady practices in the online ad marketplace -- fraud and smoke and mirrors -- automated ad buying continues to grow , CMO Today reports. IPG-owned Magna Global predicts that the programmatic buying of global display and video ads will leap 49% this year to $14.2 billion. But there’s plenty of evidence that much of that money is going to waste, as “bots” acting as real people dupe the system and questions remain on the extent to which ads are “viewable” on users’ screens. Still, advertisers are drawn to programmatic advertising because it can cut waste elsewhere and help them target niche audiences online.\nTHE GREEN LIGHT : High Times, the must-read magazine for seasoned and budding marijuana enthusiasts alike, is blazing a new trail. The publication is appointing digital media veteran David Kohl , known for helping launch Vevo, as its new chief executive, WSJ reports. Mr. Kohl will be tasked with lighting a fire under the magazine as its raison d’être has its moment in the sun: weed laws are relaxing in some states and advertising revenues are getting so high right now as ever-growing cannabis-related companies pack into the field. “The cannabis industry is a new frontier,” Mr. Kohl told the Journal.\nGIVING IT A GO : Verizon’s new mobile video service go90 has signed a deal with Publicis for a year-long advertising partnership, CMO Today reports. The third-largest advertising group in the world will become the exclusive advertiser on go90 for three months, and the $50 million agreement will place more than 10 of the ad giant’s clients on the service. Early advertising interest is a good thing for Verizon -- and the executives at Verizon-owned AOL tasked with ad sales efforts -- but it still remains to be seen whether go90 will take off among young people who have a ton of more familiar options right now, from Facebook to Vine to Snapchat.\nElsewhere Trevor Noah made his debut as “Daily Show” host but has plenty of room to grow [ TIME ]\nAxel Springer agreed to acquire Business Insider for $343 million [ Bloomberg ]\nMedium has raised $57 million in its second round of funding [ Re/code ]\nLiz Heron, Facebook’s head of news partnerships, is joining the Huffington Post as executive editor [ CMO Today ]\nFox’s “Scream Queens” got a major viewership boost once delayed viewing was factored in [ CMO Today ]\nYahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said commercials make content better and called ad-blocking a mistake [ CMO Today ]\nYahoo said it will push ahead with its Alibaba spinoff even without the explicit blessing of the IRS [ WSJ ]\nVocativ is nearing 100 million Facebook video views per month [ Digiday ]\nThere are 202 ad pages in the Advertising Week guidebook, and other “by the numbers” tidbits [ Digiday ]\nSony has promoted Steve Mosko to chairman of Sony Pictures Television [ The Wrap ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "http://digiday.com/brands/advertisingweek2015-advertising-week-by-the-numbers/", "http://time.com/4053263/daily-show-trevor-noah-debut-recap-review/", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://recode.net/2015/09/28/ev-williams-medium-raises-57-million-for-the-best-stories-and-ideas-on-the-internet/", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-29/axel-springer-agrees-to-buy-business-insider-for-343-million", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://www.thewrap.com/sony-tv-promotes-steve-mosko-to-chairman/"], "published": "2015-09-29T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:11:39.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
