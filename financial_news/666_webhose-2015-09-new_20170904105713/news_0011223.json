Nic Walker Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Environmental activists have lost another legal battle in their bid to overturn approvals for Indian company GVK and Gina Rinehart's $6 billion Alpha coal mine in Central Queensland.\nIn a move which might stop environmental activists from endlessly appealing resource projects, Supreme Court Justice James Douglas ordered Brisbane-based environmental group Coast and Country to pay legal costs for the mining companies.\nThe legal costs are expected to go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nCoast and Country will have 28 days to appeal the decision, which confirmed earlier rulings relating to the granting of environmental approvals for the Alpha mine as well as a Land Court decision that allowed the Queensland government to approve the project with strict conditions.\nWhile Indian energy company Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine has been the flash point for environmental activists in their attempt to stop mining in the Galilee Basin - 500 kilometres from the Queensland coast - they have also been targeting GVK/Hancock's plans for three new mines in the region.\nA spokesman for GVK/Hancock, Josh Euler, welcomed the court ruling saying it was another step closer to being granted water licences and a mining lease for the Alpha project ahead of making the financial investment decision on the project.\nHe said it had been frustrating the project had been held up for two years in the courts by anti-mining activists, rather than land-holders.\n\"It has been a long drawn out process and it has been disappointing how a handful of anti-mining activists have been able to delay thousands of jobs for Queenslanders,\" Mr Euler said.\n \"We welcome today's decision - it really supports the fact that we have achieved every environmental regulatory question asked of us.\n\"It's a great day for Queensland. We can now take the next steps in terms of moving forward with our projects.\"\nMr Euler said the company had invested tens of millions of dollars in addressing concerns about the impact of the project on water resources in the region.\n\"We are extremely confident about what we can do in terms of groundwater to limit our impacts,\" he said.\n\"With the landholders around our mine we have in place make good agreements which hold us legally liable should we impact on groundwater.\"\nCoast & Country, who were represented by the Environmental Defender's Office, was not present at court in Brisbane on Friday.\nAn EDO spokesman defended the appeal, saying the court decision should not detract from the tough restrictions ordered by the Land Court in relation to the project.\n\"This exposed the serious groundwater impacts the project would have on local farmers and it also highlights the overall importance of the legal system in ensuring these major projects are properly scrutinised,\" he said.\nWestern Queensland farmer Bruce Currie, who was involved in the original Land Court case, said he simply didn't have the money to continue the legal challenge against GVK/Hancock Coal.\nHe said his cattle property was between GVK's Alpha and Kevin's Corner projects and he refused to sign the \"make-good\" agreement with the company.\n\"If this mine goes ahead and I lose my water, I lose my business,\" he said. \"The make-good agreement I was given doesn't protect us.\"\nIt comes as the federal government moves to tighten loopholes to stop activists from using litigation to slow down the approvals of major resources projects.\nFederal Environment Minister Greg Hunt introduced legislation to parliament last month to abolish section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act so that people only directly affected by mining projects can challenge the projects in the courts. The amendment is likely to struggle to pass the Senate.\nThe escalation of tensions over resource projects follows a court decision last month which set aside environmental approvals for Adani's Carmichael mine after it was found Mr Hunt did not take into consideration the protection of two species, a skink and an ornamental snake. The court action was raised by the Mackay Conservation Group, funded by the EDO in NSW.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-04T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:05:01.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
