Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Reserve Bank of Australia's chief risk watcher has challenged the focus of property bubble obsessives on credit volumes, suggesting unsustainable bank lending can often lead to a blow up in commercial and business lending ahead of a mortgage collapse.\nLuci Ellis, who heads the central bank's financial stability department said there are strong links between strong upswings in credit and growth in property prices leading to \"subsequent bad events.\"\nHowever, she said it was \"by no means settled\" whether credit surge cause price gains, or the property markets drive the credit rise, or whether either of these is the decisive factor in generating an economic downturn of financial distress.\n\"I've heard it said that paying attention to these correlations is still worthwhile, because you don't have to know what causes a typhoon to know that it is dangerous,\" she said at a housing symposium in Sydney on Tuesday.\n\"But in that situation, there is nothing to stop you from believing that the typhoons are a punishment from the weather gods and that the appropriate policy is a program of sacrifices to placate them.\"\nCause or correlation Dr Ellis conceded that putting aside more capital and insisting on borrowers repaying their debt more rapidly help boost the ability of a financial system to weather storms.\nHowever, as soon as the focus swings to preventative policy - whether typhoons or housing bubbles - \"you should at least have a good theory about the mechanism and some evidence to back it up.\nRelated \"Otherwise, how can you distinguish what is really causal, from what is merely a correlation?,\" she said.\nThe remarks are an important contribution to a growing broader debate about the role of regulators in controling the housing market, with some policy makers and economists labelling curbs on lending or price gains as \"macroprudential tools.\"\nThe term has grown to prominence since the 2008 financial crisis because central banks around the world have been forced to drive official interest rates to record lows as a way of stoking faltering economies and devaluing currencies.\nAt the same time, the use of macroprudential tools have increased because of concerns that low borrowing costs have made many asset markets - chiefly property - too hot.\nAustralia, following analogous actions in countries such as Canada and New Zealand - has resorted to imposing its own tougher capital requirements on major banks to bolster financial stability in a world of ultra-easy monetary policy.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is trying to bring growth in lending to property investors to below 10 per cent.\nInvestor credit has been running slightly above that level since September of last year, and came in at 10.8 per cent in July, according to Reserve Bank figures published last week.\nA 'kind of forgetting' Dr Ellis said in her speech - Property markets and financial stability: what we know so far - that history shows it is possible to forget good credit risk management.\n\"As we get further away from the peak of the crisis, increasingly we will hear points of view questioning what the fuss was all about,\" she said.\nRegulators are also at risk of forgetting how to do good risk management, noting there was a \"kind of forgetting\" at play in the US mortgage market in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis.\nAustralia's experience of a near-financial collapse in the early 1990s - as well as similar crises in Japan and the Nordic countries around the same period - have led to a \"kind of scarring effect - or scaring effect, if you like,\" she said.\n\"According to this narrative, the people who went through the early 1990s crises or near-crises were still in charge in the lead-up to the more recent crisis, and their earlier experience made them more cautious.\"\n\"There is probably something to this story and, if so, it raises the question of how to pass that realistic approach to risk down to future generations of bankers and policymakers.\n\"But there is an alternative interpretation of events, which is simply that the financial sector can only be deregulated once from its post-war restrictions.\n\"The resulting over-exuberance, borne of inexperience, could only re-occur if something else came along that resulted in a similar transition period of fast credit growth, at the same time as we somehow forgot everything we have learned since about credit risk management.\"\nCommercial debt risks More importantly, Dr Ellis suggests, is to remember that property markets are about more than just household mortgages, with commercial lending often tending to expand in importance in the late stages of a boom, and accounting for a disproportionate share of loan losses in a bust.\n\"If we are looking for surges in credit growth as precursors to painful downturns, we should bear in mind that, historically, these surges have been evident in business credit far more than in housing credit.\"\nDr Ellis takes issue with analysts who focus too much on leverage when comparing different markets as they often fail to acknowledge that there are many different triggers for financial market instability.\n\"There are clear connections between financial stability outcomes and the mandate, powers and culture of the prudential supervisor, or the form and coverage of consumer protection regulation around credit.\n\"But it is perhaps less obvious that labour market institutions, for example, or the way health care is paid for, can affect the idiosyncratic risks households face, and thus the credit risk they pose to lenders.\n\"Though the profession has clearly learned that leverage matters, we risk forgetting that credit is not an amorphous blob.\"\n\"Excessive focus on one dimension to the exclusion of others could in some cases be counterproductive.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-08T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:35:04.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
