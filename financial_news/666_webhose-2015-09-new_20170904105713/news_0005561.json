All the three Moto G versions share an almost similar spec sheet. On paper, something major is yet to happen. However, Motorola is among the few brands that prioritise overall user experience over the price versus hardware specification. The good part is consumers are appreciating this.\nWhile it is becoming difficult for consumers to make their buying decision with almost every brand trying to woo them with more RAM and cores at a low price, the new Moto G comes as a much needed relief. At least, now buyers have one smartphone that they can be sure about while comparing it with others in the same price range.\nAfter the launch of Moto G (3rd gen), many smartphone enthusiasts had declared that it is hardly an upgrade from the second generation. However, our first impressions were positive and we felt that the new Moto G could be a\ngreat smartphone for most budget buyers. After using it for a month, here is the review.\nThe new Moto G, when compared to the 2014 variant, offers a better camera, bigger battery, 4G support and is water-resistant. On paper, the Moto G might not stand out. However, Motorola seems to have added just the right upgrades. It comes in 8 GB and 16 GB ROM options at R11,999 and R12,999, respectively. Both the versions support 4G. While the 8 GB internal storage offers 1 GB RAM and the 16 GB variant has 2 GB RAM, both support microSD cards. Rest of the specs are the same.\nWhat is good?\nOverall, the Moto G offers a smooth experience. Pure Android Lollipop gives a refreshing break from all the iOS inspired interfaces. The device has one of the fastest cameras. It can record 1080p videos along with 720p SloMo videos from both the cameras. The Focus Ring now comes with exposure control. Quick Capture enables ‘lets launch and swap’ between the two cameras by twisting their wrist twice.\nThe device is equipped to handle daily performance demands of average users. This is the only smartphone in this price range which is water-resistant. You cannot swim with your new Moto G, however, you need not worry about rains or accidental spills. The battery easily lasts a day of regular usage.\nWhat is not that good?\nMotorola has done nothing on the display department. Though the quality is good, like in the Moto G 2014 version, outdoor visibility is average at best. This smartphone might be a good deal for most average users. However, if you are into a lot of gaming or multitasking, then expect sudden crashes or lags.\nVerdict: If you are caught in between this intense price versus hardware battle in the budget smartphone market, then you can safely consider buying the new Moto G. It caters well to needs of most smartphone users who are looking to get a decent deal in the price range of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 13,000. However, it is totally upto you whether you wish to spend that R1,000 extra for extra RAM and ROM.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n* Display: 5-inch 720p HD display\n* Processor: 1.4 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410\n* Operating system: Android 5.1.1 Lollipop\n* SIM type: Dual SIM (Micro)\n* RAM: 1 GB for 8 GB version; 2 GB for 16 GB version\n* Storage: 8 GB/16 GB (32 GB expandable)\n* Camera: 13 MP rear camera; 5 MP front camera\n* Battery: 2,470 mAh battery\n** Estimated street price: Rs 11,999 (8 GB); Rs 12,999 (16 GB)\n 24, 2015 12:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T04:07:11.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
