We also recover unpaid Employment Tribunal Awards due to employees and unpaid invoices due to small businesses.\" \nThe frequently contentious nature of its business may provoke some controversy about the size of the windfall that could be made by Inflexion and some of Marston's top executives. \nThe company, which was unavailable for comment on the sale process, insists that \"maintaining the highest professional standards of service that demonstrate our commitment to ethics, transparency and customer service excellence is a vital part of our success\". \nInflexion, which is in talks to buy the Yo! Sushi chain and owns businesses such as Jack Wills, the fashion retailer, declined to comment on the appointment of Deloitte.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:41:29.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
