(Nasdaq: INTU ) is switching its Dallas-area campus to wind power as part of the company’s ongoing commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. \nThe Intuit site in Plano, a Dallas suburb, houses about 500 employees in the company’s Accountant and Advisor Group, which offers products and services to professional accountants. The location is one of Intuit’s largest electricity users, and is the first to be powered through an offsite renewable energy agreement. Following the switchover on Oct. 1, the facility will be 100 percent powered by wind energy, reducing its carbon footprint to zero. \nThe electricity and associated Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are being sourced by Renewable Power Direct, LLC, a wholesale green energy marketer, under a multi-year agreement with an existing Texas wind farm. RPD’s retail electricity partner, XOOM Energy, LLC, will provide the retail service delivery to Intuit’s campus. \n\"Electricity usage accounts for almost 40 percent of Intuit’s overall carbon footprint,\" said Sean Kinghorn, Intuit's senior sustainability program manager. \"We have set a goal of reducing our absolute carbon footprint by 20 percent by 2020 with a baseline year of 2012. RPD’s ability to creatively supply our Texas campus with 100 percent clean power will significantly reduce our company’s carbon footprint and is one of several steps that we are taking to increase our use of on-site and off-site renewable energy.\" \nA growing number of companies are realizing that they can convert to wind power without investing in expensive facilities. \n“Our business with Intuit shows that companies can now get the renewable power they want without having to buy a whole wind farm or solar park,” said Phil Minick, RPD’s director of marketing. “RPD expects to see similar types of green power purchases by other major brands soon.” \nBackground \nAbout Renewable Power Direct, LLC \nRenewable Power Direct, LLC is a FERC authorized wholesale power marketer that specializes in supplying directly sourced renewable electricity to commercial and industrial consumers.
