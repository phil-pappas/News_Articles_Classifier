Louie Douvis by Sally Patten Quest Asset Partners, a fund manager that oversees $1 billion of assets, used the August sharemarket dive to snap up shares in some of its favourite companies, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, property developer Lendlease, global wealth manager Henderson Group, online job recruiter Seek, Ramsay Health Care, SurfStitch, an online action sport retailer, and residential property developer Villa World.\nIn the lead-up to the August falls Quest's three directors Chris Cahill, Michael Evans and Troy Cairns and team member Swapan Pandya were having trouble finding value in the Australian market. But a 7 per cent dive in the S&P/ASX 200 for the month put paid to that.\n\"We were a buyer on every major bad day in August,\" Cahill says.\nApart from CBA, which Cahill argues is the highest-quality lender among the majors, partly because of its strong technology platform and sound management, all the other shares bought by the manager lie outside the 20 biggest companies listed on the Australian bourse.\nNotable, but no coincidence. One of Quest's guiding beliefs is that investing in the biggest companies in the Australian market is no longer a safe option.\n\"The top 20 is no longer a safe haven,\" Evans says. \"Investing has looked easy because you could do a set-and-forget strategy in the top 20 companies. It is no longer a position of safety,\" he says, warning that investors will need to do more homework to familiarise themselves with smaller companies and understand the risks involved.\n\"You can't invest for your self-managed superannuation fund by reading the paper over a cup of coffee on the weekend any more,\" he says.\nFalling demand The reasons appear fairly simple. The big banks, constrained by the need to retain more capital, are \"coming to the end of their earnings-per-share growth\", the mining behemoths are suffering from falling demand from China and plummeting commodity prices, while the big retailers are locked in a war for customers.\nAs it happens, BHP Billiton is among Quest's largest holdings, but only as an insurance policy. Cahill and Evans are quite happy to admit that their downbeat view of the resources sector might be misplaced and that they need exposure to the industry in case they get caught on the wrong side of market history. BHP is in the portfolio based on the fact that it is a diversified, low-cost producer, has a decent yield and is well managed.\nQuest was established in 2004, some months after the idea for the boutique fund manager was hatched on a golf course in the Sydney suburb of Cammeray. Evans had hired Cahill in 1994 to join the AMP small-cap Australian equity team, but had left AMP a few months before the two met for a round of golf.\nOf the $1 billion under management, $950 million is in the form of three mandates from large investors and the remaining $50 million is managed on behalf of wealthy individuals. The money is managed through separately managed accounts, rather than through a pooled vehicle, so investors do not get lumped with other people's tax liabilities. Evans and the others have 28 companies in the portfolio, just below the ceiling of 30 companies.\nQuest's aversion to the top 20 companies has meant that the new listings market has proved a useful hunting ground. Not only are the companies smaller, but it is a way to find companies with strong growth prospects in a world that is characterised by low economic growth and low top-line growth.\nOf the 100 initial public offerings that have appeared over the past two years, Quest has looked at 50 in detail and made 15 investments, including Amaysim, a mobile reseller, Cover-More, a travel insurance provider, Smart Group, a salary packaging company, and OzForex, a foreign exchange provider.\n\"We regard the flow of IPOs over the last two years as a much-needed replenishment that is good for the market,\" Cahill says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:07:48.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
