Glen McCurtayne/Coleman-Rayner Share on twitter by Dominic White The on-demand viewing habits of Millennials will never revert to the steady linear patterns of their parents when they grow up, according to YouTube's director content strategy, Jamie Byrne.\nIn an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media, Mr Byrne also dismissed suggestions that YouTube risked becoming a farm system that fostered the next generation of stars only to see them stolen by the likes of Netflix and the Hollywood studios.\nYouTube says its reaches more people in the United States than any cable network among ages 18 to 49, the group most sought after by advertisers.\nAnd Mr Byrne, who has been with the video platform since 2006 – just before it was acquired by Google for a prescient $US1.65 billion – predicted it would keep viewers as they moved higher into that age range.\n\"I find it hard to believe that if you have grown up in a world where you choose what you want to watch, you're not locked into anyone's linear programming schedule and can set your own schedule across any device, that you are going to switch back to something that gives you less control,\" he said.\nBillboard promotion As part of its push to grab more advertising dollars from television, YouTube has bought space on prominent billboards along Sunset Boulevard to promote its growing roster of \"creators\" such as Tyler Oakley, Lilly Singh, Michelle Phan and Bethany Mota.\nThese stars have lured millions of millennial viewers – and some big-name sponsors – to their channels, which feature content from Oakley's interview with Michelle Obama to Singh's observational comedy skits via Phan and Mota's popular beauty tips. YouTube takes 45 per cent of advertising sold against the videos.\n \"The creators are becoming moguls or media businesses in their own right and you will see them start to extend into other places like The New York Times bestseller lists and movies,\" Mr Byrne said.\nBut he insisted the most savvy YouTube stars would stay loyal to the platform amid increasing attempts by other media to poach them. \"The creators tell us that no matter what else they do, they want to stay here. This is the platform that helps them get on the bestseller list, sell their movie and distribute their content to other players, which is fine, that's how the media business works.\"\nDisruptive threats But YouTube itself faces disruptive threats in free on-demand video content with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat and Vine all competing aggressively for eyeballs.\nMr Byrne shrugged it off.\n\"One company cannot build an entire industry on its own so it's expected,\" he said. \"It's a good validation of what we've been doing but it also means there's other people in the marketplace that are going to help advertisers to move over to video as a platform and that's kind of needed in many respects.\n\"We need advertisers to recognise the power of video and the power of these influencers and start moving more of their budgets into our space. As that happens, creators make more money, they can invest more money in content and the whole industry should rise.\"\nYouTube's content push is about to be stepped up with the arrival of ex-MTV programming chief Susanne Daniels, who will oversee development and production of content.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-09-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:05:27.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
