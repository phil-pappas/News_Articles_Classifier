In the past 10 years alone, class action settlements in excess of $50 billion have been distributed to damaged shareholders, an amount substantially greater than the SEC or other regulatory penalties have imposed. Still, investors frequently only receive a modest fraction of their overall losses that result from corporate wrongdoing. Financial Recovery Technologies LLC (FRT), a leader in securities class action settlement recovery, today announced the launch of FRT Direct, a service designed to provide clients with opportunities to opt out of class actions and pursue private litigation as an alternative to remaining a passive class member. The service aims to provide institutional investors with the information needed to make decisions as to how to address securities litigation based on the best interest of the firm and its shareholders. When a class action settlement does not adequately represent an investor’s interest, private actions can provide investors the opportunity to recover significantly more than they would in a class action settlement.\n“Many of our clients are not aware of private litigation opportunities as they are difficult to identify,” said Rob Adler, President of FRT. “But private action settlements have the potential to produce significantly larger recoveries than if an investor remained a member of the class and passively filed a claim.”\nFRT Direct aims to help institutional investors maximize their asset recovery while minimizing the costs and hassles of considering and engaging in select private litigation situations. The FRT Direct service includes:\nAccess to a proprietary database of active opportunities Email alerts and customized analysis to provide the client with the necessary information to begin their evaluation process Increased access to cases as a result of law firms participating in the FRT network reducing their minimum loss thresholds Service and support throughout the process\nAdler continued, “Our clients require us to be more than a claim filing service. FRT is a full-service partner in addressing securities litigation and related class actions. We will continue to expand and improve our service offerings to meet and exceed the expectations of our client base and the market as a whole.”\nAbout Financial Recovery Technologies\nFounded in 2008, Financial Recovery Technologies (FRT) is a leading technology-based services firm that helps the investment community identify eligibility, file claims and collect funds made available in securities class action settlements.
