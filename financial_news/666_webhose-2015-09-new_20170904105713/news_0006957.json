He had managed all our finances. A number of loans, credit cards and other financial dealings came to light the majority of which I had no knowledge of. \nAt the time of his death I was earning around £10,000 per year and had no savings. There was a secured loan on our home but my husband told me this had been paid off. \nNaively, I never asked for any proof of this. Also there was no equity in the property when I had thought there was approximately £100,000. \nI received correspondence from Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) about payments I couldn’t pay. \nThe family home was sold at a loss because of this. \nI am 60 now and trying to move on with my life but there is a huge blemish on my previously clear credit history. Can you see that this is returned to normal? ST, North of England \nYou took out a joint loan in 2007 and over the years more borrowing was added to it. As joint borrower you had a right to check with Barclays that the loan had indeed been paid off. \nUnderstandably you trusted your husband and so did not do so. Arrears accumulated for a year and a half after the death and I understand all this is reflected on your credit file, as well as some credit card issues. I also believe £22,870 was eventually paid off by you and the bank wrote off the outstanding £3,519. The bank also paid you £2,448 for a PPI mis-selling claim. \nYou referred the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service , and then, around half a year before contacting me, told it not to progress the matter. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) told you that a credit file had to reflect what had happened. \n• 'My struggle to correct credit file' \nThis is Barclays’ argument too. It stresses that, whereas you repaid an element of the debt, the remainder was written off. It says, “We are obliged to record a true reflection of the customer’s financial circumstances.” \nThis is affecting your attempts to take out a loan with another bank. I have given you details of a contact at Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) who can help you construct a statement “a notice of correction” to put the best slant on what shows on your file. \nGet free debt advice from the local Citizens Advice Bureau, the Money Advice Service (0300 500 5000; moneyadviceservice.org.uk ), the National Debtline (0808 808 4000; nationaldebtline.org ), StepChange debt charity (0800 138 1111; stepchange.org ), and others. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:32:57.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
