This is because funds lent out come mainly from accumulated deposits from other customers, which are repayable on demand. Failure to repay credit facilities prevents other customers from accessing funds to support viable economic initiatives while limiting the viability of the institutions' operations'. \nWith the introduction of a range of electronic products and services, including funds transfer, airtime top-up, and balance enquiry, Opportunity International has increased its loan portfolio to GH¢88.4 million with total deposit clients of over 425,000 as at June 2015. \nThe company has deposit balance of GH¢85.5 million. \nVoted 'Non-Bank Financial Institution of the Year, 2013' by the Chartered Institute of Marketing, Ghana, management of Opportunity International Savings and Loans Limited intends to serve 1 million clients by 2020.
