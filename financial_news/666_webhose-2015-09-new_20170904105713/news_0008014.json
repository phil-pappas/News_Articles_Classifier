The credit union today unveiled its Choice Rewards program, which gives cardholder members a point for each dollar spent when they don't use their PIN number, and a point for each two dollars spent when they do use the PIN. The program is tied to First Service Credit Union's free checking account, which includes other free features such as home banking, bill pay, and electronic statements.\nMembers can collect points toward a wide variety of rewards, such as electronics, home goods, recreational items, jewelry, clothing, music and games, and travel. Rewards come from local merchants, online retailers, and travel websites.\n\"Credit card rewards programs have been around for a long time, but not that many financial institutions give rewards for debit card usage,\" said David Bleazard, President of First Service Credit Union. \"Our generous Choice Rewards program is designed so that our members can benefit from their everyday debit card usage.\"\nAbout First Service Credit Union\nFirst Service Credit Union provides financial services that enhance its members' lives. It has 12 full-service branches in the Houston metropolitan area, along with three company client-specific branches. It was founded in 1978 by employees of a premier engineering, procurement, construction and services company, and is now community chartered to serve members in the Houston area.
