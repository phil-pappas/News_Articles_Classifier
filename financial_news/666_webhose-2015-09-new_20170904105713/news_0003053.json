Under this scheme instead of buying physical gold, Indian residents can buy the gold bonds,” Jaitley said.\nThe Budget 2015-16 had proposed to launch a Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme to develop a financial asset as an alternative to gold.\nThe bonds will be issued in 2, 5 and 10 grams of gold or other denominations and the tenor of the bond could be for a minimum of 5-7 years so that it protects investors from medium-term volatility in gold prices, Jaitley said.\nAs regards the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the minister said people holding idle gold can deposit it in banks for either short, medium or long term.\n“This is not a black money immunity scheme and normal taxation laws would be applicable,” Jaitley said when asked if this was an immunity scheme.\nHe said around 1,000 tonnes of gold is imported annually and people hold such quantum of idle gold just for investment purpose every year.\nBy taking advantage of gold monetisation scheme, people can deposit idle gold with authorised agencies and take advantage of the price escalation of gold as well as earn interest on the deposit, he said.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 3:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:37:46.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
