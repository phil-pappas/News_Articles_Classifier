Among other Asian markets Hong Kong rose 0.31 percent after returning from a one-day holiday, while Sydney was slightly higher following a sell-off Thursday. There were also losses in Seoul, Singapore and Wellington. \nThe euro softened after the ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank was ready to ramp up its vast bond-buying scheme -- known as quantitative easing (QE) -- if needed to kick-start the eurozone economy. \n\"The asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme,\" Draghi told a news conference after the ECB kept interest rates unchanged at record lows. \nThe bank also cut its growth and inflation forecasts for 2015-2017, noting the downside risks from low oil prices and the economic slowdown in China. \n\"Mario Draghi didn't let markets down. He obliged with not only a promise of more QE if needed but also announced the ECB can now purchase more of any one debt issue,\" Lawler said. \nA possible widening of QE highlights the divergence of policy between the ECB and the Fed, suppressing the euro. \nThe single currency fetched $1.1132 Friday, against $1.1224 in US trade, while it also slipped to 133.34 yen from 135.15 yen. \nHowever, European markets ended sharply higher. London climbed 1.82 percent, Paris gained 2.17 percent and Frankfurt rallied 2.68 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:13:39.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
