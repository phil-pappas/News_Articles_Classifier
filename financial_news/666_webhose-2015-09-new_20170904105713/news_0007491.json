In early September, the Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) reportedly issued additional import allocations for, at least, 300,000 tonnes of petrol for the remainder of the third quarter. \nThis was on top of 1.5 million metric tonnes of existing petrol import allocations for the third quarter and is related to slow domestic refinery output, as well as to increased demand, sources told Platts. \nThe allocations, which enable the companies that hold them to import fuel under the country's subsidy regime, are in addition to the 1.5m tonnes issued for the third quarter earlier this year to, at least, 37 importers. \nSources said supplementary permits may have also been issued because NNPC terminated offshore processing agreements in mid-August. \n\"There is a wave of buying,\" a trading source maintained. \nMeanwhile, India's Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) says it will be cautious in buying Nigerian oil as the company is still scouting for a vessel to lift a cargo for early October loading after Nigeria sought a \"letter of comfort\" from shippers. \n\"We are finding it difficult to book a vessel to lift Nigerian crude ... We will be cautious in future while deciding about crude of Nigerian origin,\" its Head of Refineries B. K. Namdeo told Reuters. \nNamdeo said his firm was unsure whether it would be able to lift a very large crude carrier of Qua Iboe crude on time.\"Nobody is coming forward to offer the vessel and whoever is willing to go to Nigeria is asking exorbitant rates,\" he stated. \nHPCL bought the two million barrels of Qua Iboe from Totsa, a trading arm of France's Total, for October 7-8 lifting on a free on board (FOB) basis, meaning the buyer pays the cost of marine freight, insurance, unloading and other costs to destination. \nThe Indian firm had chartered the Ridgebury Progress to lift the cargo, but the vessel owner refused to sign the \"letter of comfort\" sought by the Nigerian authorities. \nNigeria this month lifted a ban on certain oil tankers sailing into its territorial waters. But as a condition for the ban removal, it created the letter of comfort requirement in an effort to target oil theft. \nWith Agency Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:42:13.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
