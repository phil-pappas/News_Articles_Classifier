AAPL 1.55 % will do to the auto manufacturing supply chain what it did to electronics production. Apple on Monday termed its study of its own electric car a “committed project,” and the WSJ’s Daisuke Wakabayashi writes the prospect of Apple-made cars raises significant questions about the project and its impact on the world of auto parts production . Apple clearly wants to apply the expertise that it has honed in developing iPhones, including batteries, sensors and highly-sophisticated technologies. It’s unclear, however, whether Apple wants to extend the contract manufacturing model its used for iPads and phones to auto making. And the company has set a highly ambitious “ship date” of 2019 for the car, a target that will challenge the company’s ability to pull together the complex manufacturing behind automobiles—even a company praised in logistics circles for how it manages its supply chain.\nShipping companies in parts of the Northeast where Pope Francis will visit this week effectively are giving up in the face of stringent security and enormous crowds. The papal tour that will touch New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia will create a week of rare logistical challenges for the companies , and the impact will hit thousands of deliveries. Apple’s new iPhones are supposed to hit doorsteps on Friday, when major service disruptions in New York and Philadelphia are expected. The U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service Inc. UPS 1.35 % already have warned they will suspend some pickups and deliveries, and even railroads Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC 0.79 % and CSX Corp. CSX -0.21 % have told customers some operations will be sidetracked. Tens of thousands of e-commerce shipments could be disrupted, but some businesses have already prepared by getting goods in early or, if they can afford to, planning to shut down for the duration.\nT he Dubai-based Mara Group is setting up a delivery network to back up its bet that Africa will be the next frontier for e-commerce. The WSJ’s Dan Keeler reports that the technology-focused business services company is launching an online marketplace that it plans to expand across the continent within four years. With mobile systems prevalent across Africa, the challenge is less the technology reach than it is the difficult logistics. That’s why Mara is setting up a shipping company, Mara Xpress, that it says will confront the “big bottleneck” of last-mile logistics. A big part of the $100 million investment Mara is seeking will probably back the launch of the delivery service, but that may only be the beginning of what the company needs. Several studies have suggested Africa has enormous potential as a retail market but logistics companies says moving goods any distance at all is difficult and expensive.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES ENLARGE Photo: Jae C. Hong/Associated Press The global network of warehouses known as freeports doesn’t cover much ground by logistics-industry standards but the sites probably are as secure as storage sites can be. But the WSJ’s John Letzing and Max Colchester report that the closed-door nature of the sites, built to hold precious art works, is drawing new scrutiny . Governments are questioning whether facilities built to protect valuable paintings are allowing art dealers to operate outside normal financial scrutiny and tax systems. The interest has grown since the biggest backer of a Luxembourg site has faced criminal charges over the sale of paintings. Freeports grew out of bonded warehouses, where commodities in transit across borders can be stored without incurring taxes, and there are dozens around the world. Customs officials worry they don’t know what’s being stored at the sites, and the potential for illicit business has gotten the attention in the U.S. of the Department of Homeland Security.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We want to get our drivers in early and then get them out of there. ’\n—Thomas Connery, president of New England Motor Freight, on the delivery during the pope’s visit.\nIN OTHER NEWS Volkswagen AG VLKAY -17.10 % halted sales of some cars in the U.S. as the government began a criminal investigation of its emissions reporting.
