Michael Clayton-Jones Investors who've stayed with it all the way as a bedrock of their portfolio through the sharemarket slides of 1994, 1998, then the dot com crash of 2001 and the GFC of 2008 have experienced a return averaging 17.2 per cent every year when dividends are included, even though CBA shares have fallen back to $71.60 now.\nThe former Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has delivered even bigger returns since it was privatised in 1994 in a $299 million float at $2.30 per share. CSL shareholders will receive their final dividend on October 2 which when converted into Australian dollars is a 89.99Â¢ per share payout. The full-year payment is $1.64375, which is inching towards the original $2.30 price. Over the past 21 years, CSL has generated the equivalent of a 27.1 per cent annual return each year. CSL is now at $89.24, and has been through a 3-for-1 share split over the journey.\nOf course, there are dozens of examples where other companies have floundered and market value has vanished over the long-term because new competitors arrived or they failed to respond to outside threats, or succumbed to hubris or complacency inside the boardroom. There's no substitute for shrewd stock-picking.\nBanks still likely to be a good buy\n Where might the blue-chip favourites be in 2025? Citigroup is convinced that all of the major banks including CBA will have to cut dividends on a three-year view because of higher capital requirements and a souring economy.\nBut it's a fair bet that unless chief executive Ian Narev makes some serious mistakes, and then whoever his successor is can avoid any catastrophes, the annual dividend will eventually be on the rise again and the nation's biggest bank will be a $100-plus stock. The big four banks are also highly likely to pass on extra imposts forced on them by regulators through higher home loan rates over time.\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett is fond of saying the best time frame to own a good stock is \"forever\". The ease with which shares can be bought and sold make them first in the queue for a quick sale when the merits of different asset classes are scrutinised in a total portfolio. Ditching the two-bedroom investment apartment in Darlinghurst or Elwood is less appealing because of the horrendous transaction costs and real estate agent fees. The stamp duty costs alone in re-entering the market in a couple of years' time make that route prohibitive.\nTime horizons play a big part in investment decisions and those closer to retirement want stability and to preserve capital.\nWith regular 100-point drops on the ASX/S&P 200 over the past month the volatility on the stockmarket is at much higher levels than normal and the \"noise\" around a Chinese economy slowing faster than people anticipated and central banks around the globe having lost the ability to really influence economies, is getting louder.\nAMP Capital figures show that the grossed-up dividend yield of Australian shares headed higher than the one-year term deposit rate banks were offering on cash in mid-2011, and the gap has been widening since.\nMost investors think the sharemarket is still a reasonable place in the quest to generate a long-term rate of return better than bonds, cash or real estate. Getting the timing right is fraught though. Just ask those who were planning to retire in 2008 and watched their genius investing decisions turn bad just when they were about to bring home the bacon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:07:14.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
