The new documents are simpler, shorter and will make it easier to compare multiple loan offers, but the process probably won’t be seamless.Here’s what you should know. You’ll be able to compare loans more easily. In the past, trying to determine whether you were getting the best deal was complicated. Fees varied from company to company, and different lenders used different names for fees or grouped them in different ways, making it difficult to feel like you were relating apples to apples. “Congress was concerned that the old documents didn’t really serve consumers well,” says Holden Lewis, a mortgage analyst for Bankrate.com. “They just resulted in a lot of confusion.”The new documents include a comparison section that adds up how much the loan will cost in the first five years—all the closing costs, principal, interest and mortgage insurance, if any. “Those are bottom lines that really make it easy to tell one loan from another,” Lewis says.[caption id=\"attachment_764\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] (Photo credit: Colin)[/caption] Your closing may be delayed. Before this change, if a lender made a substantial change in the loan in the last day or two before closing, it didn’t delay the closing. Now, if something happens before closing, a change creates a new three-day waiting period before the loan can close.“A common thing that will happen is someone will apply for a loan, get approved, and while they’re waiting to close they’ll go out and buy furniture and appliances on credit,” Lewis says. “When you apply for credit and get credit, it can lower your credit score. Then lenders check in the last couple of days to see if your credit score is the same, and if your score has gone down enough, they may have to rewrite the loan and raise the rate.” Lenders may make fewer loan changes . The three-day waiting period is fairly good incentive for lenders not to make changes if they don’t have to. “They’re going to be really insistent on telling borrowers, ‘Once you’ve been approved for the loan, just leave your credit alone,’” Lewis says. You may want a longer rate lock . “At least in the first few weeks, while lenders and title companies are making sure they have all the processes intact, I think some of them will advise borrowers to lock a little bit longer just in case,” Lewis says. That may mean a 45- or 60-day lock instead of 30 days. As a borrower, ask the lender what he or she recommends. There may be bugs. “These new forms, there are a lot of changes of processes underneath them,” Lewis says. “There were months and months of software development. This has been a really long, expensive, time-consuming process and it’s not a matter of printing forms that look different.” In other words, for new borrowers after October 3, the process may be a little bumpy until everything has been road-tested.
