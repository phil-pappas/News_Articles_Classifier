In this old game it's almost obligatory to say \"Brad Pitt\" while friends offer less-flattering suggestions. Not so long ago, a chap might have suggested Robert Redford and received an equally derisive response.\nTravel writer Bill Bryson is in the flattering position of being portrayed by Robert Redford in A Walk in the Woods , but somehow it's not the same. Bryson's best-selling book about hiking the Appalachian Trail came out in 1998, and it was soon suggested that the author and his walking companion, Stephen Katz, should be played by Redford and Paul Newman, reuniting for the first time since 1973's The Sting . The years ticked by and Newman died of cancer in 2008. Redford just got older.\nWhen Bryson undertook his big hike he was 44, but when they eventually made the movie Redford was 78 – which necessitated a slightly different approach. The comic premise of the book concerns two unfit middle-aged guys setting out for the ordeal of their lives. The movie tells the story of two unfit, elderly guys trying to defy encroaching mortality. In the early part of the film Bryson goes to a funeral service, which makes him feel he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life sitting around in New Hampshire, waiting for death.\nNick Nolte, drafted in to play Katz, is probably a better fit for the role than Paul Newman. Nolte, who is 74 this year, is every bit as gross, eccentric and overweight as Katz was in the book. Newman couldn't have degenerated that fast.\nRebecca Hall, Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton star in The Gift, a psychological thriller set in Los Angeles that turns on a failure of politeness. Bill Bryson owes his popularity to a droll sense of humour and a writing style that mixes self-deprecation with a keen eye for human stupidity. He also has the remarkable ability to cram his books with useful information without ever becoming dull.\nIn book form, A Walk in the Woods is chock-a-block with stories and statistics relating to a trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine, a total distance of more than 3500 kilometres. It encompasses extremes of heat and cold as well as steep mountains, dense forests, and rivers. The entire walk should take between five and seven months, but only a small percentage of hikers manage to make it past the first week. It sounds hellish.\nThe Appalachian Trail is not quite as long as the Pacific Crest Trail, recently traversed by Reese Witherspoon in the 2014 film Wild , but it may be even more forbidding. Wild was treated as a rite of self-discovery, a penance imposed on herself by a woman trying to reclaim her life. In comparison, A Walk in the Woods is a comic ramble by two curmudgeons who in real life would be lucky to make it up the first slope.\nStumbling old-timers Related My guilty admission is that I much preferred watching the old-timers stumbling around in the woods, instead of one woman's march towards self-actualisation. A Walk in the Woods is devoid of overheated introspection and flashbacks, although there isn't much more to the story than a series of mildly funny episodes on the long trek from Georgia to wherever.\nDirector Ken Kwapis follows Bryson's tale with reasonable accuracy, allowing for the usual embellishments, additions and condensations. He leaves out the historical profile of the Appalachian Trail and the author's anthologies of interesting facts. What remains is a script with a propensity to plunge into storylines that simply fizzle out.\nKristen Schaal makes a brief but memorable appearance as Mary Ellen, a loudmouth hiker who attaches herself to Bryson and Katz early in the walk. Mary Steenburgen appears for about two minutes in the role of an innkeeper who has a mild flirtation with Bryson.\nThe episodic style of the narrative may be an attempt to capture the fleeting nature of human contacts that occur along the trail, with the overwhelming priority being the need to keep pushing on. On the other hand, it may reflect the scriptwriters' difficulty in making dramatic sense of the author's conversational approach.\nOne of Bryson's repeated themes is the disappearance of the distinctive fauna and flora of the American wilderness, partly as a result of the destructive mismanagement practised by the US National Park Service. None of this makes it into the movie.\nA Walk in the Woods is ultimately an unambitious film that will draw most of its audience from the ranks of Bill Bryson's loyal readers, and from those attracted by the star appeal of Redford and Nolte. It's mildly amusing and always watchable, but doesn't begin to capture the sheer agony that the Appalachian Trail represents to everyone who attempts this epic hike. By all accounts it is a life-changing experience, which is more than one could say about the movie.\nPeril from the past Most boys from the western suburbs of Sydney would be content with the life of a Hollywood actor, but Joel Edgerton has recently revealed an exceptional talent as a writer of screenplays. Now comes The Gift , his debut feature as a director, and it's an impressive achievement. Not only has Edgerton written the script and directed, he also plays one corner of a tense emotional triangle.\nThe Gift begins with Simon and Robyn (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) finding a new, modern home in the Los Angeles hills, after relocating from Chicago. Simon is returning to his home town, having scored a high-powered job with an internet security firm. Robyn is an interior designer who is going to work freelance.\nWhile shopping, Simon is approached by an apparent stranger (Edgerton) who introduces himself as Gordon, or \"Gordo\", from his old class at school. Right from the start there is something odd about the way Gordo stares blankly at Simon and Robyn. They fob him off with the standard, insincerities – \"We must catch up\" – but Gordo has no intention of keeping his distance.\nSoon there are neatly wrapped gifts appearing on their doorstep. When Gordo turns up while Simon is at work, Robyn invites him to stay for dinner. Yet the conversation is stilted and one-sided. Gordo expresses his admiration for the couple, while giving little away about his own life.\nFor Simon, this is too much. He recalls that Gordo was called \"the weirdo\" at school, and finds him even weirder today. Robyn is more sympathetic, and urges her husband to be polite to this undesired friend.\nAs Gordo's gifts become more extravagant, Simon and Robyn accept a dinner invitation. The night turns out badly and they tell their host not to call them again. But it is already too late. Gordo has insinuated himself into their lives as an almost subliminal presence.\nOther side of the coin Edgerton cranks up the tension little by little, as Robyn begins to feel insecure at home. The wall-sized glass windows of their house offer little protection, and every bump or flickering shadow exacerbates her paranoia. At the same time we find out she has a problem with amphetamines that may have contributed to a miscarriage in Chicago, or may be the result of that experience.\nAs she sinks into depression, Simon is pushing aggressively for a promotion at work, and the tensions between them are rising. Robyn senses that Simon is not telling her the whole story about Gordo and what they did at school. As she begins to dig deeper she discovers another side to her husband's personality. We see the world through Robyn's eyes, as she feels she is being stalked by one stranger while married to another.\nThere have been lots of movies about a couple being menaced by a mysterious interloper, but this film is no Cape Fear . Gordo may harbour malevolent intentions but his tactics are largely psychological. The subtle pressure he exerts brings out the bully in Simon, whose ambitious nature translates into violent, unscrupulous behaviour.\nThe novelty of The Gift is that it is a psychological thriller that turns on a failure of politeness. By rejecting Gordo's overtures of friendship, Simon rekindles old animosities that might otherwise have been laid to rest. Yet what can one do with a friend who keeps turning up when he is least wanted? Gordo has the kind of needy personality that means he won't take a hint. It's an intolerable bind, especially for Robyn who is already feeling frail and unstable.\nEdgerton's Gordo is a wonderfully ambiguous character. His blank expression seems to conceal a well of pent-up emotions: insecurity, resentment, envy, fear, simmering anger – almost anything. His good manners and willingness to help have a threatening edge. It is obvious to Robyn, and to us, that Gordo is carrying around a burden of pain that won't let him rest, and Simon is somehow responsible.\nJason Bateman has to conjure a character who is both a loving husband, and an egocentric careerist who despises weakness in others. The dark side of Simon's personality is allowed to slowly assert itself as the pressure builds. Meanwhile, Rebecca Hall's Robyn has to mix vulnerability and strength, overcoming her own traumas to delve deeper into the mystery of her husband's past.\nEdgerton throws us a few easy clues but manages to disguise the big surprise ending. Along the way, we meet many familiar motifs from the horror-suspense genre: from the sudden shock that ends in anticlimax to the kitchen tap inexplicably running; and even a flash of Robyn's bare back as she stands in the shower. It's not exactly the Bates Motel, but this is a film Hitchcock might have been proud to own.\nA Walk in the Woods\nDirected by Ken Kwapis\nWritten by Rick Kerb & William Holderman, after the book by Bill Bryson\nStarring Robert Redford, Nick Nolte, Emma Thompson, Kristen Schaal, Mary Steenburgen\nUS, rated M, 104 mins\nThe Gift\nWritten & directed by Joel Edgerton\nStarring Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Allison Tolman, Tim Griffin, Adam Lazarre-White\nAustralia/US, rated M, 108 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:09:49.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
