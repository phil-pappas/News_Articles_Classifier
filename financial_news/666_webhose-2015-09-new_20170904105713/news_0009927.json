It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's coming after last week, when we had a big storage build and it's basically the beginning of (refinery) maintenance season,\" said Yawger. \n\"The market anticipates a pretty good build and also you'll get a reduction in the refinery utilization rate, leaving lots of crude oil on the sidelines.\" \nAnalysts expect commercial crude-oil inventories rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News. \nAt the same time, the DoE predicted in a new report Wednesday that US crude-oil production would decline through the middle of next year in response to low oil prices, before picking up again in late 2016 on an expected rise in oil prices. \nUS crude output fell by 140,000 barrels per day in August from July. The government lowered its 2015 production estimate to 9.2 million barrels per day, 100,000 barrels lower than its month-ago forecast. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so, total US oil output this year is expected to be the highest since 1972.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:02:27.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
