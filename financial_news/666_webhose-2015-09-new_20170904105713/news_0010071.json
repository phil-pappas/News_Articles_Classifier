Looking past the ups and downs, the average growth rate for June and July was just a shade under 0.3 per cent, and so was the average for the preceding six months, according to the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. So all the latest estimates tell us is that retail trade growth was as slow over the past two months as it was in the half-year before. The figures are volatile. They wobble around from month to month. And they don't say consumer spending has suddenly ground to a halt, any more than the slow 0.2 per cent June quarter rise in gross domestic product (GDP) reported on Wednesday, after a 0.9 per cent surge in the previous three months, signalled a sudden descent into economic stagnation. Even so, the trend in retail trade, as in GDP, is decidedly tepid. And there are headwinds, as economists are fond of saying these days. Wages growth is weak, employment growth is slowing, home-building is topping out and confidence is fragile. The national accounts on Wednesday showed that, thanks to the combination of slowing wages and jobs growth, household disposable income, a key measure of purchasing power, rose by 3.3 per cent through the latest year. The average for the 21 years before that, a period beginning in 1993 with the start of the Reserve Bank of Australia's inflation-targeting regime, was 6.2 per cent, so the current pace is barely half the norm. And there is some downside risk, with signs that the surge in residential building is topping out. That means household goods retailing, one of the strong components of the retail survey, will probably post much slower growth over the coming year than its latest, unusually rapid, annual growth rate of 8.6 per cent. This is all against the background of surveys repeatedly showing consumer confidence at best around its long-run average - in other words, somewhere between sick and healthy. Whatever drives consumer spending over the coming year or so, it won't be growth in household income, or a home building boom or the cheerful disposition of the average shopper.
