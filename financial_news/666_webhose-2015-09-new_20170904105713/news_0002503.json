Many of the complaints have been filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by women who received an implant to make themselves sterile. There has been growing concern among regulators and patient advocates about the safety of the product which is called Essure. An FDA panel has questioned the agency about how careful it was in reviewing safety data for the Essure device. \nThere has been testimony from patients and experts who have shared stories of persistent abdominal discomfort, allergic reactions and messed up insertions. Essure was developed by a subsidiary of Bayer. The product is a small metallic coil which is placed in the fallopian tubes.

This device has been around for thirteen years. It has come under increasing scrutiny due to complaints of chronic pain, bleeding and fatigue by women using it.
