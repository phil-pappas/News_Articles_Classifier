Anchored in Charlotte, the Carolinas Division serves the finance needs of middle market companies with annual revenues of $20 million and above. A 22-year financial services industry veteran, Morrison most recently served as the regional vice president for the Charlotte West Regional Commercial Banking Office (RCBO). In her new role, Morrison will oversee commercial bank operations throughout the Carolinas where the company has nine regional and satellite offices. Morrison succeeds longtime commercial banker, Stan Gibson, who is retiring September 30. This marks a return to Charlotte for the home base for the Carolinas Division of Commercial Banking, which was most recently located in Charleston, S.C., where Gibson was based. Morrison began her finance career in 1993 as a commercial banking relationship manager at Wachovia Bank, N.A. in Winston Salem, N.C. She also has spent time both in the private sector and other areas of the bank. In 2010, she joined Wells Fargo’s Commercial banking team as a relationship manager and earned a promotion in 2012 to lead the Charlotte Metro West RCBO. During her tenure as regional vice president, that office saw double-digit growth throughout the portfolio. “Suzanne is a seasoned financial professional with deep roots in the Carolinas and a strong background in credit lending, investment banking, and corporate banking – all key partner businesses that serve middle market companies,” said John Manning, head of Wells Fargo Commercial Banking’s East Region. “Her leadership will be invaluable in helping middle-market companies succeed financially throughout the region.” Morrison holds a bachelor’s degree in business and finance from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is a Chartered Financial Analyst. She serves on the boards of the Charlotte Regional Partnership, the British American Business Council and Communities in Schools.
