It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) announced plans last week to cut debt by a third by the end of 2016. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) said on Tuesday that it planned to place up to 1.31 billion new shares, representing 9.99 percent of its share capital. \nThe sale was priced at 125 pence a share, the company said on Wednesday, representing a 2.4 percent discount to the stock's closing price of 128.05 pence on Tuesday. \nGlencore directors and employees have taken up 22 percent of the new shares as the company's executives try to shore up market confidence in the business. \nGlencore will also sell assets and cut capital spending in a bid to lower the debt. \nThe strategy, which includes plans to shut down some copper mines to support flagging prices, had briefly triggered a rally in Glencore's stock, but concerns of further falls in commodity prices continue to weigh on the shares.
