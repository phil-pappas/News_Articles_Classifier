PUBLISHED: 14:04, Wed, Sep 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:09, Wed, Sep 2, 2015 GETTY September 2 is the best day to put your home on the market according to research \nListing a home on September 2 gives property owners a prime two-month window to sell their home, before buyer activity tails off at the end of November until the end of the year.Buyers see Christmas as a key influencing factor, with many people determined to be moved in time for December 25, the date helps to push through a sale, found online estate agent eMoov. Securing a home in a desired catchment area before the start of February and school application deadlines is another factor expected to be pushing buyers to seal a deal in the coming weeks. The last few weeks of warmer weather also help to make a property more attractive, with almost a fifth of sellers reporting that it's more difficult to sell a home in winter. Finally buyers who have typically been on holiday or busy with children during the summer months are now back in the market and giving searches their full attention.
