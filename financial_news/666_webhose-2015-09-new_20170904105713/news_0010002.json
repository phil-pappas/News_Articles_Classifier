That translates to roughly $22 million Pacific pesos.\n\"Mr MacKenzie made an extraordinary contribution to the company during his tenure, creating a global leader in the packaging industry which has considerable opportunity for further growth,\" said his former chairman, Graeme Liebelt .\nAdvertisement And that does not include the $33.5 million of shares he pocketed on the way out.\nSure bet You don't need to risk your loot at a roulette table when you're on the Crown casino executive bonus scheme.\nLast year Crown's half owner, James Packer , showed all was sweet with his long-time deputy, John Alexander (JA), by tethering him with a new $4.5 million in bonus payments over the four years on top of the $1.5 million base pay JA had received to date.\nThe release of this year's annual report shows it rocketed JA's remuneration to $2.625 million. This means he earned more than Crown's CEO, Rowen Craigie , who took a walloping on his equity-based long-term incentive package.\nJA was not the only one to leave Craigie eating his dust. The head of Crown's Australian operations, Barry Felsted , lead the executive suite with remuneration of $3.2 million, followed closely by Crown's strategy guru, Todd Nisbet .\nNot that they will be crowing about it in the office. Packer does not get paid a cent and is forced to eke out a living on the $134.7 million worth of franked dividends he received from the company this year.\nLow tide Is it safe to go back into the water at Billabong?\nCompany founder Gordon \"Greasy\" Merchant certainly thinks so.\nMerchant has been on a buying spree this year. He dipped his toe into the water twice in April, picking up a combined 3.5 million shares for around $2 million.\nHe was at it again in May, picking up another 1.7 million shares, and on Thursday Greasy got really serious, picking up 4.2 million shares for $2.6 million.\nThat will be comforting for investors who might be worried about the prospect of Oaktree dumping its substantial stake in favour of its new toy, Billabong rival Quiksilver.\nBut it is easy to see why Greasy considers the stock a bargain.\nIn 2012, with the company's fate in the balance, Greasy scuppered a takeover by private equity group TPG Capital when he said he would not support due diligence even if TPG upped its offer to $4 a share.\nA year later the stock hit a low of 13¢, and it is now trading in the 60¢ range.\nHunger Games The political Hunger Games begin in earnest next week. Hundreds of the country's elite are being sent to the bread lines by our Liberal pollies.\nJosh Frydenberg offered a sick note from the boss, Malcolm Turnbull , to those who were expecting to attend his Association of Financial Advisers lunch at Melbourne's Crown casino on Monday. It appears the current assistant treasurer might be needed elsewhere.\n\"It is with regret that we announce that the lunch with the Assistant Treasurer, Melbourne event has been cancelled,\" said the AFA.\"With the make-up of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's ministry likely to remain in doubt until the end of this week, the AFA has been informed that all party members have been instructed to clear their schedules for a swearing-in ceremony on Monday 21 September, in Canberra.\"\nOf course Frydenberg might not make the cabinet cut this time around, in which case he would be free for a paper bag lunch in the pokies room.\nTurnbull is continuing to cower from speaking duties, cancelling his date with the National Press Club on Tuesday. But the good news is that the man in charge of our bread lines, Social Services czar Scott Morrison, has ensured his CEDA audience at Melbourne's Sofitel will still be getting a feed this Friday.\nJust as well, given attendees are paying up to $300 a head.\nIt might help ensure the grateful audience do not ask any pesky questions about political coups, cabinet reshuffles, or byelections in WA.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T22:49:38.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
