He is currently leading opinion polls.\nSchwarzenegger said he was a huge fan of 'The Celebrity Apprentice' and \"the way it showcases the challenges and triumphs of business and teamwork. I am thrilled to bring my experience to the boardroom and to continue to raise millions for charity.\"\nThe Austrian-born action hero and former bodybuilder has released a handful of movies since returning to the entertainment industry, but few have had the box office success he enjoyed in the 1980s and 1990s with films like \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"The Terminator.\"\nHis latest outing \"Terminator: Genisys,\" released in July, brought in a disappointing $90 million at the North American box office but fared much better overseas with about $350 million, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com (Reporting by Jill Serjeant in New York and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Plumb )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:27:27.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
