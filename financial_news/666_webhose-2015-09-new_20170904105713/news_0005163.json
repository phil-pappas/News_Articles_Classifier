Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Joanna Mather A GST increase to 15 per cent would allow Tony Abbott give $15 billion in tax cuts and provide extra health money to the states, tax experts say.\nBacking comments by NSW Premier Mike Baird, Grattan Institute chief executive John Daley said a five percentage point increase in the GST would raise an extra $30 billion a year.\nAfter paying compensation to the poorest 20 per cent of society via welfare benefits ($6 billion) and giving extra to the states for health ($9 billion), the government would have about $15 billion left over tax cuts, Dr Daley said.\n\"It's not going to buy you enormous changes in tax rates,\" he said.\nGrattan Institute chief executive John Daley said a five percentage point increase in the GST would raise an extra $30 billion or so a year. Ryan Stuart \"But it gives you enough to put something towards health, something towards income tax cuts and so, yes, you can do both.\"\nIn July, Mr Baird took the lead in national debate about tax reform by declaring himself open to an increase in the GST if the extra revenue raised was spent on health.\nShortfall Mr Baird said the health funding shortfall would reach $20 billion a year by 2020, which is higher than the $9 billion figure Dr Daley has used.\nRelated \"Health is a question of how long is a piece of string,\" Dr Daley said. \"Over the next couple of years an extra $5 billion to $10 billion would go some way.\"\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott last week said there was a \"strong argument\" for taxing consumption more and income less.\nThat was read to mean that revenue generated by any GST rise would, at least in part, need to go to income tax cuts. The politics is clear: health is a state responsibility and income tax a federal one.\nSouth Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill responded by saying Australia could either fund tax cuts or the growing cost of public health, but not both.\nNow Mr Baird has weighed back into the debate. \"In simple terms, the proposal I put forward is yes, it's about increasing the GST , but at the same time it's going towards the health gap and compensation must be paid,\" Fairfax Media Quote: d him as saying on Monday.\n\"And compensation can be paid in terms of lower income tax, so that can be used as a compensation method for the rise in the GST, and I think that package delivers what everyone wants.\"\nIncrease sought The states viewed the Abbott government's 2014 budget as effectively forcing them to ask for a GST increase by cutting $80 billion from hospitals and schools.\nThe NSW government's GST increase proposal involves cost-of-living compensation for families with a combined income of less than $100,000, and partially assisting those with a combined income between $100,000 and $150,000.\nPwC tax partner Paul Abbey agreed that increasing the GST to 15 per cent would allow for income tax cuts and additional health funding for the states.\nIdeally, any tax relief would be aimed at preventing Australians on average weekly earnings – $80,000 a year – from moving up into the next tax bracket.\nHowever, swapping an income tax cut for an increase in living costs might leave taxpayers no better off at all, Mr Abbey added.\nThat would challenge Mr Abbott's promise that changes need to occur within the \"context of overall lower taxes\".\nThe GST's revenue raising capacity is diminished each year by the fact that what people spend more of their money on – such as home mortgages and health – are exempt.\n\"When the GST was first introduced it [applied to] about 58 per cent of the economy, it's now about 46 per cent so the proportion of the economy that's being caught by the GST is in decline,\" Mr Abbey said.\nModelling by NATSEM at the University of Canberra showed the average household would be up for an extra $2915 GST a year, or 9.3 per cent of their income, if the GST rose to 15 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather", "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/nsw/mike-baird-says-gst-increase-can-fund-health-and-also-deliver-tax-cuts-20150906-gjg9if.html"], "published": "2015-09-07T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:29:57.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
