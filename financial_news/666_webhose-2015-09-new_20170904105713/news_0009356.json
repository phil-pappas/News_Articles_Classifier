In addition, the country's financial and goods markets were also relatively well developed (62nd and 67 th respectively). \nAdditionally, the country was also ranked 11 th in Africa in terms of having a conductive environment for doing business with Mauritius emerging top of the category. \nWhile some economic critics believe the report should have focused on wooing foreign investors into the country to do business, others have argued that economic prospects of Ghana remained bright in view of the IMF and the World Bank's latest assessments. \nThe report, which is the most comprehensive assessment of national competitiveness worldwide, looks at productivity and progress of countries and proffers solutions. \nBy Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:47:16.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
