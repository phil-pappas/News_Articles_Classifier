A cut in deposit rate is generally considered a precursor for reduction in lending rates.\nIn its monetary policy review on August 4, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had rued that banks had lowered their rates by only 30 basis points despite the central bank having cut its benchmark rate by as much as 75 basis points since January. 100 basis points are equivalent to one percentage point.\nRajan had also linked better monetary policy transmission or banks cutting their lending rates to any future rate reduction by the central bank.\n“HDFC Bank has decided to lower its base rate, or the minimum rate of lending, to the lowest level in the industry, to 9.35 per cent from the existing 9.70 per cent. The new rates will be effective tomorrow,” a source told PTI.\nThe base rate of country’s three largest lenders — SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank — stands at 9.7 per cent.\nCanara Bank in a filing to BSE said, “The board has approved reduction in the base rate by 10 basis points from 10 per cent to 9.90 per cent for loans or advances effective from September 3, 2015″.\nBesides, Axis Bank cut its deposit rates by up to 0.50 per cent across maturities.\n“We have cut our deposit rates by 0.20-0.50 per cent across tenors. The revision will be effective tomorrow,” a senior official from the bank told PTI.\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 7:34 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:40:04.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
