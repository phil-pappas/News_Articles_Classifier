There are better ways to achieve safer roads for all users.\" \nOne cycling campaign group called for lorries to be given \"direct vision cabs\" with lower seating positions to give drivers a \"view of pedestrians and cyclists (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:40:15.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
