Their surplus would also get a better value in the export markets,\" said Jonathan Leitch, Wood Mackenzie's research director.\n\"Inland refineries would get a benefit from increased local (gasoline) demand and could maintain import parity pricing rather than export parity pricing in some cases.\"\nAlready, an unexpected jump in global gasoline demand this year as a result of collapsing oil prices has led many plants around the world to maximise their gasoline yield.\n\"It's not so easy to increase gasoline output,\" said Matti Lehmus, vice president of oil products for Finland's Neste , whose 206,000 bpd Porvoo refinery is one of Europe's most advanced plants. \"Typically, it means constructing new units... Step changes in gasoline takes significant investment.\"\nWoodMackenzie estimates that most refineries can only shift 3-5 percent of their output from one fuel type to the other.\n\nECONOMIC SENSE\nUltimately, money could tip the balance for Europe's fuel consumption.\nA rollback of the favourable retail tax treatment of diesel across Europe would cost drivers 16 billion euros in the first year, making it economically advantageous for 15 percent of drivers to switch to gasoline cars, according to Wood Mackenzie.\nAlready, diesel demand in Europe is slowing.\n\"I do think the 'dieselisation' has plateaued and there will be a little bit of a comeback of gasoline, particularly for small vehicles and hybrids,\" said Dario Scaffardi, general manager of Italian refiner Saras.\n\"Today it makes more sense from technical standpoint for small engines to be gasoline.\"\nDespite a spectacular surge in refining profits over the past year as a result of surging global fuel demand, particularly for gasoline, following the oil price collapse, more refinery closures are expected in Europe by the end of the decade, including by Total and Italy's Eni.\nStill, Leitch, Scaffardi and others note the nearly three decades of \"dieselising\" Europe's fleet and an average 12-year lifespan for diesel cars means any switchover would be slow.\n\"Over the next few years, things are going to get tough for European refiners,\" Leitch said.\n\"But this could help some of them.\" (Additional reporting by Karolin Schaps, editing by David Evans)\nEurope News Europe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:31:11.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
