The Google Cardboard project has basically spun off an entire ecosystem of similar VR devices that don’t cost a lot of money—for example, the AuraVR Virtual Reality Plastic Headset costs Rs. 650 and the DOMO nHance VRC1 Magnet Switch costs Rs. 290, on www.amazon.in . All you have to do is place your phone (any Android phone or iPhone with a 5-6-inch display generally will do) in these virtual reality headsets to get immersed in a digital world where the view changes depending on how you move your head. Thanks to the ever-increasing popularity of these devices, the app ecosystem is becoming robust too.\nIf you want a good VR experience, we would recommend starting out with these apps and a game—all free.\nGoogle Cardboard\niOS, Android\nClick here for enlarge The official app is an excellent starting point for anyone who has Google’s official Cardboard device but does not really know how to negotiate the VR world. You get superb views of Google Earth and can watch videos and images that offer different perspectives as you move your head.\nOrbulus\niOS, Android\nOrbulus is a set of images taken for a VR experience. What makes the app special is the fact that it allows you to navigate by simply moving your head—you can zoom into an image by moving your ear to the right, zoom out by moving your ear to the left, and exit by simply looking down. There are dozens of very high-quality images to choose from, allowing you to view the fireworks over Hong Kong harbour and even the surface of the planet Mars.\nStereogram For Cardboard 2.0\nAndroid\nClick here for enlarge The whole idea behind Stereogram For Cardboard 2.0 is to let you see old photographs from an entirely new and much more comprehensive perspective. These are not images that you see in an album or on a wall, but ones that you can actually zoom into with a simple movement of the head and experience in all their 3D glory. It is like taking a trip into the past, walking through a massive interactive museum.\nSeene\niOS, Android\nClick here for enlarge Want to not just view but also take some photographs that you can see on Google Cardboard? Seene is the app for you. It does show you a lot of pictures from all over the world, and you can explore different parts of an image by simply moving your head. What makes it extra special is the fact that it helps you take similar pictures on your smartphone. You can shift focus and blur areas if you wish and even share images on social networks.\nTitans Of Space\nAndroid\nClick here for enlarge It offers a guided tour through the solar system, with relevant information displayed on the screen. Titans Of Space is a bit like having a planetarium on your eyes. There is even a soundtrack and a voice-over (although that is an optional in-app, or additional feature, purchase). The graphics are excellent and the feeling of moving through space has been well captured—it’s great for educational purposes.\nLost In The Kismet\nAndroid\nClick here for enlarge Imagine waking up in prison and then trying to find your way out. Lost In The Kismet is a game that literally forces you to look around and find objects and clues that will help you get out of the room you find yourself in at the beginning of the game. Navigation is simple—looking at an object will make you pick it up and you can combine objects too (put a lighter and wood together to light a torch). Easily one of the most interactive games you can play because thanks to the Cardboard, you are literally in the game.\nWar Of Words VR\niOS, Android\nClick here for enlarge What can virtual reality do for literature? Well, War Of Words VR merges images, animation and sound effects to impose the battle of the Somme from World War I on Siegfried Sassoon’s famous poem, The Kiss . You can see the flares, the flashes of gunfire, the barbed wire and the desolation around you as you move your head, and see Sassoon’s immortal words come to life. Haunting brilliance.\nRoller Coaster VR\niOS, Android\nClick here for enlarge Virtual reality at its simple best. You are all set for a roller-coaster ride that will set your teeth on edge as your carriage changes speed, and objects nearby flit by, emerge and disappear. Be warned: You might feel a bit dizzy once you are through. This is unlikely to stop you from trying again, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:04:24.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
