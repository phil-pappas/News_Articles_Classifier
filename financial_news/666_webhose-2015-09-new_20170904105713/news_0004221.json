London has hosted 29 floats on the main market so far this year, compared to 39 at the same stage of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data through to September 18. \nPanmure doubled its spending on redundancies to £376,000, although the overall headcount has risen from 118 after a deal to take over Charles Stanley (LSE: CAY.L - news ) ’s securities division in July. \nThe 139-year-old company won the race to buy the firm for up to £6.5m, depending on performance, and has said the acquisition will grant the company greater access to merger and acquisition work and bond broking. \nThe group, which brought in the Qatari bank QInvest as a major investor in 2009, restored its dividend in March this year for the first time since the financial crisis. \nMr Wale said the firm's major investors have \"had nothing but sympathy for the state of the market\". Aim-listed shares in Panmure, which are scarcely-traded and therefore volatile, fell 20pc to 98.5p in early trading, the lowest price since a share consolidation in early 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:57:45.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
