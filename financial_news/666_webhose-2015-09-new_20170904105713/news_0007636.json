The peer-to-peer marketplace, whose shareholding investors include Heartland Bank and Trade Me, said it would expand into Australia in October. Harmoney is facing competition on its home turf with two other licensed peer-to-peer lenders about to enter the market and others said to be lining up. Squirrel Money is due to launch in October while LendMe said it would launch before Christmas with or without confirmation of a tie-up with an unnamed trading bank which is still under discussion. Mr Campbell said competitors would help grow the market but his biggest worry was any lack of professionalism in new entrants would reflect badly on the embryonic market. \"People could be put off that market for a while because if one crowdfunder is not doing very well, then other crowdfunders will not do very well,\" he said. \"That's the biggest danger for us as more people come into peer-to-peer lending and may not be very good at it.\" Harmoney launched in September 2014 with $NZ100 million of committed lending capital from institutions. Through its online platform it matches individual borrowers looking to borrow money with lenders who commit funds for borrowing. Harmoney has between 7,000 and 8,000 borrowers and received loan applications of $NZ1 billion in the past year. The purpose of any loan, which Harmoney grades on risk, is made public but not the borrowers' identities. For example, one borrower wanted $NZ3,300 to buy new tyres for his car, AC/DC tickets, and to pay the bond on a house he was moving into. Harmoney is not yet making money and founder Neil Roberts said it needs to double the size of its lending and number of investors to reach the scale necessary to become profitable.
