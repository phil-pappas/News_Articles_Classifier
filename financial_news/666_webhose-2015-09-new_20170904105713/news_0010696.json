Reuters Share on twitter by James Chessell When the decomposing bodies of 71 refugees were found inside an abandoned poultry truck on the side of the main highway to Vienna last week, it seemed as if this Summer's migrant crisis in Europe could not get any worse.\nAustrian police at the scene a few miles from the Hungarian border described the smell of death as \"overpowering\". The bodies were only discovered because a man moving the grass nearby had noticed rancid liquid dripping out of the back of the refrigerated lorry. Among the dead were four children including a baby girl.\nYet in the past 48 hours the sense of catastrophe engendered by Europe's biggest influx of migrants since World War II has intensified.\nAdded to the catalogue of horror, tragedy and desperation were shocking images of a young boy lying face down in the surf near the Turkish resort of Bodrum. He was one of at least 11 Syrians drowned attempting to reach the Greek island of Kos.\nPhotos of a Turkish border guard with the boy's lifeless body taken on Wednesday morning were the top trending pictures on Twitter under the hashtag #KiyiyaVuranInsanlik (humanity washed ashore).\nThe images have been published extensively by the world's media, including the Financial Times and Reuters.\n'Uncontrolled flood' As the bodies began to wash up on the Turkish beach, hundreds of migrants gathered outside Budapest's biggest railway station demanding to be let in so they could travel west to Germany and beyond.\n \"Merkel - we want to leave,\" shouted the crowd holding their children aloft. The station had been closed as part of efforts to protect the Hungarian capital from what Budapest's mayor described as an \"uncontrolled flood\".\nMeanwhile, on the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, an African man was found squeezed behind the engine block of of a car choking on petrol fumes. Ceuta is the same place where people traffickers attempted in May to smuggle an an eight-year-old Ivory Coast boy across the border hidden inside a suitcase.\nIn Norway, more than 130 Syrian refugess have begun to cycle across the border from Russia. It is illegal to enter Norway on foot via car if you don't have the right papers. However, bicycles are allowed. And somewhere under the English Channel, passengers on the 7:13pm Eurostar service spent the night on board the train while police cleared the migrants from the track. They did not arrive in London until 10:50am.\nEuropean governments are in danger of losing control of their borders. One of the crowning achievements of the European Project - alongside democracy and free markets - was the creation of the passport-free Schengen travel zone. Comprised of 22 European Union countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switizerland, Schengen has arguably been a united Europe's most popular founding principle. Particularly, for the millions of people who emerged from behind the iron curtain.\nYet record numbers of new arrivals from Syria, the middle east and Africa have put Europe's open borders under extreme pressure and exposed simmering tensions between the continent's east and west about how best to handle immigration.\nFuture of European Project at stake How governments handle the migration crisis will not just have huge ramifications for the bilateral relationships within EU but could decide whether countries such as Britain remain part of Europe. The very future of the European Project is at stake.\n\"It is clear the Schengen Agreement is crumbling, as recent events are putting so much pressure on the political agreement,\" Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-EU UK Independent Party leader told the Telegraph.\n\"Schengen has now hit the buffers of the real world and is falling apart. In a crisis, national interests always prevail over European ideology.\"\nThe risks are obvious. Increasingly frustrated by what she sees as a shirking of responsibility by eastern nations to accept their share of often-Muslim migrants, German chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the Schengen area could be in jeopardy unless there the EU could agree on a fair distribution of refugees.\n\"I believe that our values in Europe are based on the dignity of every individual, without saying 'we don't want Muslims, we are a Christian land',\" Merkel said on Monday.\nGermany, which is Europe's richest nations, has said it will accept 800,000 refugees this year. However, poorer countries such as Greece and Hungary are struggling to cope with record numbers of asylum seekers crossing their borders.\nMigration is shaping up as a far greater test of European unity than the Greek debt crisis.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-09-03T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:01:29.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
