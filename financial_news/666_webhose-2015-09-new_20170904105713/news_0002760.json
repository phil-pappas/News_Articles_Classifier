The 19,236 hectare Lubu project is owned by Sable and is located in north-western Zimbabwe. The project has a modelled in-situ seam tonnage of 786m tonnes. \nSable's management intends to use coal mined at Lubu to supply the power station when it's constructed, as part of the group's plan to unlock value from its south African coal assets. \nThe memorandum of understanding is supported by the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Ministry of Energy and Power Development. When completed, Sable's management believes that the coal-fired plant can supply not just the domestic market, but also the regional market, which includes South Africa. \nA long way to go \nThere's no denying that today's news is game-changing for Sable Mining. However, like all early-stage miners, Sable is still a high-risk investment. The company still has a long way to go before it can be considered to be suitable for all investors. \nIndeed, for the year ended 31 March 2015, Sable didn't generate any revenue and an operating loss of $12.6m was reported for the full-year. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $6.3m, so it's clear that the company's options are limited. \nStill, at the end of August Sable raised $2m via the sale of non-core assets. As part of this deal, the company was able to negotiate the repayment of $18.6m in debt attached to one of its projects, on a priority quasi-royalty basis from the project's operations. \nSo, Sable has been able to agree several income generating deals within the past few months, which should buy the company some time. \nNevertheless, over the long term it's difficult to tell what the future holds for Sable. The company has spent years acquiring a portfolio of potentially world class iron ore assets, but the iron ore market is in turmoil. After years of ramping up supply to meet demand from China, the market is now oversupplied and Chinese demand is falling. \nAs a result, iron ore prices are expected to remain flat over the next two years and it's unlikely that banks will want to provide the financing for new iron ore mines with such a dismal outlook for the sector. \nThe bottom line \nOverall, it's difficult to place a value on Sable's shares at present. Although the company has plenty of potential, it's almost impossible to value the shares with so many risks ahead. \nIf you're looking for a company with a more predictable outlook, The Motley Fool's top analysts have recently identified a company that they consider to be one of the market's \"top small caps\" . \nAll is revealed in our new free report entitled \"Is This Stock Tomorrow's Big Winner?\" \nDon't delay, download the free report today -- but hurry, it's only available for a limited time. \nRupert Hargreaves has no position in any shares mentioned.
