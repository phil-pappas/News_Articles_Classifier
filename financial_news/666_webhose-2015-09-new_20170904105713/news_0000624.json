Transport also saw modest revenue gains both on-quarter and on-year, while the mining sector enjoyed a rare bounce back, with on-quarter revenue gains indicating demand strength in parts of the economy.\n\nRetail and property saw on-quarter weakening, but those results were stable and improved, respectively, on-year.\n\nDeflation nation? \n\nView gallery Getty Images. Current market perceptions of China are \"thoroughly divorced\" from the reali … Concerns over deflation in China, fueled by the plummeting producer price index (PPI), are overblown, according to CBB. \n\n\"Official inflation gauges are being misrepresented. A common story is that the CPI [consumer price index] reflects wages, and the PPI sales prices, so the recent divergence of the two is eviscerating companies' bottom lines. This is inaccurate,\" Miller said. \n\n\"For now, the CPI is being driven by food, not wages, while the PPI is being driven by imported commodities, not domestic oversupply,\" he said. \nRead More Chinese economy healthier than data suggest: Beige Book \nChina's PPI - a gauge of factory gate prices - fell 5.9 percent, marking the 42nd consecutive month of declines, while CPI rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier.\n\n\"A shrinking labor force means long-term pressure for higher wages, and it is almost impossible for commodities prices to continue to fall as steeply as they have. Federal Reserve take note: true deflation in China remains unlikely,\" Miller added. \nIs monetary stimulus futile? \n\nWhile investors have been calling on the People's Bank of China to further loosen monetary conditions to bolster the flagging economy, Miller says lower interest rates are unlikely to do the trick.\n\n\"Our data, continuing through Q3, show that interest rates have dropped considerably, at banks and shadow financials as well as in terms of bond yields,\" he said. \n\n\"Yet the result was still a downtick in the share of firms that accessed capital-as well as those that sought to do so-tying the lowest levels we have recorded in our survey.\"\n\nWhile this leaves the door open for fiscal support, Miller says China's track record with fiscal stimulus is questionable. \n\n\"The 2009 binge, for example, was carried out through bank loans and corporate investment, not net government spending increases,\" he said. \"While China is not without policy tools, we stand in uncharted territory.\" \n\nMore From CNBC \nChina's problem?
