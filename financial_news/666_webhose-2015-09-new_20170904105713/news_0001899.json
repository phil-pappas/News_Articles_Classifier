Tammy Mrotek, RE/MAX Unlimited Northwest magazine\n magazine 3 percent of agents in the Chicago area received this recognition.\n“I became fascinated with homeownership at a very early age, around seven years old. Growing up in a poor, inner-city Chicago neighborhood, most everyone rented their places to live, including my very young mother. Having a backyard that was not just cement, but an actual lawn to play on was a big deal. If someone owned their home, they were considered well off. I would see real estate signs in front of homes and could not understand why my mother could not just go and buy a nice house for us to live in. The realities of economics took over as I became older, but my desire to help families achieve homeownership is instilled in my very soul. I truly love this profession!” says Tammy.\n“The home buying and selling process can be very stressful.
