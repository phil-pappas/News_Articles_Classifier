Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Commodity prices have bottomed in Australian dollar terms, and mining stocks are cheap, providing an ideal opportunity to buy, fund manager Charlie Aitken says.\nThe macro-themes of China and the Fed have overshadowed the fact that key commodity prices have been steadily rising, the former stockbroker and founder of Aitken Investment Management said.\n\"No one's mentioned in the last month that iron ore's actually gone up, oil prices have gone up, the Australian dollar has come down, so Australian dollar commodity prices have actually bottomed in my view,\" Mr Aitken said in a television interview this week.\nMr Aitken said he was building positions in the low-cost, diversified miners – namely BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto – in Australia as well as their UK listings.\nAustralian exports have been the main driver of iron ore price volatility Citi Research \"I don't think I'm going to get instant gratification from BHP or Rio, but if I look at it, I think there's value there,\" he said.\n\"They may not produce me much return in the short term, but they're cheap; they're half the price they used to be.\"\nMr Aitken's bullish comments came before a horror 24 hours for mining stocks. BHP fell 5 per cent in trade in London, while Rio fell 3 per cent. The sell-off continued on the ASX on Wednesday.\nIron ore fell almost 2 per cent overnight, with iron ore for delivery to the Chinese port of Qingdao buying $US56.21 a tonne.\nIron ore prices have tracked steadily higher since the plunge driven by China's sharemarket turmoil Bloomberg While the third quarter of 2015 delivered flat to negative returns for all market-traded commodities, well underperforming all other asset classes, Citigroup's global team of analysts is expecting a \"tempered\" recovery in commodity prices in the fourth quarter.\nChina is still the big theme Citi Research, led by global head of commodities Edward Morse, said: \"It's hard to argue that most commodity prices have reached their trough for the year.\"\nChina is still the big theme for the last three months of 2015. Citi is forecasting stimulus from China's policy makers to boost economic growth by year's end, lifting energy, industrial commodities and bulk commodity prices.\nChina had stoked the rout in the third quarter, particularly through the shock devaluation of its currency against its US dollar peg and the equity market turmoil.\nBut only extreme risk events, such as a rapid increase in Chinese growth and supply disruptions in oil from the Middle East, can reverse the prospect of weaker prices, which Citigroup expects to continue into next year.\nIron ore would particularly struggle as more supply entered into the market, bringing down prices even amid rebounding steel production, Citigroup said.\nAustralian exports in particular have fuelled iron ore price volatility, as supply pulled back in July and August. This weaker supply resulted in a lift in prices, but normalising exports and the start up of Roy Hill should lift export volumes in the coming months.\nOversupply remained the biggest threat to commodity prices, Citigroup said.\nThe longer the US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates at near zero, the longer the flightiness of capital and volatility in commodity prices remain.\nCitigroup said: \"For the past two years, a significant amount of price change and volatility can be attributed to low interest rates and investors' aggressive search for short-term return.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-23T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:05:53.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
