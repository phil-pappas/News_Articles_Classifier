It will include a state dinner at the White House hosted by President Barack Obama. \n“The Chinese government staunchly upholds cyber security, firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks in accordance with law,” Chinese Embassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan said in a statement earlier this week. \nHe said China wants enhanced dialogue and cooperation with the United States and that “groundless speculation, hyping up or accusation is not helpful to solve the problem.” \nThe U.S. government has suffered a series of embarrassing cyber attacks in recent months, including one on the White House Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that potentially provided a treasure trove of data about government employees to foreign spies. \nU.S. officials suspect that attack was linked to China, which has denied any involvement in hacking U.S. databases and says it too has been a victim of cyber attacks. \nThe sanctions Washington is currently considering would not target suspected hackers of government data, but rather foreign citizens and firms believed responsible for cyber attacks on commercial enterprises, one U.S. official said. \nIf taken, the action would be the administration’s first use of an executive order signed by Obama in April to crack down on foreign hackers accused of penetrating U.S. computer systems. \n(Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Sandra Maler, David Storey and Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:55:42.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
