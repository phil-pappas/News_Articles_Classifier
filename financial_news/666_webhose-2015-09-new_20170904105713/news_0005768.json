The flagship site will have a full convenience offering including an Engen Quickshop with a sit-down Corner Bakery.” \nFor Inhambane, Cook said plans are to complete construction on both sites by the end of the year. \nThe first Inhambane site will be a knock-down revamp to bring it to its full potential size-wise and to match the high global environmental, safety and quality standards of Engen’s retail offerings. \n“This site is showing tremendous promise. Demand has exceeded current capacity, so it was ripe for a full rebuild with a complete convenience offering and Corner Bakery. Previously there was no Quickshop,” said Cook. \nEngen started construction on the second Inhambane site in August. The brand-new service station will feature a sit-down Corner Bakery and completion is planned for the end of 2015. \nEngen currently operates 16 services stations in Mozambique. \nKotze said the current expansion activity signals Engen’s seriousness about the Mozambican market. \n“This is a key market for us, as demonstrated by our continued retail expansion and a new depot we’ve just inaugurated in Beira. The depot opens up another corridor of supply into southern Africa, taking pressure off our Durban refinery and ensuring greater security of supply in the region. The expanding retail network is, we believe, indication of Mozambique’s economic growth.” \nEngen currently operates in 18 countries in Sub Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands. \n– CAJ News \nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=8293 Posted by Admin on Sep 21 2015.
