New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) orders have dried up and he has no idea how profitable his firm will be next year and beyond. \nThe outlook for companies such as Hunting (Other OTC: HNTIF - news ) , where Rose is finance director, seems grim as clients in the energy industry have already cancelled $200 billion in investments due to weak oil prices, and more cuts are likely. \nThere are exceptions among the businesses that supply oil and gas projects with anything from anti-corrosion paint to computer software that simulates pipeline installation. \nThose active in areas where oil and gas can be extracted cheaply are doing better, while diversified groups with strong finances are trying to snap up weaker rivals. \nBut benchmark crude is back below $50 a barrel after rallying in the spring, and prices above $100 - as they were until mid-2014 - are a distant memory. The energy producers are therefore saving hard by cutting or cancelling projects, hurting their suppliers who rely heavily on plentiful order books. \nThis makes financial planning difficult, if not impossible, for services firms like Hunting, a British-based group founded in 1874. Rose may exaggerate to make his point, but the problem is clear. \n\"I haven't got an order book. We don't know if revenue will continue at the current rate or whether it will decline,\" he told Reuters last month. \"What is Hunting going to deliver in terms of profitability? I haven't got a clue.\" \nEuropean oil and gas services companies performed relatively strongly in the first six months of 2015 as they worked through the backlog of existing orders. But delivering these results, they also warned of tough times ahead. \nTheir typically well-fed project pipelines are running thin towards the end of next year, with little sign they will be replenished quickly. \n\"The backlogs of oil service companies tend to look light in aggregate for second half 2016 due to the time lag of installation work start-up from project sanction and award,\" said Rohan Murphy, energy equities analyst at Allianz Global Investors. \"I am concerned by this threat.\" \nPROJECT VOID \nThe FTSE All Share Oil Equipment and Services index has fallen 14.4 percent since early May, when crude prices started slipping again after the brief upturn, and analysts expect many of the stocks to fall further as they factor in the full impact of the project void. \nIn a worst-case scenario where oil prices don't recover until 2017 and energy companies reduce spending further, analysts at Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) said the five most affected companies would jointly need as much as $7 billion in capital to stay in business. They named these as Italy's Saipem (Other OTC: SAPMY - news ) , Swiss Transocean and France's CGG (NYSE: CGG - news ) , plus Seadrill (Hamburg: 2171269.HM - news ) and Subsea 7 (Other OTC: ACGYF - news ) of Norway. \nGRAPHIC: Oil equipment & services share index vs oil price: http://link.reuters.com/jak65w", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:26:27.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
