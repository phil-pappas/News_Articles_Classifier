The pledge came after a New York Times story detailed the company's financial support for the Global Energy Balance Network. The story said the group promotes the idea that people are overly fixated on how much they're eating, rather than how much they're exercising.\nIn a video announcing the network, one of the group's leaders had said the media focuses on \"eating too much, eating too much, eating too much — blaming fast food, blaming sugary drinks, and so on.\"\nSome health and nutrition advocates say it has become common for food companies to try and deflect criticism about their products by talking about the need for more physical activity.\nFollowing criticism sparked by the New York Times story, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said he was disappointed the company's actions created \"more confusion and mistrust\" and vowed to be more transparent. The maker of Sprite, Dasani and Powerade said its transparency effort will start in the U.S., and expand internationally.\n\"We understand that our efforts in dealing with the obesity epidemic are not seen as credible, so we must — and want to — do better,\" said Sandy Douglas, president of Coca-Cola North America, in a statement Tuesday.\nIn a post on its website, Coca-Cola said it spent $21.8 million on scientific research since 2010. It also spent $96.8 million on \"health and well-being partnerships,\" including payments to dozens of dietitians and others who share their views with the public.\nIn March, The Associated Press reported that Coca-Cola had worked with fitness and nutrition experts who each suggested a mini-Coke or mini-soda as a snack in columns for American Hearth Month in February. The pieces appeared on nutrition blogs and other sites.\nCoca-Cola's website lets users search its partnerships and research efforts by keyword and year. The organizations it has provided money to include The Obesity Society and the American Diabetes Association.\nYoni Freedhoff, a nutrition and obesity expert at the University of Ottawa, said the disclosures by Coca-Cola provide a degree of transparency, but said the information doesn't necessarily capture what Coca-Cola got in return from the organizations.\n\"Consciously or unconsciously, (the organizations) might pause before saying anything that would in turn be negative for their funders,\" Freedhoff said.\nThe Global Energy Balance Network previously had not listed its funding source on its website, but posted it after Freedhoff pointed out the oversight to the group. The network has said that the suggestion that its work promotes \"the idea that exercise is more important than diet in addressing obesity vastly oversimplifies this complex issue.\"\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\nHealth Care Industry Coca-Cola", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:55:13.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
