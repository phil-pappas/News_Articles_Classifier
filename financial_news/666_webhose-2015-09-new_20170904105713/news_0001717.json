Rosario said that only 39 per cent of the Nampula population have access to safe drinking water, compared to 50 per cent nationally (and a target of 75 per cent in the government's five year programme for 2015-2019), \nElectricity reaches 20 per cent of the province's population, compared with 45 per cent nationally, and that electricity is often of poor quality. 20.2 per cent of the Nampula road network is tarred, compared with 23 per cent nationally. Some districts with great economic potential, such as Mogovolas, Angoche, Moma and Mogincual, have no tarred roads at all. \nBearing these challenges in mind, he added, the priorities defined by the government for Nampula over the next five years include completing the tarred road from Nampula city to Cuamba, in the neighbouring province of Niassa; tarring the road from Nampula city southwards, to Nametil, with prospects of reaching Angoche and Moma, on the coast; rehabilitating the port of Nacala; and building a new power line from Caia, in Sofala province, to Nacala. \nThe new transmission line is of critical importance for Nampula's power supplies. Currently the entire province is dependent on the centre-north power line from the Cahora Bassa dam. When this line was knocked out by floods in Zambezia province in January which felled ten pylons, Nampula, and the northernmost provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, were deprived of power from the national grid for a month. A new line to Nacala will provide a back-up, ensuring that there should be no repetition of the January black-outs. \nNacala port, with its road and rail links, and the new Nacala international airport “give this province an unparalleled opportunity to play a preponderant role in the economic integration of SADC (Southern African Development Community), as well as in linking southern Africa with the world”, said Rosario. \nOne of the pillars of the government programme, the Prime Minister stressed, is improving the business environment. This involved “public-private dialogue” and Rosario said the government has been undertaking initiatives with the Confederation of Mozambican Business Associations (CTA) seeking to boost this dialogue. \n“We recommend that this initiatives be replicated and consolidated in the provinces, districts and municipalities”, he said. \n“Our conviction is that through permanent dialogue we can together overcome obstacles that causes difficulties for the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises, which are the backbone for creating jobs, and increasing the productivity and competitiveness of our economy”, Rosario added.
