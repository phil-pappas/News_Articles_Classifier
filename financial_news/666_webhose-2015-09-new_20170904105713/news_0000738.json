Photo: Kerrie Leishman\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a leader in possession of a large organisation must be in want of a dog. How else can we explain the most ubiquitous failing of leaders? Loyalty can be a leader's greatest strength, but it can also be their greatest weakness. We expect our leaders to show enough strength to stand by their staff when the flak is flying. We also expect leaders to have great vision. Blind loyalty is for dog lovers not leaders.\nThere is no clearer recent example of this problem than recently deposed Tony Abbott. In many ways admirably, he stuck by his Chief of Staff, Peta Credlin, to the very end, defending her in his last speech as Prime Minister. However, if political commentary is to be believed, he refused to see the points of view of his ministers and other colleagues who allegedly found it hard to work with her. Some have suggested that his failure to act against Credlin was the tipping point in his loss of power.\nThis scenario is played out time and again in organisations where leaders surround themselves with a praetorian guard of loyal deputies. Relationships develop, and the leader either comes to rely on their close colleagues, or may be invested in them because they are the captain's pick. This is fine when things are going well and the deputies are performing well. However when the deputies are not performing the trouble starts.\nWhile John Getty's maxim, \"if you haven't got a problem, you haven't got a job\" is true, that we employ people to solve our problems, it also applies to leaders. They are there to solve the problems that their staff collectively cannot. When the deputies are failing, the communication to the leader can become distorted, filtered and partial. The leader sees a loyal deputy who is unfairly maligned and this is the fatal mistake. Essentially, the leader takes the side of one senior person in preference to a large number of usually more junior colleagues.\nAdvertisement The problem is one of perspective. Junior colleagues are likely to frame complaints from their own perspective that is usually narrower, and can seem trivial, self-serving or even blame shifting. Leaders become desensitised to the low-level background barking or even howling that is inevitable in any organisation. After all, nothing will be achieved if first, all objections must be overcome. The challenge for the leader is to detect a signal in the noise. This is far from easy. It is a strong leader who resists the temptation to dismiss such complaints as trivial yapping when considered against the bigger strategic picture. When those complaints build into a chorus of disapproval it is a strong leader whose loyalty extends beyond the confines of their office.\nLoyalty is an essential and admirable strength of effective leaders. However, our strengths are our limitations. As Tony Abbott discovered too late, barking dogs can bite too.\nJim Bright is Professor of Career Education and Development at ACU and owns Bright and Associates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:15:49.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
