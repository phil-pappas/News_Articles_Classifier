Tepid global demand is also hurting manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy.\nA report on Tuesday showed the manufacturing industry braked to a more than two-year low in August, with some economists blaming the slowdown on the recent global stock market sell-off.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.9 percent in July after a previously reported 1.8 percent increase in June.\nThe dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinationals.\nOrders for transportation equipment rose 5.5 percent in July as bookings for motor vehicles and parts increased 4.0 percent, the largest gain in a year. Orders for automobiles are likely to remain strong after sales surged in August.\nIn July, there were increases in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computers and electronic products.\nThe Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 2.1 percent instead of the 2.2 percent rise reported last month.\nShipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.6 percent in July, unchanged from last month's estimate.\nInventories of factory goods slipped 0.1 percent after three straight months of gains. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, unchanged from June.\nThat suggests manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters. Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.2 percent, increasing for a second straight month.\n(Reporting By Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by Andrea Ricci )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:14:22.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
