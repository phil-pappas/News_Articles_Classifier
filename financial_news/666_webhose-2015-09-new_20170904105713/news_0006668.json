Customers in 52 countries can now send money transfers from the WorldRemit app to all bank accounts in Pakistan.\nThe State Bank of Pakistan has found that Pakistanis living overseas sent remittances amounting to $13.3 billion in first three quarters of 2014-2015, a year on year increase of 15%.\nWorldRemit launches its new Pakistan service in the middle of the Eid ul Adha festival, when remittances to the country traditionally surge.\nRemittances play an essential role in alleviating poverty and increasing economic growth in countries such as Pakistan.\nAlix Murphy, senior mobile analyst at WorldRemit, comments: “For too long the Pakistani diaspora has had to deal with inconvenient and unnecessarily old-fashioned money transfer services. Using the WorldRemit app, Pakistanis abroad can now send money home just like an instant message.”\nIn February 2015 WorldRemit received a $100m investment round led by Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV), early investors in Facebook, Spotify and Dropbox.\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12977233.htm\nInformation contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
