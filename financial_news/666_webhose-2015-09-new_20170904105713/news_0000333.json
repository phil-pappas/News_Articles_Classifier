In fact, she told YouTube that at age 8, she said, “I can broke stocks.”[/tweet_Quote: ] [caption id=\"attachment_489503702\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] KANSAS CITY, MO - SEPTEMBER 21: Musician Taylor Swift performs onstage at Sprint Center on September 21, 2015 in Kansas City, Missouri.

Unlike the Generation Xers before them, who saw the pre-stock market bubble with dot com stocks flying sky high, millennials have heard that jobs are hard to come by, student debt is crushing and investing is risky.The millennials began their careers in the most challenging economic and labor environment since the beginning of World War II. Many of them are working simply to get ahead of their debt, and haven’t yet had time to get interested in investing. A 2014 Wells Fargo Millennial study found that 45 percent of millennials are not saving for retirement.Millennials are often described as lazy or impatient and afraid of investing. My opinion is that they’re neither lazy nor afraid. Instead, they are indifferent. To get them interested, we must get them engaged. To draw their engagement, we need to listen to their questions and speak their language.How to start the investment conversation: [tweet_Quote: display=\"Show them that even a small amount of investing goes a long way. #invest @sungroupwp\"]Show them that even a small amount of investing goes a long way.[/tweet_Quote: ] [caption id=\"attachment_488770866\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] CHICAGO, IL - SEPTEMBER 17: Traders in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) wait for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on September 17, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. Citing global economic concerns, the Fed chose to leave interest rates unchanged. The news was met with a round of boos in the pit. The Fed is still expected to raise rates later this year.

Experian reports that student loan debt is the only type of consumer debt not decreasing. In the years since 2008, nationwide student loan debt has jumped 84 percent with 40 million Americans paying off student loan .This debt sidelines many millennials, causing them to miss out on their biggest advantage – time – as well as employer 401K and HAS matches.Share with your millennial clients that saving even $50 or $100 each month adds up over time if invested in the proper savings vehicles. Capitalize on their reliance on Smartphones and mobile devices. According to Investopedia, “ Millennials check their phones as many as 43 times daily .” The Wall Street Journal reports that “the app store is the top technology vehicle millennials use to discover a new brand. [Additionally] researchers found that 57 percent of millennials prefer an app experience over a mobile web browser experience.”This generation, born in the Eighties and Nineties, respects corporations that embrace technology. A study of Smartphone-owning millennials, conducted by Annalect , found that “a brands’ use of technology can be a competitive differentiator. When asked to choose whether the technology being used by a brand or the brand’s name would be more important when making a product or service purchase, 52 percent chose the brands’ use of technology.”Millennials, often dubbed the instant gratification generation, are accustomed to finding information, products and services at the swipe of finger. This group is learning about investing online, via social media and discussion groups. [tweet_Quote: display=\"Educate them about the savings options available. #invest #millennials @sungroupwp\"]Educate them about the savings options available.[/tweet_Quote: ] In early 2015, CNN Money reported the findings from a Capital One Share Builder survey of millennials and investing. This group answered less than half the questions correctly on a State Street financial literacy test, down significantly from the generations before them.This lack of knowledge, coupled with their negative financial experience, has resulted in an absence of trust. That same study found that 93 percent of millennials (ages 25 to 34) distrust the stock markets and lack confidence about investing.Who can blame them for distrusting the market? They’ve witnessed unprecedented volatility with the dotcom bubble and the Great Recession.Those who do invest are putting a greater percent of their retirement savings in cash and fixed-income assets than previous generations – the surveyed results range between 40 and 75 percent. Their conservative financial habits have been compared to the young adults who entered the workforce out of the Great Depression.Educating young investors about their options will alleviate their mistrust and encourage them to enter into investments that feel secure. The tide is turning. A survey from BlackRock found that “45 percent of Millennials are more interested in investing in the stock market today than they were just five years ago.” This is a very optimistic generation who is committed to protecting their financial future.When they do buy stock, they tend to buy what they know or invest in companies “with a cause.” For example, 13 percent of millennial investors own Apple stock, according to research from Wells Fargo and TD Ameritrade. Two other Top Ten stock buys are electric car company, Tesla , and Alibaba , which is China’s version of eBay.According to the U.S. Census , Millennials make up a quarter of our nation’s populace, now outnumbering Baby Boomers. They are a more diverse group than previous generations and, since they are “plugged in” 24/7 via their mobile devices, they tend to process information at a rapid pace. Provide them with the investment information they need and they will succeed with it.
