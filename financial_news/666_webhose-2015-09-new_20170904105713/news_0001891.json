This is the company's sixth STACR offering this year. \nIn addition, Freddie Mac will now provide STACR preliminary payment disclosure on the 4th business day of the month following the release of PC disclosures instead of the 25th. \n\"The STACR market is becoming more sensitive to prepayment speeds, and these changes provide investors with access to the information as soon as possible,\" said Mike Reynolds, Freddie Mac vice president of Credit Risk Transfer. \"Our goal is to be attuned to what the market is looking for and to adjust our disclosures accordingly.\" \nThe STACR 2015-HQA1 offering of $872 million will represent the company's third transaction where losses will be allocated based on the actual losses realized on the related reference obligations instead of allocating losses using a fixed severity approach. \nWith STACR 2015-HQA1, Freddie Mac is issuing 100 basis points of first loss. Freddie Mac holds the senior loss risk in the capital structure and a portion of the risk in the Class M-1, M-2 and M-3, and the first loss Class B tranche. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch and Nomura will serve as co-lead managers and joint bookrunners. Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas are co-managers, and Williams Capital is a selling group member. \nSTACR 2015-HQA1 has a reference pool of Single-Family mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of more than $19 billion. The reference pool consists of a subset of 30-year fixed-rate Single-Family mortgages acquired by Freddie Mac between August 1, 2014, and November 30, 2014, with LTVs from 80 to 95 percent. \nFreddie Mac will hold an issuer presentation at the ABS East Conference in Miami on Sept. 17, 2015. Freddie Mac leaders will provide updates on its credit risk transfer initiatives, including the award-winning STACR program, and the company's servicing and REO disposition practices. \nThis announcement is not an offer to sell any Freddie Mac securities.
