While delivering the order, Justice Gautam S Patel also passed several strictures on NSE. He said, \"The suit and the NSE’s conduct seem to me attempts at deflection and evasion. I also believe this entire action to be a gross abuse of the process of this Court. The NSE seems to have taken it more or less for granted that our Courts are too easily cowed by self-congratulatory assertions and overblown claims of rectitude to even consider refusing their claim. This is an approach that must be deprecated, and there is only one way to do that when dealing with an institution like the NSE. Our Courts are not to be treated as playgrounds for imagined and imaginary slights for those who command considerable resources.\" The case related with NSE filing a suit against Moneywise Media Pvt Ltd (publishers of Moneylife), Ms Dalal, Managing Editor and Mr Basu, Editor & Publisher of Moneylife for writing two articles and calling for investigation on algo or high-frequency trading. Terming the articles as defamatory, NSE had filed the suit in the HC. Ms Dalal had received copy of a letter addressed to DGM of SEBI from a whistleblower on 22 January 2015. After making several enquiries, on 11 June 2015, she sent an email to SEBI Chairman UK Sinha, NSE's Vice Chairman Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna, Managing Director and Chief Executive of the Exchange. There was no answer. Ms Dalal then on 15th June sent a reminder, which also met with silence from NSE. On 16 June 2015, Ms Dalal sent an SMS to Mr Narain and Ms Ramakrishna and there was still no response. She on 19 June 2015 wrote an article for crowd-sourcing investigation on a whistleblower account detailing how NSE’s system has been exploited. (Read: Blowing the Whistle on Manipulation in NSE ) After receiving feedback and inputs from several people, Ms Dalal on 8 July 2015 wrote another article calling for a detailed probe in the high-frequency trades. (Read: High-frequency Trading Needs a Detailed Probe ). NSE had filed a case after the second article was published. The HC noted that there were three distinct communications from Ms Dalal to the two persons at the NSE, best placed to answer the questions, she raised. The Court said, \"Ms Dalal’s query to Mr Ravi Narain and Ms Chitra Ramakrishna was no idle accusation. She had then not gone to press with her article. She took the trouble firstly to make her own investigations, and then specifically to solicit the views of the two persons who manage and run the NSE. I do not believe she was duty-bound to do more. She had with her a damning letter, albeit anonymous, but one that contained a welter of detail that could not be denied and that, on my reading of it, certainly calls for a response, irrespective of the source. To decry this as the handiwork of a disgruntled individual or to belittle the anonymous author is, I think, in this day and age of the statutory recognition of what are called ‘whistleblowers’, to attempt to deny the undeniable. To say that there must be material from which a person may draw a conclusion is only half the story… it might certainly be enough to lead one to a conclusion that the addressees of this letter had nothing in fact to say in response at all. The only alternative to that view is again a point that Ms. Dalal makes in her articles, viz., that the persons in charge at the NSE felt it beneath them to deign to respond to what is indubitably a very serious case made manifestly in the public interest.\" Justice Patel said, \"There is not even a whisper of these communications in the plaint. Even today, despite the amendment, there is no explanation as to why these two persons chose not to respond to Ms. Dalal. What is stated in paragraph 18A of the plaint cannot be new. It was then known to the NSE. If it is indeed a complete answer, it ought to have been provided. It was not; and we are left to speculate as to why the NSE did not think it necessary to provide the response when it was sought.\" In the rejoinder of its Plaint, the Exchange, under paragraph 18A stated, \"It is impossible for any trading member to ensure a particular position in a queue in the port since such a position is automatically allocated by the network card and cannot be tweaked manually. There are maximum 30 trading members per port. The time lag between the first person and the last person (depending on the load) is maximum 50 micro seconds (1 micro second = 1 millionth of a second) which by no stretch of imagination can confer any advantage to any person.” \"To begin with, I believe this paragraph is yet another attempt at misdirection,\" Justice Patel said, adding, \"The anonymous letter specifically mentions the advantages paragraph 18A tries to deny, possibly in the hope that the judicial mind can safely be presumed to be ignorant of all matters technical and too easily overawed by an outpouring of technical jargon.\" \"I note that paragraph 18A does not even begin to address the very many technical questions pointedly raised in the letter and to which Ms Dalal drew the NSE’s attention. Instead, that paragraph cherry-picks one isolated facet that possibly relates to an earlier point in the history of the NSE’s systems automation and presents that as a ‘complete’ answer. Indeed, it is not. And this is telling: for at least now, after the suit was filed, the NSE had the undeniable opportunity to deal with the technical aspects. It has chosen not to do so, and the reasons that suggest themselves are, in my estimation, and I expect in the estimation of any rational-minded person who went through this carefully, precisely those that Ms Dalal outlined in her articles. It is certainly not insignificant that the letter in question outlines a typical instance with figures of how these advantages can be obtained,\" Justice Patel added.
