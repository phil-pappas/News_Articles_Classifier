The ruling was handed down by FIFA's ethics committee, which began investigating Warner's activities after allegations of a corruption scandal broke in the spring. Warner had been a FIFA vice president and member of the executive committee. \"Mr. Warner was found to have committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions at FIFA and CONCACAF,\" said FIFA. CONCACAF stands for the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football. Warner had been president of CONCACAF from 1990 until 2011, when he was suspended and later stepped down. FIFA said Warner was a \"key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments.\" The Swiss attorney general's office last Friday opened a criminal probe into FIFA President Sepp Blatter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:34:19.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
