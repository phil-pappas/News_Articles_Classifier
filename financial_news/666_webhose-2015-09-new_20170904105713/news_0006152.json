But just how socialist is the U.S. -- the largest capitalist country in the world -- even without Sanders? \nCatching up on your political science terminology, socialism is a form of government in which \"economic and political system based on public or collective ownership of the means of production,\" according to Investopedia . A purely socialist state is one in which the state is responsible for 100% of economic output and spends all of it on social programs, making individuals dependent on the state for everything from food to health care. Of course, the U.S. government isn't \"socialist\" by this standard -- even after universal health care from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare -- yet there are some states that spend more of their output on social programs than others. Web site Insider Monkey first brought attention to the degree of socialism within the 50 states in 2010, determining \"socialist states\" by using state revenue data divided by state GDP data and developing a ratio. The higher the proportion of state revenues to GDP, the more \"socialist,\" the thinking went. We attempted to reach out to the article's author to discuss her methodology, but did not get a response. As well, TheStreet 's sister site, MainStreet , also used a very top-down approach in 2010 to analyze which states in the union were more \"socialist\" than others by measuring total state expenditures as a proportion of its total economic output to compare the size of the public sector in each state. MainStreet 's 2010 article used state gross domestic product figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and state expenditure figures from the National Association of State Budget Officers, to come up with the 10 least and the 10 most socialist states in America. By dividing the latter by the former, tallies the proportion of the state's economic output that is used by the state and its people for collective spending. Since state expenditures and revenues are often very similar, the lists yielded similar results. Yet, academics called the methodology flawed. \"It is hogwash,\" said Richard D. Wolff, Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \"You don't capture [state socialism levels] by a fraction of government spending at the top and GDP at the bottom.\" Dean Stansel, a research associate professor at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business, also didn't think much of it. \"Most observers of state and local fiscal policy would agree that Illinois being on a 'least socialist' list, especially up so high, is a sign that something's substantially wrong with the methodology,\" Stansel wrote in an emailed response after reviewing the article . \"The same would be said for California and New York NOT being on the 'most socialist' list.\" Stansel noted that looking at only state spending excludes the amount used on local spending. \"States vary substantially in how they distribute total state and local spending between state and local governments, so this creates a sizable distortion,\" he wrote. Additionally, NASBO's data only identifies \"general fund spending,\" which leaves out items like grants to local governments and insurance trust spending (unemployment insurance, workers' comp., etc.), he noted. Nonetheless, TheStreet refreshed MainStreet's 2010 story using 2014 state GDP figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis as well as the total state expenditures for fiscal year 2014 from NASBO's most recent report . Many of the most socialist states on the list are among the most conservative politically -- with the top five all solidly red states. ( The District of Columbia was not included in NASBO's annual expenditure report. ) \nHere are the 10 \"most socialist\" states in ascending order. Read to the end to see which state is the most socialist.
