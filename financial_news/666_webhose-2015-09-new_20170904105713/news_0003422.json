Most other euro zone yields were down 2-4 bps.\nThe ECB comments come after the U.S. Federal Reserve prolonged the era of nearly free money by not hiking interest rates last week, citing global economic risks.\n\"I'm not too convinced that they are signalling they are ready to do something in October, but it does support our view that if nothing changes between now and December, the ECB may have to add more stimulus,\" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.\nTo some analysts, the U.S. economy looked robust enough to justify a hike, but a slowdown in China and a slump in oil and commodity prices hurting the inflation outlook across the world tilted the balance towards a delay of what would be the first hike in a decade.\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said last week's decision to leave rates unchanged was largely a \"risk management\" exercise to be sure recent market volatility would not become a drag on the U.S. economy.\nHe said he still expects the Fed to hike rates later this year.\nThe spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and their lower-yielding German counterpart has widened by almost 15 basis points this month to just over 150 basis points, reflecting the divergent monetary policy outlooks in the two regions.\nSpanish 10-year yields were up 1 basis point at 2.02 percent, while Portuguese yields rose 3 bps to 2.62 percent.\nIn Spain, investors worry a win for secessionists in a regional election in wealthy Catalonia on Sunday could trigger political instability. In Portugal, the Oct. 4 elections are likely to produce a hung parliament.\nOn the supply side, the Netherlands raised 2.8 billion euros at a three-year bond auction. The April 2018 bond was issued in January and has never traded with a positive yield.
