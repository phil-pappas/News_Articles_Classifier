As per our analysis, roads, railways (civil construction), metro rail, power T&D, the Dedicated Freight Corridor and renewable energy are the key business segments which are likely to drive order flow growth in 2016-17,” it added.\nHowever the report said macro trends suggest a weak business momentum.\n“We note that most macro indicators such as growth in freight traffic through rail, road and ports as well as energy consumption through power supply, coal, LNG and gasoline are still witnessing weak business momentum after a spurt in 2014-15 post-elections,” it said.\nThe report, to corroborate its hypothesis, analysed the quarterly revenue trends for the past 12 quarters for 51 industrial and infra companies having a presence across 20 business verticals.\n“Our analysis suggests that growth for most short-cycle based industrial products (ex-rail wagons & industrial cables) has been decelerating, which corroborates our view that a recovery in industrial capex is likely to be back-ended versus infra capex,” it added.\nIt, however, noted that the growth for product exports is robust, mainly led by the rupee depreciation.\nThe BofA-ML analysis suggests that demand for consumption products such as home cables, lights and fans and scooters are showing signs of fatigue after an acceleration, post elections.\n“While growth for air-conditioners has been robust for the past few quarters, it was impacted in Q1 of 2015-16 led by unseasonal rains. Growth in passenger vehicles and paints has been moderate, but is registering a sustained recovery,” it added.\n 08, 2015 11:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:31:59.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
