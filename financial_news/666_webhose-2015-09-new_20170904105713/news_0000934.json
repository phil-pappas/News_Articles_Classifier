Bloomberg by Matthew Stevens\nBHP Billiton's membership of a new coalition of high powered commerce with the lofty aim of assisting the transformation of emerging nations into low carbon economies says much about the gathering pressures of climate change on those who make money in the fossil fuel cycle and just as much about the Global Australian's radically changed view of its place in the world.\nBHP was formally invited to become a foundation member of an \"energy transitions commission\" in a letter to chief executive Andrew Mackenzie penned by Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden.\nThe Shell initiative, which will be formally announced in Houston on Monday, has been made all the more timely by China's confirmation that it is contemplating the imminent introduction of a cap-and-trade carbon trading scheme and of stricter limits on the level of public funding for \"high carbon projects\".\nThis is patently a deeply worrying development for big coal. China's economic development is powered by electricity and that means it sits front and centre to any and all the optimism that the miners can muster about the medium and long-term outlook for coal.\nOrganisations like the World Coal Association are forever cycling comforting International Energy Agency data that says China has 126 coal fired power stations under construction and plans for another 639 more of them. And, for good measure, that India is finishing off 177 new coal units while a further 539 sit on the drawing board.\nOf course, a whole lot of what is promised by the IEA forecasts will play out and coal surely will play a cornerstone role in the transition of these economies and many more as billions of people around the globe join the middle classes.\nBut it rather looks like flaring strategic tension between the US and China has produced a balming alliance between Presidents Obama and Xi on ever firmer action aimed at containing carbon emissions in the name of preventing climate change.\n Plainly the Presidents Two have announced their aligned emissions intent ahead of the next big global climate change summit in Paris and that creates the potential that the world will emerge form December's gathering with something more meaningful and binding than might have been anticipated just a week ago.\nLong-standing commitment China's commitment to stopping the growth of emissions by 2030 is one of relatively long standing. But the policy shifts foreshadowed in US media on Thursday, and the fact that Xi has chosen the US for their announcement, reinforces a belief firm at the top levels of Australian mining that China's President means business on carbon and there will be material change in the Middle Kingdom's future energy mix.\nAll of that, of course, only further informs the need and urgency of Van Beurden's move to establish a new carbon caucus. Shell's pitch is that the fossil fuel industry could most constructively find a way back into the global climate change debate at the point where policy formation on climate change intersected with global and regional economic policy and innovation in energy technology.\nFrom BHP's perspective, the invitation was prescient. Mackenzie entered 2015 determined to lift the breadth, quality and regularity of BHP's contribution to the public and political conversation about climate, trade, transparency and tax.\nThat has happened. Two weeks ago, for example, Mackenzie took the fight for free trade to its intellectual heartland of Washington. This week saw CFO Peter Beaven become an apostle for tax transparency and the need for a global alignment of tax rules. And Friday brought confirmation of BHP increasingly active response to the climate challenge and the threat it poses to the fossil fuel cycle.\nEach of these contributions sits part of a strategy to introduce BHP to a far broader constituency of international influence than was considered relevant to its fate over past years. Mackenzie is determined that BHP will have a voice in centres of policy power like Washington, London and Brussels and that reflects long held views around the role and responsibility of the private sector to produce solutions to the problems they have helped create.\nLike many involved in the fossil fuel cycle, Mackenzie has a confidence resolute that technology sits central to carbon mitigation and that business and government have roles to play in fostering the intellectual and financial capital needed to identify, foster and deploy these solutions.\nThe 15-year mission for Shell's coalition is to manufacture a workable and repeatable blueprint for the economic evolution of the emerging economies in the most carbon efficient way technology can make possible.\nTo that end, along with Australia's biggest company and one of the world's biggest coal producers in BHP Billiton, Shell has recruited General Electric and Dow Chemical to the cause along with Norway's state-controlled oil company Statoil, senior environmental lobbies from both sides of the Atlantic and the Baron of greenhouse economics, the Lord of Brentford Nicholas Stern. It is said that the World Bank has been approached to join the group along with several other agents of multilateralism.\nInterestingly, it is a matter of record, both Stern and Mackenzie have a shared past with Tony Blair's Labor government and that both were elected to the Royal Academy in 2014, so it is hard to believe that BHP's boss did not have something to do with the recruiting here.\nEach of member organisations will be represented by a commissioner (BHP's opening voice will be commercial and market boss Dean Della Valle) and the expectation is that their responsibilities will be divided into \"buckets\" relevant to their individual organisation's interests and experience.\nWith global consultancy McKinsey providing the secretariat, the commission will offer high level policy papers and government advisory on balancing carbon efficiency and economic development, energy security and emerging energy technologies.\nWhile it is not planned that the commission should be an active lobby there can be no question that the identification of the need for a new way is a slap in the face for the other senior lobbies supported by the fossil fuels industries.\nAnimal manure Just finally, hats off to one of our favourite Fair Work commissioners, Danny Cloghan. Outside of routinely making a lot of sense, commissioner Cloghan often demonstrates a fair gift with our wonderful language. And Thursday in Perth delivered us another Cloghan classic in his decision to reject the unfair dismissal claim of a welder who had failed a random alcohol test more than two hours into a shift driving a fork lift around Broome's port.\nThe bloke was sacked after testing 0.026 at a workplace that had a firm zero-tolerance policy for alcohol. As it turned out, our welder had drunk at least 20 cans of full strength beer over a 12 hour Australian Day party and had turned up to work after barely more than four hours of sleep. His case for unfair dismissal was, in part, that this was a genuine mistake, that he had felt \"fine\" and \"okay\" and \"didn't feel like I was affected by alcohol\".\nIn rejecting this proposition Cloghan advised: \"If (this) evidence was put to the 'front bar' that after 20 cans of full strength beer and 4.5 hours of sleep he felt fine, it would be greeted with that very Australian saying relating to animal manure\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:12:03.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
