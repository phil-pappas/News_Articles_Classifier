Follow @kathykristof \nComfort the sick; feed and clothe the poor; provide shelter for the homeless. Pope Francis, who begins his first visit to the U.S. on September 22, has focused on issues of social justice since being named to the Catholic Church’s top slot in 2013. But even before Francis became pope, several mutual funds applied the teachings of the church to their selection of stocks and bonds. In light of the pope’s visit, we’ve taken a look at the stock holdings of three Catholic values fund families—Ave Maria, LKCM Aquinas and Epiphany FFV (FFV stands for Faith and Family Values)—which all base their investment choices on the ecumenical constraints of the church. That means barring investments in companies that facilitate abortions or produce pornography, among other things. See Also: Mutual Funds Fit for a Pope \nEven with these exclusions, Catholic values funds have plenty of companies to choose from. So we took a look at their top holdings in search of attractive stocks. Here are 10 that savvy investors—and even the pope—could love. (Share prices and related figures are as of September 18.) Health care Advertisement \nSpun off from Abbott Labs in January 2013, drugmaker AbbVie (symbol ABBV , $61.22) is owned by two of the three fund companies that specialize in Catholic causes: LKCM’s Aquinas Growth ( AQEGX ) and Epiphany FFV ( EPVNX ). AbbVie is best known for its blockbuster autoimmune drug, Humira, which is used to treat arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis. The stock, which has climbed 74% since AbbVie began trading as a separate entity, has hit a rough patch lately, partly due to worries that the company could lose protection for some of its Humira patents next year. But analysts say that Humira won’t be easy to replicate and, in any case, AbbVie has an impressive list of new medications, treating everything from fibroid tumors to hepatitis C and leukemia, working their way through its labs. Thanks in part to the recent pullback—the stock has dropped 13% since mid-July—the shares sell for just 13 times estimated year-ahead earnings. Plus, the stock yields a healthy 3.3%. By comparison, Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index sells for 16 times estimated year-ahead profits and yields 2.2%. UBS analyst Marc Goodman rates AbbVie a buy, with a one-year price target of $81. \nAbbVie’s former parent, Abbott Labs ( ABT , $43.33) is a top holding in both Ave Maria Growth ( AVEGX ) and Ave Maria Rising Dividend ( AVEDX ) funds. When Abbott spun off its brand-name drug enterprise in AbbVie, it kept its generic pharmaceutical and medical device businesses, which have continued to grow rapidly. Because of the strong dollar, Abbott expects earnings to dip slightly this year. But analysts see profits rebounding by 11.5% next year. The stock trades for 19 times estimated year-ahead earnings and yields 2.2%. William Blair analyst Margaret Kaczor believes the company’s profit estimates are conservative and that the stock is likely to outperform the market over the next year. \nSt. Jude Medical ( STJ , $67.31), which makes heart devices, is among the top holdings of the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund ( AVEMX ). St. Jude, fresh off a restructuring aimed at consolidating its manufacturing and supply-chain operations, is expected to post flat earnings in 2015, then see profits rise by 9% next year. But what makes the shares especially compelling, says William Blair analyst Ben Andrew, is St. Jude’s planned $3.4 billion purchase of Thoratec, a company that makes medical devices designed for patients with advanced heart failure. Andrew says the deal gives St. Jude entrée to a business with annual sales of $1 billion. That will boost St. Jude’s revenues, he says, and revive the stock, which has slumped 13% since mid-July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:12:37.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
