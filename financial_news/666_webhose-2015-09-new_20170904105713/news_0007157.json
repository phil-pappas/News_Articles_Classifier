The company cited several reasons for the layoffs: to reduce prices for its customers, invest in technology upgrades, and improve its cost structure. \n\"We believe this is an important step to evolve Whole Foods Market in a rapidly changing marketplace,\" Co-CEO Walter Robb said in a statement. Additionally, he said that the job cuts will be managed through natural attrition and that the company will offer its employees severance, transition pay, or help them find other jobs within the company. Specifically, the company expects many of the affected workers to find jobs from among the 2,000 open positions available currently at the company, or through new jobs in more than 100 new stores in development. \n\"This is a very difficult decision, and we are committed to treating affected Team Members in a caring and respectful manner,\" Robb added.
