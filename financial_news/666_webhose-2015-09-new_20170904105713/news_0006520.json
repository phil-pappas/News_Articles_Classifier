This was already evident in the last one year or so when mutual funds received impressive inflows,” Jhunjhunwala said.\nThere are 3.37 crore active folios in the equity segment of mutual fund market, Sebi data showed. The mutual fund industry saw inflows of Rs 8,903 crore into equity funds during August, which include ELSS, Amfi data showed. In FY15 so far, MFs have received inflows of Rs 47,948 crore.\nHis views are in line with soaring confidence of retail investors in equities. The markets remained upbeat through out 2014 as the Sensex yielded 30% returns during CY14.\nDomestic institutional investors (DIIs), led by mutual funds, have helped the markets sail through the intense FPI selloff during August.\nResponding to a question about high frequency trading, Jhunjhunwala said: “There shouldn’t be any regulations on Algo trading unless it is found that traders are using the technology to manipulate volumes.”\nFirst Published on September 24, 2015 12:12 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:09:16.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
