IPG -2.02 %\nMagna MGA -3.22 % estimates that programmatic would represent about 31% of the $46 billion display and video ad market this year.\nThe march of the machines continues to grow, despite the fact that many advertisers have concerns about the practice, including the lack of transparency around ad prices, the “viewability” of ads, and the increased rate of ad fraud that can occur when ads are purchased programmatically.\nA study last year showed that ads purchased through programmatic channels are more likely to be loaded by “bots” than non-programmatic ads. Bots are computer programs that mimic the activities of real users.\nThe benefits of programmatic “outweigh the headwinds” that the sector faces, said Luke Stillman, Magna’s associate director of forecasting. Advertisers are drawn to the practice because “they get improved reach, reduced waste, enhanced targeting and access to new audiences,” he said.\n“There are still strong incentives for both sides, publishers and advertisers, to move toward programmatic,” said Vincent Letang, Magna’s director of global forecasting.\nThe problems facing automated ad buying will be among the topics addressed this week during Advertising Week. A panel on Monday entitled “Transparency and Openness in Programmatic” will explore the issue.\nAbout 81% of the expected automated ad spending this year, Magna said, will be done through real-time bidding systems, in which machines automatically bid for inventory within milliseconds of inventory becoming available.\nThe U.S. continues to lead the push into automated buying, with about $7.7 billion worth of ad spending expected to be done through automated systems this year.\nMagna estimates that automated ad buying will reach $36.8 billion (50% of the display and video spend) by 2019.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KN078_CMOpro_E_20150928112647.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:41:06.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
