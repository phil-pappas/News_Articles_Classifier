The ISM service sector PMI fell to 59 last month from 60.3 in July.\nElsewhere in the Americas, activity in Brazil's services sector fell for the sixth straight month in August, but contracted at a slower pace than in July, according to HSBC/Markit.\nThe more modest contraction, combined with a downturn in the manufacturing sector, lifted HSBC's Composite PMI to 44.8 in August from 40.8 in July, but nevertheless suggested Brazil's recession may have deepened in recent months.\n\"This bodes ill for the Brazilian economy, which will likely see further declines in activity in upcoming months,\" said Pollyanna De Lima, an economist with Markit.\nEURO ZONE PICTURE BRIGHTER\nBusiness activity in the euro zone accelerated at its fastest pace in more than four years in August, according to surveys that highlighted a divergence between laggard France and the other big economies in the currency bloc.\nWhile generally upbeat, the set of surveys still point only to modest third-quarter economic growth growth of about 0.4 percent in July-September, according to Markit.\n\"The upwards momentum that the euro zone economy had has started to fizzle out, and growth no longer seems to be accelerating,\" said Nick Kounis, head of macro and markets research at ABN AMRO.\nMarkit's euro zone service sector PMI rose to 54.4 from July's 54.0, after the manufacturing PMI, released on Tuesday, dipped to 52.3 from 52.4.\nMarkit's final August Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.3, its highest level since May 2011. It has now been above 50 since July 2013.\nItalian firms had their best performance since early 2011 and German growth strengthened. It was a different story in France, the bloc's second biggest economy, where the composite PMI slumped to its lowest since the start of the year.\nOn Thursday the European Central Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts, warning of possible further trouble from China. At the same time, the euro zone central bank pledged to beef up or prolong its economic stimulus if needed, which helped global stock markets rally.\nAugust was disappointing for the British economy too with the Markit/CIPS PMI for the service sector recording its weakest growth since May 2013, just as the Bank of England is considering when to start to raise interest rates.\n\"Let's face it, August was not a pretty month and a number of downside events will have weighed down on business sentiment and activity,\" said Kallum Pickering at Berenberg Bank.\nJAPAN IMPROVES, CHINA STILL A WORRY\nActivity in Japan's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in almost two years in August, easing concerns about economic growth after disappointing industrial production and household spending data for July.\nThe Markit/Nikkei Japan Services PMI which rose to 53.7, the highest since October 2013, from 51.2 in July.\nJapan's economy contracted in April-June as exports and consumer spending weakened. The government is counting on a return to growth in the current quarter to fulfil its pledge to revitalise the economy.\nIndia's service sector grew for a second month in August, keeping pressure on the central bank for another rate cut to bolster a slowing economy. India's Nikkei/Markit services PMI rose to 51.8 in August from 50.8.\nEconomists remain concerned about China, where PMI data earlier this week from Ciaxin/Markit showed activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors slowing. Chinese stock markets, the source of much of the global volatility in recent weeks, were closed for a two-day holiday starting Thursday.\n(Additional reporting by Mike Connor in New York, Brad Haynes in Brazil, Aaradhana Ramesh in Bengaluru, and Stanley White in Tokyo; editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:50:53.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
