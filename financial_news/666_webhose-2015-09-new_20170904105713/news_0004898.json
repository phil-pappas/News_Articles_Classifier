Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (\"MD&A\") have the same meanings as in such Notes. \nOverview \nWe are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the United States (U.S.), Canada, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Brazil, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), Oman, and Bahrain. We also provide vehicle remarketing services in Germany and Spain. \nWe provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the Internet through our Virtual Bidding Third Generation Internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as VB3. Vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies, but also include banks and financial institutions, charities, car dealerships, fleet operators and vehicle rental companies. We sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters and, at certain locations, to the general public. The majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies, or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, minimize administrative and processing costs, and maximize the ultimate sales price. \nIn the U.S. and Canada (North America), Brazil, the U.A.E., Oman, and Bahrain, we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers, as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage. In the U.K., we operate both on a principal basis, purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account, and as an agent. In Germany and Spain, we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies. \nWe monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Such indicators include: \nService and Vehicle Sales Revenue: Our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue, purchased vehicle revenue, and other remarketing services. Revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis, where our fees are fixed based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our Percentage Incentive Program (PIP), where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price. Under the consignment or fixed fee program, we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation. We may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs not included in the consignment fee. Under the consignment program, only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue, not the actual sales price (gross proceeds). Sales \ntransaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles, storage, loading, and annual registration. Transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle, which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own, and is primarily generated in the U.K. We have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal, purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account. We also purchase vehicles in the open market, primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account. \nOur revenue is impacted by several factors, including salvage frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price, as over 50% of our service revenue is associated in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle. Vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by: (i) changes in commodity prices, particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies, as this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling; (ii) used car pricing, which we believe has an impact on salvage frequency; and (iii) the mix of cars sold, as insurance company cars on average command a lower average selling price than non-insurance cars. We cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap, dismantling, retailing or export. We also cannot predict the future movements of these influences. Accordingly, we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing, used car pricing, and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue. Salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs, used car values, and auction returns. Over the last several years, we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in salvage frequency. The increase in salvage frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs. Conversely, increases in used car prices, such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease salvage frequency and adversely affect our growth rate. Used car values are determined by many factors, including the used car supply, which is tied directly to new car sales, and the average age of cars on the road. New car sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars. Additionally, the average age of cars on the road continued to increase, growing from 9.6 years in 2002 to 11.5 years in 2014. These factors, among others, have led to a general decline in used car values while repair costs are generally trending upward. The factors that influence repair costs, used car pricing, and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements. Accordingly, we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency. \nOperating Costs and Expenses: Yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel, equipment maintenance and repair, and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management, accounting, data processing, sales personnel, human resources, professional fees, research and development, and marketing expenses. \nOther Income and Expense: Other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property, foreign exchange rate gains and losses, and gains and losses from the disposal of assets, which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period. Other expense consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 - Long-Term Debt. \nLiquidity and Cash Flows: Our primary source of working capital is cash operating results. The primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents. The primary factors affecting cash operating results are: (i) seasonality; (ii) market wins and losses; (iii) supplier mix; (iv) accident frequency; (v) salvage frequency; (vi) increased volume from our existing suppliers; (vii) commodity pricing; (viii) used car pricing; (ix) foreign currency exchange rates; (x) product mix; and (xi) contract mix to the extent appropriate. These factors are further discussed in the Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nPotential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. A potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity; however, we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and, if available, if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us. \nAcquisitions and New Operations \nAs part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as well as the regions currently served by our facilities. We believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage, as we have facilities located in North America, the U.K., Brazil, the U.A.E., Oman, Bahrain, Germany, and Spain with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. \nThe following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2015: Acquisition or Geographic Locations Greenfield Date Service Area Webster, New Hampshire Greenfield September 2012 United States Gainesville, Georgia Acquisition May 2013 United States Davison, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Ionia, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Kincheloe, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Salvage Parent, Inc.* Acquisition May 2013 United States Seaford, Delaware Greenfield July 2014 United States Montreal, Quebec Acquisition November 2013 Canada Moncton, New Brunswick Greenfield July 2015 Canada United Arab Dubai, U.A.E.

In particular, we have certain contracts inherited through our U.K. acquisitions that require us to act as a principal, purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account. It is our intention, where possible, to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods. Changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages. \nIn addition to growth through business acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets; (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements; (iii) increasing our service offerings to sellers and members; and (iv) expanding the application of VB3 into new markets. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures, and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems, and redeploying personnel, when necessary. \nResults of Operations \nThe following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended July 31, (In percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Service revenues and vehicle sales: Service revenues 86 % 82 % 81 % Vehicle sales 14 % 18 % 19 % Total service revenues and vehicle sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Operating expenses: Yard operations 46 % 45 % 44 % Cost of vehicle sales 12 % 15 % 16 % General and administrative 12 % 14 % 13 % Impairment of long-lived assets - % 3 % - % Total operating expenses 70 % 77 % 73 % Operating income 30 % 23 % 27 % Other (expense) income (1 )% - % (1 )% Income before income taxes 29 % 23 % 26 % Income taxes 10 % 8 % 9 % Net income 19 % 15 % 17 % \nComparison of Fiscal Years ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 The following table presents a comparison of service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended July 31, 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Change % Change Change % Change Service revenues $ 985,363 $ 958,413 $ 849,667 $ 26,950 2.8 % $ 108,746 12.8 % Vehicle sales 160,716 205,076 196,719 (44,360 ) (21.6 )% 8,357 4.2 % Total service revenues and vehicle sales $ 1,146,079 $ 1,163,489 $ 1,046,386 $ (17,410 ) (1.5 )% $ 117,103 11.2 % \nService Revenues. The increase in service revenues for fiscal 2015 of $27.0 million, or 2.8% as compared to fiscal 2014 came from (i) growth in North America of $18.6 million; (ii) growth in the U.K. of $6.4 million; and (iii) growth in our other international markets of $2.0 million. The growth in North America was driven primarily by increased volume, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per car due to lower average auction selling prices, which we believe is due to lower commodity prices. The increase in volume in North America primarily came from existing suppliers as we believe there may have been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency. Excluding a detrimental impact of $5.8 million due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate, the growth in the U.K. of $6.4 million was driven primarily by increased volume as we increased our market share and a marginal increase in revenue per car. \nThe increase in service revenues for fiscal 2014 of $108.7 million, or 12.8% as compared to fiscal 2013 came from (i) growth in North America of $76.7 million; (ii) growth in the U.K. of $23.7 million, driven by increased volume from our vehicle suppliers; and (iii) our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into Germany, Spain, the U.A.E., and Brazil, which represented $8.3 million. Excluding the increase in revenues in fiscal 2013 associated with Hurricane Sandy of $31.2 million, North America service revenue grew by $107.9 million, or 14.7%. The growth in North America was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat. The increase in volume came from the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc., which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and increases from existing suppliers as we believe there may have been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency. \nVehicle Sales. The decrease in vehicle sales for fiscal 2015 of $44.4 million, or 21.6% as compared to fiscal 2014 came from (i) a decline in the U.K. of $31.8 million; (ii) a decline in North America of $8.1 million; and (iii) a decline in our other international markets of $4.5 million. The decline in the U.K. was primarily the result of decreased volume from insurance sellers and lower average auction selling prices, driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public, and included a $5.1 million detrimental impact due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate. The decline in North America was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average auction selling prices, which we believe is due to lower commodity prices. The decline in our other international markets was driven primarily by reduced volume. \nThe increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 of $8.4 million, or 4.2% as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily came from (i) our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into Germany, Spain, the U.A.E. and Brazil, which represented $4.8 million; (ii) growth in the U.K. of $2.3 million, driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public; and (iii) growth in North America of $1.3 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. \nThe following table summarizes operating expenses, total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended July 31, 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 (In thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Change % Change Change % Change Operating expenses: Yard operations $ 526,291 $ 520,423 $ 458,228 $ 5,868 1.1 % $ 62,195 13.6 % Cost of vehicle sales 136,412 174,493 167,236 (38,081 ) (21.8 )% 7,257 4.3 % General and administrative 138,975 164,535 137,930 (25,560 ) (15.5 )% 26,605 19.3 % Impairment of long-lived assets - 29,104 - (29,104 ) (100.0 )% 29,104 100.0 % Total operating expenses $ 801,678 $ 888,555 $ 763,394 $ (86,877 ) (9.8 )% $ 125,161 16.4 % \nTotal other expenses $ (12,332 ) $ (4,899 ) $ (6,120 ) $ (7,433 ) 151.7 % $ 1,221 (20.0 )% Income taxes 112,286 91,348 96,847 20,938 22.9 % (5,499 ) (5.7 )% \nYard Operations Expense. The increase in yard operations expense for fiscal 2015 of $5.9 million, or 1.1% as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily came from (i) growth in volume in North America, the U.K., and in our other international markets; (ii) partially offset by a decrease in the cost to process each car in North America, primarily driven by operational efficiencies and the integration of the Salvage Parent, Inc., acquisition; and (iii) the beneficial impact of $3.5 million in the U.K. due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Included in our yard operations expenses for fiscal 2014 were severance and lease termination costs of $4.0 million, primarily associated with the integration of the Salvage Parent, Inc. acquisition. \nIncluded in yard operations cost was depreciation and amortization expenses, which were $34.9 million, $36.2 million, and $40.8 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The decrease in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully amortized in North America. The decrease in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was due primarily to our data center assets being fully depreciated. \nThe increase in yard operations expense for fiscal 2014 of $62.2 million, or 13.6% as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily came from (i) growth in North America, driven by the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc., which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, increased volume from what we believe to be an increase in the overall size of the salvage market due to increased salvage frequency, and increases in volume from non-insurance suppliers; (ii) growth in the U.K., driven by increased volumes from our new and existing suppliers; and (iii) growth in our international activity outside of the U.K. as these operations are in their developmental stages, without the benefit of scale. Included in our yard operations expense in fiscal 2013 was $25.7 million of abnormal costs associated with Hurricane Sandy. Excluding those costs, the average handling cost per car increased, driven primarily by growth in normal subhaul, labor, equipment and titling costs, as well as charges associated with severance and lease termination costs of $2.9 million, primarily associated with the integration of the Salvage Parent, Inc. acquisition. \nCost of Vehicle Sales. The decrease in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2015 of $38.1 million, or 21.8% as compared to fiscal 2014 came from (i) a decline in the U.K. of $26.9 million, which included the benefical impact of the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $4.0 million; (ii) a decline in North America of $6.9 million; and (iii) a decline in our other international markets of $4.3 million. The decline in the U.K. resulted from decreased volume from insurance sellers and \nlower average purchase prices, driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public. The decline in North America was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average purchase prices. \nThe increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 of $7.3 million, or 4.3% as compared to fiscal 2013 came from (i) our international expansion during the prior fiscal year, which represented $4.8 million; (ii) growth in the U.K. of $2.1 million, driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public; and (iii) growth in North America of $0.3 million driven primarily by the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 of $25.6 million, or 15.5% as compared to fiscal 2014 came primarily from a decrease in North America of $23.7 million as a result of the integration of the Salvage Parent, Inc. acquisition, the relocation of our technology department being completed in fiscal 2014, decreased expenditures on technology development and a decrease in stock-based payment compensation. Included in fiscal 2014 was $7.5 million in lease termination, severance and relocation costs associated with the integration of the Salvage Parent, Inc. acquisition and the relocation of our technology department from California to our Dallas, Texas corporate headquarters. \nIncluded in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were $11.7 million, $17.5 million, and $16.0 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 came primarily from a decrease in North America as a result of certain assets becoming fully amortized. \nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 of $26.6 million, or 19.3% as compared to fiscal 2013 increased primarily from (i) our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into Germany, Spain, the U.A.E., and Brazil representing $3.7 million; and (ii) growth in North America of $19.6 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc., which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, increased expenditures on technology development, and the overall growth in labor costs, professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion. \nImpairment. During fiscal 2014, we terminated a contract with KPIT (formerly known as Sparta Consulting, Inc.), whereby KPIT was engaged to design and implement an SAP-based replacement for our existing business operating software that, among other things, would address our international expansion needs. Following a review of KPIT's work performed and an assessment of the cost to complete, deployment risk, and other factors, we ceased development of KPIT's software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place. As a result, we recognized a charge of $29.1 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software. \nOther (Expense) Income.
