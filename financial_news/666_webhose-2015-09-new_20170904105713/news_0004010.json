AstraZeneca , Pfizer and other drugmakers are also pursuing their own compounds. \nNovartis wants a share of immuno-oncology, too.\n\"These agents allow your own body to work as a defence against the cancer,\" Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said in an interview on Friday on CNBC. \"This is what's so exciting about it.\"\nMeanwhile, Novartis' Jimenez has building plans of his own.\nThe company has enlisted star architect Frank Gehry, designer of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, among others, as part of its multi-billion-dollar reshaping of its Basel campus.\nNovartis is aiming for the clouds, too: three high-rises, each around 120 meters, are being planned for completion over the next few years, according to a local newspaper.\n($1 = 0.9558 Swiss francs)\n\n(Reporting by John Miller in Zurich, Ruben Sprich in Basel; Editing by Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:37:28.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
