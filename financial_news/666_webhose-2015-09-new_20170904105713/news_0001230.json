Dr Srikanth was released on bail on May 17 last year.\nBut an internal investigation by Leighton found governance failings associated with dealings between Thiess and Roshni, with senior Leighton executives believing Thiess had failed to do appropriate due diligence into the risks of partnering with a firm associated with Mr Reddy.\nMr Munro was also caught up in corruption investigations.\nThe former Thiess managing director was named in a criminal investigation by an Indian magistrate last year.\nThe investigation alleged Mr Munro signed off on a memorandum of understanding with Mr Reddy promising a lucrative subcontract of at least $90 million if the Indian businessmen helped Thiess secure a $5.5 billion contract to develop and operate the PakriBarwadih coal mine in the Indian state of Jharkhand.\nThiess's Indian operations, which have been running since 2005, are structured as a joint venture, Thiess Minecs .\n​The joint venture is 90 per cent owned by Thiess and 10 per cent owned by Minecs Finvest Private Ltd, which is controlled by the family of a former coal minister.\nThiess Minecs was awarded the PakriBarwadih contract in 2010 by NTPC Ltd, India's largest power generator. NTPC said in May 2014 that it was terminating the contract , which had dropped in value to $267 million, to disputes over delays.\nMr Munro is believed to have been unhappy with CIMIC's handling of the corruption allegations before leaving the company earlier this year. Mr Munro was replaced by another Thiess executive, Michael Wright.\nCIMIC's Spanish management team has been trying to restore the company's reputation after changing its name and is succeeding in winning big transport contracts.\n​", "external_links": ["http://www.thiess.in/index.html", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20140512/pdf/42pkqgp66w2dp2.pdf", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20140519/pdf/42ppqmlflv05zh.pdf", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/thiess-head-bruce-munro-leaves-cimic-20150506-ggvx6c.html"], "published": "2015-09-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:10:04.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
