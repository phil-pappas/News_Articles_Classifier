Oil prices have fallen from more than $100 a barrel in July 2014 to below $50 a barrel for most of 2015. \n\"The overall picture remains unchanged: the market is oversupplied at the current edge, which will be alleviated in the medium term by a reduction in US oil output,\" Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) said. \nCiti Futures analyst Tim Evans said the declines in production thus far are not sufficient to tilt the market. \n\"We'll stick with our base case 'lower for longer' scenario\" in terms of oil prices, Evans said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:59:52.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
