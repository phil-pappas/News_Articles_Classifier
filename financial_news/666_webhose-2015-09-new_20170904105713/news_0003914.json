Getty Images by Lisa Murray Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to use his visit to Washington this week to push for the repatriation of two high-profile corruption suspects.\nWhile cyber security and economics are likely to dominate talks between Xi and American President Barack Obama, the Chinese leader's signature policy so far has been an unexpectedly protracted and aggressive anti-corruption campaign.\nOne of the most high-profile victims of that campaign is Ling Jihua, a former political adviser to Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao. In July, Ling was expelled from the Party, after being accused of taking bribes, adultery and illegally obtaining state secrets.\nHis youngest brother Ling Wancheng has reportedly been living in California and so far requests for his repatriation have been resisted.\nAccording to the South China Morning Post , Chinese officials have asked for the repatriation of Ling Wancheng and Guo Wengui in the lead up to Xi's visit.\nThe head of the Communist Party's legal affairs committee made the request in a meeting with FBI director James Comey and National Security Adviser Susan Rice last week in preparation for the talks, the Hong Kong-based newspaper reported.\nLing moved in elite circles in Beijing and may have information he could share about top officials with the US intelligence community.\nGuo was a close associate of Ma Jian, a former State Security vice minister and one of the most senior intelligence officials in China, who is currently the subject of a corruption investigation.\n Last year, Guo was ranked 74th on China's Hurun rich list with an estimated fortune of 15.5 billion yuan ($3.4 billion). He has since fled to the US, following Ma's detention in January but claimed earlier this year he was there for a leg operation and has done nothing wrong.\nThe investigative business magazine Caixin reported Guo and Ma worked together to pressure business rivals.\nThe latest leg of Xi's anti-corruption campaign has been dubbed Operation Skynet and is aimed at bringing home corruption suspects who have fled overseas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:38:11.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
