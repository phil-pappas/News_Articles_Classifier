It will be the point of linkage between the Mombasa-Nairobi and the Nairobi-Malaba stretches of the rail. \nPresident Kenyatta symbolically broke the ground for the project by operating an excavator then unveiling a plaque. \nHe later held a Cabinet Steering Committee on SGR meeting in which he was briefed on the progress of the project. His deputy William Ruto are among top government officials who witnessed the groundbreaking. \nThe China Road and Bridge Construction, which is implementing the project, said in a statement that the structure once completed will be one of Nairobi's landmarks \"and serve as a symbol of friendship between China and Kenya\". \nThe passenger terminus of the station is expected to hold 1,400 passengers, with a plan to expand that capacity to 1.21 million passengers by 2035. \nAccording to Kenya Railways, the implementation of civil works for the standard gauge railway was at 49 per cent by August 31, with 463 kilometres of a railway corridor constructed. The second phase will be completed in June 2017. \n\"Trail-track laying along the whole line is being prepared in full swing for the commencement late next month and technology, personnel and equipment preparation are top on the agenda,\" China Road said. \nThe new station, once complete, will be able to link commuter rail to the old rail system and to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. \n\"What we are bringing to Kenya is not just the railway hardware but also advanced knowledge and skills that will help in the design, construction and operation of the railway system,\" said Mr Julius Li, China Road's manager for external relations and cooperation. \nOther stations for the standard gauge railway will be at Mombasa, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Maiseny and Voi.
