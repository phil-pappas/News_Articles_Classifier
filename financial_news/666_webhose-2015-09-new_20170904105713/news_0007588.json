The leg between Nederland, Texas and Houston would move up to 500,000 bpd, and the entire project was targeted to start in late 2015. \nThe line was intended to accommodate growth in medium sour and other crudes. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also would restore a flow from Louisiana to Texas after Shell reversed its Houma-to-Houston pipeline - now called Zydeco - to move Texas crudes to Houma, St. James and Clovelly, Louisiana. \nHowever, in mid-2012 Shell slashed Westward Ho's initial capacity to 300,000 bpd after wrapping up an open season to gauge shipper interest. Shell said it could be expanded to 900,000 bpd if shipper interest warranted. \nThen other pipeline projects began moving inland U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . output to Houston and the Nederland/Port Arthur area, flooding the region with crude while interest in Westward Ho waned. \nThose projects include TransCanada Corp's 700,000 bpd MarketLink pipeline, which transports oil from the U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland, and Enterprise Products Partners' 780,000 bpd pipeline from its ECHO hub in Houston to Beaumont. \nIn October last year, Shell said Westward Ho was on hold to allow for another open season, and proposed initial capacity rose to 400,000 bpd. Shell pushed the target startup date to late 2017. \nShell did not announce results of the second open season. The company also did not elaborate on canceling Westward Ho on Tuesday except to say the decision was in line with company strategy to manage projects \"to meet ever-changing market conditions and optimize resources.\" (Reporting By Kristen Hays; Editing by Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T02:43:15.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
