National Coordinator of the special taskforce, Henry Sam, explains under Section 34 of the VAT Act, Act 546, and Section 136 of the Internal Revenue Act, when a property is sealed, owners have 14 days within which to pay up.\n“We have locked the place but it is not an end, the final determination is that we will auction their property if they fail to pay within the 14 days”, he explained. \nMr. Sam says GRA has had to resort to the action because management of the institutions failed to respond to their notices to fulfill their obligations. \nThe GRA is imploring institutions especially delinquent tax payers to voluntarily comply with tax laws. \nAbout 2.6 million Ghana cedis has been recovered from 46 tax payers in the Ashanti Region since the operation began on September 7. \nGRA has a revenue target of 22 billion Ghana cedis for the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T06:19:52.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
