However, this is a clearly disappointing exploration outcome for this part of the basin,” said Marvin Odum, director of Shell Upstream Americas. \nShell caused controversy with environmental campaigners with its decision to return to the Arctic this year after a three-year absence. \nShell was last forced to suspend drilling three years ago when its Kulluk drilling rig washed up on the coast of Alaska in 2012 following a storm at sea. \nAt the time, the failed attempt to find oil in Chukchi cost Shell around $5bn. \nThe Arctic is though to be one of the last great frontiers in oil exploration. According to estimates by energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, the region straddling territory belonging to Russia, Alaska, Norway, Greenland and Canada may hold as much as 166 billion barrels of oil equivalent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T10:35:14.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
