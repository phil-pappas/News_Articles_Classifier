Fleet sales were down 24 percent on a 38 percent decline in rental deliveries. Total sales were in line with a year ago. \nGM continues to have the highest average transaction prices (ATPs) and had the lowest incentives as a percentage of ATP in the domestic industry, according to PIN. \n\"GM's retail sales increase far outpaced the industry in August, and we have grown our retail share for five months in a row compared to last year,\" said Kurt McNeil, GM's U.S. vice president of Sales Operations. \"We will continue this momentum with the redesigned Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu, the launch of diesel engines for our midsize pickups, a dramatic restyling of the Chevrolet Silverado and the aggressive rollout of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\" \nGM's outperformance came in a very strong month for the industry. The estimated seasonally adjusted annual selling rate (SAAR) for light vehicles was 17.5 million units in August, the fourth month in a row above 17 million units - a streak unmatched since 2006. \n\"All of the economic fundamentals that we look at, including job growth, disposable income and fuel prices, are in good shape and that should keep sales strong,\" McNeil said. \nAugust Sales Highlights vs. 2014 (except as noted) \nTotal Sales Chevrolet Crossover deliveries have increased year over year for nine consecutive months, with the highest August total and retail sales ever.
