Analysts had forecast factory orders to shrink by just 0.6pc. \nThe surprise decline suggests Germany's patchy recovery has yet to gather sustained momentum. Europe's largest economy, which has helped drive the rest of the single currency out of its turmoil, is heavily exposed to any downturn in the fortunes of China and the emerging world. \nOn Thursday, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi stressed that a slowdown in emerging markets would exert a sustained drag on the eurozone's 19 economies. \nMr Draghi said the bleak outlook for growth and inflation meant the ECB would be willing to expand and extend its €1.1 trillion quantitative easing programme . * Spain is Europe's 'star performer' but France lets down the Big Four The factory numbers sent Germany's benchmark DAX index down by 1.9pc in morning trading, while European markets reversed much of the gains made after the ECB's dovish noises. \nSeparate data from the construction industry saw output drop to a seven-month low as German builders struggled to avoid falling into stagnation. \nThe country's headline Purchasing Manager Index dropped to just 50.3 - any number below 50 indicates contraction. \n\"Companies noted a lack of incoming new business and reported pessimism towards the 12-month outlook for activity,\" said Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) , which compiles the report. \nWeakness in the construction sector contrasts with Germany's booming services industry and manufacturers who roared ahead of the rest of Europe in August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:39:24.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
