Ian Horner Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston My Greek odyssey continues apace. On our seventh and eighth days on Mykonos, my brother Lachlan and I added both his girlfriend and our sister to our travelling party. On the 10th day, we set sail for Santorini, to attend my mother's second, second wedding .\nI don't much like Santorini, and never have. The clifftop aspects at sunset are handsome, to be sure, but I cannot adore a scaldingly hot volcanic isle without first-rate beach amenities. All day, the town of Oia teems with Chinese brides and their armies of photographers, and fat Americans devouring Nutella crepes. The implacable sun has nowhere to assail but the stone and your face. \"Oh my Gawd, it's so hot I've got the titty sweats!\" one corpulent Seppo in a visor shrieks to another as I pass.\nBut one's mother is boss, and mine was set on re-marrying ( again ) at a relatively unsung and unmapped taverna, Galini, on Kamari beach. Mum, her hubby Tony the painter (TTP) and I came here for a (principally liquid) dinner late one night in October 2011. After 65 shots of mastika, Mum was dancing around the kitchen in a kaftan like Joni Mitchell on Quaaludes, while TTP briefly disappeared into the frothing, wintry sea. This set a high bar for our return.\nOn Kamari's black rocks, beside a rusty, red dinghy mounted with Greece's flag, my mate Adam acts as celebrant, despite holding no qualification to do so. On the fringes of the gathering, a pair of wild cats caterwaul around, scrapping, in a ball, to the death.\nOur columnist Joe Aston predicts liver failure over lunch with his sister Madeline and friend Adam at Kiki's taverna in Mykonos. Supplied Back at the taverna, Mum's friend's hubby, Arnold Schwarzenegger's Swedish doppelganger, busts out Irish folk tunes on his guitar. He's damned good. The best man, Tom, a Glaswegian rock climber, follows suit. TTP's Liverpudlian relatives convene a hometown singalong: Blackbird , All My Loving . Galini's other patrons are enthralled by the mad spectacle.\nTTP's mother chain smokes and in her Scouser accent narrates the decade in which she bore 13 children. \"If you came to me 'ouse, there'd be, oh, 26 people: Barry, Larry, Dick, Mick, Ricky …\"\nAt some indeterminate point, I rise unsteadily to make the toast. Apparently, I use this opportunity to settle historical scores and matters of empire, lambasting TTP's family for abandoning this territory, the sacred Cyclades, to Mussolini and the Nazis, just as they'd left us in Singapore as fodder for the Japs. After that, at least, the waiters have my back.\nMykonos: 'kinda rocky' Maelstrom becomes pandemonium when Galini fires up Dancing Queen on the house speakers and the female guests form a conga line around the tables, using filled carafes as their karaoke microphones.\nOn the 13th day, I return to Mykonos. \"It's a rocky kinda place,\" Adam marvels as we berth at the new port. \"Olive groves and philosophers as far as the eye can see!\"\nWe take a marvellous villa on the hill atop Chora, and I reclaim my 170cc quad bike of destiny from Nikos, the blond reprobate .\nLachy has gone on to Italy, so I am left with Adam and my sister. This changes the dynamic considerably: while my brother is peaceable and easy company, Madeline is hot-headed, and we fight almost daily. And Adam is not a truly committed alcoholic. He jogs in the mornings, among the feral dogs and the simmering, fetid clusters of garbage, while Maddie and I sit on the balcony and breakfast on cold tins of Mythos, listening to Chisel's Choirgirl , gaping at the seven windmills in a torpid silence.\nDespite my unhappy experience last week at the deceptively named Paradise Beach, we set out for its neighbour, Super Paradise. Such a place must curse the cartographer or town hall bureaucrat who designated it so; saddling this stretch of shore with Dickensian expectations, I'd rename it Semi-Satisfactory Purgatory. The service is bovine, the facilities rudimentary, the prices lavish. Middle-aged gays lie nude, browning their witchetty grubs; a tanned penis, presumably, being the final frontier.\nOn the way to lunch, I take a wrong turn and we cross the island on an inland goat track, where we pass a gnarled local in khakis. On the road's shoulder, he sits on his dirt bike bearing a hunting rifle. The Ivan Milat of the Aegean. Wolf Creek joins the eurozone. After passing him, I stand on the throttle, praying Maddie and I can outrun him back to a main road, even if Adam falls behind and ends up locked in Ivan's back shed, hanging from butchers' hooks, naked and electrocuted.\nAt Kiki's, there is a queue for lunch from 11:30, and the proprietor refreshes his intended patrons from a makeshift esky of ros é. Over charcoaled sea bass and litre jugs of house white (or, as Adam calls it, Angry Box, because \"it comes from a box and drinking it makes you angry\"), I confess to a days-long, uninterrupted and enervating case of heartburn that no amount of Zantac will dull. It isn't heartburn at all, I suspect, but esophageal varices, and within weeks, I will die of cirrhosis. Better, I suppose, than spending six months in a pitch black sex dungeon, before leaving this world in the muzzle flash of Greek Ivan's shotgun.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-09-10T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:08:41.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
