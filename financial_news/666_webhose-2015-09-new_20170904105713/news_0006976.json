But they don't want this huge political super structure - and that seems to me what we ought to be campaigning for. \n\"But that's not what we're going to get.\" said Mr Mills, who is co-chairman of Business for Britain. \"There is a one-off chance for big reform which is not being taken,\" he said, adding that \"on balance\", Britain would still be better off \"on our own.\" \nWhile Mr Mills described steps to bring France and Germany together after the war as \"a real success story\", he said the single currency had proven to be a \"disaster\". \n* EU budget: what you need to know * UK business Brexit vote hinges on negotiation Mr Mills said the Government's demands, which include curbs on benefits for people coming to Britain from the rest of the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels and EU safeguards against ever closer union in the eurozone would not address the bigger issues. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) came as a new study showed half of company directors said the way they will vote in the European Union referendum will depend on what reforms the Prime Minister achieves. \nA survey of more than 1,200 members of the Institute of Directors found that two-thirds of respondents agreed that the benefits of the UK remaining a full member of the EU outweighed the negatives, but only 13pc think that the EU currently has a viable socio-economic model. \nHalf replied that the way they will vote in the forthcoming referendum will depend on what reforms David Cameron achieves, with 40pc intending to vote to remain under all circumstances, and 7pc saying they will definitely vote to leave. \nThe IoD said that businesses want Europe to focus more on securing trade deals and to stay away from social and employment law, with half saying that EU interventions in these areas were “unhelpful”. \nSimon Walker, director general of the IoD, said: “It is vital that politicians here and across the Continent move away from a rigid Europe which seeks to micro-manage the economies of member states. In particular, we are calling on the Labour party to acknowledge that maintaining the status quo is not good enough.” \nMr Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum on Britain’s EU membership before the end of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:08:20.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
