The three overseas hotels will have to be encumbered with us,” he said.\nHe further said the Sahara Group will pay Reuben Brothers which has taken charge of the three hotel properties. The three foreign properties —London’s Grosvenor House Hotel, New York’s Dream Downtown and The Plaza — are at present under the charge of David Reuben and Simon Reuben-led private equity firm Reuben Brothers after they refinanced the Sahara group by taking over the loan for around $900 million from BOC in June. Ruben Brothers had bought Sahara’s debt after the bank had declared it as a defaulter and had started looking for a buyer for the three offshore properties.\nThe judges, however, rejected Rao’s plea saying the bank guarantee will not be given by a third party, but by Saharas. “We are not concerned with these people (Helvetia group). We don’t want to sanction any arrangement. Whatever arrangements they want to enter into that will be at their own risk. We don’t know who these people are. We can’t get involved in these international transactions,” the bench said.\nSahara has in the past year made failed attempts to raise the money from its hotels and some other properties in India.\n“You are on a weak wicket. You must concede sometimes,” it also observed when senior counsel Gopal Jain, appearing for Gorakhpur Real Estate Developers Private, said the Saharas’ are not given good tiles of the property and one Surya Vir Singh is not an duly authorised to execute the MoU for development of Sahara Group’s 140-acre land in Gorakhpur. Besides, he said that even the power of attorney given to Singh is not registered.\nThe judges also told the group that it had stopped the MoU from taking shape. “What is sacrosanct is the MoU and not the person, but the person must be competent enough to execute the MoU.”\nThe court had in August approved sale of Gorakhpur land to Gorakhpur Real Estate Developers Private surpassing the Rs 150 crore bid offered by Samriddhi Developers and settled the deal for Rs 152 crore.\nThe court also extended by another six weeks special facilities to Roy to facilitate communication for negotiating transactions to raise money.\n 29, 2015 12:49 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:16:19.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
