SSRI recently announced the closing of a new $75 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The amounts that have been borrowed under the credit facility will incur variable interest at London Interbank Offered Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.75%. This interest rate has been determined based on the company's net leverage ratio.\n\nThe tenure of the credit facility is three years. All the liabilities and assets under the facility are guaranteed by Silver Standard’s material subsidiaries as well as assets. The credit facility may be utilized by the company for reclamation bonding, working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe credit facility adds to the company’s healthy balance sheet and provides flexibility for future growth.
