Therefore, it is premature to comment on whether any specific immediate surveillance measures are also necessary in Europe and whether vehicles sold by Volkswagen in Europe are also affected.\n\"But let me be clear: We need to get to the bottom of this. For the sake of our consumers and the environment, we need certainty that industry scrupulously respects emissions limits.\" (Reporting by Barbara Lewis and Alastair Macdonald ; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T14:30:32.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
