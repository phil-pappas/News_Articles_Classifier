Its latest forecast is much more pessimistic than the government's estimate of 3.3 percent contraction. \nThe decision to keep the interest rate at the same level came after \"August saw a serious deterioration in foreign economic conditions,\" the central bank said. \n\"Inflation and inflation expectations were showing a clear upward trend, impacted by the exchange rate dynamics.\" \nThe decision was expected by most economists since the central bank currently has little room for manoeuvre, wanting to lower the rate to help the economy recover but needing to protect the ruble. \nIn December last year, the bank hiked interest rates to 17 percent in a bid to regain control as the Russian currency plunged due to falling oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine. \nRussia has subsequently cut its interest rate five times since January, most recently to 11 percent on July 31. \nThis level remains very difficult for businesses and households, preventing economic recovery. \nAs oil prices plunged this summer, the ruble fell 20 percent against the dollar, reaching its lowest level this year in August and pushing consumer prices up. \n\"Going forward, the economic situation will depend on the global energy prices and the economy?s ability to adjust to external shocks,\" the central bank said. \nIt said that its baseline scenario was for the price of oil to \"linger at about $50 for the next three years.\" \nThese difficult conditions should help inflation to slow \"considerably\" in early 2016, the bank said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:30:30.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
