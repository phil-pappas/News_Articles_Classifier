Average hourly earnings climbed more than forecast and workers put in a longer workweek, the report also showed.\n“I was on the fence for September, but now I’m much more confident they would hike in October,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “It’s a pretty disappointing number.”\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury note yields fell 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.15 percent as of 8:50 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.\nThe gain in payrolls followed advances in July and June that were stronger than previously reported, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate fell to the lowest since April 2008.\nFutures prices indicated traders saw a 32 percent chance of a rate increase when the Fed meets Sept. 16-17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on the assumption that the benchmark will average 0.375 percent after liftoff. That’s up from 26 percent earlier Friday but down from a 38 percent probability at the end of last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T16:00:39.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
