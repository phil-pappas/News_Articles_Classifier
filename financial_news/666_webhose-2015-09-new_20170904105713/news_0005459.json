Also, 55% labor under the misconception that they have to carry a credit card balance to increase their credit score, despite myriad attempts to convince them otherwise. \nIn general, Americans seem almost willfully ignorant of their credit scores. A LendingTree survey last year found that 21.2% of Millennials said they do not know their current credit score , and another 11% said they have never even checked their credit score. At least they can blame the folly of youth. Bankrate says that, overall, 70% of Americans don't know that limiting themselves to just one credit account has a negative impact. And more than half of Millennials don’t know that having a short credit history can potentially delay major life milestones such as buying a home. Most disconcertingly, 37% of U.S. adults have no idea that if they make a credit card payment more than 30 days late, it will show up as a negative account on their credit report even if the bill is later paid in full.
