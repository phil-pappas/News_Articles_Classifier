Luis Ascui Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The chief executive of global mining giant Rio Tinto, Sam Walsh, has expressed strong confidence in the Chinese government pulling \"levers\" to keep the economy on track, as he revealed that Rio's internal economic measures for the nation were broadly in line with Beijing's official estimates.\nMr Walsh admitted the world economy had become far more \"volatile\" and that potential \"shocks\" are in store for commodity markets, but was overall upbeat on China in the face of growing unease about its prospects.\nSpeaking in Washington on Friday, Mr Walsh pointed to reassurance from Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the World Economic Forum on Thursday that China would avoid a hard landing and that Beijing will meet its 7 per cent growth target this year.\n\"Rio Tinto endorses that. We believe it will be around that,\" Mr Walsh said, after delivering a speech at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\"I am positive about China and I am positive about the Chinese leaders and what they can do in relation to pulling the levers they need to pull to keep the economy motoring,\" he added.\nRio has a large exposure to China through the sale of iron ore, copper and other commodities used to construct buildings, bridges, roads and vehicles.\nA slew of recent disappointing economic reports suggests China may be slowing faster than most economists had anticipated.\nA shock devaluation of the yuan last month, a stock market plunge and tumbling commodity prices have amplified concerns about the fallout for trading partners and mining companies who have helped feed China's earlier voracious demand for raw materials.\n Iron ore imports to China fell 14 per cent in August , a development analysts blamed on softening demand, a factory explosion at Tianjin and a seasonal slowdown.\nMr Walsh said the drop was a \"month to month\" variation and that iron ore capacity being pulled from the global market by higher cost producers contributed.\n\"There is not a build up of stock at Chinese ports and everything is indicating the current iron ore price has reached some measure of stability,\" Mr Walsh said.\n\"But how long for I can't forecast.\"\nIron ore has partially recovered to approach $US60 a tonne entering the weekend.\nThe price of iron ore plunged to as low as $US44 a tonne this year, from $US92 a year ago and a peak of about $US187 in February 2011.\nA growing chorus of economists and investors, especially in the United States, are casting doubt on the Chinese government's ability to manage the economy smoothly as policymakers seek to shift from export and investment led growth to consumption driven expansion.\nAddressing an American business audience in the home of capitalism, Mr Walsh sought to correct more pessimistic views on state-controlled China's ability to successfully navigate a successful course.\nHe said the \"American lense\" didn't work in China, because the government through rapid policy responses and state-owned enterprises had the ability to take direct corrective action far more decisively.\nMr Walsh acknowledged public scepticism on official Chinese government economic data. He said there is \"no question during the second quarter there was a slowdown\".\nTo independently assess the situation, Rio has developed \"alternative measures\" of GDP growth in China, which are thought to include indicators such as construction, consumption and trade flows.\n\"It is indicating greater volatility than we're seeing in the official numbers,\" Mr Walsh said.\n\"However, our alternative means is actually coming back at points [and] crossing over with the official numbers.\"\nRio's optimistic view of demand for iron ore peaking at a 3 billion tonnes by 2030, from about 2.1 billion tonnes this year, has been widely questioned by mining analysts.\nIt is predicated on Chinese steel production hitting 1 billion tonnes in 15 years, above BHP Billiton's low point range estimate of 935 million tonnes and higher than other forecasts.\nMr Walsh admitted there was \"controversy\" in the media over the Rio forecasts , but said the Chinese peak steel production figures were \"pretty well aligned\" with the projections of others.\nHe said the major point of difference was on how much steel-made products China would export abroad, expressing confidence in the \" new Silk Road \" (an intertwined set of economic integration initiatives seeking to link East and Central Asia) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to increase trade in the region.\nThe copper price bounced to a seven-week high this week, after Swiss commodity trading and mining giant, Glencore, cut supply from the market.\nCompetitors of Rio and BHP Billiton, the lowest cost iron ore producers that have flooded the market and depressed prices, want the big two to ease back on supply of the steel-making commodity.\nMr Walsh again dismissed suggestions that Rio should cut iron ore production to boost prices.\n\"That logic doesn't actually flow,\" he said. \"We are the lowest cost producer in the world and if we take capacity off, all that is going to happen is prices will be up for 10 minutes, the higher cost producers will flood back and the price will go back to where it started.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.cfr.org/asia-and-pacific/building-new-silk-road/p36573", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-12T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:03:29.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
