He first happened on the sangiovese Super Tuscan red at Peter Bourne's legendary Wine Emporium at Moore Park, which he frequented to both purchase wine and learn more about wine in the various wine courses the store periodically ran. This was in the years before he and his wife Prue purchased their little terrace on Heeley Street to open Five Ways in 1987.\nIt transpires that Cook and myself got into Italian wine about the same time in the mid-'80s, although my Italian lightbulb was a white wine by the name of Anselmi Capitel Foscarino, which I was impelled to cross London to purchase, inspired by the words of Nicolas Belfrage in his Italian wine classic, Life Beyond Lambrusco .\nSome years later I crossed Sydney for a retrospective tasting of Monte Vertine's Le Pergole​ Torte (and other serious Tuscans) which \"Cookie\" was hosting in the upstairs tasting room at Five Ways. I owe much to my understanding of Italian wine to Cook from this and other tastings, and this tiny little store is an exemplar of all that is great about a local, independent, fine wine merchant.\nIt should be noted that \"fine\" here, in a wine context, should not be interpreted as being \"expensive\"; it simply represents the care and attention that goes into the selection of wines at all price points. As Cook says: \"We have a loyal following because we stock high-quality wine, and no ordinary ones: which we don't have room for anyway.\" At Five Way Cellars you'll find many wines at $15 to $50 a bottle, as well as others with a zero or two stuck on the end.\nPoggerino Chianti Classico 2013 (Tuscany) Cook didn't start out on wine. He took an economics degree at Sydney University then worked in a computer company – Burroughs – for 18 months, which, he says, \"was absolutely awful\". He also spent two years working in the family hardware business. He and Prue met courtesy of her best mate who was studying at the Women's College at the same time Cook was going through uni. As Cookie relayed recently: \"Through all of that, wine had become an out-of-control hobby.\"\nAt Cookie's side for much of the past 15 years has been Todd Slater who also represents the Italian wines of specialist Brisbane importer Addley Clark (the Timorasso reviewed in What to Drink is one of theirs, and like the other wines reviewed, is available at Five Way Cellars).\nExciting wines from Spain Slater takes a special interest in the store's Spanish selections. Cookie explains: \"Todd's in charge of Spain, although both of us got interested at the same time and we followed the lead of Scott Wasley of The Spanish Acquisition, who was importing exciting wines from Spain. We got on board with him right from the beginning.\"\nOltretorrente Timorasso 2013 (Colli Tortonesi, Piedmont) This explains why Five Way Cellars was the Sydney retailer selected to host one of the Alvaro Palacios events earlier this year, which Cook says was \"the best Spanish event we've ever held\". (You can read my column about Palacios' Australian visit at afr.com/lifestyle ; search \"The music of wine\".)\nFive Ways does, of course, strongly support quality local wine, and the shop's most recent offers include Bass Phillip (Gippsland), Grosset (Clare), Powell & Son (Barossa), Andrew Thomas (Hunter), Bloodwood (Orange, NSW), The Wanderer (Yarra Valley), and many others.\nThe store has also been paying close attention to the new wave of small Australian producers. \"My son, Ches, who's 25, is on board with us and he's helping to broaden the range with the likes of Ochota Barrels and Lucy Margaux. So he's having a go.\" Ches did a vintage with Dean Hewitson in the Barossa recently to broaden his experience. Slater also has vintage experience working with Stephen Pannell.\nCookie recalls that when he and Prue got married in '86 he was unemployed and his best man said in his speech he couldn't see what Prue saw in him and that \"all I liked was wine and drinking, and that he couldn't see a future in it\". Wine lovers today, and new ones tomorrow, are surely glad that Ian and Prue saw and made that future.\nWHAT TO DRINK: ITALIAN WINE THREE WAYS Oltretorrente Timorasso 2013 [Colli Tortonesi, Piedmont, Italy]\nPeach kernel and sort-of dried pineapple on the nose: smells like it's going to be dense. Which it is on the tongue, with lots of extract and more of that stone fruit kernel action. Long and powerful and sublime with tripe (or tofu) in a tomato chilli sauce.\n94/100, $49. Cork\nMassolino Langhe Nebbiolo 2013 [Piedmont, Italy]\nHas that fragrant forest-berry, pippy, undergrowth smell. Plenty of cherry stone and flesh too. Fragrant and with a sniff of warm terracotta. Packed with flavour and almost silky (for a nebbiolo). There are sweet tasting tannins too, among the chew and brick dust. Give it a few years in the cellar if you can. 93(94)/100, $53. Screw cap\nPoggerino Chianti Classico 2013 [Tuscany Italy]\nSmells lusher than the last vintage and is packed with brandied cherry and redcurrant fruit. Characteristic cedary dustiness. Excellent weight on the tongue – squeezed black cherries and liquorice – stacked onto approachable, squeezed tannins. Really succulent and mouth-watering. 93/100, $45", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:08:47.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
