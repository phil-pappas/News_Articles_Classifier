That seemed to strengthen Mr. Winterkorn’s position, which was made precarious earlier this year when Ferdinand Piëch, VW’s chairman at the time, tried to oust him.\nNow, Mr. Pötsch’s appointment to the top job at Volkswagen puts him in charge of his current boss and makes clear that Mr. Winterkorn’s ambitions to one day become the chairman of Volkswagen might never be realized. Mr. Piëch earlier this year sought to prevent Mr. Winterkorn from becoming chairman, citing troubles in emerging markets and other concerns.\nWolfgang Porsche, chairman of Porsche Automobil Holding SE POAHY 0.45 % and Mr. Piëch’s cousin, said Mr. Pötsch enjoys the “unlimited confidence of the entire supervisory board” of Porsche SE. That means that the family, including Mr. Piëch, who sits on the board of Porsche SE, voted unanimously to back Mr. Pötsch.\nAfter stepping down in April, Mr. Piëch, scion of Beetle inventor Ferdinand Porsche, seemed to be sidelined. While he stepped down from all posts within Volkswagen, he remained a major VW shareholder and voting member on the supervisory board of Porsche. That company controls VW’s voting stock, making Mr. Piëch something of a silent partner with power to wield.\nMr. Piëch was isolated within the families when he tried to oust Mr. Winterkorn as CEO. But when speculation emerged in the German media this summer that Mr. Winterkorn could step down as CEO to take the chairman’s seat, the families were united in their opposition, said a person familiar with the matter.\n“We could not imagine that Winterkorn becomes a member of the supervisory board,” that person said. “In the end, yes, Piëch stopped Winterkorn.”\nWhen Mr. Piëch stepped down, leaving the chairman’s post empty, Berthold Huber, former head of the IG Metall trade union, stepped in as interim chairman, charged with finding a new permanent chairman.\nMr. Pötsch, an Austrian, is well respected in investment circles and deeply understands the company. He has been a member of VW’s management board since 2003.\nHe also is close to the controlling families. He engineered a €5 billion ($5.61 billion) capital increase that bailed out the Porsche and Piëch family holding after a failed attempt by Porsche AG to take over the larger Volkswagen put the families deeply in debt.\nMr. Pötsch also is CFO of Porsche SE and will keep that position when he becomes VW chairman. That decision will be taken at a special meeting of the company’s shareholders in November.\nMr. Pötsch and Mr. Winterkorn will certainly seek common ground and have worked well together in the past. But it could be a difficult role reversal.\n“It’s unpleasant for Winterkorn, but he could not be chairman. He could only be CEO or leave,” said Philippe Houchois, automotive analyst at UBS.\nWrite to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:32:36.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
