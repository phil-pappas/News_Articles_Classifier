One in two parents said they did the washing up to earn their pocket money, while a third washed the car and 23pc collected the groceries. \nOthers hung up the laundry, watered the garden and raked leaves. \n\"The custom of giving children pocket money for leisurely pursuits or treats really took off through the 20th century,\" said Lyn Wall, curator of the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh. \n\"Initially children would buy comics, sweets and small toys such as marbles and spinning tops in return for chores of polishing shoes, going to the shops or cutting the grass.\" \nThe going rate for household jobs has also changed as adults tap their children for their digital know-how, with half of parents admitting they have paid up to £20 for an individual digital chore . \n\"Apart from sweets, the items children spend their money on has dramatically changed over the years, and the chores that children are helping with in return for pocket money have changed too,\" Ms Wall said. \nDespite children's technological savvy, the Barclays research found that seven in 10 parents hand out pocket money in cash form, with just 19pc using direct debit or payment apps . \nAs that pocket money no longer goes on trips to the corner shop for penny sweets and a magazine, and with commerce moving swiftly online , Barclays is launching a mobile banking app to help teenagers manage their hard-earned piles of £20 notes . \nThe bank hopes that the app, which is available on iOS and Android, will teach digitally native 11 to 15-year-olds to track and manage their finances. \n\"We are moving into a digital age and hope that the app will help support parents across the country in encouraging their children to take responsibility for their pocket money earnings,\" said Barclays' Luke Christoforidis. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will provide them with a tool to confidentially carry out their banking needs with ease and speed via their preferred channel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:22:35.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
