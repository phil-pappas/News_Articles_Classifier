Current potential homebuyers receive a Good Faith Estimate and a TILA (Truth in Lending Act) disclosure, a HUD-1 and a closing TILA document in addition to other servicing documents. \nThe new documents will be streamlined and will be replaced with the new Loan Estimate, plus the new Closing Disclosure. \n“It will be easier to understand if the loan at closing is the same one that you were promised,” Lewis said. “This was really a problem before. With the new documents, you can set it side by side and see the numbers if they jacked up the closing costs and if the interest rates are the same.” \nThe current forms have been around for over three decades with slight updates, so “it’s time to implement these changes,” said Ben Niernberg, an executive vice president at Proper Title, a Northbrook, Ill. title insurance agency. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T15:56:20.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
