Long lines of commuters and school children could be seen at bus stops early Wednesday, while passengers were stranded at airports as taxis and rickshaws stayed off the streets. \nFinancial services were expected to be hit by the strike, with many banks shutting their doors for the day. \nHawkers, domestic workers and daily wage labourers were also expected to join the strike to demand an increase in the minimum wage. \nTelevision footage showed the strike's impact in the eastern state of West Bengal, where unions enjoy significant clout, with the capital city of Kolkata mostly deserted with bank branches, shops and other businesses closed early Wednesday. \nModi won a landslide election victory last May, promising a string of business-friendly reforms to attract foreign investment and revive Asia's third-largest economy. \nBut the opposition has blocked flagship tax and land reforms, aggravating investor concerns, while the unions are increasingly angry over the reforms. \nIndia's economy grew by a slower than expected 7.0 percent in the first quarter of the financial year and experts say reforms are needed to create jobs for millions of young people. \nPrevious strikes have shut down cities and cost the Indian economy millions of dollars in lost production.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:44:59.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
