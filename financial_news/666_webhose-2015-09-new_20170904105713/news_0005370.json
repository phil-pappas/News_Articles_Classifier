According to Sky News , buyout groups including Apax Partners, CVC Capital Partners, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and TPG (Taiwan OTC: 6521.TWO - news ) are losing interest or no longer in the frame for the acquisition, which is now valued at under £1bn - less than half original estimates. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) cited people familiar with the matter as saying that General Atlantic Partners, which had been involved in a joint bid with marketing services giant WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) , has decided not to pursue a deal. \nTesco recently struck a five-year agreement with the unit which manages its Clubcard loyalty scheme. However, that deal expires in 2020 meaning that a new owner will have to secure another deal with the company which currently accounts for more than half of Dunnhumby's revenues. \nA number of private equity bidders withdrew on the basis of that deal, having struggled to secure acceptable borrowing terms from banks. \nThe news come a day after Tesco announced the sale of its South Korean unit, Homeplus , to a consortium led by MBK Partners for £4.24bn. \nTesco said the deal, which is expected to complete in the fourth quarter, will allow it to significantly reduce its £4.23bn debt pile. \nReports on Monday also said that Tesco was exploring a potential sale of its central and eastern Europe business .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:34:58.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
