A move downward from here would mark resumption of the decline from late-August highs above the 1.17 figure, making good on a break of near-term trend line support two weeks ago. Near-term support is at 1.1225, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion, with a break below that on a daily closing basis opening the door for a challenge of the 38.2% level at 1.1134. Alternatively, a rebound above the 14.6% Fib at 1.1282 clears the way for a test of the September 14 high at 1.1373. Our short position from 1.1224 was stopped out last week. We are keen to re-enter the position but an actionable trade setup is absent at this stage. Most critically, prices are too close to support to justify triggering a trade from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will remain on the sidelines and wait for a more attractive opportunity to present itself.
