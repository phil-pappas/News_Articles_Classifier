None changed their view from a hold to a hike, suggesting that momentum is moving against a Fed move this week. \nBut it has gone right down to the wire, with the number of economists predicting no change in rates now outnumbering those betting on a hike by 45 to 35. Among primary dealers, 12 banks expect the Fed to hold and the remaining 10 expect a hike. \nThe US economy has been performing relatively well, although it has been weak compared with past recoveries. So far it has generated little inflation, even with the rates at 0-0.25% for more than half a decade and adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet via bond purchases. \nThe latest data due on Wednesday are expected to show a steady and weak inflation rate. \nWhile the Fed has delayed hiking, dark clouds have gathered over China, global financial markets, and by extension, the global economic outlook which the Fed can't ignore. \"Fed Chair Janet Yellen has been conspicuously silent, with no significant comments since July's congressional testimony,\"wrote Standard Chartered senior economist Thomas Costerg in a note explaining the decision to switch from September to aDecember hike. \n\"We think the recent global market volatility - driven by ongoing concerns about global growth - has raised the bar for a first rate hike near-term.\" \nTo complicate matters, interest rate futures markets are pricing in roughly a one-in-four chance of a hike on Thursday. That suggests that for all of the preparation the Fed has done to signal to markets to be ready, they are not positioned for a move now. And bond market pricing has been at odds with the Fed's own views on the path for rates for a long while. \nWhat the Fed actually will do with rates if and when it hikes is also disputed. Roughly 85% of economists say the Fed will move the 0-0.25% range higher, 15% say it will return to a point rate. \nIf the Fed doesn't go on Thursday, the most likely date for lift-off is December. Only five of 80 economists don't expect a rate hike this year. \nThe conviction rate was never high for the September meeting, but it has dropped compared with the poll on Sept 11. \nAsked what the probability of a hike on Thursday was, the median response given fell to 45% from 50-50. \n\"My gut instinct is they will go,\" said Lou Crandall, a veteran Fed watcher and economist at Wrightson ICAP. \n\"There are a whole bunch of weak arguments on both sides. \nFor all that they would like to argue that this is data-dependent, it clearly is not. If it were data-dependent, it would be impossible to explain why you're moving in September when you had not moved in July.\" \nThe other issue is forecasters' track record. \nIn 2009, a year after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and with the economy already in the depths of an historic, deep recession, economists were predicting the Fed would hike rates as early as the first quarter of 2010. \nIt's been more than half a decade since then and they - as well as financial markets - still aren't sure.
