Irish 10-year yields were 1 basis point lower at 1.31 percent.\n\"It is definitely conceivable that at least the outlook will be upgraded to 'positive'. The current Baa1 rating makes Moody's the last of the three major rating agencies to not yet have assigned a rating in the \"A\" category to Ireland,\" DZ Bank strategists said in a note.\n\"The return of Irish bonds to the core segment ought to continue and even accelerate in the form of noticeable spread narrowing in the coming weeks.\"\nGerman 10-year yields, the euro zone benchmark, were also 1 basis point lower at 0.68 percent on growing doubts over the likelihood of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike next week.\nExpectations that the U.S. central bank will act have fallen since the Fed gave no strong indication in the minutes of its July meeting that a September rate increase was likely. Low inflation is also seen as complicating the Fed's ability to raise interest rates.
