In some cases, savers' money is never invested and fraudsters simply run off with it. \nThe launch of the tool follows a deluge of warnings from consumer bodies over investment fraud, with one report warning that conmen are fleecing people out of nearly £3m a month in London alone, through a range of sophisticated investment scams. Another report claimed some pensioners are fielding as many as six cold-calls a day from firms. \nOver 55s are considered the highest risk candidates for investment fraud as they are now able to access up to 100pc of their retirement funds in one go. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) already has a register of authorised advisers, but it is cumbersome to use, and does not warn people if firms or individuals are known to be linked to a scam. \nThe regulator has designed the new tool to be easier to use to encourage more savers to check up on firms before handing over money to invest. \nYouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) data collected in August shows less than half (48pc) of people who have taken financial advice did anything to ensure the adviser was properly authorised. \nCarlton Hood, a director at Old Mutual Wealth, said: “Authorised financial advisers are subject to stringent regulation from the Financial Conduct Authority. Unfortunately, a small handful of fraudsters claiming to give advice are taking advantage of vulnerable customers and putting people off taking advice altogether. \n“Customers can give themselves peace of mind by checking the new FCA register to be sure that they are dealing with a properly regulated financial adviser. This will help them avoid making irrevocable, catastrophic decisions with their finances.\" \nThe FCA is launching the new version of the tool, called the Financial Services Register, on September 7. \nkatie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:07:53.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
