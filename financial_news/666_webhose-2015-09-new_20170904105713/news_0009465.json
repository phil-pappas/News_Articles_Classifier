Some are worried an oil spill would harm protected species while others are concerned about the cost after oil prices more than halved in a year. \nShell said the decision to withdraw from the area reflected poor results from its Burger J exploratory well, the project's high costs and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment in the area off the U.S. state of Alaska. \nA Shell source said the company had found U.S. regulation very prescriptive and in some cases contradictory, making it difficult to navigate the regulatory process. \nPresident Barack Obama's administration dealt a blow to Shell in June, ruling that laws protecting walrus and polar bears prevented Shell from drilling two rigs simultaneously at close range. \n\"The entire episode has been a very costly error for the company both financially and reputationally,\" said analysts at Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , who estimate the Shell's Arctic exploration project could cost the company about $9 billion. \nARCTIC CASUALTIES \nEnvironmentalists, who have criticised Shell's drilling plans in an area that is home to populations of whales, walrus and polar bears, claimed victory. In July, activists tried to stop an icebreaker key to Shell's drilling plans from leaving port by dangling from a bridge. \nAnnie Leonard, head of Greenpeace USA, said Shell's decision was \"proof positive that drilling in the Arctic is too costly to be effective and a bad bet for other energy companies.\" \nThe decision is also the latest in a series of setbacks for projects in the Arctic to find oil and gas deposits estimated at 20 percent of the world's undiscovered resources. \nEarlier this year, Norway's Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) postponed its Arctic Johan Castberg project again and in 2012 Russia's Gazprom, together with Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) and Statoil, scrapped the Shtokman gas project in the Arctic Barents Sea. \n\"Arctic exploration has been a clear casualty of the oil price slump,\" said Peter Kiernan, oil and gas analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \nOil firms have dropped costly offshore projects worldwide as weak oil prices have eaten into budgets. These include BP's decision to review investment plans for the deepwater Mad Dog 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico and Husky Energy (Toronto: HSE.TO - news ) 's delay to an extension of its West White Rose field off Canada. \n\"Alaska been a bone of contention for many investors thus today's update is a positive,\" said Bernstein analysts, who rate Shell's stock as outperform. \nSenator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan Republican, said she was disappointed by the decision. The U.S. Interior Department \"placed significant limits on this season's activities, which resulted in a drilling rig sitting idle,\" she said. \nShell's London-listed shares moved up in early trading but later fell more than 2.8 percent. \nShell said its Alaskan project was valued at about $3 billion on its balance sheet and that it had a $1.1 billion in future contractual commitments. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said it would give an update on the cost of writedowns with third-quarter results.
