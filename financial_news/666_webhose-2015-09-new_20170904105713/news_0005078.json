This is the second time the global financial services major has revised the Sensex target in 3 months. It had earlier trimmed its year-end Sensex target to 31,000 in June on account of a more muted environment for foreign inflows and earnings cuts in preceding two quarters.\nSensex on Monday rebounded over 96 points to 25,706.87 in early trade, reversing its two-day losing trend on the back of positive IIP numbers for July.\nThe BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty snapped four week losing streak till Sept 11 by gaining 408.31 points and 134.25 points respectively on fresh buying in rate-sensitive stocks amid rising hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank.\nDeustche Bank said that combination of commodity deflation, sharp compression in global trade, deep emerging market(EM) currency depreciation and dollarisation of EM debt has raised the risks of an EM contagion.\nIt further added that cross border loans and debt securities to EM at $5.7 trillion could lead to fast paced tightening of credit.\nNitasha Shankar, vice president, research, YES Securities, said, “Global markets are cautious ahead of the US Fed meeting. Largely the expectations are that the US Fed will not hike rates.”\nThe global financial services major also said that India looks relatively better placed due to government reforms and low levels of external debt relative to nominal its GDP.\nDeutsche Bank listed Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys , Nestle India, Godrej Consumer and Zee Entertainment as preferred stock picks. IRB Infra, Shree Cement Cummins India, JSW Energy, NTPC also figured in its list.\nMacquarie, Barclays and Ambit had slashed India’s targets earlier citing delay in earnings recovery.\nWith inputs from Reuters\nFirst Published on September 14, 2015 11:20 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:07:38.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
