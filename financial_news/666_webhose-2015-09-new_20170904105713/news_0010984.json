Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nEconomists are scrambling to revise their projections for Australia's dollar after it sank below US70¢ this week, with a surprisingly weak Australian economy, and fresh concerns about China, forcing some analysts to slash their forecasts.\nBut there is no consensus on where those forecasts will end up. Many believe it could fall towards US60¢ next year while others think it has been oversold and will rebound to the mid-70s in the medium-term.\nAustralia's dollar hit multiple six-year lows this week, touching US69.78¢ on Wednesday on concerns over the health of China's economy – Australia's largest export market – and signs that Australia's economy was weaker than expected.\nIllustration: Simon Bosch.\nOn Friday it touched another six-year low, hitting US69.61¢, as disappointing second-quarter GDP growth and retail sales continued to weigh on the currency.\nBureau of Statistics data on Wednesday showed Australia's economy expanded by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter, and just 2 per cent in the 12 months to June, a slower rate of growth than the Reserve Bank and Treasury would be comfortable with.\nAdvertisement The news prompted a serious round of selling of the dollar, which had already weakened in the wake of China's sharemarket crash last week and the decision by the People's Bank of China to devalue the yuan on August 11.\nAustralia's currency was one of the weakest last month among global currencies, and it was being tested again on Friday ahead of crucial US job figures on Friday night.\nWith the outlook for Australia's economy looking less bright following the weaker than expected GDP figures, some analysts slashed their currency forecasts to record lows .\nBut significant uncertainty remains about the strength and length of those projected falls.\nDeutsche Bank chief economist Adam Boyton said the state of the global economy – a chaotic Chinese sharemarket, weakening domestic conditions, and strengthening US activity – meant Australia's dollar could fall to US60¢ by the end of 2016 , and possibly even further, into the 50s range, within a few years.\nBut Westpac currency strategist Sean Callow said the dollar appeared to be oversold this week and would likely rebound to the mid-70s in the medium-term, given the recent rise in global iron ore prices.\n\"We're getting into the sort of territory where we think it's getting a little undervalued,\" Mr Callow told Fairfax Media.\n\"A lot of it does appear to be global speculators taking a very bearish view of the Aussie dollar. We can't help suspecting that they're using the Aussie as a proxy for China, because it's a lot easier to sell the Aussie than to get involved in the Chinese stockmarket where the rules change every day.\"\nAustralia's dollar has now fallen 37 per cent against the US dollar since its 2011 high.\nEarlier this year, when BusinessDay surveyed 25 of Australia's top economists working in the private sector, academia, industry and consultancy, they expected the dollar would be worth US73.8¢ on average by the end of this year, and US72.5¢ by June next year.\nBut some individuals were much more optimistic. Stephen Koukoulas from Market Economics believed the dollar would be worth US80¢ by the end of this year before strengthening to US83¢ by June next year.\nSaul Eslake, former chief economist of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, believed it would be US70¢ by December and then US65¢ by June. Mr Eslake told Fairfax Media this week that he had no reason to change his mind about those predictions.\nAMP Capital's Shane Oliver said on Friday that, though he finds it difficult to predict where the dollar will be heading, he thinks it will head towards US60¢ over the next year.\nHe also says a lower overall dollar will be good for Australia's economy.\n\"The plunging dollar … is certainly bad news if you are planning an overseas holiday or if you do a lot of purchases online at offshore websites, but that's the point,\" Mr Oliver said.\n\"On balance a lower dollar is just what Australia needs right now to help rebalance the economy in the face of the mining downturn.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:13:53.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
