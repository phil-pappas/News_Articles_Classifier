EDF never specified who these parties were. \nFellow French company Areva (Paris: FR0011027143 - news ) had also agreed to 10 percent, but years of losses have wiped out its capital and EDF (Hanover: E2F.HA - news ) has taken over Areva's reactor arm in a rescue operation. This forces EDF to take a majority stake in Hinkley Point and consolidate related debt on its already stretched balance sheet. \nSpeaking in Beijing this week, finance minister George Osborne said the British government would provide 2 billion pounds in initial support for Hinkley Point. \nLevy also confirmed comments by Osborne who said that China could build and own a nuclear power plant in Britain in the future. \nBuilding a Chinese reactor in Britain is part of the global partnership that EDF is developing with the Chinese, backed by British government support, Levy said. \nHe said EDF plans to build two EPRs in Hinkley Point, two more in Sizewell, and then a reactor based on Chinese technology -- the Hualong -- on the Bradwell site in eastern England. \n\"We will help getting that reactor certified. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will have to be adapted to the needs of the UK grid and the requirements of the UK regulator. Therefore it will be a 'UK Hualong',\" he said. \nLevy declined to comment on a report by Japan's Nikkei on Monday which said EDF had asked Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Other OTC: MHVYF - news ) to invest in Areva's reactor arm along with EDF and that the two were likely to start negotiations soon.
