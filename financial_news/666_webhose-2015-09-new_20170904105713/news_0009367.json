The panelists observed that the global economy is recovering at a moderate pace since the end of the global financial crisis.\nIn order to support the recovery, monetary policy in the developed world has remained accommodative through lower policy rates and expanded central bank balance sheets, they said.\nThey felt that this has led to not only lower short-term interest rates but also lower long-term interest rates. Despite recent prospects of policy normalisation in some advanced economies, interest rates are likely to stay low in the coming years as well, reflecting the downward revised growth potential and very low inflation rates especially in the developed economies.\nThis environment coupled with slowing productivity growth and low investment rates poses challenges for central banks across the world.\nExtraordinarily low interest rates for an exceptionally long time, in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, raises questions about its efficacy, its potential threats for financial stability and hence the need for an expanded set of policy tools.\n 04, 2015 7:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:33:55.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
