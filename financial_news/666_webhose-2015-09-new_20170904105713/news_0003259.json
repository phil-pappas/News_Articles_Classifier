Europe boss Dawn Airey out after two years By Christopher Williams | Telegraph – 2 hours 26 minutes ago -12.00 \nTelevision industry veteran replaced by salesman Nick Hugh amid continued sales decline \nDawn Airey, the British media executive brought in by Yahoo (Hanover: YHO.HA - news ) ! to run its European operation, has parted company with the struggling internet player after two years. \nMs Airey, better known as a television executive after holding senior positions at Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) and ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) , has left Yahoo! to “pursue external opportunities”, the company said. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has been immediately succeeded as senior vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) by Nick Hugh, previously general manager of advertising for the region, who has a more sales-oriented CV. \nThe abrupt changes come as Marissa Mayer, Yahoo!’s chief executive since 2012, battles to reverse long-term decline at the former dotcom star. In its most recent quarterly results, the company reported an overall revenue increase of 15pc, albeit on sharply higher costs. \nWithin the improving revenue picture, EMEA continued to lose business. Sales under Ms Airey fell 12pc on the same period in 2014, to £85.8m. Revenues in the Asia Pacific region also fell, by a smaller proportion. \nA Yahoo! spokesman said: “We are incredibly grateful to Dawn for her dedication and contributions to Yahoo! over the past two years, and for her leadership of this extremely important region.” \nIn an April interview with the advertising trade magazine Campaign , Ms Airey rejected suggestions that she was not close enough to Yahoo!’s sales functions, describing 2015 as the company’s “renaissance year”. \n“We need to get bigger and we will get bigger,” she said, adding that Ms Mayer “just wants to get there quicker”. \nMs Airey's departure from Yahoo! leaves a question mark over her role as the digital advertising sector's representative on the panel of media industry experts appointed to advise the Culture Secretary on the future of the BBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:28:18.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
