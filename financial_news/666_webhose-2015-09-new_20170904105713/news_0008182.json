Josh Robenstone by Marianna Papadakis An inheritance from her late father meant for the first time Melbourne dental nurse Leanne McConnell could buy a brand new car.\nShe wanted a vehicle tshe could proudly say was environmentally friendly and would give her better mileage than other petrol guzzlers.\nShe said she waited almost seven months for her $40,000 VW TDI Golf to arrive from Europe in July 2010.\n\"My father passed away in 2009, he wanted me to use my inheritance on a quality car that would last a long time, I would never normally spend money like this,\" Ms McConnell said through tears.\n\"As well as the brand's reputation, I bought the diesel variant because of the claim it was a 'clean diesel' and could do more kilometres per litre than a petrol car,\" she said.\n\"It was supposed to be the car of the future.\"\n'Embarrassed' owner TEhe once \"proud and happy owner\" says she is now embarrassed to drive her car.\n She said because she was asthmatic she would be \"furious if I saw my car driving around. I thought they were a reputable company.\n\"You think you're doing the right thing by the environment. I'll never be able to trade it in, I feel that my car is worthless.\"\nShe was dismayed she had received no apology or advice from Volkswagen about what she should now do.\nShe said four friends and family bought VW Golfs on her recommendation but she was relieved they were all petrol variants.\nDisgruntled Volkswagen customers are flocking to social media to express discontent about how the company has dealt with their grievances.\nThe German car marker's diesel vehicles are not the only models that have been affected by problems in recent years.\nCall to 'come clean' Sydney student Stevie Rabie is so angered by his dealings with the company he started a petition \"Volkswagen: It's Time to Come Clean\". He is calling for the company and its officers to be held to account.\n\"It's time for the company to come clean on an organisational culture that is based on deceit and unscrupulous behaviour,\" Mr Rabie said.\n\"If Volkswagen has the audacity to knowingly deceive 11 million customers with a matter as significant as the environment, what other illegal or unethical activities are Volkswagen engaging in.\"\nMr Rabie, 21, said he had a nightmare ever since buying a VW Golf direct shift gearbox model in 2012.\nThe car does not have the software to hide emissions. But the model was recalled in 2013 because of problems with the gearbox control unit.\nHe said his car stopped cut dead three times with no brakes, power or lights, leaving him with only the handbrake to stop.\nHe said he took it to local repair centres but was told there was no fault.\nHe was now pursuing the company through the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:04:21.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
