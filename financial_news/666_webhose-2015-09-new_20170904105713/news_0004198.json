We were expecting a rate hike in September, but after the latest numbers, we're not as sure as before.\"\nShares rose in Europe and Asia while the dollar lost ground against the euro after trade data from China and Germany highlighted the divergent outlooks of the two heavyweight economies.\nGold has failed to find a strong safe-haven bid despite the recent weakness in stocks due to worries over the Chinese economy, showing that the metal is struggling to find direction outside U.S. monetary policy.\nSilver was up 0.7 percent at $14.67 an ounce, while platinum was up 1.3 percent at $996 an ounce and palladium was up 1.7 percent at $585 an ounce.\nThe platinum market deficit shrank in the second quarter, data from the World Platinum Investment Council showed on Tuesday, as rising mine supply and autocatalyst and jewellery recycling outstripped a much smaller increase in demand.\n\"Whilst the estimate for the deficit for full-year 2015 was increased, we note that the price of the metal remains weak, and the weakening (South African rand) is providing producers with relief,\" Investec said in a note. \"We do not see a material recovery in the metal until the industry is able to fundamentally restructure.\" (Additional reporting by A.
