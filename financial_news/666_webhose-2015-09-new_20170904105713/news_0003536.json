The WSJ’s Laura Stevens writes that leaders of three of the top four big railroads will speak at an investor conference in Boston that will be the first big forum for the industry since a downturn in carload shipments accelerated over the summer. The slowdown, including big declines in coal and petroleum shipments, comes as China’s economic growth is sputtering and patterns in U.S. energy consumption are changing. That’s cut into profits at the big carriers, and analysts and rail customers are watching for changes in operations. The railroads may look to cut costs more than they already have, analysts say, and carriers may shore up pricing in a bid for more revenue from intermodal and other business that has been growing.\nThis fall is shaping up as a critical period for new regulations on transporting lithium batteries on commercial jets. The WSJ’s Andy Pasztor reports that the U.S. Transportation Department will host a meeting of hazardous materials experts this month to consider the U.S. position on safety enhancements . They’ll meet amid a growing consensus in the aviation industry that fire triggered by the batteries, blamed for a fatal United Parcel Service Inc. crash five years ago, can spread with a rapid ferocity that aircraft fire systems cannot control. There’s significant shipping at stake. A battery trade group says more than 5 billion individual lithium ion cells—including the powerful packs produced for electric cars—will be produced next year, nearly double the 2008 total.\nA decline in U.S. truck orders this summer may be a pause rather than a signal of a true step back in the market for trucking capacity. The FTR research group estimates net truck orders in August fell 18% from July to the lowest point of 2015 . FTR analyst Don Ake says trucking companies remain on track to add significant capacity in the coming months, however, because of record orders truckers placed late last year. That would be good news for shippers who have been pushing more goods to the highways this year. FTR still is projecting there will be 300,000 orders for heavy-duty trucks for all of 2015, well ahead of long-term average annual orders. So far this year, industry measures show there’s been enough demand to match trucking companies’ confidence.\nTRANSPORTATION ENLARGE Photo: Luke Sharrett/Getty Images The signals of weakness in the international air cargo market are getting louder. The WSJ’s Jon Ostrower reports that Nippon Cargo Airlines canceled an order for four Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters . The cancellation is another warning sign for air freight operators and aircraft manufacturers as worries about economic growth, especially in Asia, threaten to chill demand. The International Air Transport Association says global air freight traffic fell 0.7% year-over-year in July, and WSJ Logistics Report’s Loretta Chao writes that freight capacity grew 6.7% in the month . The gap between demand and capacity is expanding, and it looks like carriers now are recalibrating, pushing Boeing to cut its monthly average 747-8 production rare for the third time since 2013.\nXPO Logistics Inc. will continue its integration of Norbert Dentressangle SA, and its European expansion, without the help of Norbert’s former chief. WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that Hervé Montjotin, resigned abruptly last week just three months after coming into the business with XPO’s acquisition of the French trucker. XPO Chief Executive and Chairman Bradley Jacobs says no other Norbert executives are leaving, but Montjotin’s departure suggests the difficulty companies can face pulling together businesses across borders. Wall Street has been displaying concerns, shaving XPO’s share price down by about a third since the stock hit its 2015 high in late May—just before the Norbert acquisition closed.\nIN OTHER NEWS\nA glass shortage is hitting the country’s commercial construction industry, raising costs enough to halt some projects.
