Since then there have been other concessions and incentives with the most recent being an immediate write off of assets purchased costing of under $20,000 by the federal government in the 2015 budget.\nThe small business capital gains tax concessions were introduced in 1999. Since then there have been several improvements to the way these CGT concessions operate. The most significant of these was the introduction of the small business entity tax system, which included changes to qualifying for the small business CGT concessions. For a business to qualify for the small business entity concessions it must have a turnover of less than $2 million.\nAdvertisement Q. I hope you can clarify how the $6 million net asset test works with regard to accessing the small business CGT concessions. I have a 45 per cent interest in a unit trust that operates a business and understand that I will need to include the entire value of the business in the asset test. I also own 50 per cent of two investment properties and logic tells me I have a net asset value of 50 per cent of the market value of these investments.\nA. From your question it would appear that the business operated through the unit trust has an income turnover of more than $2 million. If the business has a turnover of less than $2 million the $6 million net assets test will not apply. If this is the case your 45 per cent ownership of the unit trust would mean you are classed as a significant individual and therefore have access to the small business CGT concessions.\nTo pass the net assets test your assets, including the net assets of connected entities, affiliates, and entities connected with affiliates, must be less than $6 million. Connected entities are companies and unit trusts that an individual owns at least 40 per cent of the shares or units that have voting rights.\nThis means in calculating whether you pass the $6 million net assets test you are right about having to include the full value of the unit trust. Despite the full value of the unit trust being included the value of the following assets are not included:\npersonal and private use assets such as a home or holiday house, the balance of superannuation accumulation or pension accounts, and any life insurance policies. To work out whether you pass the net assets test a valuation will need to be done on the unit trust to assess what its current net asset market value is. To this will be added the value of your two investment properties, after subtracting any loans related to their purchase, and the value of any other investments.\nIf the total value of your net assets exceeds $6 million you should seek professional advice as there are a number of strategies that could result in you being eligible for the small business CGT concessions in the future.\nQuestions on small business income tax and other issues can be emailed to max@taxbiz.com.au\nMax Newham is the founder of www.smsfsurvivalcentre.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:30:14.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
