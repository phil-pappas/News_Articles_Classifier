But that’s about to change tomorrow, when the company starts the sale of its newly launched handsets in over 12 different regions. Sponsored Links \nNew iPhone launches have always been popular in the past with people standing in line for several days. This year too is no different, with people reportedly lining up at stores days before the actual launch. Given that the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are launching tomorrow, there’s already lines formed outside the official store in a number of countries. While most of the fans are present in person to be one of the first ones to get their hands on the new model, some take the smart way and employ a robot for this purpose. \nYes, Lucy Kelly from Sydney placed a robot in line at one of the flagship stores in the city. The robot is actually a Segway like device with a stand to hold the iPad in position. So, she doesn’t have to take a holiday from work to stand in line for her next iPhone, rather, she has employed her robot to do this. In fact, she aims to purchase her the iPhone without any human interaction. \nSo, while Kelly sits at her office doing her work, the robot is actually the one reserving her place, (currently fourth in line) outside the store. In fact, Kelly adds that the robot was provided by her company, a media agency called Atomic 212. The company reportedly has around six of these robot used by employees to attend meetings remotely. \nKelly placed the robot as early as 5 a.m. on Thursday. She started talking with the strangers in line from around 6 a.m. As one doesn’t find a robot in line often, many commuters were seen taking photos with it. There’s even a tent besides the robot which comes with a charger to keep the robot running throughout the night. \nAustralia will be the first country in the world to get the new iPhones, due to its time zone advantage. So, thanks to her robot, Kelly could be one of the first customers to get their hands on the new iPhone models. Other countries getting the new iPhones tomorrow include Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:08:12.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
