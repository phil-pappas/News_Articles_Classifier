This follows on the good news that inflation has held steady at 4.6%. He said the MPC decision should be seen as the appropriate decision for the economy and property market right now. \"In any event, the July rate hike did little to stem inflation or protect the rand that went into free fall soon after the announcement,\" he said. \n\"Home buyers with mortgages or seeking credit will have greeted with relief the news that the MPC meeting today announced its decision to keep the repo rate steady at six percent instead of implementing a further hike,\" said Dr Andrew Golding, chief executive of the Pam Golding Property group. \n\"Many felt that the recent increase of 25 basis points implemented following the previous committee meeting in July was premature, especially given South Africa's weak economic growth,\" he said. \n\"With inflationary pressures stemming from external factors, including rand weakness, drought and state administered prices, a further interest rate hike would do little to contain these price pressures, but would rather negatively impact much-needed economic growth.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:19:24.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
