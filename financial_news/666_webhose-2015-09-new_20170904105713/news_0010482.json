It grew out of the Soviet monopoly of the same name. \nTransaero, which began operating in 1991, is the second-largest Russian airline and the country's largest privately-owned carrier. In the first half of 2015, it carried 5.7 million passengers compared to 10.9 million who flew on Aeroflot. \nTransaero has incurred massive debts in recent years as it modernised its fleet of mostly Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) planes and was threatened with bankruptcy. It has no choice but to accept Aeroflot's offer in order to survive, wrote the Vedomosti business daily. \nWith a fleet of 106 planes, Transaero serves domestic destinations, most European capitals as well as long-haul destinations popular with Russian holidaymakers such as Thailand. It has particularly suffered as Russians have tightened their belts in the economic crisis and has been hit with serious financial losses in recent months. \nAlong with Russia's third-largest carrier UTair, Transaero had asked for a financial lifeline from the government but Russian media reported that officials were reluctant and Aeroflot opposed aid on the grounds that the airlines had got into difficulties due to their excessive borrowing and slashing ticket prices. \nThe falling spending power of Russians has hit international carriers and pushed them to reduce their margins and to sell cut-price tickets to fill planes. \nThe ruble's plunge in value has also increased costs linked to the dollar, such as rental and maintenance of aircraft as well as paying back dollar-denominated loans. \nAeroflot has made huge strides in recent years to lay to rest its image as a disaster-plagued Soviet carrier, becoming a member of the Sky Team alliance along with Air France-KLM (Other OTC: AFLYY - news ) and winning international awards for its service. \nIt has resisted the crisis better than its peers, but still reported a net loss of 3.5 billion rubles ($52.9 million) in the first half of the year. That loss was up 86 percent from the same period last year. \nHowever Aeroflot increased its passenger numbers by 14 percent and its market share by 5.8 percent to 37 percent in the first half of this year thanks to boosting domestic flights and launching a low-cost airline, Pobeda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:59:32.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
