Lenders benefit from their collateral position and low historical loss rate in asset-based facilities, while issuers benefit from lower pricing and increased operating flexibility as compared to other loan products. Asset-based facilities were once looked down upon as a loan of last resort, mainly for companies unable to borrow on the strength of their cash flow or enterprise value. However, asset-based facilities now are mainstream financial products and often are used by private equity sponsors as a key component of acquisition financings. Volume has grown from $50.89 billion in 2004 to $92.61 billion in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, with a record volume of $101.17 billion in 2011. \n“cash flow” revolving credit facility, and in some cases the differences can be substantial. \nvenant, once triggered, is generally a minimum fixed-charge coverage test. The fixed-charge covenant generally provides the issuer’s ratio of EBITDA to the sum of interest, taxes, capital expenditures, debt amortization and dividends is required to be at least 1.0 to 1.0. In some cases, shareholders have the right to contribute equity to cure a breach of the financial covenant, similar to equity cure rights in cash flow loans. The absence of an ongoing financial maintenance covenant makes an asset-based facility a natural pairing with a covenant-lite term loan ( i.e ., a term loan without a financial maintenance covenant) or a secured or unsecured bond (which typically do not have financial covenants). \n’s market, often the liens are shared such that term lenders and bondholders have a first lien on fixed assets, while the asset-based lenders retain a first lien on current assets (with each taking a second lien in the other’s primary collateral). Intercreditor agreements for these split-lien structures are now fairly standardized on key issues, including standstill periods, access and intellectual property rights, and certain bankruptcy-related waivers. This standardization has significantly reduced execution risk for the issuers because both classes of lenders know what to expect from the outset. \n“payment conditions” in covenant packages also have made asset-based loans more issuer friendly. Credit agreements often contain payment conditions, which provide that if the issuer has a specified minimum level of unused borrowing capacity under the line of credit together with a fixed-charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0, the traditional limitations on investments, restricted payments and prepayments of other indebtedness do not apply. In addition, where asset-based loans are part of a larger capital structure, including a term loan or secured bonds, asset-based lenders have been willing to loosen traditional restrictions on indebtedness, liens, asset sales, mergers and other fundamental changes, restrictive agreements and affiliate transactions to more closely match the comparable restrictions in the applicable term loan or secured bonds. One key exception to this general trend is that asset-based lenders continue to resist baskets that grow over time based on retained excess cash flow or consolidated net income and large general baskets for investments, restricted payments and payments of other indebtedness because of their focus on maintaining liquidity. For this reason asset-based lenders assert that borrowers should be required to meet payment conditions to make investments, pay dividends or voluntarily prepay other indebtedness. \nry is susceptible to declines in commodity prices, which could shrink its borrowing base and thus its ability to borrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:43:42.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
