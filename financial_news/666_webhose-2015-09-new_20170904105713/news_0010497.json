Both fell against the dollar on Wednesday. \nChina's slowing economy and worries about global growth had prompted investors to cut unfavorable bets in the yen and the euro, both of which have been popular for funding trades involving the sale of low-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding, but riskier, assets. \nThe dollar index, a measure of six major currencies' value against the greenback, was last up 0.40 percent and had added to gains when ADP reported that U.S. private payrolls increased 190,000 last month. \nWhile that was below economists' expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs, it was a step up from the 177,000 positions created in July and was followed by revised government data showing nonfarm productivity advanced at its fastest pace in 1-1/2 years during the second quarter. \n\"The data lean in the direction of a rate hike,\" said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Connecticut. \nThe chances of a U.S. interest rate hike this month, which would add to the allure of dollar-denominated assets for investors, had been dulled by a global stock market selloff following weak economic data from China. \nThe dollar was last up 0.70 percent against the yen at 120.15 yen, firming from a low of 119.225 yen as calm returned to equity markets. Japan's currency jumped about 1.6 percent on Tuesday when global stocks fell sharply. \nLooking ahead to Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, the euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.1240, having rallied 0.9 percent on Tuesday when it rose to $1.1332. \nThe dollar gained more than 1 percent against the Swiss franc to 0.9691 franc. \nThe British pound hit its lowest level against the dollar in almost three months as investors bet that the Bank of England will not raise interest rates until well into 2016. \nThe pound traded as low as $1.5266 against the dollar , its lowest since June 9, and was last unchanged at $1.53.
