But they are especially so now, since market drops have suddenly rekindled investors’ memories of bear markets.\nAfter several bracing declines for stocks, the question for investors now is: What should they expect when the next bear market comes along—if it isn’t already here? And how can they protect themselves?\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Search for Low-Volatility Investments Beyond 9/11: Alger Comes Back Can You Use a “529” for Airfare? U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month Water: The New Investing Factor The answer to the first question: Expect stocks to fall across the board. In other words, don’t expect to avoid losses on investments in “defensive” sectors of the market.\nThe answer to the second question: There might be some safety in gold and other commodities—or there might not. The surest way to avoid losing money in a bear stock market is to invest in bonds.\nAll fall down To gauge asset classes’ likely performance during the next major stock-market decline, I analyzed all U.S. bear stock markets since the late 1920s. I relied on a list compiled by Ned Davis Research of Venice, Fla., according to which there have been 28 bear markets in that time.\nAlmost every stock-market sector has suffered in each of the bear markets of the past 90 years. This is the case even for categories that are widely believed to provide downside protection, such as international stocks, those of companies with the largest market capitalizations and so-called value stocks—those trading for low prices relative to their book values.\nENLARGE Some of those sectors might not fall as much as the broad market, but they are likely to fall. For example, compared with the S&P 500 index’s 57% drop during the 2007-09 bear market, international stocks fell 61% (as measured by MSCI MSCI 3.85 % ’s EAFE Index, which stands for Europe, Australasia and the Far East). The 10% of stocks with the largest market caps fell 53%, while the 10% with the lowest price-to-book ratios fell 51%, according to data from Dartmouth College professor Kenneth R. French.\nThe asset class that has performed most consistently during bear markets is intermediate-term Treasury bonds. According to Morningstar data, intermediate-term Treasurys gained as a group during all but one of the 28 bear markets since 1929, and in the one bear market where they didn’t they still lost less than 1%.\nThe interest-rate threat Some investors may be reluctant to rely on bonds for protection, despite the historical record, out of fear that bond prices will drop as interest rates rise from their current levels near record lows.\nClaude Erb says bond funds are fine even if the Fed raises rates in a bear market. Photo: TCW Group But even if the Federal Reserve were to raise rates during the next stock bear market, which seems doubtful, bond funds, especially those investing in U.S. Treasurys, wouldn’t suffer as much as investors might fear, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income manager at mutual-fund firm TCW Group. One reason, he says, is the tendency of many investors to load up on Treasurys as a safe harbor when things look particularly grim on Wall Street, which lends support to the bonds’ prices.\nAnother, Mr. Erb says, is that bond funds are able to reinvest interest income and the proceeds of maturing bonds in new ones with higher yields—which at least partially offsets any losses from declines in bond prices.\nIt is worth noting that interest rates rose in half of the bear markets since 1929, and this still didn’t prevent intermediate-term bonds from consistently producing a profit.\nDoubleLine Total Return Bond (DLTNX) and Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX) are the funds in this asset class that are currently recommended by the most advisers monitored by the Hulbert Financial Digest whose model portfolios have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years (through Aug. 31, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index). The DoubleLine fund is slightly riskier than the Vanguard offering, currently holding bonds with an average maturity of 5.9 years, according to Morningstar—versus 3.1 years for the Vanguard fund. The DoubleLine fund yields 3.6% and has a 0.72% expense ratio, or $7.20 annually per $1,000 invested, while the Vanguard fund yields 1.8% and has a 0.20% expense ratio.\nCommodities go both ways Commodities have also performed creditably during past stock bear markets, though far less consistently than bonds. During U.S. stock bear markets of the past three decades, for example, the S&P GSCI Index, a commodity benchmark, has fallen just as often as it has risen.\nDuring the latest bear market, for example, the GSCI fell 48%, nearly as much as the S&P 500’s 57% drop.\nThe same overall conclusion applies to gold, which is part of the S&P GSCI index but is considered by some to be a separate asset class. Though it gained ground during the latest bear market for stocks, it also has fallen as often as it has risen during bear markets of the past three decades.\nTo be sure, a 50% probability of loss is far better than the near certainty that applies to different sectors of the stock market. The most popular commodity-oriented funds currently among the advisers who have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years are PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA), which invests in 10 widely traded agriculture commodities, and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which invests in gold bullion. These two ETFs have expense ratios of 0.85% and 0.40%, respectively.\nFactor in the cost Allocating part of a portfolio to bonds and commodities does carry a cost, since these assets typically don’t fully participate in stocks’ bull markets. As with any insurance policy, an investor must be willing to forgo performance when things are going well in order to reduce losses when conditions deteriorate.\nInvestors looking for protection must also be willing to forgo performance when things are going well.
