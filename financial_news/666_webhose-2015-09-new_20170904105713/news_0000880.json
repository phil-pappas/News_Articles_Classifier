There are plenty of positives but also some negatives.\"\n Anecdotal evidence from lenders indicates a big surge in switches to principal-and-interest loans from interest-only products, which are popular with property investors because, as their name suggests, they require payment only of interest and not the principal, which is the amount borrowed.\nIncreased rates and tougher borrowing terms and conditions have been introduced because regulators are concerned buyer exuberance – or fear of missing out – is forcing some to borrow too much.\n\"It is clear the property investor landscape is changing,\" says Christopher Foster-Ramsay, managing director of mortgage broker Capital Home Loans. \"Buyers are beginning to feel the impact. Lending conditions are likely to get tougher over the short term.\"\nVariety of loans The average principal-and-interest loan rate is 4.5 per cent, based on a 25-year, $300,000 loan and a 80 per cent loan-to-value ratio, which is a measure of the buyer equity compared with the amount borrowed.\nReduce Home Loans is offering a standard variable \"Rate Buster\" at 3.94 per cent. Gateway Credit Union has a \"package\" special offer at 4.09 per cent and Newcastle Permanent is offering a three-year fixed loan at 3.89 per cent.\nTerms and conditions can vary so it's important to check which offer best suits an individual borrower's circumstances.\nA popular alternative for property buyers is to hedge their bets by splitting between variable and fixed-rate loans. While some are split 50-50, there can be variations depending on borrowers' appetite for risk.\nFor larger sums borrowed, some banks are likely to require more than half the loan to be variable.\nOffset account In most cases, borrowers will forfeit their access to an offset account for the fixed amount. An offset account is a separate savings account where the balance is offset daily against the loan amount.\nOther special deals are conditional on borrowers switching their transaction accounts and credit cards to the lender.\nNational Australia Bank and ANZ Banking Group are offering cash-back payments and other incentives to owner-occupier borrowers who switch from another lender.\nFor example, NAB is offering a variable rate of 4.15 per cent on its Homeplus mortgage products for new and refinancing loans between $250,000 and $750,000. It applies only to owner-occupier loans and principal-and-interest repayments. Borrowers are eligible for $1500 cash back if they have an existing transaction account and NAB credit card.\nANZ has countered with a $1200 cash-back deal. It also applies only to owner-occupier buyers and a lending minimum of $300,000.\nPackage sweeteners Other lenders are adding sweeteners in their loan packages ranging from discounts on contents and car insurance to income protection and lower-cost credit cards.\nThose considering these options need to balance the potential savings with the red tape involved in switching existing accounts. There could also be exit and switching fees.\n\"Find out about any exit or deferred establishment fees that might apply upon paying out an existing loan early,\" Darnbrough says. \"While exit fees were banned on all new loans taken out after July 1, 2011, they could still apply to loans taken out before this date.\n\"Many borrowers will look to refinance with a lender that boasts the cheapest interest rate. But just because a lender has the cheapest rate does not mean to say the product is the cheapest home loan overall, or the most suited to their needs.\"\nExit fees do not include break costs, which can be imposed if a borrower bails out of a fixed-rate loan before its term expires.\nPossible expenses There could also be a range of upfront fees from the new lender, including loan application, valuation, settlement and government fees.\nLenders' mortgage insurance, which is required if borrowing more than 80 per cent of a property's value when refinancing, is not transferable from one home loan to another.\n\"Many home buyers do not realise this and it could be a considerable expense,\" Darnbrough says.\nThose switching to a fixed-rate loan will also need to monitor the interest rate it will revert to and shop around for the best rate. Some standard variable rates are more than 40 basis points higher than comparable products, which over the life of a loan could add tens of thousands of dollars to the total cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:06:19.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
