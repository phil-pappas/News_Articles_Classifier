(ACT).“The industry has seen a pull-forward of the fall/winter order season over the past couple years, and August new order volume, which was dry-van oriented, is likely a continuation of that trend,” said Frank Maly, Director–CV Transportation Analysis and Research at ACT. “In addition to dry van order strength, up 40% m/m in August, flatbed orders offered a solid assist, rising 39%.”Maly noted that some pressure in vocational trailers is likely over the next few months, as the full impact of the recent energy price declines is yet to be seen. He added, “Most trailer sectors remain within acceptable cancellation limits, but energy-sector impacted segments, such as liquid and bulk tanks, continue to be buffeted by energy price pressures. Flatbed cancellations were elevated for the second consecutive month, with high dealer stock again blamed.”ACT is the worldwide leading publisher of new and used commercial vehicle (CV) industry data, market analysis and forecasting services for the North American market, as well as the U.S. tractor-trailer market and the China CV market.
