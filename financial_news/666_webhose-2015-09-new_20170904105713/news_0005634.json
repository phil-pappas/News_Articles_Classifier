The CGD Minimizer enables advisors to reduce taxable events at year-end for their clients from Capital Gain Distributions by analyzing all of an advisor’s accounts to determine which accounts have the potential for savings and then automating the trades necessary to move out of the distributing fund before the distributions attach. Client funds are moved into a substitute fund that maintains the integrity of their asset allocation and keeps the overall portfolio in balance. The trade files generated can be sent directly to the custodian or moved directly into Orion’s Trade Order Management system.\n“We’ve heard for years from advisors that being able to minimize capital gains from distributing funds was a thorn in their sides due to the complexities involved, causing un-necessary taxable events for clients,” said Sheryl Rowling, CEO of TRX. “The CGD Minimizer is a direct result of our partnership with Orion and a terrific outcome of the Fuse conference that will benefit advisors across the industry. We are honored to win the “Best in Show” award for this innovation and partnership.”\nThe Fuse conference is financial services’ first and only “code-centric” event designed to create closer partnerships between the best software providers in the advisor software and FinTech industry. Over 20 companies participated and were judged on innovations that benefitted clients, benefitted advisors in making it easier to service clients, as well as demonstrated the benefits of technology integration.\nIndustry luminaries Joel Bruckenstein, Michael Kitces, Bill Winterberg and others weighed in as judges on these criteria to select TRX’ s CGD Minimizer as the “Best in Show”. The CGD Minimizer is patent pending and will initially be available to Orion clients, and then as a plug in for non-Orion clients later in the year.\n“The TRX CGD Minimizer is an innovative and powerful tool for advisors and their clients that will truly benefit the industry and is exactly the type of outcome our Fuse conference is all about,” said Orion’s CEO Eric Clarke.\nAbout Total Rebalance Expert\nFounded in 2008, TRX is the industry’s leading independent portfolio rebalancing software platform.
