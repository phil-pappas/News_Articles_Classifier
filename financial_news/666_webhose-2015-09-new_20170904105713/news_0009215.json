Amid the excitement about newfangled technologies and ways to reach young people, the week will carry a patina of fear over a handful of industry problems, such as the growing popularity of “ad blocking,” concerns over whether ads are “viewable” online, and fraudulent bot traffic, The Wall Street Journal reports. Tens of thousands of advertising, media and technology executives will hash out these issues at panels and parties. And companies ranging from Facebook to NBCUniversal -- not to mention a host of ad tech firms -- will try to win marketing dollars from big spenders.\nFACEBOOK RATINGS : Speaking of Facebook trying to win ad dollars: if you’re an online juggernaut trying to go after the big pot of TV ad money, what better way than to make your metrics as much as possible like TV ratings? As Advertising Week gets underway, Facebook confirmed it is launching “TRP (Target Rating Point) Buying,” its equivalent of the “Gross Rating Point” that is the bedrock of television ad buying, Business Insider and others report. The idea is that this will make it easier for marketers to plan campaigns across TV and digital -- and, perhaps, put Facebook’s video into the same bucket as TV for ad-buying purposes. We’ll see. Nielsen’s Digital Ad Ratings will track the performance of Facebook’s ads alongside TV commercials.\nTHIS AD IS REAL : The outdoor advertising industry has a message for Advertising Week participants concerned about digital advertising issues like viewability and bots: people actually see billboards. CMO Today reports that the Outdoor Advertising Association of America has a new campaign meant to tout the merits of the out-of-home ad business . It includes billboards that say things like “This ad is real” and posters that claim, “You are consuming an advertisement. You are real.” The campaign’s message might hit home with marketers frustrated over fraud and ad viewability. Still, let’s not get carried away: outdoor ad spending is far smaller than digital, at about $4.1 billion versus $50 billion.\nBROADCAST BRAWL : Local TV station-owner Media General Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Meredith Corp. caught Wall Street by surprise early this month. Apparently, rival broadcaster Nexstar also was taken aback, since it had been attempting to acquire Media General with no luck. Now, Nexstar is looking to break up the Meredith deal with a cash-and-stock offer for Media General valued at $4.1 billion, including assumption of debt, The Wall Street Journal reports. In a letter to the board of Media General, Nexstar Chairman Perry Sook called the Meredith deal “value-destructive” and “ill-conceived,” because Media General is paying too rich a price and would be exposing itself to the stagnant publishing business (in addition to TV stations, Meredith owns magazine titles like Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle). Now, we’ll see how Mr. Sook’s case plays with Media General’s investors.\nElsewhere YouTube is getting ready to launch a subscription video and music service [ Re/code ]\nAwesomenessTV is launching a research and consulting firm to develop ideas for brands on how to reach young people [ CMO Today ]\nWeb analytics firm Zefr is rolling out a product that will help ad buyers find videos that feature marketers’ biggest fans [ CMO Today ]\nHow the new “Daily Show” under Trevor Noah will try to reach a digital audience [ Bloomberg ]\nSquare is preparing to file an IPO [ Fortune ]\nTurner Broadcasting has hired Lauren Hurvitz as head of communications [ WSJ ]\nComcast is buying control of Universal Studios Japan [ WSJ ]\nVodafone VOD 0.31 % said it ended early stage talks with Liberty Global [ New York Times ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-launches-trp-buying-for-tv-advertisers-2015-9", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/dealbook/vodafone-ends-talks-on-a-deal-with-liberty-global.html?emc=edit_dlbkam_20150928&nl=business&nlid=57140371&_r=1&referer=", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-25/-daily-show-host-noah-to-focus-on-web-to-lure-younger-viewers", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://fortune.com/2015/09/25/square-ipo-filing/", "http://recode.net/2015/09/25/youtube-is-prepping-its-subscription-launch-two-services-one-price/", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-09-28T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:39:17.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
