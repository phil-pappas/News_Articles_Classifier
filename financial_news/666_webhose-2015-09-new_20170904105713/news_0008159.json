Most of our shareholders now come from countries other than Germany, and the percentage of private investors has increased strongly.” \nMunich Re said it had paid out dividends of more then €6bn since 2010, when Mr Buffett built up his investment. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the firm fell less than 1pc to €166 after the announcement, compared to €109 when Berkshire first revealed it was acquiring a stake \nThe shares have also been supported by an ongoing buyback, which in March saw the firm promise to take €1bn-worth of shares off the market. \nBerkshire Hathaway is a long-standing supporter of the reinsurance business, which sells protection to traditional insurance firms to spread the risk of large claims, such as hurricane damage or aviation disasters. \nThe industry has attracted large amounts of capital from institutional investors hoping to generate better returns through reinsurance premiums than the meagre yield on bonds in recent years. \nHowever, this influx of capital has put pressure on prices, which are already low thanks to a relatively quiet few years for natural disasters. \nAfter the annual reinsurance conference in Monte Carlo earlier this month, Fitch Ratings said prices looked set to fall further as \"fierce supply-side competition persist[s]\". However, Munich Re said it saw signs of the pressure easing. \nMr Buffett told shareholders at a meeting in May that \"it’s a business whose prospects have turned for the worse and there’s not much we can do about it\". \nBerkshire also owns General Re, one of the world’s biggest reinsurers, and sells its own reinsurance contracts, although executives have said the business has been more picky about the reinsurance contracts it pursued in recent months. \nBerkshire Hathaway also sold down its 3.1pc stake in rival reinsurer Swiss Re (LSE: 0QL6.L - news ) over the summer, concluding a relationship during which Mr Buffett helped to rescue the company shortly after the financial crisis (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:45:54.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
