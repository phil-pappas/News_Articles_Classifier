The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose on Friday, then hovered around 3.76 percent before falling to the current rate Tuesday.\n\"Mortgage rates are almost unchanged from last week despite some volatility in response to mixed messages from incoming data and Fed commentary,\" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. \"Despite a number of important speeches and data releases this week, expectations for the first Fed rate hike are firmly focused on December. We expect rates will remain roughly flat in the absence of exceptional global events.\"\nZillow's real-time mortgage rates are based on thousands of custom mortgage quotes submitted daily to anonymous borrowers on the Zillow Mortgages site and reflect the most recent changes in the market. These are not marketing rates, or a weekly survey. \nThe rate for a 15-year fixed home loan is currently 2.92 percent, while the rate for a 5-1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is 2.74 percent.\nPurchase Mortgage Application Activity \nZillow predicts tomorrow's seasonally adjusted Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Application Index will show purchase loan activity decreased by 23 percent from the week prior. Zillow combines loan requests made on Zillow Mortgages last week with the previous week's Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Index to predict the MBA's Weekly Application Index for purchase loans, which will be released tomorrow.
