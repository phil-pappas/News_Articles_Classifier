Getty by Xiaoqing Pi China's economy isn't as weak as it may look, according to a private survey that says it's a myth that the nation's slowdown is intensifying.\n\"No collapse is nigh\" in the aftermath of the stock market plunge and currency devaluation, according to the third-quarter China Beige Book survey published by New York-based CBB International. Capital expenditure rebounded slightly in the period and the services sector showed strength, the report said.\n\"Perceptions of China may be more thoroughly divorced from facts on the ground than at any time in our nearly five years of surveying the economy,\" CBB President Leland Miller wrote in the report. \"Global sentiment on China has veered sharply bearish -- too bearish. While we have long cautioned clients against relying on rosy official views of the Chinese economy, we believe sentiment has swung substantially too far in the opposite direction.\"\nThe report describes a mixed, rather than disastrous, picture of the world's second-largest economy. Weakening exports, deepening factory-gate deflation and a manufacturing slowdown have highlighted the risk of this year's expansion undershooting Premier Li Keqiang's target for growth of about 7 per cent.\nThe survey's findings contrast with deepening skepticism over China's outlook and policy makers' ability to steer the economy. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen last week referred to concerns about the \"deftness\" of China's response to downside risks, while Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein called the handling of its stock market collapse \"ham-handed.\"\nA Bloomberg monthly gross domestic product tracker remained below the government's goal in August with a reading of 6.64 per cent. The nation's official factory gauge slumped to a three-year low last month.\n\"Manufacturing is neither a microcosm of the economy nor its bellwether, and performances in other sectors buoyed overall results,\" Mr Miller wrote in the report with Craig Charney, director of research and polling. They said retail and property weakened, yet were still stable and improved from a year ago.\nThe report was based on surveys of 2,100 firms across China and interviews with bankers, managers and executives.\n Services, which account for more than half of China's economy, show improvement in sales, pricing, volumes and capital expenditure, the report shows. CBB said the slowdown was concentrated in the public sector, where revenue growth slowed moderately, while private businesses showed a \"slight downtick\" from a higher growth rate.\nThe authors said it's a myth that the worst factory gate deflation in six years in August signals a wider risk. \"Arguments that producer deflation and consumer inflation are both slicing into firm profits are further undercut by the responses of thousands of firms in our national survey,\" they wrote.\n\"The best situation for most economies is stable and low inflation,\" the authors wrote. \"China appears to be enjoying exactly that, notwithstanding widespread fear of deflation.\"\nThe report also found that job growth inched up, company profits improved, and wage growth moderated mildly. Capital expenditure picked up for a second quarter following four quarters of broad decline, the authors wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:10:39.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
