Wealthier than the Queen By Elizabeth Anderson | Telegraph – 1 hour 30 minutes ago -52.00 \nThe Beckham family has become a lucrative marketing machine, and their wealth is growing \nDavid Beckham has ruled himself out of playing James Bond in the future, despite a number of recent acting roles. \nBut it's not as if he needs the money. \"Brand Beckham\" - which takes into account the whole family - is now worth an estimated half a billion pounds, according to brand experts. \nAcademics at the London School of Marketing analysed David and Victoria's separate business ventures, as well as the marketing appeal of the couple and their children, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper. \nThey estimate the family is currently worth £470m, and rising in value by around £30m to £40m each year. \nThat makes the family richer than the Queen. According to the Sunday Times Rich List 2015, her estimated fortune is £340m, up £10m from last year. \nThe Beckham marketing power resides in the family’s three main corporate vehicles. Footworks, where David’s football-related revenues are collated, the \"Brand Beckham\" label, which includes money made from endorsements; and Beckham Venture, which accounts for Victoria’s fashion business. \nCurrent estimates put the value of Footworks at £150m, the Beckham name at £70m and Beckham Ventures at £60m. \nThis, combined with their non-business assets of an estimated £190m, gives the family name a total value of £470m. \nTurnover at Beckham Ventures is set to treble next year, as Victoria's fledgling fashion business continues to grow. Revenue was £30m in 2013, compared to £1m in the company's first year in 2009. Last year, Victoria Beckham was named the UK's top entrepreneur and praised for her \"finely-tuned business acumen\". \nThe research added that David's earnings have soared since he stopped playing professional football, when he earned £30m a year at his peak. The former Manchester United (NYSE: MANU - news ) and Real Madrid star earned £50m last year, mainly from a multi-million-pound contract with drinks giant Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) to launch a new whisky. \nIt’s not just the parents who are adding to the Beckham money pot. \nBrooklyn, the eldest of their four children, has caught the media’s eye, appearing in the most recent edition of Miss Vogue, the fashion magazine aimed at younger readers. He now has 4m followers on Instagram, boosting his potential for landing lucrative marketing deals. \nRomeo Beckham recently fronted a Christmas advertising campaign for Burberry, and the luxury fashion brand claimed he helped boost sales by 15pc. \n\"The Beckham name has the Midas touch when it comes to advertising. But it’s not just in the headlines that the Beckham name is making money. Both the opening of Victoria’s flagship clothing store in London last year and the positive response to her New York Fashion Week 2015 show prove how Victoria has shifted from 90s pop star to established fashion designer,\" said Anton Dominique at the London School of Marketing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:50:07.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
