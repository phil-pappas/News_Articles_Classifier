Expert \n‘You ain’t seen nothing yet’ is not only the name of a popular Bachman Turner Overdrive song, it’s also a prediction of what’s to come in the world of proxy contests. \nWes Hall, chief executive of Kingsdale Shareholder Services, believes activist investors – shareholders who want companies to do things that management doesn’t want to do – will be busy with a lot of the action occurring in the commodity sector, especially oil and gas. \nThat action will start once oil prices and presumably profits rise. “When that occurs, those investors [who have been on the sidelines] will have the confidence to come after the issuers,” said Hall, who recently released Kingsdale’s annual 2015 Proxy Season Review. \n“The entire sector will be filled with opportunities. When things start to turn around, companies would be naive to believe that they would not be subject to being taken advantage of because things were so low for so long,” said Hall. \nSo-called say-on-pay will be another area in which the activists will find opportunity. (In 2014, a record number of say-on-pay proposals were voted down.) \nThat opportunity will arise because of the issuer’s determination to compensate their executives at similar levels to 2014 despite the poor stock performance. “If [issuers] take the same position as they did last year, they might be very surprised going into this proxy season,” said Hall, who noted that some European investors are pushing for a “binding” say on pay. (The say-on-pay vote is binding in other jurisdictions.) \nIn the first eight months of 2015, there have been 29 proxy contests. (The number rises to 30 if Kingsway Financial’s recent move on Kobex Capital Corp. is included.) At 29 the number of contests is in line with the 2014 (30) 2013 (32) and 2012 (30.) In 2009 there were 43 such proxy battles – the all time high. Of the 29 contests management has been successful in 13, the activists have been fully or partially successful in 12 with four yet to be determined. \nThe 2015 numbers are lower than otherwise because some activists, after making a move, choose to sell their position and not proceed because the target’s share price falls –which exposes the activist to losses. \n“The activist then has to make a decision, ‘should I stay or should I bolt and a number of them decide to sell and try another day,” noted Hall. \nPart of the market’s behaviour is related to the activist doing the activism. If Bill Ackman (Pershing Square), Carl Ichan or Valueact Holdings announced a move then their successful track record, would tend to drive the stock higher. Hall refers to that group as the “premier activists.” But a different result ensues when less well-known activists who don’t enjoy the same reputation and haven’t done the same degree of due diligence, make a move. \nAnd Hall said that it doesn’t mater if the activism is announced (through a 13D filing) or is occurring behind the scenes. “My clients have received a ton of letters, the stock gets cheaper and ultimately those letters stop coming,” said Hall. Previously the activist would “continue to agitate” until it got its way or a settlement was reached– but would hold onto its equity stake. \nFinancial Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:33:07.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
