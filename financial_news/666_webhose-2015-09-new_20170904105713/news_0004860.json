To deal with this issue of Domestic Black Money, I suggest you bring down the Direct Taxes for Individuals and Corporates (especially Individual) drastically and in turn increase Indirect Taxes in the proportion that it covers your revenue foregone from Direct Taxes,” says Amit Arora.\nThe views also reflect that those working on the ground probably have a better idea of what is required to be done than those sitting in the government offices.\nVarun Goyal has written to the government that, “for promoting local Manuf & boost Growth, pls do\n1)Check Excise Duty’s system on import(corruption @ there, allow other countries item sell here @low cost)\n2)For manuf. give elec,land, etc. @ low cost for Small scale Comp.\n3)GST/Tax should be min. & forcefully implement, so everybody wish to do work in white.\n4)Income/property/etc. Direct tax should be min. to work in white money only\n5)Only Big currency & cheque sys is good.\n6)Public friendly law, min tax, promote white money to come”.\nSuchitra Raghavachari is of the view that, “self employment / entrepreneurship has to be given a fillip if discontent among the youth is to be prevented. Technical education, basic skill training, apprenticeships should be given incentives for both institutes & mentorees. Banks should be sensitised towards better disbursement of education / personal – business loans. Focus should be on the MSME / SME sector, tribal area development & seed fund for tech start ups. Tax breaks, SEZ’s, Tech parks & e-retail opportunities will help”.\nClearly, the whole exercise will be fruitful if FM Arun Jaitley collates these views and presents a report along with the Budget on the suggestions the government received from the general public and how far he has been able to accommodate them.\n 24, 2015 9:15 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://secure.mygov.in/group-issue/people-partners-suggestions-invited-budget/"], "published": "2015-09-24T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:43:40.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
