Now he fears that more clients could start to stumble if higher US interest rates push the Mexican peso lower, as some analysts are predicting. \n“Most of these are small companies, maybe 20 per cent of our business, but it is not something that you can just ignore either,” he says. \nJonathan Rubio, a door-to-door merchant in the state of Mexico who sells imported food products, has lost about 10 per cent of profits resulting from peso volatility, he says. \nStill, while Mexican companies’ mounting pile of dollar debt is concerning , and rising peso costs threaten to increase consumer prices and inflation, Mexico is also positioned to weather wider emerging market storms.

Even before the US Federal Reserve makes a move, the effects are reverberating throughout the global economy.

Moreover, while importers are more vulnerable to currency volatility than their exporting peers, many are implementing risk-mitigation measures. \nMr Rubio will halve payment periods to 21 days on average, minimising the effect of rate fluctuations, and he hopes to receive more payments in dollars too. \n“Today we are opting for dollars so we can balance the books,” he says. \nFerbera, meanwhile, has bolstered its due diligence processes for new clients and is targeting multinationals such as Nestlé that are more insulated from local currency woes. \n“Some small companies will probably close down,” Mr Fernández says. “But we are paying close attention to customers’ balance sheets and, as much as possible, limiting our exposure to companies with financial troubles.” Dispatches from the rate rise frontline", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:05:30.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
