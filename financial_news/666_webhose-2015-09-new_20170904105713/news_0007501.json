But a few minor changes could go a long way towards helping Australians save adequately for their retirement – and hopefully assisting the government's bottom line.\nPerhaps one of the most startling findings of NSA's survey of 2000 of its members was that senior Australians (disconcertingly defined as anyone over the age of 50) underestimated their life expectancy by up to seven years.\nIndividuals between 50 and 54, on average, assumed they would live until they were 81.4, when in fact they should expect to reach 88.5.\nIndividuals between the age of 65 and 69 were still underestimating their longevity, expecting to live until they were 84 years when in fact they are likely, on average, to survive until they are 88.\nThere is, of course, a problem when talking about averages when it comes to life expectancy. For many people, the longevity challenge is even greater. There is a reasonably long tail of people who can expect to survive until well into their 90s, particularly wealthy, white-collar workers who are well educated and have good access to healthcare. Indeed, investment consultancy Mercer has estimated that white-collar workers can expect to live, on average, for three years longer than the national average.\nThe lesson here – and the message for government and the superannuation industry – is that more effort needs to be made to educate Australians about how long they can expect to live.\nAs the report concludes: \"Longevity risk is one of the largest risks that retirees will face in their advanced years.\"\n Better planning Armed with more accurate information about their life expectancy, individuals would be able to better plan for their retirement.\nThe incentive for the government to make sure life expectancy rates are well understood is it should help its budget position by reducing the number of retirees who can access the age pension later in life.\nInterestingly, senior Australians who engage a financial planner are more likely to be aware of the longevity challenge.\nThe NSA survey found that nearly 60 per cent of retirees between the age of 50 and 64 who receive advice from a financial adviser were planning to live for a further 20 years. This may still underestimate longevity risk, but at least it is a start.\nThe lesson for the government and industry here is to help make financial advice more accessible and improve the level of public trust in the beleaguered sector.\nOnly 46 per cent of retirees reported using an adviser. While this is more than double the national average, it is arguably low for a cohort of people whose lifestyles depend almost entirely on the sound management of their finances.\nAnother interesting finding from the survey presents an opportunity to the financial services industry in the way it devises products and services for women. Some 70 per cent of female respondents said they needed different products from men to provide them with retirement income that would last for longer, reflecting their higher life expectancy.\nNearly 55 per cent of women over the age of 80 said they wanted to deal with female advisers who understood their needs.\nThe NSA finding dovetails neatly with a recent report from ING Direct, an online bank and wealth company, which concluded that women, because of their long life expectancy, would be responsible for managing an enormous intergenerational transfer of wealth over the next three decades.\nPutting these observations together must surely must be a huge business opportunity for savvy executives – or disrupters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T06:52:12.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
