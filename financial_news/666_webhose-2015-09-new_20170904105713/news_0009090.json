Talking about the need for such a platform Pranay Chulet, Founder & CEO, Quikr said , “Historically those in low salary brackets have not been targeted by the digital industry but increase in internet penetration across India is an opportunity to change this equation. I believe that empowering every person on the street with a meeting place such as QuikrJobs with current lakhs of recruiters will help boost PM Modi’s job creation agenda. With over 30MM Quikr users, our platform has a different kind of potential that goes well beyond buying and selling. We practice what we preach and we have been catering to our own such needs though our platform.” He further added that, “Our jobs category already had close to 25 lakh active candidate profiles, over 16 lakh jobs listed and we noticed that a significant number of postings on our platform were for blue collar, grey collar and entry-level white-collar jobs. In today’s age of hyper localization, the e-commerce industry has also created a big push for blue-collar recruitment and QuikrJobs has become an immediate natural solution for their unique needs.” Quikr’s latest vertical, QuikrJobs follows the launch of QuikrCars and QuikrHomes as part of the company’s verticalization strategy.
