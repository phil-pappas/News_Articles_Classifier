There are plenty of mid-cap stocks owned by many mid-size and large funds as well. \n\"After seeing strong outperformance in the first half of 2015 and continued (though more moderate) leadership in July, the 25 most crowded names in long-only, actively managed small, mid and large cap funds underperformed in August,\" according to a Credit Suisse report published on Wednesday. \nIn the mid-cap space, performance in the health care, technology , financials and materials sectors lagged last month. Of the top 25 mid-cap stocks held by mid-cap funds, BorgWarner Inc. , Affiliated Managers Group Inc. had the worst performance last month, Credit Suisse said.

And when you're done be sure to check out which large-cap stocks institutional investors love most . \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNumber of Large-Cap Funds Invested: 46 August Return: -8.3% YTD Return: 4.1% \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, A- TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates SIGNATURE BANK/NY as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate SIGNATURE BANK/NY (SBNY) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, expanding profit margins and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company is trading at a premium valuation based on our review of its current price compared to such things as earnings and book value.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 1.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 17.3%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. SIGNATURE BANK/NY has improved earnings per share by 19.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, SIGNATURE BANK/NY increased its bottom line by earning $5.97 versus $4.77 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($7.10 versus $5.97). The company, on the basis of net income growth from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly outperformed against the S&P 500 and exceeded that of the Commercial Banks industry average. The net income increased by 24.8% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $72.48 million to $90.46 million. The gross profit margin for SIGNATURE BANK/NY is currently very high, coming in at 85.49%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 32.61% significantly outperformed against the industry average. The stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Looking ahead, the stock's rise over the last year has already helped drive it to a level which is relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that the other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.
