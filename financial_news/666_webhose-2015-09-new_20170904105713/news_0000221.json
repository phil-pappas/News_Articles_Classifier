Nick Moir by Jonathan Pain Imagine you were driving your car and it unexpectedly started pouring with rain. Would you maintain your speed, increase your speed or slow down and drive more defensively? I think we all know what the appropriate response would be.\nOver the past several weeks the markets have experienced a financial storm, emanating from China. Our visibility has been significantly impaired and we are not sure where we are heading. Looking in our rear view mirror, we can see a Chinese sharemarket crash and numerous bungling and meddling bureaucrats trying to blame it on everybody else, except themselves. We also know that, historically, there has been minimal correlation between the market and the economy, and that the real correlation is with the government's credibility, which is currently in tatters.\nI think we can also assume that the central bank will do whatever it takes to ensure that the economy does not experience a crash landing. Since November last year we have had five interest rate cuts and four reductions in the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) and we will no doubt see more.\nMy bottom line is that the Chinese economy is slowing and that growth of 5-6 per cent is probable next year, with possibly even slower growth in 2017. Right now, I don't have a high degree of conviction for what that number will be. Some of this slowdown is a function of simple arithmetic: China is a $10 trillion plus economy, hence growth of 5-6 per cent is still commendable, if not remarkable. But there is more to this current slowdown than that. And it is this which is alarming markets, and me.\nAs the Shanghai Composite rose, so did the perceived competency and credibility of the Chinese Communist Party; and perhaps more importantly, the aura of invincibility of President Xi.\nThat has all now changed.\nExcessive meddling I have written previously about the excessive meddling in the markets, so won't labour that point further. Suffice to say the competency, and perhaps even the legitimacy, of the Communist Party has now been called into question, not only by foreign investors, but, more alarmingly, by the Chinese people themselves.\n The real issue here is that this has happened at a particularly awkward time amidst the Herculean task of rebalancing the Chinese economy. Up until June this year, they were handling this complex transition remarkably well, and I have said as much in previous years.\nToday, that challenge just became much tougher and our visibility, of the economic road ahead, has become much reduced. Remember also that Chinese producer prices have fallen for 42 consecutive months and are now declining at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent. The spectre of deflation is the one that Beijing fears the most. It is also worth mentioning that India, with a history of high inflation, now has wholesale price inflation declining at an annual rate of 4.95 per cent, the lowest in 40 years.\nLittle wonder the global financial markets took fright, and, returning to our driving metaphor, no wonder investors put their foot on the brake.\nEvents in China also appear to have been a major factor in the recent decision by the US central bank not to raise rates as they assess the potential spill over effects, or negative feedback loops.\nIt seems therefore that all eyes, including those of Janet Yellen, will remain firmly on China.\nAustralia, brace yourself Malcolm Turnbull is our fourth Prime Minister in two years. I will not dwell on the remarkable turn of events that led to his election – I mean \"selection\" – other than to say the Australian electoral ballot box has become almost redundant when choosing who will lead our nation.\nPrime Minister Turnbull faces a number of challenges, not least of which is that I now see Australia falling into a recession in the year ahead. This is the first time I have forecast such an event since moving here in 1997.\nAustralia now faces a confluence of negative forces: unsustainable house prices; an excessive level of household debt; a sharp and continuing decline in mining investment; continued weakness in manufacturing; and a residential construction boom that looks like ending soon. Furthermore, it is my contention that the majority of the Australian public never really felt the full shock of the 2008 crash. Their remarkable appetite for debt continued unabated, with the banks only too happy to oblige.\nIf my recession scenario eventuates then the RBA will cut rates, but I feel the household sector's capacity to take on even more debt is very limited. In this fundamental regard, the efficacy of monetary policy will be rendered impotent and the RBA will be \"pushing on a string.\"\nFormidable headwinds The bright spots in the years ahead will be agriculture, tourism, and education, but these will not be enough to counter the formidable headwinds from too much household debt and declining house prices.\nAs I travel around Australia, I get the undeniable impression that the nation is fraying at the edges. There is, however, no doubt that NSW is growing strongly at present, and obviously Sydney is booming in every sense, but much of the country is really not doing that well.\nWhenever I fly into Sydney, which, incidentally, has run out of bricklayers, it reminds me of my visit to Miami in July 2005. I wish I didn't have that feeling, but it would be remiss of me not to point out that Sydney's house price to income ratio is multiples of what we saw in Florida in 2005.\nAnd, yes, you're right we don't have all those Frankenstein-like creations of CDOs (collateralised debt obligation), CDO squared and cubed, and, yes, we don't have non-recourse mortgages and the banks here will chase you to the grave and, yes, I know Australia is a great place to live and, yes, I know that every BBQ conversation here about real estate begins with, and ends with, the same two words, \"The Chinese.\"\nBut, this time, the Chinese won't save us as they did in 2008. In fact, I'm not even sure if they can save themselves! And we don't have Kevin, oh, so '07, to hand out $900 cheques and lavish first homeowner's grants. Remember also that the RBA cut rates from 7.25 per cent, in March 2008, to 3 per cent in June 2009.\nThis leads me to my final point. The deflationary forces flowing from China, and other emerging nations, are intensifying at a time when there is a growing concern that the major developed nations have run out of monetary and fiscal ammunition. Perhaps this is the message the financial markets are trying to tell us all.\nFor so long China has been the primary locomotive of global growth and it appears to be running out of puff. At the start of this year I celebrated the fact that we had America, Europe and Japan all growing together, for the first time in a very long time. And as you know I was more optimistic than most on all of the aforementioned.\nThen something changed, and that something was China. The current state of markets has a 1998 feel to it, and it does look like that we are in for a stormy few months and hence I would drive defensively.\nJonathan Pain is a consultant, author and portfolio manager for JP Global Macro Fund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:47:17.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
