Maybe it's now time to review its competences,\" Castro said.\nTalks are set to focus on a more favourable tax regime for Catalonia, something Rajoy opposed in 2012, triggering the current separatist campaign.\nCatalonia has long asked the central government to give it the same treatment as the Basque Country, which has increased spending powers on the taxes it collects and transfers less of them to poorer regions.\nThe government in the regional capital Barcelona is also hoping to receive more infrastructures spending and be granted better legal protection for the Catalan language and culture.\nMore controversial at the countrywide level, but no longer off the table and now openly backed by Spain's left, would be a constitutional reform that would recognise Catalonia as a nation within the Spanish state.\n\"WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT?\"\nReaching a deal on those issues may not be easy in the short term. But many say the year-end general election, which is expected to split the vote between at least four big parties and force them into talks, could make it possible.\nA centrist party, Ciudadanos, which emerged as the main kingmaker nationally following the Catalan vote, called on Monday for a \"new era of dialogue and consensus in Catalonia.\"\nThat echoes the positions of anti-austerity party Podemos as well as the opposition Socialists, and left centre-right Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on his own in trying to resist the shifting tide in favour of talks over the constitution.\nHowever, hours after his People's Party scored its worst result in a Catalan election in over 20 years, in line with the rest of other local and regional votes so far this year, his position appeared to be weakening.\nAlbert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, the only party Rajoy is seen potentially teaming up with to retain government, said the prime minister was the main person responsible for the separatist parliamentary victory in Catalonia because he had failed to make Spain attractive.\n\"If Spain functions well then separatism goes down,\" Rivera said. \"But where is the president of the Spanish government? Rajoy shows he doesn't understand what's going on.\" (Reporting by Julien Toyer, additional reporting by Elena Gyldenkerne in Barcelona and Ana Vicario in Madrid, Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:26:32.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
