Germany’s KBA regulator had set an Oct. 7 deadline for it to present a plan to bring diesel emissions into line with the law.\nVolkswagen has said previously about 11 million vehicles were fitted with software capable of cheating emissions tests, including 5 million at its namesake brand, 2.1 million at luxury brand Audi, 1.2 million at Czech division Skoda and 1.8 million light commercial vehicles.\n“We are facing a long trudge and a lot of hard work,” Mueller, appointed CEO of Europe’s biggest automaker last Friday, said in the speech text seen by Reuters. “We will only be able to make progress in steps and there will be setbacks.”\nSeparately, Mueller said Volkswagen’s troubled core VW division, struggling with high fixed costs and low profit margins, would in future be able to act as independently as premium flagship brands Audi and Porsche.\n“The new company structure is a first step and the basis for a modernization of VW, for a new and better company,” he said.\n 29, 2015 2:57 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:25:15.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
