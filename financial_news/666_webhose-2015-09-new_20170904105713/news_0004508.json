The metal slid to $1,101.11 on Wednesday, its lowest since Aug. 11.\nUS gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,105.90, largely holding on to a 1.7 percent drop overnight.\nStocks on European and major Asian bourses ended higher on Wednesday, although US equities fell. The dollar rose, riding a global equities rally that helped reassure investors along with signs that governments in China and Japan were readying fresh economic stimulus.\nA rally in equities reduced demand for gold as a safe-haven, while a stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.\nTraders were also awaiting the US central bank’s next policy statement on Sept. 17 for clues on the timing of a US interest rate rise.\nGold has benefited in recent years from ultra-low rates, which cut the opportunity cost of holding bullion while holding the dollar in check. Expectations that rates will rise soon have helped push the metal down 5 percent this year.\nEconomic data on Wednesday showed US job openings surged to a record high in July and employers appeared to have trouble filling openings, the latest signal of an increasingly tight labour market that could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates.\nInvestor interest in the metal has been tepid. SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.61 percent to 678.18 tonnes on Wednesday – the biggest drop since Aug. 12.\nIndia will soon launch a sovereign gold bond and a scheme to mobilise tonnes of the metal stored in households, the finance minister said, a move that mainly seeks to wean investors away from physical gold and cut massive imports.\n 10, 2015 9:15 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:13:47.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
