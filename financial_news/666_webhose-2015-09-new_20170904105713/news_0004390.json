We once again asked college-finance experts to answer some of the recent questions.\nMy daughter is enrolled in a physician-assistant program. She attends school in Chicago, but is doing her residency in New Orleans. She must return to school in Chicago to take her exams. Can I use “529”-account money to purchase her airline tickets?\nAsk Us a Question Have a college-finance question? We’ll be answering them in future funds reports. Send them to reports@wsj.com . Previous College Q&A Columns Questions on 529s (March 2015) Grandparents’ 529s/Fafsa (April 2015) Just Give It Away? (May 2015) Grandma Pays the Tuition (June 2015) Tuition and the Gift Tax (July 2015) This ‘Trick’ Won’t Work (August 2015) The short answer is yes, but transportation costs don’t count as a qualified education expense, meaning you will have to pay tax plus a 10% penalty on the earnings portion of any 529 college-savings funds you use to pay for airline tickets.\nThere is a chance, however, that a portion of the withdrawal won’t be subject to that treatment: “Part of the distribution will likely be from the basis, or what you contributed, and wouldn’t be subject to taxes or a penalty,” says J.J. Montanaro, a financial planner with USAA in San Antonio. What’s more, you can always challenge a decision to count the tickets as a nonqualified expense, says Russell Rivera, a financial adviser and president of Voice Wealth Management in New York City. Such an appeal might succeed, he says, if the school requires travel as part of the program.\nMy daughter has received financial aid based on my income totaling about $30,000 a year. Her grandmother has since offered to give $10,000 toward her college education each year. Can she pay the school directly, or should she give me the money and I will use it for payments in the current year? How will this affect future years?\nIt depends on the family’s objective: maximizing financial aid or minimizing taxes. If the grandmother makes a tuition payment to the school, your daughter will have to report this payment on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, which will affect her aid for the following year. The payment, however, won’t count against the grandmother’s federal gift-tax reporting exemption, notes Mr. Montanaro. If the grandmother instead gives the money to you and you use it to pay tuition, the $10,000 will count toward the grandmother’s gift-tax reporting exemption, which is $14,000 per person a year, but the gift won’t have to be reported on the Fafsa.\nENLARGE Photo: iStock/Getty Images “Another option would be for her grandmother to save the money until after your daughter graduates, at which time she can use the money to help pay off any loans that might have been taken out,” Mr. Rivera says.\nI have young grandchildren for whom I’ve been contributing to 529 plans. I was surprised to see that a grandparent-owned 529 will count 100% on the Fafsa form, but parent-owned 529s at 15%. Can I transfer ownership to the parents now without a tax consequence for anyone?\nActually, grandparent-owned college-savings accounts don’t count in Fafsa aid calculations, although they are included in the CSS Profile, which is the form many colleges use to calculate a student’s eligibility for need-based institutional aid. Parent-owned 529s do count on Fafsa, at 5.64%, Mr. Rivera says.\nHere’s the problem, he says: “Withdrawals from grandparent-owned college savings plans and given to the student or school on the student’s behalf can reduce aid eligibility by up to 50% in the year following the distribution.”\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Search for Low-Volatility Investments Beyond 9/11: Alger Comes Back Hulbert on Bear-Market Havens U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month Water: The New Investing Factor You can get around this by waiting until the last year and a half of the student’s college years to use distributions from your 529 plan, Mr. Rivera says. Alternatively, the assets could be used to pay back the student’s loans after graduation. But because student loans don’t count as a qualified education expense, you typically will face taxes and penalties on the earnings portion, so consult with a tax adviser first.\nIf you decide to switch ownership of your plan, check with your tax adviser on how your future contributions will count, and realize that the plan will affect financial aid, albeit in a less-dramatic way, as a parental asset, Mr. Montanaro says.\nWould a $5,000 loan to the student, or the parents, have the same impact as a gift—that is, be reportable on Fafsa and, like a gift, affect the student’s expected contribution for future years?\nGifts and loans to parents don’t have to be reported on the Fafsa, but gifts and loans to students do and could affect financial aid, Mr. Rivera says, explaining that loans are seen as a form of cash support.\n“Better strategies for a grandparent might include waiting until graduation to help pay off any accrued student loans, paying expenses in the later years of college, or perhaps even cosigning student loans, if you are so inclined to do so,” Mr. Rivera says.\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.
