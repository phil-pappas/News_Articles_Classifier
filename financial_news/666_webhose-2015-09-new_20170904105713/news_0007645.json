Development Programme (UNDP) Monday signed an election financing agreement. \nUnder the agreement, GoL will receive a grant of 10 million Euros from the EU and US$1million from UNDP in support of the 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections. \nMaking remarks at the signing ceremony held at the National Election Commission (NEC) in Sinkor, Finance Minister Amara M. Konneh praised President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for her commitment to the democratic process that has won for Liberia the level of support it continues to receive. \n\"We can say without doubt that the electoral cycles that our country has undergone during the Sirleaf administration have been spirited and peaceful because of our President's commitment to the free and fair exercise of the rights of each Liberian,\" Konneh noted. \nHe also praised the NEC for increasingly improving election processes and demonstrating commitment to protecting the country's fragile peace and democracy, adding that the NEC started maturing beginning 2011. \nMinister Konneh indicated that had Liberia not had the 2014 Special Senatorial Election, the country could have been engulfed in a constitutional crisis that could have led to a call for an interim government. \nHe then lauded the EU and UNDP for always being there for Liberia, and called on others to emulate the two international partners, noting, \"We still need more money to fund the 2017 presidential and legislative elections and the 2016 referendum.\" \nIn remarks earlier, NEC Executive Director Lamin Lighe said the support could not have come at a better time than now that the commission is preparing for the conduct of the 2017 Presidential and Legislative elections and a possible referendum in 2016. \nMeanwhile, the head of EU delegation in Liberia, Tiina Intelmann, and Antonio Vigilante, Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Liberia have pledged their continuous commitment to support Liberia. \nThe 2017 Presidential and legislative elections will witness the peaceful transfer of power from a sitting president to an elected one that was last witnessed in Liberia in 1944.
