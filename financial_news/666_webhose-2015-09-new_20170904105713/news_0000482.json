The company builds software to help IT departments, computer programmers, and other professionals work together online.\nIts two key products are task-tracking tool Jira and project planning aid Confluence.\nFigureheads Mr Cannon-Brookes and Mr Farquhar have become figureheads for the nation's nascent technology sector. Mr Cannon-Brookes has been vocal about preserving the Australian Technology Park in inner-city Sydney as an innovation hub.\nNews of the impending Atlassian IPO comes as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull puts fresh emphasis on the importance of technology, innovation, and digital disruption to Australia's economy.\nMr Turnbull has appointed Australia's youngest MP, the 25-year-old Wyatt Roy, as assistant minister for innovation under the new innovation, industry, and science portfolio held by Christopher Pyne.\nFollowing a fact-finding mission to Israel in December 2014, Mr Roy is a firm believer in policy that supports innovators through commercialisation and seed funding .\nLabor's Jason Clare, the opposition communications spokesman, has already flagged his party's bipartisan support for policy that aids Australia's digital economy .\nClear intentions Atlassian appointed former General Electric and eBay executive Erik Bardman as chief financial officer in February in a clear move toward an IPO on either the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Stock Exchange.\nAt the time of Mr Bardman's appointment, Atlassian president Jay Simons told the Fairfax Media that there are only a handful of household names in the B2B (business-to-business) space including Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and SAP, and Atlassian is \"on the path to joining that club\".\nOracle, Microsoft and IBM all have primary listings on American stock exchanges while Germany's SAP has American Depository Receipts listed in New York.\nMr Cannon-Brookes said in August that there was no deadline on an IPO and the company was in no hurry to list.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/australian-software-tools-maker-atlassian-planning-u-s-ipo-1443213301", "http://www.afr.com/it-pro/atlassians-mike-cannonbrookes-says-australian-technology-park-worth-390m-20150830-gjavg1", "http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/how-to-create-a-startup-nation-under-malcolm-turnbull-20150918-gjq5ke", "http://www.afr.com/technology/freelancer-soars-to-250-on-asx-debut-20131115-iyv7a", "http://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-fast-tracks-nyse-float-20150211-13bl3j", "http://www.afr.com/opinion/labor-we-can-work-with-malcolm-turnbull-on-digital-revolution-20150924-gju0n7"], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T12:57:12.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
