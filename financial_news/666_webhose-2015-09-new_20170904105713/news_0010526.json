Whitney Curtis/The New York Times by Chris Hourigan We need to stop presenting our ageing population as one of the big problems the country faces right now and start thinking about it as part of the solution to our productivity and participation woes.\nTo this end, it was heartening to see last week's National Reform Summit include those aged over 50 when it examined the urgent need to lift the rate of productivity growth and improve labour force participation.\nOlder people frequently feel overlooked and undervalued. Trying to get some service in a retail outlet? If you have grey hair you may feel invisible. A date of birth in the 1960s or, shudder, even earlier? Don't put it on a CV as it will go straight to the bottom of the pile.\nDiscounting the value of a large and growing proportion of Australians makes no sense.\nTaking a glass-half-full approach to our ageing population would open up some enormous long term opportunities for Australia's society and economy.\nThis is especially the case when the demographic changes that are seeing us lead longer, healthier lives are considered alongside this era of extraordinary technological advancement.\nWith the support of Johnson & Johnson, the Sydney-based McKell Institute explored the impact of these two developments in a research report discussed at the last week's Summit.\nOlder Australians can be left disadvantaged in the wake of advancing technology if they cannot adapt to inevitable changes. However, technology can also improve their situation by increasing productivity and helping them to acquire new skills.\n Healthcare has to be at the heart of increased participation and here too, the lines of demographic change and technology-enabled transformation intersect. We can use targeted investment in healthcare, for example, to address the development of chronic medical conditions that are major barriers to workforce participation and social engagement for many older people.\nOur healthcare system can benefit greatly from the emergence of big data analytics and integrated healthcare services and a more streamlined, efficient and cost effective system that can help to offset the potential cost impacts of a an ageing population.\nThe positive relationship between a healthy old age and a productive old age goes both ways; if you feel good you are likely to stay engaged in the community and/or or in paid work for longer and the evidence suggests those who keep participating in these ways have a healthier old age.\nThe McKell research estimates the value of the untapped potential of inactive, unemployed and underemployed older workers at $32.8 billion. Yes, there are some significant barriers to overcome, including age discrimination by employers, but technology disruption is also opening up other routes to work.\nThere is no reason, for example, that start-ups should be solely the province of the young and simple steps could be taken to make self-employment more desirable for older Australians. These include tackling fears that working part time could increase tax liability or reduce access to financial support to a disproportionate degree.\nGreater integration of individuals with the \"shared economy\" would also help stimulate workforce participation as Australia ages. There are some interesting examples of this elsewhere. In the United States for example, Uber has joined forces with the Life Reimagined initiative of AARP (formerly the American Association of Retirees and Pensioners) to encourage drivers aged over 40 to sign up as Uber drivers. This was reported in one headline as \"Uber wants your parents as drivers if they can use a smartphone\".\nChildcare is another example of where older Australians could become part of the solution. Right now, a lack of quality facilities combined with a higher workforce participation rate among women has created huge demand for childcare and pushed up costs. Matching senior Australians to the childcare industry could provide health and wellness benefits for seniors, improve social development and educational outcomes for children and benefit industry as a whole by filling in a gap in demand.\nIt's also important to have a broad view of productivity that includes other measures of activity such as volunteering, child-minding and mentoring.\nEven small increases in individual engagement can deliver big benefits across society. Earlier this year, McCrindle Research estimated the value of one volunteering hour in Australia at $31. There are around 5.1 million baby boomers in Australia who have recently begun to enter retirement age. The McKell research estimates that if each of those baby boomers cut the amount of television they watched by just 10 minutes a day and spent that time volunteering instead, the added value to the economy would be $3.1 billion every year.\nAs Australians live longer, the concept of retirement is changing. More productive older years pay dividends for both the individuals involved and society as whole.\nAs the National Reform Summit noted, Australia has a strong record of undertaking reforms and investing wisely in its people to lift productivity. There is huge scope to build on these achievements by increasing older Australians' capacity to be active and productive throughout their later years.\nWe know that living longer is good for the individual; it should also be good for the economy.\nChris Hourigan is Managing Director of Janssen Australia and New Zealand, a pharmaceutical company of Johnson & Johnson.", "external_links": ["http://mckellinstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/McKell-Institute_Positive-Disruption.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-04T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:03:48.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
