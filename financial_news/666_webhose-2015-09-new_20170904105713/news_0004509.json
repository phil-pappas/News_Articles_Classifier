The latest of such deals was UnitedHealth Group Inc's $12.8 billion acquisition of Catamaran Corp .\nEvercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said he did not expect a shift in the company's strategy under the new CEO, adding that over time Wentworth \"may be open to a more diverse set of growth opportunities\".\nWentworth, who came from Medco, has been president at Express Scripts since February 2014. He had also worked at PepsiCo Inc.\nExpress Scripts shares were little changed in trading after the bell. They closed down 1 percent at $83.61 on the Nasdaq.
