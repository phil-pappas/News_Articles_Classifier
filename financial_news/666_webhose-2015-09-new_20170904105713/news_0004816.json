Wayne Taylor by David Ramli Dodo founder Larry Kestelman says Vocus Communications and M2 Group must merge to become more like newly bulked up larger rival TPG Telecom, in order to survive.\nM2 and Vocus announced on Monday they would merge to become a $3 billion telco titan that would buy up rivals and take on bigger players like Telstra, Optus and TPG.\nIt was Mr Kestelman's 2013 sale of Dodo to M2 that helped cement the latter's position as one of Australia's biggest providers of broadband services. Both companies worked by reselling the internet services of other telcos.\nBut Mr Kestelman told Fairfax Media that the days of resellers thriving were over thanks to the $56 billion national broadband network as well as the rise of much larger consolidated telcos like TPG, which recently bought its rival iiNet for $1.56 billion .\n\"You probably need to have a combination of infrastructure and sales experience,\" he said. \"The days of the pure and absolute MVNO [mobile virtual network operator] are probably gone.\n\"That's why I think this was an important deal for them to do. They now make another version of TPG and you've seen the success that TPG has had.\"\nHe described the merger as \"a great deal\" and said it was vital because both parties now had more control over the prices they paid for services as well as how they reached out to customers.\nOne example of this in action the plan by Vocus to explore the expansion of its fibre optic footprint to give M2 customers access to fibre to the basement services. These would offer NBN-like internet services at potentially lower prices.\n \"This certainly gives them the option of doing that now and without each other it wouldn't have been,\" Mr Kestelman said. \"For Vocus to be doing that, it's not their core because they don't have the customers and vice-versa without the fibre network M2 wouldn't be able to do it.\n\"They can act as TPG does and have their fate in their own hands while watching what happens with NBN and the government.\"\nAnalysts have largely backed the deal on its strategic merits since its announcement.\nCiti Research analyst Ross Barrows said combining the companies could see them generating savings that were higher than the $40 million per annum currently forecast.\n\"We do not anticipate any ACCC issues considering that this is a vertical integration play given Vocus' fixed infrastructure focus and M2's retail focus,\" he told clients in a note. \"We think $40 million in cost synergies can be exceeded given that it represents only [about] 4 per cent of the combined entities' operating cost base and the potential to use Vocus' fixed infrastructure assets to on-sell M2's services.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:07:11.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
