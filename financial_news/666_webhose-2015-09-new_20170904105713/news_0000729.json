Its shares were up 16 percent at 79.43 pence by 1504 GMT. \nThe Swiss-based company said its business remained operationally and financially robust and it was confident in the medium and long-term fundamentals of its commodities, which include copper and coal. \n\"We have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues,\" a company spokesman said in a statement. \n\"Glencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding.\" \nThe shares had plunged on Monday wiping about 3.5 billion pounds from Glencore's market value on fears the group was not doing enough to cut its $30 billion debt pile as commodity prices tumbled. \nChief Executive Ivan Glasenberg had to bow to shareholder pressure this month by agreeing to cut Glencore's debts and protect its credit rating after the prices of its main products fell. \nGlencore plans to suspend dividends, sell assets and raise cash, among other measures, to cut its net debt by a third by the end of 2016. The group has already raised $2.5 billion through a share placement. \nThe company's $10 billion share listing in London in 2011 turned its managers into billionaires. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) there is speculation it might make sense for Glencore management to take the company private. \nAnalysts at Citi have said Glencore should consider going private via a management buyout. Such a move would make it easier to restructure while metals prices are slumping and could allow various assets to be spun off. \n\"In the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly,\" Citi analysts wrote in a note to clients. \nBut mining industry bankers said it would be virtually impossible for management to put together the required financing for any buyout. \n\"How, in a market where everyone thinks it has too much leverage, would you put leverage on it?\" one senior banker said. \nInstead, the company is expected to step up its divestment plans beyond those already announced earlier this month, one banking source said, adding that while other options like a company split or a buyout of the trading business were possible, they were unlikely. \nThree Glencore executives are among the firm's top ten shareholders, including Glasenberg with an 8.42 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data. Just two weeks ago, management took up 22 percent of the new shares being issued at 125 pence each. The stock has fallen more than a third since then. \nGlencore has been holding talks with talks with investor trade body Investment Association related to its $2.5 billion equity placing, Sky News reported. \nSome investors, including the Investment Association, have criticised the way in which Glencore raised the money, saying that the mining company had breached shareholder protection principles. \nA spokesman for Investment Association confirmed to Reuters that the trade body was in talks with Glencore, but did not divulge any further details. Glencore declined to comment. \n(Additional reporting by Freya Berry in London.; Writing by Jane Merriman.
