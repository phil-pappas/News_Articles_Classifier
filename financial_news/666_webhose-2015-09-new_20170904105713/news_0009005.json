Only one in ten parents thinks that kids should start learning about personal finances past their mid-teen years or even later than that.\n“Anticipating what the future might hold for their young ones is an aspect that concerns many parents, if not all of them,” said Abigail Nixon, Managing Director of Voth Nixon Group. “Despite economies around the world showing signs of improvement, parents are still worrying when it comes to their children’s financial outlook. A good way to avoid such concerns would be long term planning and investing early, with small and regular contributions. In order to assist parents with preparing for their children’s future monetary needs Voth Nixon Group has published the 'Setting Aside for the Future: Guide' which offers unbiased information regarding available options without the complicated vocabulary of the economic industry. It has become more than apparent that parents consider education a fundamental element in helping people appreciate the importance of setting aside funds for future plans and offering this sort of education to their kids will teach them the value of prudent saving.”\nAbout Voth Nixon Group\nVoth Nixon Group is a global asset administration group, managing capital for both institutional and retail investors across the world.
