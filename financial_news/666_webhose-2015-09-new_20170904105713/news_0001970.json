The proposal will be vetted by a sub-committee tomorrow for making final recommendations to the CBT.\nThe trustees will also consider a proposal to provide incentives to EPFO pensioners for digitally filing their live certificates.\nAt present, these certificates are manually filed by pensioners at the banks. EPFO pays service charges to banks for collecting these live certificates of pensioners.\nUnder the proposed Jeevan Pramaan Patra scheme, the pensioners’ live certificate will be collected through e-mode.\nIt is proposed to provide one time incentive of Rs 100 to pensioners registering under the scheme and Rs 30 for subsequent years. EPFO has about 51 lakh pensioners.\nIt is also proposed to provide incentives to employers to encourage seeding universal account number with know your customer (KYC) details like bank account number, PAN and Aadhaar.\nThe employers will be refunded a part of administrative charges under this proposed scheme.\nEPFO will also place performance review of its fund managers for 2014-15 before CBT, which placed SBI at the top with a score of 99.64 out of 100 followed by Reliance Capital (99.49), ICICI Securities PD Ltd (99.42) and HSBC AML (99).\n 08, 2015 5:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:18:47.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
