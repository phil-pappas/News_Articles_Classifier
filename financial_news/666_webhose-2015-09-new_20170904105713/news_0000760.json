According to mounting evidence fraudsters flock to mobile fraud because it’s easy.According to the recently published TechRepublic article over 30% of all identity fraud attacks start out on the phone ( http://www.techrepublic.com/article/phone-identity-fraud-is-the-new-low-hanging-fruit-for-crooks/ ). This adds to the perhaps more alarming fact that mobile phones play a vital role in customer onboarding, where much of the identity fraud begins. The typical use case in customer-not-present account opening in regulated markets involves customer taking a photo of their ID using their smartphone cameras and submitting it via their mobile device or computer for authentication and data referencing. Amazingly, the common practice is still having these pictures eyed by a back-office team. Mostly NOT border control experts… The result is unreliable yet slow and costly fraud screening. But the technology that moves the low hanging fruit away from the reach of many fraudsters is already there. BOS, the first 2nd generation ID image authentication and processing technology is already used by an increasing number of market majors. This technology takes advantage of the capabilities that already exists in today’s smartphone, far better than any 1st generation solution. BOS technology is designed for handling sub-optimal image qualities that so characterize online. It can detect image tampering even if manipulated data is perfectly logical, and it can add even collateral indicators that may suggest potential risk.AU10TIX draws attention to the fact that identity fraud prevention should start already at customer onboarding, and the technology for it is already there.\n“Obviously there is an arms race and battle of brains between fraudsters and online/mobile service providers”, says Ron Atzmon, Managing Director of AU10TIX: “It is already clear that identity fraud prevention is a multi-factor thing, and robust multi-factor ID authentication is now available in online and mobile channels. You don’t want to mess with a fraudster that’s already in, using fraudulent identity he or she whitewashed at onboarding. In that case you’re likely to get it once the fraud has already been make”.\n“Identity fraud prevention is inseparable from customer onboarding”, says Ofer Friedman, VP Marketing of AU10TIX: “Those who behave otherwise are losing customers and money. 2nd generation ID authentication technology is a 2-in-1 package. The same seconds-fast process get you both multi-factor authentication and a ready to use data set, speeding up customer onboarding and saving operating costs at the same time you’ve got yourself the deepest Id fraud protection and KYC compliance possible today. In other words, security and operating efficiency are one and the same for BOS users.“\nAbout AU10TIX\nAU10TIX Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of ICTS International N.V, deals with the authentication and digitization of identifying documents including Passports, identity cards, driving licenses and other complementary identifying documents.
