Representatives for CPI Card Group didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.\nCPI filed its initial prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 7. It’s planning to go public as U.S. credit-card companies push toward issuing more secure-chip cards.\nThe company makes cards issued for brands including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, as well as Interac in Canada, the Aug. 7 prospectus shows. The firm estimates it makes about 35 percent of all U.S. financial payments cards, with clients including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.\nCPI Card Group, which is 91 percent owned by funds of Vancouver-based private-equity firm Tricor Pacific Capital Inc., seeks to tap into a forecasted 4.3 percent compound annual growth rate of payment cards in the next five years, helped by U.S. adoption of more secure and expensive chip cards that’ll replace magnetic-stripe cards, according to the filing.\nCPI Card Group made more than 360 million cards last year and provided services to more than 3,200 card-issuing banks and prepaid debit card issuers, the filing shows. The company earned $13.3 million in the year ended Dec. 31, up 55 percent from the prior year on a 33 percent gain in revenue to $261 million.\nBank of Montreal, Goldman Sachs Group and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are leading the sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:28:05.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
