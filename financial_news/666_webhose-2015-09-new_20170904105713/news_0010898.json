He said Mr. Oshiomhole was misleading Nigerians with \"wild and spurious\" allegations. \nThe former minister said, \"The Federal Government of Nigeria, guided by the Transaction Adviser, Roughton International, agreed to provide a refundable Catalytic Funding of N30bn. By May 2015, N10bn Catalytic Funding was paid from the Federal Ministry of Works' SURE-P Budget to fast-track the early and sub-structural works of the bridge. This implies that the successful concessionaire, JB-NSIA Consortium, has responsibility for the design, finance and construction of the project, as well as its operation.\" \nHe added that the total project cost is N108bn (excluding duties and Value Added Tax) with a completion period of about 48 months. This cost was arrived at, after the Bureau of Public Procurement's review of the concessionaire's submitted cost of N138bn, the former minister said. \nHowever, Mr. Oshiomhole said since the former minister was aware that no reasonable work had been done on the second Niger Bridge, he and the mangers of the sovereign wealth funds should simply explain to Nigeria what they did with the huge amount that was withdrawn for the project. \n\"The real people who should apologize to Nigerians for their many sins against the country are those who expended so much of our resources without any corresponding achievements to show for it,\" the governor said. \nThe governor accused the former minister and the past administration of destroying existing roads rather than rehabilitate them. \nHe said, \"In Edo state, the Aduwawa end of the Benin-Auchi road is almost impassable especially during this rainy season. As we speak, erosion has cut off the Benin-Auchi road into two and motorists are going through hell passing through that road. What about Benin- Abraka road; one hell of a road completely abandoned and vandalized. In the name of politics, they came trying to impress Edo people but ended up depressing all of us.\" Nigeria \nThe naira depreciated by N5 to N220 per dollar yesterday in the parallel market as dollar demand to fund Hajj pilgrimage … see more » Copyright © 2015 Premium Times.
