Hence, it is very much needed to increase the fund management charge for managing of the pension funds to be somewhere between 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent,” HDFC Pension chief executive Sumit Shukla told PTI.\nHowever, UTI MF, which has a separate vertical and manages pension fund, feels the fund management charges must be increased to 25 basis points.\n“We have demanded that the commission to be paid to pension fund managers must be increased to 25 basis points to make it a fair number,” UTI MF group president, sales and marketing, Suraj Kaeley said.\nPFRDA chairman Hemant Contractor had recently said here that the regulator was in favour of hike in commission, so as to popularise the NPS, the matter was being reviewed.\nFirst Published on August 28, 2015 10:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:31:49.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
