Bloomberg by Trevor Sykes To be a successful share trader all you need is deep pockets, strong nerves, impeccable timing and good luck. Any reader with those attributes could have made a fortune trading Wesfarmers over the past year.\nAs spring burst out in 2014 Wesfarmers was trading about $43. It plunged to $40 in October, soared almost to $47 in February then slumped below $39 in June. This financial year it reached $43 at the start of August and is now about $39 again, making the shares a tempting buy.\nIt is an index of market instability that a solid heavyweight with a good business should have such a jagged share price. Between February and June the company lost 18 per cent of its value on the ASX. That's ridiculous, as well as being an absolute refutation of the efficient-market hypothesis.\nIt also underlines the futility of trying to make logical forecasts of share price movements in a volatile market. Nevertheless, here goes.\nWesfarmers is one of the giants of the ASX, owning a retail empire which includes (in order of importance) Coles, Bunnings, Officeworks, Kmart and Target. Its other businesses – insurance, coal mining, chemicals, energy, fertilisers, industrial and safety – are relatively minor. So while a business such as coal mining may be under pressure, its overall impact on Wesfarmers is probably going to be slight.\nIn 2014-15, Wesfarmers revenue from continuing operations rose 3.6 per cent to $62.4 billion, a modest increase but OK. Of that total, 61 per cent was generated by Coles and another 18 per cent by Bunnings and Officeworks.\nGroup stalwarts Those three are the powerhouses of Wesfarmers. Officeworks is dominant in office supplies (just look at their margin on ink cartridges), and Bunnings has so far seen off competition from Masters. Bunnings' great advantage is that its big stores all around Australia are in the best locations at historical costs. It could take a generation for Masters to match that real estate.\n Coles, however, has competition from its traditional rival Woolworths as well as upstarts such as IGA and Aldi. In 2014-15 Wesfarmers reported earnings before interest and taxation at $3.76 billion, of which Coles contributed 47 per cent. Total EBIT generated by Coles, Officeworks and Bunnings was a tick under $3 billion, or nearly 80 per cent.\nGroup earnings per share was $2.16. At $40, Wesfarmers is on a trailing price/earnings multiple of 18.5 times. In a normal market at a time of historically low interest rates, that would be an attractive multiple.\nThe external factors which have sparked much of the recent market turmoil and the steep decline of the Australian dollar should be neutral for Wesfarmers because the rising cost of imports should affect retail rivals as well as Wesfarmers.\nBut the sheer intensity of competition is more likely to make retailing an increasingly tough battleground over the next year or two. And as the sharemarket could well continue handing out severe shocks, investors need to be a little wary.\nGiven all these factors, it is difficult to see more than modest increases in net profits over the next two years, while share prices could remain skittish. So Wesfarmers looks reasonably well valued between $39 and $40, while $45 would be a stretch.\nThe big question mark is over the payout ratio. In 2014-15, Wesfarmers paid dividends of $2 a share. At a share price of $40, Wesfarmers is therefore on a yield of 5 per cent before franking, making the yield a big attraction for investors. So the yield is fine but growth may be limited.\nHowever, the payout ratio is 92.5 per cent – nosebleed altitude.\nAt the media conference after issuing its accounts, Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder said the group had always had a \"pretty full\" payout ratio. He said: \"The pleasing thing over the last few years is we've done that by investing heavily in our businesses and maintaining our credit rating.\"\nThe credit rating is important because Wesfarmers funded its dividend by borrowing. The cash-flow statement shows operations and investments generated net cash flow of $1.9 billion, but dividends cost nearly $2.6 billion. That was funded by running down cash during the year from $2 billion to $711 million. Group debt rose from $5 billion to $6.5 billion.\nOn top of the dividends Wesfarmers spent $864 million on a capital return and share consolidation. Issued capital reduced by 19.5 million shares, indicating Wesfarmers paid an average $44.25 for its own stock. Which shows Wesfarmers is no better at share trading than the rest of us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:47:25.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
