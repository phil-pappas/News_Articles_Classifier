Continued suspense surrounding the US Fed's intentions of raising interest rates will force BoU to adopt a 'wait and see' attitude before intervening in the forex market as a result of depleted stabilisation resources,\" said Rachael Kaggwa Sebudde, lead economist at the World Bank Uganda country office. \nA large current account deficit caused by surging imports pegged to large infrastructure projects and depressed exports is expected to put further pressure on the shilling, observers say. \nThe country's current account deficit increased from 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2013/14 to 8.8 per cent of GDP in 2014/15 while total export revenues fell by 2.8 per cent to $680 million at the end of June. The Ugandan shilling lost 24 per cent against the greenback during 2014/15, according to World Bank data -- a trend that saw the former hit Ush3,300 in June amid increased capital flight caused by investor worries over economic stability prior to next year's general election. \nA weaker shilling directly translates into higher import expenses incurred by government and private enterprises and increased core inflation -- an official gauge of price changes in foreign sourced goods and services. \nRising interest rates triggered by steep increases in the Central Bank Rate (CBR) witnessed since June have raised risks of \"crowding out\" for the private sector and increased interest payments incurred by government on domestic debt; a trend that could translate into muted economic growth.
