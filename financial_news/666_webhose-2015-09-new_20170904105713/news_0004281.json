The Vehicle Certification Agency, the UK regulator, is working with vehicle manufacturers to ensure that this issue is not industry wide. \n\"As part of this work they will re-run laboratory tests where necessary and compare them against real world driving emissions.\" \nDetails of the 11 million cars fitted with the dodgy software are also set to be released in the next day or two, which will tell drivers of diesel VWs, Audis, Skodas or Seats whether their vehicle could be recalled. \nVolkswagen already faces billions of pounds worth of fines, class suits and a criminal investigation in the US. \nThe company sells more cars than any other company but has seen its shares plunge by 40% since Friday. \nThis was when US regulators said it admitted to fitting the emission test-cheating software to hundreds of thousands of diesel cars. \nMercedes (Xetra: 710000 - news ) on Friday said it does not use defeat devices \"which illegitimately limit the effectiveness of the exhaust after-treatment system\". A spokesman said: \"This applies to every Mercedes-Benz diesel and petrol engine worldwide.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:06:29.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
