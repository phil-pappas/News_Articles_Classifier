Forty years later it becomes clear what refugees can contribute to society.\" -- Cecilia Araneda, Winnipeg filmmaker who was just four years old when her family fled Chile. Surplus for Canada NDP leader Tom Mulcair. On the plus side: The federal government posted a surprise $1.9-billion surplus in 2014-15 — bringing the country's books back into balance a year earlier than expected. The Finance Department released year-end figures Monday for a period that was supposed to instead generate a $2-billion shortfall. Trudeau’s not buying it: With that announcement, Justin Trudeau is accusing Conservative Leader Stephen Harper of balancing the budget on the backs of a cross-section of vulnerable Canadians. \"We saw Mr. Harper underspending and making cuts to Veterans Affairs, to Aboriginal Affairs, to Seniors — in the billions of dollars — so he could balance the books in time for his election.” Mulcair says good for us: NDP Leader Tom Mulcair, meanwhile, says this is good for Canadians and allows the NDP to take over the reins of power on good footing. Hmm, someone’s been reading the polls. Meanwhile, Mia Rabson will talk to local folks here about the economy and what Manitobans would like to see. Back in business At left, Darren Rainkie, interim president and CEO of Manitoba Hydro, and Premier Greg Selinger announce a new export sales agreement with SaskPower on Monday. The business of hydro: Premier Greg Selinger and Manitoba Hydro interim president Darren Rainkie announced today that SaskPower will buy a minimum of 100 megawatts of electricity from Manitoba beginning in 2020. Terms were not disclosed. The sale will necessitate construction of an 80-kilometre transmission line between Birtle, Man., and Tantalon, Sask., at a cost of about $50 million. The good news comes just a day before Hydro executives are set to appear before a standing committee of the Manitoba legislature. City business: The city's alternative services delivery committee approved several department funding requests for projects promising to save the city money but a review of the fire paramedic service wasn't one of them. School business: Winnipeg School Division trustees will unveil their new livestreaming of school board meetings this evening at 7 p.m. Officials said the web portal will be loaded later today on their website. The WSD has been criticized for not being transparent enough. In case you missed it 'As service gets cut, people get frustrated,' union head John Callahan says of the recent shortage of Winnipeg Transit buses due to maintenance delays. No quick fix: Problems with Winnipeg Transit will not be resolved overnight. And the Transit union warned city hall long ago that this was an issue. Healthy food: The city of Winnipeg may be adopting a policy soon on access to healthy foods. A food policy council is being spearheaded by Food Matters Manitoba, which advocates for the use of more locally grown food and the reduction of food waste. Chewing the fat: Dan Lett talks to campaign insiders about how the election is going so far. Other voices Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been ousted by Malcolm Turnbull in the Liberal leadership race. Politics down under: There’s been a shake-up in politics in Australia. Liberal Malcolm Turnbull has won the leadership over Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The Australian has the full story. Shaken baby syndrome: A report out of the New York Times suggests that perhaps the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome has been used too liberally. Water, water everywhere: B.C. has passed new legislation that gives the province more control over its water. It closes a loophole in the 100-year-old laws governing water. Today in history Election day: In 1926, William Lyon Mackenzie King (1874-1950) defeated Arthur Meighen in the general election, winning 128 seats to the Conservatives' 91, with 46.1 per cent of the popular vote.
