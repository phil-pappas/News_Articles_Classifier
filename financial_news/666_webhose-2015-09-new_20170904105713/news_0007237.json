It is about to set up its own office in China to manage surging demand for products from western countries. Louise Kennerley by Simon Evans Optimism that heavy demand in China for Australasian vitamins will continue to accelerate helped drive a strong sharemarket debut by vitamins and sports nutrition products company Vitaco and pushed industry stalwart Blackmores to a fresh record high on Wednesday.\nAfter a $232 million initial public offering with an issue price of $2.10, Vitaco burst onto the ASX in its opening trades at $2.50, representing a 19 per cent premium to its issue price. The stock reached as high as $2.59 in early trading before settling back to close at $2.38 delivering a solid 13.3 per cent gain on debut.\nPrivate equity firm Next Capital is selling down its stake in Vitaco, which it has owned since 2007 after the merger of Healtheries and Nutra-Life, from 71 per cent to about 15 per cent.\nVitaco is in the final stages of setting up its own corporate office in China to oversee the rapid expansion in demand from that country. Chief executive Ryan D'Almeida said the company hasn't \"touched the sides yet\" in harnessing the opportunities from Chinese buyers entranced by western brands.\nMr D'Almeida said the demand from China for vitamins and nutrition products manufactured in Australia and New Zealand is accelerating, and now represents about 8 per cent of Vitaco's total sales of $172 million, from negligible levels a year ago.\nOrders are being serviced from a warehouse in China with most of the buying coming through Vitaco's Healtheries online site on the popular Tmall Chinese-language portal which is part of Chinese web giant Alibaba's operations.\n\"We're in the process of putting people on the ground up there,\" Mr D'Almeida said.\nGrowing demand from China Surging demand from China has been behind a five-fold jump in the share price of Blackmores over the past 12 months as it rose from $25 to hit a record $131.99 earlier this month. That record was eclipsed on Wednesday when it reached a new intra-day record of $132.99 before closing at $130, up 5 per cent for the day.\nThe demand is also fuelling expectations of a hefty sale price of $1 billion-plus for Melbourne-based Swisse Wellness which is heading towards the final stages in a process likely to deliver new majority shareholders via a trade sale, or capital injection .\nMr D'Almeida said there is no danger of the demand from China and other Asian countries being unsustainable, because the appetite for \"clean and green\" products manufactured in Australasia is vast. The local population trusts western brands, especially after some health scares involving local Chinese manufacturers in food and infant formula, he said.\n\"There's obviously a massive population with a macro interest in health and wellness and there's a real affinity for western brands,\" Mr D'Almeida said. \"We haven't even touched the sides yet.\"\nHe said the Vitaco business in Australia and New Zealand is showing strong growth because of similar trends, with fitness and good health an increasing priority for Australians.\nVitaco bought the Bodytrim business in 2014 and in June, 2015 finalised the acquisition of the Musashi nutrition supplements and protein powders brand.\nThe general population is also much more focused on health, and it isn't only people going to the gym that are buying low-carb protein bars. He said the biggest selling products in the Vitaco range include Aussie Bodies lo-carb bars which make people feel fuller, and less inclined to snack.\n\"It's not just people who want bigger biceps,\" he said, referring to the broad range of people consuming sports nutrition products. On the vitamins side of the business, an aged garlic product sold under the Wagners brand is delivering stand-out growth.\nMr D'Almeida said while expanding the China business was a major priority, the company would also be looking to bring more brands into its portfolio through acquisitions because the vitamins and sports nutrition market is highly fragmented. Vitaco operates its own manufacturing plants in New Zealand.\n\"We clearly have an appetite to continue to consolidate,\" he said. \"There are good synergies that accrue by being a manufacturer and bringing those brands under our roof.\"\nVitaco's chairman is Greg Richards, who is also chairman of electronics and DVD retailer JB Hi-Fi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:13:32.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
