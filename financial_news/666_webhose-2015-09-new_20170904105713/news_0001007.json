But they oppose a shutdown confrontation over Planned Parenthood, which is under intense criticism for undercover videos that raise questions about its practice of supplying fetal tissue for scientific research.\nA \"Dear Colleague\" letter by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello promises to \"avoid repeating the mistakes of the past\" — a reference to the GOP-sparked 2013 shutdown over implementation of the new health care law.\n\"We are writing today to express our strong support for a funding resolution that will avoid another unnecessary and harmful government shutdown,\" the GOP freshmen wrote.\nThe eleven said they were \"elected by our constituents to be principled, pragmatic leaders.\"\nWednesday's letter came as Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., criticized the tea party's strategy — most strongly backed by GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas — in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\"I'm tired of the people on my side of the aisle who have been pushing this strategy even though they know they don't have the votes,\" Ayotte said Tuesday. \"They can't answer the question, 'What's the end game for success?'\"\nThe Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday afternoon on a measure that would fund the government through Dec. 11 and try to \"defund\" Planned Parenthood. Its expected failure at the hands of filibustering Democrats would then set the stage for a vote on a more traditional temporary funding bill that would be free of the Planned Parenthood controversy.\nThe plans of House leaders such as Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who often struggles to control his divided GOP conference, remain unclear.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that Rep. Ryan Costello is from Pennsylvania and that letter was sent Wednesday, not Tuesday.\nPlanned Parenthood government shutdown GOP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T20:38:36.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
