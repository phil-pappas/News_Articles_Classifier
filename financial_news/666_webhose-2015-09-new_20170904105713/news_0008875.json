Rob Homer Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The nation's current account deficit blew out in the June quarter after a slump in both prices and shipments of iron ore and coal exports, increasing the risk that the economy contracted for the first time since 2011.\nPlunging global commodity prices saw the terms of trade fall 3.4 per cent from the previous three months, widening the current account deficit to $19 billion from $13.5 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.\nEconomists had tipped a deficit of $16 billion.\nCritically, for Wednesday's much-anticipated national accounts, net exports will subtract 0.6 percentage points from growth in the June quarter - or double the amount forecast by analysts.\nSigns are mounting that the strong export performance of the March quarter - which was the source of almost all of the quarter's gross domestic product growth - faltered in the three months through June after prices for Australia's main exports fell.\nThe Abbott government seized on the March quarter's 0.9 per cent GDP growth as evidence of Australia's relative outperformance.\nHowever, the average forecast for GDP in the second quarter - due to be published on Wednesday - is for growth of less than half that amount, which would take annual growth to just over 2 per cent, or one of the weakest expansions since the global financial crisis.\nTuesday's export data is likely to see many economists further downgrade their GDP predictions for the second quarter, with some already warning that Australia may be facing its first economic contraction in the almost two years since the Abbott government won office.\n Iron ore exports fell 8 per cent - or by $1.6 billion - in the June quarter, with volumes down 2 per cent and prices down 6 per cent, the ABS said on Tuesday.\nCoal slumped 11 per cent, with volumes down 8 per cent and prices 4 per cent lower.\nThe commodities rout - which augurs badly for the government's hopes of a politically pain-free return to budget surplus - was not offset by any major improvement in rural exports.\nFarm exports rose just $11 million to $11.3 billion, with volumes down 1 per cent and prices up 1 per cent.\nThe Australian dollar was little changed after the data, trading at US71.13Â¢.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-01T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:23:10.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
