Allocation levels are reassessed every two years, and each year a committee sits down to question its assumptions about capital markets and expectations between asset classes – global equities versus local; sovereign bonds versus corporate credit; that sort of thing.\nCommon sense v models Objective scrutiny is also applied via some old-fashioned optimisation, where a maths model tells the team which mix of assets is best. But optimisation should only really be used as an initial input, dePourbaix says. \"An optimiser won't factor in other risks; it doesn't account for things like credit risk, liquidity risk, leverage – all these other risk factors that are very important when developing your asset allocation.\"\nIlliquid assets are a prime example. Because they're not priced daily, they'll show as having extremely low volatility, which will prompt an optimiser to pile in to them. \"You need common sense,\" he says.\nDePourbaix says about half the \"value add\" in the portfolio is expected from expertise in allocation and half from fund manager selection. Only one passive fund is included in the portfolio, in Australian listed property.\nFund managers are each chosen to play a role in the portfolio, he says, where there are three selection criteria: \"beta\" (market exposure), \"risk control\" (where a manager's flexibility vary exposure to market risk is favoured) and \"alpha\".\n\"It's very difficult to time the market effectively,\" he says, so managers who have flexibility to move to cash, for example, will provide a \"buffer\". The \"alpha\" realm is where small cap and hedge funds reside. \"Those parts of the market and strategies we believe can generate [returns] in excess to the benchmark.\"\n Beta, risk control and alpha are mixed to suit the client's risk profile. A conservative client will suit a portfolio where risk control is dialled up, to lower chances of capital loss when the market dumps.\n'You get what you pay for' Fund managers charge fees, of course, but dePourbaix reckons you get what you pay for. \"Sometimes the conversation gets too skewed around cost.\"\nOnly time will tell if a strategy works, no matter how high the fees. A relationship with a manager who is not cutting it will need to be ended, in the hope its performance doesn't suddenly improve. How do you know when to sack a fund manager? If the manager's Lonsec rating slips to below \"recommended\", it's on review. If new managers set up shop, it's another reason for an incumbent to be nervous. An example is the alternatives class, where new strategies have been offered in the past few years.\nLet's explore that asset class for a moment, because \"alternatives\" is the most unhelpful handle anyone could have ever come up with. What's in these new alternative funds? \"They have a different return profile and risk profile from traditional assets,\" he says. \"Growth alternatives\" can be as risky as equities and include hedge funds and multistrategy hedge funds. They may have low correlation to shares, he says, and even provide some \"downside protection\".\n\"Defensive alternatives\" includes hedge funds again, but bonds managers who can short positions and rig portfolios to magically achieve negative duration, when needed. (Lonsec also runs model portfolios that exclude alternatives.)\nLet's end on bonds, where this growth portfolio could look a little overweight to some folk. DePourbaix acknowledges the growth-defensive conversation is never straightforward. Just look at balanced funds, he says. \"We're 60:40, some of the industry is 70:30, some is 50:50 – there's no right or wrong; it is really about how does that fit within the suite of risk profiles.\"\nThe weightings, he says, reflect a logical trade-off between risk and return. \"That is what we're trying to achieve there.\"\nHe concedes Australian equities are favoured for franked income, and recommends caution about expecting too much from the US for a while. \"We are cognisant of understanding what our risk exposures are.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:07:58.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
