Kirstin Scholtz by Carrie LaFrenz and Sue Mitchell Global action sports retailer Quiksilver – founded in Victoria almost 50 years ago – has put its American arm into bankruptcy and plans to cut debt by $US600 million ($859.5 million) as part of a major restructuring, which has also raised questions about the future of its major rival, Billabong International.\nBillabong's largest shareholder, US investment company Oaktree Capital, is set to emerge with control of Quiksilver as part of a $US175 million refinancing of the beleaguered retailer's US business.\nFormer Melbourne AFL player Greg Healy, Quiksilver's newly appointed president, confirmed on Wednesday that the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ahead of the restructuring, which mirrors a $350 million refinancing at Billabong almost two years ago.\n\"We have been through an extensive process over past three months, we talked to many suitors and this is where we end up,\" Mr Healy told Fairfax Media .\n\"Unfortunately, due to the missteps over past few years … this is the best option to secure the future of the company. This is not a step we took lightly. We have looked at all the options available.\"\nQuiksilver's European and Asia-Pacific operations, which include Australia, will not be part of the bankruptcy filing.\nMerger not out of the question Oaktree will provide funding for the Chapter 11 process and will convert its debt holdings into a majority equity stake when Quiksilver emerges from bankruptcy in three or four months. Quiksilver's net debt will fall from almost $US900 million to just under $US300 million.\n Oaktree's sizeable investment in Quiksilver has raised questions about the investment company's 18.7 per cent stake in Billabong and its longer-term plans for the two companies, which are leading players in the $19 billion global action sports market.\nAnalysts said a merger of the two retailers was not out of the question, as there would be significant synergy benefits and cost savings.\nHowever, Mr Healy quashed speculation about a possible future merger, saying: \"No, that is not the case.\"\nOaktree's role in the Quiksilver refinancing has also raised corporate governance issues.\nOaktree director Matthew Wilson was a non-executive director of Billabong until this week. He stepped down abruptly on Tuesday, citing an unexplained \"conflict of interest\" relating to Oaktree's investment portfolio.\nWilson's departure applauded Former Billabong shareholders applauded Mr Wilson's departure, but questioned whether Oaktree should have excluded itself from Billabong board meetings when it started speaking to Quiksilver several months ago.\nOaktree acquired an 18.7 per cent stake in Billabong in 2013 as part of a $350 million debt and equity refinancing deal with fellow US investment company Centerbridge Partners. Billabong also owes about $US200 million debt held by Oaktree and Centerbridge but is looking to refinance.\nAbout 330 million Billabong shares held by Oaktree and Centerbridge are set to come out of escrow on September 18, but sources close to the investors have played down speculation they may sell shares.\n\"They're very much committed to turn around this business,\" one source told Fairfax Media last week.\n\"I can't see them looking to do anything until they generate further value.\"\nOaktree and Centerbridge were issued shares at 41¢ as part of the refinancing. Billabong shares, which reached 71.5¢ in May, are now trading around 59¢.\nTurnaround gains traction A Billabong spokesman said the retailer, which came close to collapse two years ago, would not be distracted by the Quiksilver restructuring, and a turnaround put in place by chief executive Neil Fiske was gaining traction.\nBillabong founder and major shareholder Gordon Merchant said: \"I'm definitely happy with the direction the company is taking.\"\nHe declined to comment on Mr Wilson's departure.\nLast month Billabong reported its first profit in four years and the first growth in underlying earnings in seven years.\nQuiksilver was founded in the Victorian town of Torquay in 1969 by two surfers, Alan Green and John Law, who started making boardshorts​ in their garage. It is now based in southern California and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nSeries of failed acquisitions At its peak, Quiksilver was worth more than $US2.3 billion, but it has struggled in recent years after taking on too much debt and making a series of failed acquisitions, including ski brand Rossignol in 2005.\nThe company, which also owns women's surf brand Roxy and DC Shoes, reported a $US309 million loss last year after sales tumbled 13 per cent.\nIn a recent management reshuffle, Pierre Agnes replaced former chairman and chief executive, Andy Mooney.\nMr Healy said the biggest challenge facing the company was turning around the North American business.\n\"Pierre and I, we need to get back to our core accounts in the US. Our focus will be around rebuilding that business, focusing on the qualitative nature of sales rather than just growing top line sales for top line's sake,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:06:42.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
