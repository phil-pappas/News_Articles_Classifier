He discussed the possibility of Arkansas exporting rice and chicken to Cuba, as well as cooperation in biotechnology. \nThe Arkansans will stay until Wednesday, and their visit will include a stop at the tax-free zone at the new Mariel \"megaport,\" which the government hopes will become a magnet for foreign investment. \nThe Cuban government claims that the US embargo the main obstacle to the country's economic development. However, only the US Congress can lift the embargo, and the opposition Republican legislators that control the body have no interest in doing so. \nIn August, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Havana to preside over the flag-raising at the reopened US embassy after diplomatic relations were formally restored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:50:12.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
