Pollseye is a 30 seconds video review app that was launched almost five weeks ago by Abhinav Sree, Ashwin Nath and Vijith KK. Abhinav’s shopping experience provoked the team to come up with something authentic enough to help people make better decisions while they shop online. “We wanted to come up with something which is user friendly and at the same time is easier for the users to review and inform the customers out there,” says Abhinav Sree.\nThey did extensive research to figure out a unique and innovative business model to help people make better and informed decisions while shopping online and found out that 80% of the people have an attention span of only 30 seconds while watching a video and that’s how they decided on the time limit which also differentiates them from their immediate competitors like Instagram, YouTube and Vine. “While Instagram and Vine have a very short time limit to review a product, YouTube can be really overwhelming at times but Pollseye is a platform dedicated exclusively for reviewing products and has inbuilt features that makes the whole experience seamless and hassle free.\nAs of now they have four categories-gadgets, beauty and wellness, home accessories and fashion. “Gadget is the hottest category in our app and we are trying to expand to other categories as well. Hotels for instance can be an interesting category and people would really like a video review about the rooms before they book one,” adds Abhinav. Within 5-6 weeks of their launch they have managed to get around 4,000 downloads and Abhinav claims that their unique business model is responsible for this overwhelming response as there are hardly any platforms dedicated towards reviewing products.\nSoon after the company was launched the team members contacted few reviewers and YouTube reviewers, according to Abhinav they loved the idea and the app as a tool for the inbuilt features that it has. The app enables the user to review the the product seamlessly for 30 seconds and one can also insert background music and text to it to make it more appealing to the customers. “If Instagram has made everyone a photographer and if Vine is trying to make everyone a video maker then we are trying to make everyone a reviewer to help people make people more aware about various products,” says Abhinav.\nThe company also plans to tie up with brands and marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and OYO to sell their content on their platform. Currently every like that a reviewer gets on their videos get a credit added to their wallet. “We convert these credits to real currency and give it through Amazon and Paytm vouchers. After we tie up with them they will be able to redeem it directly from these marketplaces,” says Abhinav.\n 28, 2015 12:16 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:39:09.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
