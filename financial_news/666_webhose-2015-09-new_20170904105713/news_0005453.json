Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Well, well, well. Aside from the blood stains on the blue ministerial carpet and former PMO staffer Richard Dowdy 's c-bomb and Peta Credlin at the top of The Australian Women's Weekly 's \"most influential women\" list and sort-of influential right faction powerbroker Kevin Andrews ' bruised ego and Ray Hadley 's tiff with our new Treasurer, Scott Morrison – hasn't everything worked out well?\nTake Washington. Little more than four months after Joe Hockey approved a bit over $230 million to upgrade the Australian embassy in Barack Obama 's United States of America, the former treasurer is a security check away from taking over from Kim Beazley .\nIt looks like that part of the Abbott fallout is going to work out OK.\nNow, before the Fun Police involve themselves, let us make the situation clear: Beazley's offices on Massachusetts Avenue are, quite seriously, falling apart. It has been encased in permanent scaffolding to catch falling embassy debris.\nAustralia is a strong Atlantic gust away from taking out a visiting dignitary and then dealing with the nightmarish diplomatic consequences.\nFunds lobby When Hockey visited Washington last year, Beazley lobbied our then Treasurer personally for the funding .\nBack then, Tony Abbott 's PMO was scheming about sending Malcolm Turnbull to 1601 Massachusetts Avenue. Now Hockey is on the cusp of benefiting from Beazley's powers of persuasion. A funny old world.\n However, it is going to take several years for the place to be demolished and rebuilt. Here's hoping Hockey gets a five-year posting to enjoy the benefits – not just the construction headaches.\nIt could be worse. Pity Abbott's national security adviser, Andrew Shearer . He was the expected next in line.\nBut that, of course, was before shit happened.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-09-21T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:06:54.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
