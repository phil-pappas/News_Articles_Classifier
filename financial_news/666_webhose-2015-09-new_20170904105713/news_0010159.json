We're going to get a clear understanding of the extent to which we can move the business forward on the strategy and then to see if we want to supplement that,\" he said. \nThe Swiss agrichemicals group earlier unveiled plans on Thursday to sell its vegetable seeds business and buy back more than $2 billion (1.31 billion pounds) worth of stock in a campaign to boost shareholder returns after it rejected a takeover approach from Monsanto Co (MON.N). \nRamsay said the business could fetch of 3-6 times annual sales, which were $650 million, and that Syngenta was confident that net proceeds from the divestment would exceed the $2 billion in expenditure from the share buyback. \n(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Georgina Prodhan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:06:20.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
