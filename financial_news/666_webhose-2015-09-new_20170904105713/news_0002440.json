PUBLISHED: 12:30, Wed, Sep 9, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:47, Wed, Sep 9, 2015 GETTY HMRC phoine waiting times average 47 minutes, according to research \nHMRC took a huge 47 minutes on average to pick up calls, despite its website saying calls are answered within 10 minutes.And thanks to the taxman's 0300 contact numbers a caller could be charged up to £4.66 for the typical wait. If people aren't able to get through to the taxman to update information relating to tax credits, they could be left short or overpaid which could cause debt problems, said Citizens Advice. \nThe charity discovered the failings by analysing the numbers of users complaining about waiting times on social media site Twitter.Workers who can't fill in their self assessment return on time and can't get through on the phone could also be landed with a fine for missing the deadline.Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: “People are paying the price for not getting through to HMRC. \"From fines for not completing a tax return in time to under or overpayments for tax credits, people can be left out of pocket because they cannot speak to HMRC on the phone.“Work and caring responsibilities means not everyone will be able to wait for three quarters of an hour to ask HMRC a question.”More than 11,500 callers tweeted the agency to complain about excessive waiting times, found the charity. The figures raise stark questions over HMRC's official figures that state an average wait of ten minutes. The Government agency promised to deliver better customer service after figures earlier this year revealed that it had failed to pick-up around 18million customer phone calls over the 2014-15 tax year . Citizens Advice said it had been prompted to look into HMRC call times after people seeking help from the charity reported not being able to get through to resolve matters with HMRC. The charity said it had 295,000 queries in the last 12 months that could mean people needed to contact HMRC and warned that the roll-out of Universal Credit could mean waiting times will soar even higher. \nMs Guy added: “We have consistently raised this issue with the Government. But evidence from across the Citizens Advice service, and our new research, shows HMRC is still failing to provide a timely service. “HMRC needs to urgently address the problems many people are experiencing with phone lines.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:19:06.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
