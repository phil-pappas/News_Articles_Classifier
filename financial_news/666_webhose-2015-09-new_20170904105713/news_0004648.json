Photo: Natalie Roberts\nNegative gearing has been at the centre of considerable discussion as a result of the federal government's inquiry into housing affordability.\nMany of the submissions have called for an overhaul of the system and the finger of blame is pointed at tax offset rules.\nDepreciation in today's climate is effectively what creates the negative gearing position. Rental returns against interest are almost neutral. The deprecation claim is the non-cash expense offset against the investor's personal salary. This creates the negative position and, in many cases, creates a cash-flow positive position for the investor.\nThis is noteworthy when you benchmark the Australian depreciation regime against our closest partner, New Zealand. The top tax bracket in New Zealand is 33 per cent; significantly more favourable than the 49 per cent rate in Australia.\nAdvertisement The ability to depreciate residential investment properties in New Zealand is also significantly less, in some cases by 80 per cent.\nAnother point to consider is that the top-end tax bracket in New Zealand is not far above our capital gains rate, without a 50 per cent discount. Taking all that into consideration, it's clear that tax incentives for residential investment are significantly less in New Zealand.\nYet, property prices have been surging in Auckland, just as they have in Sydney and Melbourne. Admittedly, New Zealand has similar issues with foreign investment pushing up prices, but it's clear from the above that this is not because of negative gearing.\nThe impact of foreign investment is another consideration. In Victoria, a recently introduced stamp duty for offshore purchasers (a 3 per cent surcharge on the purchase price) has led to a significant fall in inquiries and transactions from foreign clients.\nTraditionally, stamp duty savings for off-the-plan transactions in Victoria have been more favourable than the other states. However, this additional surcharge has put Victoria behind other states as an investment option because of the high entry costs for foreign investors.\nSo, I would argue that it's not negative gearing that is changing the market; it's more likely to be foreign investment.\nHowever, we need to wait and see how the Victorian stamp duty laws play out as a test case. And if changes need to be made to tax offsets, let's look at it holistically, taking into account yesterday and tomorrow and not just today.\nSeven years ago, we were pushing investors into property with the introduction of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Today, we're looking to push them out. Where will we be in another seven years?\n Neale Scott is the Pacific director, building, depreciation and cost consultancy, at CBRE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:02:53.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
