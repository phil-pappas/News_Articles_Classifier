Futures on the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX , France's CAC and Britain's FTSE 100 all fell by between 0.3-0.5 percent. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday in a bow to worries about the global economy, financial market volatility and sluggish inflation at home, but left open the possibility of modest rate rises later this year. \"Yes, we've got a reprieve on an immediate interest rate hike, but the reason for the stay of execution is rather bearish itself,\" said London Capital Group dealer Jonathan Sudaria. Asian shares rose modestly on Friday on relief that the Fed had held off on raising interest rates but gains were capped by renewed concerns about the health of the global economy, in particular China. The Fed's decision also pushed up the euro against the dollar, and gains in the euro can often weigh on European carmakers and luxury good stocks as their exports typically benefit when the euro is weaker on currency markets. Greek shares could also be in focus in the run-up to another election in the country on Sunday. The country's stock market has fallen sharply this year, due to persistent worries over Greece's debt and economic problems. The Greek election campaign ends on Friday, with opinion polls giving no clear winner, setting the stage for a cliffhanger vote on Sunday between the political left and right, and the near-certainty the next government will be a coalition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:21:36.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
