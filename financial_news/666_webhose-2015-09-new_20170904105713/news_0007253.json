RBA governor Glenn Stevens (right) has a few things to ponder. Aykut Unlupinar by Alan Mitchell The Reserve Bank and the Treasurer are off the hook.\nThe gain of 17,400 new jobs in August, as revealed on Thursday , was three times stronger than expected, and the unemployment rate fell when the smarties were bracing for a hefty rise.\nIn fact, there are signs that the impressive monthly growth in employment has passed its peak, and the anticipated surge of people back into the labour market still might occur.\nBut these are issues for the future. Instead of spending a beautiful spring day battling with crisis headlines, Joe Hockey, freshly returned from last weekend's G20 meeting in Turkey, could bask in the unexpected glow of economic strength.\nThe index incorporates the real 90-day bill rate, real exchange rate and the terms of trade. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens, too, could get on with his day without feeling the Prime Minister's eyes burning into the back of his neck - and not just because of the stronger-than-expected official labour force survey.\nThe depreciation of the Australian dollar is a tonic for the economy. Over the plast 12 months, the dollar has fallen a good 17 per cent against the currencies of our major trading partners.\nThe result has been a substantial easing in monetary conditions (see the accompanying graphic) without the need for a further cut in interest rates.\nThis is the kind of economic stimulus that the RBA and the government have long been hoping for, with the exchange rate boosting profits and the outlook for business investment without causing more overheating in the Sydney and Melbourne real estate markets.\n The most obvious beneficiaries of the lower exchange rate are the trade-exposed industries, especially manufacturers whose spending on new investment has been falling at an average annual rate of 12 per cent since the first half of 2012.\nThe revival of non-mining business investment is the key to filling the gap in the economy created by the fall in mining investment.\nHowever, there is more to the depreciation of the dollar than the boost to trade-exposed manufacturers and tourism.\nWhile the weaker dollar allows trade-exposed industries to increase prices and profits, those higher prices also will deflect demand toward so-called non-traded (as in not internationally traded) industries, such as housing construction and personal services. Not all service industries will be in a position to capitalise on this increase in demand, but some undoubtedly will.\nOf course, these happy spring-time musings will be brought to a sudden stop next week if the US Federal Reserve defies market expectations and increases its monetary policy interest rate.\nThis promises to be the acid test of the reforms in the emerging market economies and their capacity to absorb a return to more normal global interest rates.\nPresumably there will be the much-predicted period of market volatility, even though the US monetary tightening has long been expected and a great deal of capital already has fled back to the west.\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have appealed to the Fed to delay the rate rise , and the former US treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, says tightening monetary policy now would be a big mistake . The flow of economic data, he says, shows that the US and global economies are slowing.\nBut the arguments don't all flow in one direction. Despite the World Bank's fears that a US rate rise would destabilise the emerging market economies, several central bankers from those countries say it would be better to get the uncertainty over.\n\"The situation will recover the sooner the Fed makes a decision and then gives expectation to the market that they [will] increase [rates] one or two times and then stop,\" Mirza Adityaswara, senior deputy governor at Indonesia's central bank told the Financial Times .\nAnd a former US central banker, Richard Fisher, thinks a start to the tightening cycle now would actually reinforce confidence in the Federal Reserve's determination not to risk a setback to economic growth.\n\"Every time the Fed has waited for full employment to be achieved before starting to tighten policy, it has ended up having to tighten so much that it has driven the economy into recession,\" he says.\nPerhaps also in the back of Fisher's mind is the possibility of renewed concerns that the US might stage an accidental surge of inflation as a means of reducing its public debt burden. It has done it before, and it is estimated that moderate inflation of 6 per cent could cut the US debt-to-GDP ratio by a fifth within four years. The cost would fall heavily on Chinese taxpayers who are massive holders of US Treasury bonds.\nThe risk of such an event could see a damaging rise in market-set interest rates and complicate already fragile US-Chinese relations.\nWhile Summers sees no prospect of a revival of inflation in the current environment, the Fed's deputy chairman, Stanley Fischer, argues that inflation has been only temporarily suppressed by falling oil and other commodity prices and the appreciation of the US dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:07:14.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
