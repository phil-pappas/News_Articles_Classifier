The Fed’s policymakers said that this could put “downward pressure on inflation in the near term”. \n“We’ve long expected some slowing in Chinese growth over time, as they rebalance their economy,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said. “The question is whether there might be the risk of a more abrupt slowdown than we expect.” \nWeak inflation has so far halted Fed efforts to raise interest rates, as it has appeared to fulfil one side of its dual mandate - its obligation to promote maximum employment. But inflation has lingered below target for more than three years. \nMs Yellen said: “In light of the heightened uncertainties abroad … the committee judged it appropriate to wait for more evidence … to bolster its confidence that inflation would rise to 2pc in the medium term.” \nThirteen of the 17-strong Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets to decide on rates, said they were still looking at a hike before January. But investors did not appear convinced. \nMarket data showed that the odds of a rate rise had shifted further back, making January the most likely candidate for “lift-off”. Ahead of the meeting, December had been the favourite for a rise in rates . \n“Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective,” said Ms Yellen. On the inflation measure by which the Fed assesses its mandate, prices rose by just 0.3pc in the year to July. \n“We are reasonably confident that inflation will return back to its 2pc target over the longer-term,” she said. “As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate … [the Fed projects] that inflation will rise to 1.7pc” by the end of next year, she explained. \nThe Fed’s interest rates have stood static in a 0pc to 0.25pc range since December 2008. Markets had suggested that there was a one-in-three chance that the central bank would put an end to that run of unchanged rates on Thursday. \n“The importance of the initial increase should not be overstated,” Ms Yellen said, stressing that policy would likely remain “accommodative” for some time. The Fed is now looking for further progress in the jobs market, and adjusted its forecasts for how much further unemployment could fall. \nSeptember saw a “hawkish” dissent from one of the FOMC’s 10 voting members, who voted to raise rates this month. Jeffrey Lacker, the hawkish president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (Taiwan OTC: 2743.TWO - news ) , called for a 0.25 percentage point rate increase. \nThe FOMC’s decision came after warnings from both the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that tighter policy at this juncture risked the derailing the global economy. Lawrence Summers, who was a contender for the current Fed chairman job, warned that “this is not the time for a tightening” . \nThe build-up of debts in emerging market economies, particularly those issued in dollars, has left them especially vulnerable to higher US rates. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is feared that if the Fed were to move quickly in tightening policy over a short period of time, these economies would not be able to cope with their debt obligations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:11:22.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
