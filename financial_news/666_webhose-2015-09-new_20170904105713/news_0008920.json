Photo: Erin Jonasson\nSmall business owners across Australia have faced ups and downs this year. Prior to the federal budget announcement in May, consumer confidence was down, and, small business confidence was at its lowest point since the inception of the Index in February 2014.\nThe latest results of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Small Business Index show there's a stronger sense of optimism than there has been for some time. The research shows that since May, small business confidence has reached its highest recorded level to more than 20 per cent on the back of a balanced State Budget, historically low interest rates and improving business and consumer confidence conditions. That's a substantial increase and it's heartening to see.\nThe index measures confidence, current performance and future plans of the small business sector. Small business owners said their customers and staff are key to business performance and their positive outlook. Customers are at the heart of every small business, so seeing small businesses placing an increased importance on customer loyalty and repeat business in response to increased competition in many sectors is encouraging.\nI spend most of my time visiting and advising small business owners across Australia and it's the best part of my job. What really hits me is that for them, it's very personal. It's their business and they've started it with a dream and passion to do something wonderful, not only for themselves but also for the local community.\nAdvertisement Last week I met Westpac customer Pauline Penklis who owns a café in Sydney's Surry Hills. For the last eight years, she's gotten out of bed each day at 4am to open her café and serve customers with her trademark coffee and vibrancy. Pauline said that in addition to customers and staff being positive factors over the last quarter, the tax deductibility for assets announced in the Federal Budget in May, influenced her recent decisions and has lifted her confidence. She recently replaced old furniture in the café and improved the kitchen, something she believes will result in more customers and in turn the ability to employ more staff. Her experience was echoed by other small business owners who were surveyed for the Index with more than a third saying that they too were positively influenced by the tax deductibility for assets below $20,000.\nSmall business is the biggest employer in Australia and implementing more measures that support its prosperity is integral to improving the Australian economy as a whole.\nIt's also great to see the improvements in confidence and expected performance across the major states. In particular, Western Australia recorded a significant increase of 36.2 per cent in the Small Business Index over the last quarter as the economy settles and business owners start to regain confidence. In Queensland the result remained stable (an increase of only 0.3 per cent) with a lower Australian dollar encouraging competitiveness in tourism and export-oriented sectors.\nThe National Index also found a third (33.2 per cent) of small business owners are expecting an increase in business activity over the next quarter – a reflection of their confidence, and an encouraging sign for employment intentions in the near future. Kate Carnell, CEO Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said to the ABC in March that we have 815,000 employing small to medium businesses in Australia. According to the ABS, as at July 2015, total unemployment was at 772,300. If every employing small to medium business employed one person, the unemployment rate would reduce significantly.\nIt's also encouraging to see the recent lift in consumer confidence and in turn, spending, so business owners' thoughts are very much on the right track. This is having a positive impact on the small business sector.\nJulie Rynski is the Westpac general manager, small business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:30:52.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
