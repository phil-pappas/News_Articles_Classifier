What, you thought Anheuser-Busch InBev was going to let the other big brewers have all the fun during their California brewery shopping spree?\nIn the past four months, we’ve seen Paso Robles, Calif.-based Firestone Walker partner with Boulevard and Brewery Ommegang owner Duvel Moortgat , Petaluma, Calif.-based Lagunitas sell a 50% stake to Heineken NV HEINY, -0.23% and San Diego’s Saint Archer sell to MillerCoors LLC.\nAlthough Anheuser-Busch InBev NV BUD, -3.46% hasn’t exactly been silent during that span — buying Michigan’s Virtue Cider earlier this month — it was noticeably absent from a corner of the map where it has a big production brewery in Van Nuys, but no craft beer presence.\nThat changed in a big way last week when A-B InBev announced the acquisition of Los Angeles-based Golden Road Brewing Co. Though it only came into being in late 2011 — the brainchild of former Yale University swimmer and Oskar Blues salesperson Meg Gill and Los Angeles bar owner Tony Yanow (Mohawk Bend, Tony’s Darts Away) — Golden Road has seen its production spike from 5,000 barrels in its first full year in 2012 to 15,000 in 2013, 29,400 last year and an estimated 45,000 by the end of this year.\nIt’s also helped to blow open a Los Angeles craft beer market that was just finding its feet before Golden Road arrived. The other large craft brewer in the Los Angeles metro area, Angel City, had just moved from Alpine Village to downtown L.A. the year Golden Road arrived. It was purchased by Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer Co.’s Alchemy & Science branch in 2012 and absconded with original Golden Road brewmaster Jon Carpenter in 2013.\nThat prompted Golden Road to switch brewmasters less than two years into its existence and forced new brewmaster John Houck, formerly of San Francisco-area brewers Drake’s and 21st Amendment, to completely revise the recipes for the brewery’s flagship beer, Point the Way IPA. The switch made its beer less of a malty English-style IPA and more of a citrusy, potent hop bomb befitting a West Coast brewery.\nGill, meanwhile, helped make Golden Road an L.A. fixture by opening multiple tasting rooms, connecting it with Santa Monica-based environmental group Heal the Bay through the brewery’s Heal the Bay IPA and steadily increasing its output. All that — and the fact that roughly 90% of Golden Road’s distribution was through Anheuser-Busch InBev — made it a prime target for A-B’s craft division.\nAfter acquiring Chicago’s Goose Island in 2011, Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point, Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel last year and Seattle’s Elysian earlier this year, A-B just made the brewery acquisition that would make the most sense for its regional strategy. Gill, meanwhile, managed to build a thriving brewery and sell it to the world’s largest brewing company before turning 31. We spoke with Gill and Andy Goeler, CEO of A-B InBev’s craft beer division about the sale, the potential impact for Golden Road and what it means for A-B’s craft strategy — and for its naysayers.\nFirst off, congratulations. Building a successful brewery is an accomplishment by just about any measure, but getting the biggest brewer in the world to take notice puts you in some rare company.\nGill: Thank you. I will tell you that all the anxiety I thought I might have, I don’t and it’s just pure happiness.\nLooking at the growth of your brewery since 2011, it all occurred even with your brewery changing brewmasters in midstream and changing the makeup of its flagship beers. Going into the deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev, what made you think that this latest change would be the right move for the brewery?\nGolden Road Meg Gill of Golden Road Gill: With the growth that we’ve seen and the opportunity that we saw in the market, we made changes quickly and the reason we made those changes is due to what the consumer tells us and how closely we listen to our retailers and distributors. It has been a bit of a crazy ride and I can’t believe that we’ve done what we’ve done, but it’s amazing.\nThe team here and the energy in the building is just through the roof. The positivity from everybody who works here is fantastic.\nAs for the question at the top about how we started, back in May I took a flight from Chicago to L.A. and I was bitching to the stewardess that “I only drink IPAs. I’m a millennial, goddamn it, and you never have any.” She was like “Oh, no, we do have Goose Island IPA,” and I was like “Wow, awesome; I’ll take all that you’ve got.” It was a long flight.\nI did a lot of thinking on that flight and my thoughts immediately went to “A-B’s vision for craft is coming together for me.” And while Andy’s sitting here going “What the hell are you talking about? I had this vision for craft five years ago?,” that was the moment that it hit me that they were doing big things locally with their craft brewers and we could explore that opportunity and see what’s going on. We could have a great strategic partnership.\nWe never talked to bankers. We weren’t for sale, but we saw that the vision of A-B was something unique and we went for it.\nAnd it isn’t as if you had nothing going on at the time. You have a new tasting room opening, you have a new brewery planned for 2016 to supplement your existing facilities. What did you see coming down the road and what potential do you see in partnering with A-B?\nGill: For the short term, it’s about leveraging their resources. Starting on the supply side, it’s accessing their amazing raw materials and customer service and vendors — being as big as they are with packaging and raw materials. That’s pretty straightforward, right?\nOn the marketing side, I’m really looking forward to working with Andy. We don’t have much of a marketing department. We don’t even have a marketing director. Our graphic designer reports directly to me, so we’re going to use their resources, hire and continue to build that department. On the distribution side, it’s getting the beer to more people and becoming a brand priority within their Region 7 portfolio — which includes California, Arizona and Nevada — focusing the market for the beer we have and the plan we’ve already made for 2016. Beyond that, we’ll see. If there’s demand out there, certainly now we’ll have the resources to get the beer wherever that may lead us.\nDoes this leave anything up in the air for Golden Road? I know it had a brewing partnership with some retailers that involved creating house brands for them and I know you are a big supporter of the Heal the Bay environmental group in Santa Monica through your Heal the Bay IPA and other initiatives.\nGolden Road Meg Gill Prev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:03:40.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
