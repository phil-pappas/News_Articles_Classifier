If you bitch loud enough (i.e., tell them you’re taking all your toys and going home) they will give you an unquestioned “God account” where you can do as you wish. My statement in a phone call (once I got a manager on the line) went something like, “Well, I don’t care if it’s policy or not, next time you block a buy or transfer I will be closing all my accounts and going elsewhere.”…That seemed to have fixed things. 😀 Reply bigcajunman September 22, 2015, 2:08 PM \nGood on you! 👍👍👍 Yes it has E-series funds, but still seems to be under their “laws of trading”. 😐😐😐 My Own Advisor September 14, 2015, 6:34 PM \nNext step = move all assets to a TDDI (formerly Waterhouse) account. Problems solved, all DIY going-forward! bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 7:52 PM \nAgreed. 👍 kathy waite September 14, 2015, 12:44 PM \nI always feel its to make you talk to them so they can try sell you something! bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 12:46 PM \nI think you are on the mark, even if it is another savings account! Reply Eric September 14, 2015, 1:10 PM \nI’m pretty sure those investor profiles are required by law, as are the updates. Of course the banking lobby helped write the law so the government claims to be protecting Canadians and the banks get another shot at selling you stuff. Some institutions though will let you do those profiles on-line (I believe RBC does) so not everyone is evil! \nAfter a while though you know that answers to give to get the profile you want, and you just start answering before they’ve finished asking the question. At that point a good salesperson will clue-in, get it done, and get you out – so they can move on to the next client. bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 1:39 PM \nOr better still, just don’t use a “Mutual Fund” account? Just sayin… 🌵 Michael James September 14, 2015, 12:23 PM \nDo you think they reset your profile deliberately as a way to try to sell you more expensive funds every year? Reply bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 12:46 PM \nThat would be a solid assumption, I think. The longer you are there, the more likely you are to make a rash decision. Reply Bernie September 14, 2015, 10:48 AM \nSorry to hear of your frustrations. I’ve been going it alone with a discount broker, BMO InvestorLine, since 2008…couldn’t be happier! DIY isn’t for everyone but it isn’t rocket science and most of the “work” is upfront in the selection process. I know Questrade offers commission free ETF trading but I believe they charge $9.95 commissions on mutual funds. I don’t think any of the major brokerages charge commissions on mutuals. I hope your journey into DIY goes well for you! Reply bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 10:55 AM \nI am already most of the way there with my RRSPs, and RDSP with TD Waterhouse, just had a couple of older accounts hanging around, but I think it is time to go. Reply Eric Schultz September 14, 2015, 9:55 AM \nAs much as I am guilty of it myself it astounds me how much we put up with when it comes to our banks. \nI think I pestered RBC about the excessive fees Action Direct (or Direct Investing or whatever it was called) for two years before I made the swtich to E*Trade. Though I’m happy once E*Trade became questionable (albeit in the US) I didn’t hesitate to jump ship to Qtrade – and I’ve never looked back! \nIf anyone asks me, my advice is Qtrade. \nNow I’ve got to stop talking about doing something about my chequeing account fees and actually do something!!! bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 10:44 AM \nYeh, we do seem a bit masochistic when it comes to banks (and many service industries). Reply Paul T September 14, 2015, 7:55 AM \nWhy not just open a TD Waterhouse account? Same funds, less hassle. (Hey, maybe they should use that as their new marketing line) Reply bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 7:58 AM \nThat is pretty much where I am headed, for now. Might check out Questrade too, just for comparison sake. Reply Paul T September 14, 2015, 8:31 AM \nYou probably know this, but if you want the e-series funds, TD bank MF account or TDWH are the only two places you can get them. Reply bigcajunman September 14, 2015, 8:49 AM \nYeh, but I am confident there are ETFs I can use in their stead if I do change to other places.
