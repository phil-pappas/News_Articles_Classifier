The levy is to be scaled back and paid only on UK balance sheets, reducing the bill for HSBC which as an international bank had been paying a charge based on its global balance sheet.\nOsborne is meeting representatives of challenger banks this week, including the boss of Metro Bank. When Metro launched in 2010 it was the first bank to open a new branch network on high streets for 100 years, and it is now reported to be pressing ahead with plans for a stock market flotation next year.\nStandard & Poor’s says it expects the new 8% surcharge to “dampen the challenger banks’ profit ambitions in the near term”. It also pointed to the potential for a wave of mergers and acquisitions among the challengers. “We don’t expect all challenger banks to succeed in their aims, therefore consolidation appears inevitable to us,” the ratings agency said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:22:02.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
