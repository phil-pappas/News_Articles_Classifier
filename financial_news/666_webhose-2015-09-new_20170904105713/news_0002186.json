Ever since the Reserve Bank’s Guy Debelle complained about unusually benign financial market volatility in September 2014, we’ve had rolling ructions with only brief windows of respite.\nAfter the eurozone was going to be torn asunder in June by the 11 million “irrationalistas” in Greece, investors were head-faked by stability through July. Turmoil quickly returned in August with Australian and global equities plunging as much as 13.3 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively. Horrific stuff for those long the asset class.\nThe culprit was the great Chinese sharemarket crash of 2015 which, after being staunched by “strongman” President Xi Jinping’s unprecedented interventions in June, shockingly reasserted itself two months later. This is significant for many reasons.\nFirst, an economy smaller than Queensland’s (Greece) is no longer the tail wagging the dog. China is the second-largest economy in the world and the single most important contributor to global growth.\nSecond, China’s dramas represent a stealthy battle between free markets and non-democratic central planning, with geopolitical and security consequences. In recent decades the Chinese Communist Party reluctantly embraced Western reforms and open markets to create a sustainable growth platform and establish itself as a respected international-actor-cum-superpower.\nBut when markets decided the extraordinary “stir-fried” 154 per cent run-up in Chinese equities between August 2014 and August 2015 was hugely overdone, and prices fell 43 per cent, the CCP was not receptive to the gratis advice. (Stir-frying is Chinese shorthand for flipping.) The crash was especially embarrassing for President Xi, who in June told a journalist “it’s good to trade shares” and predicted the Shanghai Composite Index would “soon hit 10,000 points”.\nInvestors prevailed In its own version of quantitative easing – a euphemism for governments buying assets when they don’t agree with market prices – the CCP has burnt more than $200 billion trying to defend equity values. It also announced draconian restrictions on trading, including banning short sales (punting on price declines), declaring stocks cannot fall more than 10 per cent in a day, and prohibiting sales by individuals who own more than 5 per cent of a company for the following six months.\n While these measures initially worked, and stimulated a 10 per cent rally in the Shanghai market in July, investors would prevail in their arm wrestle with the state. The catalyst for the devastating slump in mid-August, which at its peak saw intra-month losses total more than 25 per cent, was the “surprising” decision of China’s central bank to modestly devalue its currency by 3 per cent.\nThe issue was that China’s exchange rate peg with an appreciating US dollar had led the yuan to become overpriced. Yet investors worried the depreciation was motivated to mitigate deeper, obscured, vulnerabilities across China’s real economy after years of state-directed investments into dodgy infrastructure and housing projects.\nSuspicions about the reliability of state-published economic data – many believe the CCP massages it to maintain the illusion of stability – were not helped by HSBC dumping its independent industrial production index, which often conflicted with official numbers.\nHumiliatingly for the CCP, the same problems that caused the GFC – excessive leverage and speculative investment in overvalued assets – have been the source of its megabubble. One key difference is that state-owned enterprises dominate the Shanghai market, which may explain why politicians were so keen to blow the bubble.\nAlthough market forces have raised questions about the CCP’s once-unassailable control of the economy, Xi Jinping has not given up, instructing his $313 billion pension funds to buy equities while authorities warn of prosecutions for locals collaborating with “foreign forces to attack the soft underbelly of the market and bet against the government’s stabilisation measures”. One trader’s take on the message was “sell Chinese equities = jail”.\nIn a world characterised by record leverage, volatility will remain the constant. That’s why I believe in hedging equities exposures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:56:30.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
