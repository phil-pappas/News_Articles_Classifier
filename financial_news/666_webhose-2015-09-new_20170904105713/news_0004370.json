Teck's ratings outlook remains negative, it added.\nCredit downgrades typically drive up the cost of borrowing for companies, as some big investors will only buy investment grade bonds.\n\"We expect prolonged commodity price weakness and sizable investment spending will cause Teck's financial leverage to remain well in excess of typical investment grade thresholds through at least 2017,\" Moody's said in a statement.\nPrices for Teck's main commodities, coal and copper, have fallen sharply in recent years and show few signs of a quick turnaround.\nThe agency said it expects Vancouver-based Teck will burn through C$1.5 billion ($1.13 billion) in cash in 2016 and C$1 billion in 2017 as it presses ahead with the Fort Hills oil sands project, where it holds a minority stake.\nTeck's shares were down 2 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$8.50 after the rating cut.\n($1 = 1.3263 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:53:17.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
