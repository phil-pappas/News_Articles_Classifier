The pair found support above the 0.69 figure after recoiling from trend line resistance capping gains since mid-May. Near-term resistance is at 0.7033, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, with a break above that on a daily closing basis opening the door for a challenge of the 38.2% level at 0.7110. Alternatively, a turn back below the 14.6% Fib at 0.6985 clears the way for a test of the September 4 low at 0.6907. We entered short AUDUSD at 0.7214 and have since booked profit on half of the trade . Emerging signs of bottoming and the break of near-term trend resistance warns of a larger upswing ahead. With that in mind, we will exit the remainder of the position and wait for another opportunity to re-enter short.
