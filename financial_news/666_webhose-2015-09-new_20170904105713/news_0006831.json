It's been volume increases, a weak Aussie dollar and cost savings that have really put the results in the not-too-bad bracket.\" \nHe said the impairments and the decline in asset values had been expected, but the continuation of a special dividend was a welcome surprise. \nShares in the company were 9.0 cents, or 5.59 per cent, higher at $1.70 at 1352 AEST. \nNEW HOPE SINKS INTO THE RED \n* Full year loss of $21.8m, from $58.5m profit \n* Revenue down 7.9 per cent to $505.8m, from $548.96m \n* Final dividend of 2.5c, up from 2.0c @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook VW Aust checking cars with head office AAP \nVolkswagen Group Australia is checking with its German head office to see if cars sold locally have the same emissions-cheating …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:05:10.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
