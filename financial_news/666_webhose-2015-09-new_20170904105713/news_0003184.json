Advertising Print This Post \nUllink has partnered with Tradegate Exchange, a German private investing exchange, to help provide all members of Ullink’s global NYFIX community access to Tradegate Exchange’s service suite and liquidity capabilities. \nTradegate Exchange relies on a broad stock offering and is an integral component of Deutsche Börse. Earlier this week, Tradegate Exchange saw a total of $7.5 billion (€6.7 billion) in August 2015 volumes , rising 81.1% MoM from just $4.2 billion (€3.7 billion) in July 2015. \nAlternatively, Ullink supports trading across nearly all asset classes through FIX protocol, advantages that will now be extended toward Tradegate Exchange. Moreover, Tradegate clients will now be granted access to a consolidated FIX connection from Ullink. \nAccording to Thorsten Commichau, Tradegate’s CEO, in a recent statement on the partnership, “We are delighted to partner with Ullink’s market leading trading community, NYFIX. This is an important milestone for the expansion of our business which instantly makes our exchange accessible to a much wider community.” \n“We are excited to be the first vendor that offers access to such a popular and innovative exchange. We are committed to providing our trading community with access to the broadest range of liquidity venues and trading services, and our partnership with Tradegate is a strong illustration of that commitment,” added Richard Bentley, Ullink’s Chief Strategy Officer in an accompanying statement. \nUllink is a provider of electronic trading and connectivity solutions to the global financial community. Back in June, Ullink appointed Didier Bouillard to the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) . The resulting appointment allowed for Bertrand Sciard, Ullink’s Interim CEO, to move to the role of Chairman. Got a news tip?
