Did we know defeat devices were being used in the EU? No.\" \nAnother source added the reinforced testing that has been in preparation since then has been developed to thwart such cheat technology. \n\"Future legislation (will be) more efficient to prevent their use,\" the source said. \nThe European Union since the 1990s has progressively adopted tighter auto emission standards for carbon dioxide and the harmful nitrogen oxides vehicles produce but it is up to the 28 member states to enforce them. \nIt banned defeat devices in 2014 under what is known as the Euro 6 regulations which require automakers to meet lower emission targets. \nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said Friday that \"currently emissions are measured on a laboratory test cycle (NED) which does not reflect the emissions of vehicles in normal driving conditions.\" \n\"To address this shortcoming, the Commission has been working to develop Real Driving Emission (RED) test procedures,\" it said. \n\"RED testing will reduce the currently observed differences between emissions measured in the laboratory and those measured on the road under real-world conditions, and to a great extent limit the risk of cheating with a defeat device.\" \nThe new testing procedure will come into force in January, the Commission added. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook EU tightening auto emission tests to prevent cheating: sources AFP \nThe European Union moved to change its diesel car emission tests to prevent the sort of rigging used by German â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T04:21:01.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
