I welcome them because at the end of the day I know there is no view which has not been put on the table and taken into account in arriving at the final path that we have to travel.\" \nChinamasa said there was need for the country's leaders to fully focus on the country's economic challenges, which he felt had been neglected for some time. \n\"We should always craft strategies that will eventually overcome or minimise negative impact on our economy. Now, the first reality that I defined is the debt overhang,\" he said. \n\"That reality means over the past 15-20 years, we have not been playing our rightful part in the global economy; we are not fully integrated in the global economy, but we have to and time is not on our side. We have already lost time.\" \nChinamasa said he was happy that other than attention in the politburo, government was increasingly engaging business to find solutions to the economic crisis. \nHe said the development was positive given the scale of economic problems Zimbabwe is facing. \n\"We have now built bridges and speak with a collective voice and that is how it should be. We can mess up business big time if we are not correctly advised or made aware of its concerns,\" said Chinamasa. \nIn recent weeks, the politburo has discussed several issues, including retrenchments and amendments to the Labour Act and the need to reduce government expenditure, particularly reducing the wage bill which is gobbling 80% of government revenue. \nThe politburo and the government, however, seem to have no clue on how to rescue the economy despite both of them taking time to discuss economic matters every month and weekly respectively.
