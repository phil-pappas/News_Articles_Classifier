This is how it could serve us all By John Kay | Telegraph – 14 minutes ago 43.89 +1.28 \nThe Money Lab: We do not need an army of the overpaid and overbonused buying and selling from each other, writes John Kay \nThis article is part of our 'Money Lab' series, in which prominent commentators are invited to submit radical ideas for improving the landscape for our personal finances. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will be published in print in Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) 's Your Money with a selection of readers' comments, so please have your say below \nWhat do the people who occupy the skyscrapers of the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) and Canary Wharf actually do? \nTo an extent that defies the imagination, they trade with each other. Lending to businesses outside the financial world which many people might think the principal activity of a bank represents about 3pc of the activity of British banks. \nThe volume of trade in foreign exchange is 100 times the volume of world trade in goods and services. The scale of exposures on financial “derivative” contracts the esoteric bets that financial institutions make between themselves is today around three times the value of all the assets in the world. \nWhat is all this activity for? And is it worth what you and I pay for it? After all, every penny that funds the remuneration packages and bonuses of those who work in wholesale financial services comes from the pockets of savers. \nThe financial markets exist to facilitate the allocation of capital gathering savings and directing them to productive investment. But the capital needs of business have changed over the past century. The manufacturing business with its extensive and specialised plant and buildings has given way to the “knowledge economy”. \nApple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) and Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) are now the most valuable companies in the world and they employ very little capital. They do not need to own the shops, offices and computers they use in their business, and mostly they don’t. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) capital-intensive large businesses, such as Exxon and Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , are self-financing. The stock market is no longer a means of putting money into companies but a means of getting it out. \nThe total value of Britain’s national assets is about £7 trillion (about £120,000 per head), and 60pc of that is the value of our houses. The balance is made up, in roughly equal shares, by commercial property (offices, shops, warehouses), infrastructure assets (roads, railways, sewers) and business investment. Residential mortgages represent about two thirds of bank lending outside the financial sector. The balance is spread across lending on commercial property, business and consumer credit (car loans and credit card debt, for example). \nEfficient capital allocation requires an effective search process looking for new investment opportunities and effective stewardship, which means ensuring that established assets are sustained and enhanced. \nWe need to maintain our physical assets and enhance the capabilities of our companies. These jobs are not now done well, and they are not what most people engaged in financial markets are even attempting to do. Their focus is on rearranging claims to existing assets between themselves. \nWe are neglecting new investment. At current rates it would take more than 200 years to replace the existing housing stock, far less cope with the needs of a growing population and smaller households. We are not building enough houses, but we are enthusiastically bidding up the price of old ones. \nThe Government could borrow for 50 years to renew our crumbling infrastructure at lower interest rates than at any time in history; instead it is attempting to keep bond and share prices high through buying existing debt back via “quantitative easing”. \nThe changes in the nature of business I have described mean that business’s need for external capital is mostly to fund the operating losses of start-ups an activity from which banks have retreated (and were never well placed for). “Venture capital”, devised for this purpose, has morphed into private equity and became preoccupied with financial engineering for established businesses. \nWith large companies no longer needing external finance, the primary role of the stock market investor is stewardship ensuring that Britain’s businesses have effective management, well thought-out strategy and a perspective that matches the time horizons of the savers whose life cycle and retirement plans depend on them. \nInstead, following a mantra of “shareholder value”, we have locked ourselves into a dysfunctional cycle of quarterly earnings reports, while too many executives enrich themselves at their investors’ expense. Fund managers compete to second-guess each other in a pursuit of market outperformance that is necessarily futile in aggregate and unsuccessful in most individual cases. \nWe need a simpler world in which unwieldy financial conglomerates are broken up into focused institutions, and in which short chains of intermediaries provide more direct links between savers and the assets in which their funds are deployed. We need to restore “boring” banks that take our deposits and short-term savings and lend them on to government and home buyers. \nAnd we need asset managers whom we can trust to hold our savings for the long term and build knowledgeable, enduring relationships with the companies in which they invest. \nToday’s hyperactive secondary markets meet the demands of financial market professionals, not the needs of savers. We need intermediaries who are familiar with business, who understand the housing market and other forms of property investment, and who, like good retailers, are driven by the needs of their customers. \nWe do not need an army of the overpaid and overbonused buying and selling from each other. \nJohn Kay is visiting professor of economics at the London School of Economics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T09:57:08.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
