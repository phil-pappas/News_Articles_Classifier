The seven major rules that comprise the law—all due to be finalized next year—are aimed at modernizing food-manufacturing processes after a wave of deadly outbreaks in the past decade stemming from contaminated fruit, spinach, peanut butter and other products.\nThe rules finalized Thursday, which apply to foods for humans, pets and livestock, require companies to draw up and implement written plans for keeping food safe. Companies must identify hazards in manufacturing, measures to reduce the risk of contamination and methods to verify that the controls are working. The FDA is empowered to access a company’s food-safety plans and take action if it fails to comply with the rules.\nAbout 48 million people, or one in six Americans, get sick each year from foodborne diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 128,000 people are hospitalized, and 3,000 die annually.\nCongress in 2010 passed the biggest overhaul of federal food-safety regulations in 70 years, seeking to imbue the FDA with new authority to hold food companies responsible for keeping plants clean and reducing the risk of foodborne pathogens including salmonella, listeria and E. coli.\nOne common theme of food-safety breaches is that “they are largely preventable,” said Michael Taylor, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for food and veterinary medicine. Thursday’s rules provide “new enforcement tools that will create more accountability.”\nRelated\nGeneral Mills Recalls Some of Its Green Beans Due to Listeria Blue Bell Ice Cream Returns to Store Shelves in Select Cities Peanut Executive Faces Possible Life Sentence in Salmonella Case Food-safety advocates applauded the finalized rules, in part because the regulations attempt to transform a regulatory system that traditionally has been reactive into one that acts to prevent food contamination.\nUntil now, “the FDA would investigate after the fact, after people got sick and products were recalled,” said Sandra Eskin, director of food safety for Pew Charitable Trusts. Now, federal officials can take action before contaminated food products land on grocery-store shelves. “That’s huge,” she said.\nThe rules come just over a week after Texas-based Blue Bell Creameries LP, one of the largest U.S. ice-cream makers, resumed sales after recalling all its products in April following a listeria outbreak that led to three deaths. Records released by the FDA after the outbreak showed that Blue Bell neglected practices that might have prevented listeria contamination, including enacting comprehensive food-safety programs like the kind food manufacturers now will be required to detail in writing.\nOther recent episodes have added to concerns about food-safety practices. Last week, California-based Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce began voluntarily recalling cucumbers imported from Mexico after they were tied to a salmonella outbreak that so far has sickened 341 people across 30 states and been linked to two deaths, according to the CDC.\nThe finalized rules go into effect for large food companies next year, though smaller companies have longer to comply. All food companies will have to abide by the new rules by 2018.\nEven after the rules have taken effect, the FDA faces significant challenges, including securing adequate funding from Congress. Mr. Taylor said the FDA will need $260 million to fully implement and enforce the seven major food safety rules, including $109.5 million for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. President Barack Obama has requested that amount, but appropriations bills in both the House and Senate allocate just $41.5 million and $45 million, respectively, for fiscal 2016.\n“We’ve waited a long time for the rules and the longer it takes [for the food-safety law] to be fully implemented, more people are going to get sick from preventable illnesses,” said Ms. Eskin of Pew Charitable Trusts.\nWrite to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:03:28.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
