Photo: Supplied\nWould you employ someone who arrives late for a job interview? Or someone who shows up ungroomed?\nThese are just a couple of tell-tale signs that the person who has applied for the job may not be the right fit for your organisation.\nSo how do you spot a dud candidate at a job interview?\n\"Personal appearance is a big giveaway,\" says small business owner Paul Ames. \"If someone is dressed poorly, ungroomed, smelly, this indicates they have very little pride in themselves or have issues of self worth.\" That would make him question how much pride they would take in their position, he says.\nAdvertisement Ames, who is the managing director of Skye's The Limit Career Counselling, says knowledge of the organisation is also key.\n\"Interviewees should have a good understanding of the organisation they are applying for a position with. If I was interviewing someone for a position with my business, I would be looking to ensure that they have passion and drive for the industry and that their personal values are aligned with the organisational values.\"\nRecruitment manager Johnny Wood says first impressions count and how you present yourself is important. \"That will differ from company to company depending on the culture. For instance, a technology start-up may want to see people who aren't too dressy, maybe not wearing a tie or a suit, maybe they are wearing jeans and an open-collared shirt.\n\"The fundamental thing is when you see them, do they stand up, do they smile at you, do they look you in the eye, do they shake your hand well, it can be too firm, it can be too soft? I think that's quite important to me.\"\nWood works with Employment Innovations, which provides businesses with employment law and migration services. He says he does not like it when a candidate arrives late for an interview and does not offer any explanation or apologise. \"If someone can't get to an interview on time, there's something seriously wrong. I am happy for them to call up in advance. It means they are aware of the circumstances.\"\nAnd he does not like candidates to stray too far from questions. \"It makes me feel like they're not really sure of what to answer, so they'll wander off and try and speak more to make it seem like they know what they're talking about,\" he says.\n\"If I don't feel they have given a substantial enough answer, then I'll probe more.\"\nWood finds questions such as, 'What are your greatest strengths, what's your biggest weakness' pointless. \"Every candidate knows and they prepare for these questions because they are standard.\"\nInstead he prefers to ask, \"If you could go back and visit yourself as an 18-year-old, what piece of advice would you give yourself?\"\nHe says he asks this question not to catch people out, but give them a question they have probably not thought about before. \"There is very little chance to try and make up an answer at this point.\"\nIt bothers Wood when candidates don't ask questions. \"There is clearly so much you need to know about a company before you join them,\" he says.\n\"The whole point of the interview is that the candidate is interviewing the company as well as the company interviewing the candidate. It's always a two-way street.\" Wood says if they don't have any questions, it's a sign that either they are not engaged enough in the interview or have not done their research.\nAmes highlights another key point that indicates that a person is not the perfect fit for the position: if they don't know what their key strengths and skills are that will add value to the organisation.\n\"In reality any small/medium business owner wants to know how this candidate can provide them a return on their investment in hiring them,\" he says.\n\"This is where candidates should state what achievements or cost savings or earnings they have previously achieved in similar positions so the employer can see the value in hiring you.\"\nAnne-Marie Orrock, managing director of Corporate Canary HR Consulting, says there are ways to cut an interview short once a dud candidate has been identified, like phone interviewing first.\nIf it is a face-to-face interview with no prior phone screening, and it is clear that some major requirements of the job are not met, Orrock suggests halving the planned interview time.\nOne way is to ask high-level questions without drilling down, and move on to the wrapping up stage by asking the candidate if they have any questions, she says.\n\"Don't leave them hanging with a false premise that they may be contacted again for next interview stage,\" Orrock says.\n\"Try to highlight some of the strong points in their CV and accomplishments, that are commendable in their career but that are not relevant to the role. This helps cushion the let down.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T00:20:12.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
