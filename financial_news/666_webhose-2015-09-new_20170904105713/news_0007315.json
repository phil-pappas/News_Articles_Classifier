Once you get past those two words together in a sentence, the idea starts to seem more and more appealing . Take a nap on the way to work. Sip your latte while your car purrs along safely. Play Scrabble with your kids on the way to the beach. \nAs it turns out, that’s only marginally true. \nJurisdictions like California, D.C., Florida, Michigan, and Nevada that have legalized driverless cars all aim to keep you squarely in the driver’s seat, vigilant as ever. More Headlines Determining the Right Time to Take Out a Student Loan \n“Under D.C. law, there has to be a licensed driver in the car, that driver has to be in the driver’s seat and there has to be a manual override feature,” says John B. Townsend II, manager of government and public affairs at AAA Mid-Atlantic. “When anti-lock breaking was first used, for instance, people had a hard time adapting, because, for a long time, you used to have to pump your breaks. With anti-locking systems, brakes are smarter, even if you’re still in control—and that kind of evolution is a better metaphor for what automated cars will mean.” \nIn other words, the latte scenario is still in play, but you’re still on the hook even if you’re only blithely “driving.” \nThe question of personal safety and driver responsibility is also one that insurance companies are looking it. Even if, as Townsend points out, driverless cars are widely thought to be far safer than conventional cars, putting a number around how that will impact premiums and discounts is another story. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:45:49.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
