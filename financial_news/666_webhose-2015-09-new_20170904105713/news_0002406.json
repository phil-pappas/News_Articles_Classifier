Among the measures are a \"circuit breaker\" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount. \nIn early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat. \nJuichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings (Other OTC: NRSCF - news ) , told Bloomberg News: \"We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.\" \nGlobal investors are nervously waiting for next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil. \nA hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets. \nHopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Street's three main indexes all ending strongly higher. \nA less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275. \nAnd the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents. \nThe ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent. New Zealand's dollar, which tanked Thursday after the central bank cut interest rates, edged up 0.3 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:23:44.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
