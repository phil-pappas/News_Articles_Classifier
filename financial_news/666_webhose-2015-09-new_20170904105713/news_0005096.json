According to papers filed with the Registrar of Companies dated September 8, Falcon Edge is joined by existing investors Tiger Global Management, SoftBank and others. Ola competes with Uber in India. The latest round of funding also comes on the heels of San Francisco based Uber's announcement to invest $1 billion in India as the app-based taxi-hailing market in the country heats up. Ola has said it clocks more than 750,000 trips a day and expects to hit 1 million, while Uber averages about 200,000 trips a day in India.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:04:36.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
