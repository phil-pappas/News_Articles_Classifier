The reasons for the reductions included falling oil prices and efforts by many states to move towards an environmentally and economically more sustainable energy policy. \nThe report said most of the reductions took place in Mexico, where subsidies went from €18.5bn in 2012 to €2.5bn in 2014. \nSource: DPA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T14:27:58.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
