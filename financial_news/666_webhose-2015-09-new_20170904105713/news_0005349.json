Rick Wilking Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Currency traders and economists may need to brace for a potentially outsized jump in the jobless rate on Thursday, amid speculation changes to the federal government's dole program have pushed more people into the official workforce.\nIn an adjustment that could trigger an alarming but essentially overstated surge in the headline unemployment rate, there has been a significant increase since early July in Newstart and youth allowance recipients actively counted as looking for work.\nIf the July surge in the jobless rate to 6.3 per cent from 6 per cent is repeated in the August data – published in Sydney at 11:30am – there is a risk the unemployment rate could come in at more than 6.5 per cent, an indicative analysis of recent data suggests.\nThat would be contrary to almost every other labour force indicator – including job advertisements and the official Australian Bureau of Statistics employment-to-population ratio, which point to an improving underlying jobs story.\nUnderlying volatility While there is considerable underlying volatility in the jobs figures in any given month, government sources believe there may have been a structural shift in the workforce participation rate after the government's shift from the old Job Services Australia scheme to a new \"jobactive system.\"\nEarly evidence suggests the new scheme is forcing more Newstart recipients into actively searching for work, compared to the previous system which allowed a number of exemptions such as learning a language, numeracy and literacy training, as well as taking a short course for 20 or more hours a week.\nThe new system – which was fully implemented by August 17 – requires most dole recipients to undertake up to 20 job searches a month.\n Department of Social Services figures show there was a sharp 38,000-person spike in dole recipients classified as \"jobseekers,\" an increase of around 9 per cent in just one month.\nA further sizeable surge could have occurred in August, government sources said.\nAll else equal, a rise in the participation rate normally pushes up the jobless rate.\nJobseekers surge 9pc While the Coalition will be keen to applaud increases in workforce participation as a result of the changes it will also be politically sensitive to a sudden jump in the jobless rate.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey told parliament on Wednesday there could be short-term volatility in the employment data amid \"early indications\" the new jobs system was helping boost workforce participation.\n\"Our $6.8 billion Jobactive program places an emphasis on ensuring income support recipients who can work are actively seeking employment,\" Mr Hockey said. \"This gives them the best chance of finding a job.\n\"This may create short-term volatility in employment data but it reflects a structural improvement in participation, which is a key driver of growth.\"\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the jobless rate to ease back to 6.2 per cent in August from 6.3 per cent, with employment up by 5000.\nHowever, ANZ Bank senior economist Justin Fabo is urging people to \"handle with care\" Thursday's labour force report, speculating that it was possible the sharp rise in official jobless rate in July was partly due to new and stricter government rules for some jobseekers.\n\"We cannot gauge the potential size of this effect,\" he said. \"If it is real and significant in size, however, then there is a risk of permanency to the sharp jump in the jobless rate seen in July, even if the true pool of unemployed or available labour may not have really changed.\"\nGovernment sources said it could take several months of extra labour force data to determine how much the jobactive scheme has impacted the figures.\n﻿", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:49:36.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
