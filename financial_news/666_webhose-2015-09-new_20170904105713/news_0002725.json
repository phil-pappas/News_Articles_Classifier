The milk is then processed and resold to other countries where member countries earn revenue from taxes directly to their respective exchequers,\" he says. \nESADA's chairman Kipkurui Arap Langat said entry of the Ugandan company into the Kenyan market has ensured availability of milk throughout the year, especially during dry season. \n\"ESADA will be pushing for inclusion of milk as among the items to be given priority at the one-stop border customs points. You cannot keep milk trucks waiting for days as that would mean hefty losses for dairy companies,\" he said. \n\"We need to look at ways of encouraging our dairy companies to carry out trade within the region which will take integration to a whole new exciting level where commerce thrives.\" \nThe East African market, said Chaturvedi, is experiencing notable growth in dairy consumption. This, he added is attributable to a growing middle class that live in cities and urban areas where raw milk is hard to find.
