It is expected to end with government securing commitment from the investors to lend out some 1.5 billion Ghana cedis to the country. \nJOYBUSINESS is learning that Standard Chartered Bank, Barclays and Deutshe Bank will act as transaction advisors for the Eurobond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:38:17.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
