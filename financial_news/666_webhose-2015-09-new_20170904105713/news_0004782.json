Milos Bicanski Share on twitter by Karen Maley After spending most of this year engaged in fiery political combat, Alexis Tsipras must now resign himself to years of grinding hard labour as he oversees the implementation of the country's punishing austerity program.\nEven as he hailed the \"victory of the people\" after his leftist Syriza party won Greece's fifth election in six years , the struggles of the past months - first the endless and acrimonious battle with the country's creditors, and then the bitter split within his own party – were evident.\nTsipras appears wearier – he's gained several kilos and his smile has lost some of his radiance - than when his Syriza first swept to power in nine months ago. At the same time, he's been forced jettison many of his treasured political beliefs.\nBack in January, he promised to bring an end to the \"humiliation and suffering\" caused by five years of austerity. Now he can only offer the vague hope that the terms of the Syriza government will somehow be able to soften some of the harshest austerity measures that he agreed to in exchange for the country's latest €86 billion ($135 billion) bailout.\nAnd while he claimed in his speech that the Syriza victory represented \"a crystal clear mandate to escape from the old, corrupt establishment that governed this country for so many years\", Tsipras would have been only too aware that, following the split within his own party, he was forced to rely on the support of his political foes to get the country's latest austerity package through Greek parliament.\nAll the same, Tsipras will be able to console himself with the thought that his gamble to call a snap election had paid off, and that it has at least brought a decisive end to what was undoubtedly the worst period of his political life.\nOn July 5, Tsipras was euphoric after Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected the tough austerity measures and reforms demanded by the country's creditors in exchange for fresh funds.\nA week later, and after a humiliating night of negotiations in Brussels, Tsipras backed down and agreed to sign a punitive bailout deal that condemned the country to a further three years of austerity.\n But even though he is now able to put the memory of that humiliation behind him, Tsipras's challenge is only really beginning. For most of this year, the Syriza government been so dominated by political theatrics that there's been little test of whether it is able to form a competent administration.\nIn addition, although the terms of the austerity program are well advertised, Syriza has yet to feel the political backlash that it is certain to face when the new measures – ranging from higher taxes and pension reforms, opening up the Greek energy market to clamping down on corruption – begin to bite.\nEconomists may be divided on how damaging these new measures will be to the Greek economy, but there is little disagreement as to the devastation caused by country's previous bailouts. These have left Greece's GDP 25 per cent below its level in 2009 and most economists believe it will take year, even decades, for Greece's economy to regain its former size.\nAt the same time, Greece is struggling with an unemployment rate of 25.2 per cent – the highest level in the eurozone - while investment has plunged by close to two-thirds since 2007. Reflecting this collapse in investment, industrial production, excluding the construction sector, has fallen by 20 per cent since 1999.\nThe drop in Greek wages – down 25 per cent since 2008 – should have helped Greek companies boost their export sales. But Greek businesses have been severely hamstrung by the unwillingness of Greek banks to extend credit, and, more recently, by the capital controls that the Tsipras government introduced at the end of June.\nAs a result, the Greek economy, after showing a few tentative green shoots last year, has relapsed into recession. Brussels is now expecting the Greek economy to contract by 2.3 per cent this year and by 1.3 per cent next year.\nWith the economy mired in recession, the Greek banks are facing a surge in problem loans, which will require hefty write-offs. These write-offs, combined the massive deposits they suffered earlier this year, have left the Greek banks in a precarious state. One of the first tasks of the incoming Tsipras government will be to negotiate the terms of the €25 billion injection of fresh capital into the country's banks.\nAnother big item on the Tsipras list will be to start negotiations on the restructuring of Greece's debt that now stands at more than 175 per cent of GDP – a level that is clearly unsustainable.\nBut this won't be easy. Although the International Monetary Fund clearly believes that it will be necessary to lighten Greece's debt burden, other countries – particularly Germany – have shown little enthusiasm for the idea.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-21T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:10:06.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
