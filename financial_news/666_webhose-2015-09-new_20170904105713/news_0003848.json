But for one reason or another, you still haven't taken the leap. We're here to give you a push. \nBasically, if other people at the office are wearing sneakers, you can, too. But the presence of sneakers at your workplace does not give you carte blanche to wear any old thing. Keep it simple and look for a classic silhouette with a solid color and understated design. High- and mid-tops are easier to wear around the office, but low-cut shoes are great for summer. \nHere are some of the trendiest choices that tick all of our work-appropriate boxes and can be had for as little as $60. Leather \n\nNew Balance New Balance 574 Leather ($80) \nMost leather shoes have a place at work, and leather sneakers are no different. Subtle, cool, and comfortable, these all-leather, stark white New Balance 574' s are great for just about any office. Solid Color \nMr Porter Common Projects ($405) \nSimple is the name of the game. These Common Projects Tournament shoes are like a high-end Converse All-Star, only more minimalist and presented in luxe suede. In a bright tan, these sneakers might even get confused for a pair of cupsole chukka boots — a serious plus. Low-Profile \nAdidas Adidas Stan Smith ($75) \nAdidas' Stan Smiths might get played out, but that's only because they're so versatile. In a pristine white interrupted only by a strip of leather on the heel and a graphic on the tongue, this shoe is perfect for casual summer Fridays. Pair them with cuffed denim and you're good to go. Canvas \nJ Crew Vans X J Crew Washed Canvas Authentic ($60) \nLeather may be the office favorite, but canvas is still in the game. A plain blue canvas shoe like this Vans x J Crew collaboration is more than work appropriate. Though it loses points for the offensive branding, it makes up for it with its skater-kid-goes-yachting-for-the-day vibe. Not-So-Sporty \nNike Nike Internationalist Mid ($80) \nA sportier look can be worn to work, but only if it has a retro lean. This Nike Internationalist is a far cry from the running shoes that have elbowed their way into the realm of casual attire. It's a casual sneaker with a hint of sportiness. After all, you're not literally running from meeting to meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:57:39.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
