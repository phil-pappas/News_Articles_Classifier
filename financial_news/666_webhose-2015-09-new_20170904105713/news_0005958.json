Assad arrived in Turkey with his glamorous wife Asma and their two children for a visit that touched off the seven happy years that ended with Erdogan turning his former guest’s removal from office into a major diplomatic goal.\nThat goal now seems more elusive than at any other point since the Syrian civil war’s outbreak in spring 2011. In fact, other than the Syrian people, Turkey now emerges as this war’s main casualty, as its diplomatic setbacks fan political mayhem and economic flux.\nRussia’s ghosts Turkey’s reactions to the Syrian crisis have failed one by one.\nRussian Lawmakers Approve Military Action in Syria (1:38) Russian lawmakers voted unanimously on Wednesday to let President Vladimir Putin send troops to Syria. A top Kremlin official said the authorization follows a request for military assistance by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Photo: AP.\nOn the refugee front, Turkey’s creation of tent camps and caravan cities along its Syrian border has been impressive both in humanitarian and logistical terms, but its main aim, to block a Syrian influx, has failed.\nA least 800,000 Syrians penetrated Turkey proper, besides more than 100,000 who populate the 13 Turkish-built camps. With 100,000 to 200,000 Syrians now inhabiting Istanbul, social problems already abound, since the refugees’ language and ethnicity are entirely different from the non-Semitic Turks.\nWorse, Turkey has no shortage of unskilled workers. Unlike Germany, for which the refugees are an economic asset, for Turkish economy they are a liability, weighing on a workforce where nearly one in 10 adults and one in five young adults are jobless.\nOn the military side, Turkey has failed so far to create an effective proxy within Syria that would rival Iran’s and Russia’s cultivation of Assad. Worse, Ankara’s half-hearted role in the war on Islamic State has made most of the world suspect that its Islamist government is secretly cheering the fundamentalist organization that everyone else is out to subdue.\nFinally, on the diplomatic side, Ankara was caught sleeping while Russia redoubled its Syrian foothold with new infusions of warplanes, tanks, troops and advisers, underscored by the construction of a new airbase outside Latakia, less than 80 miles south of the Turkish border.\nMoscow’s arrival in the vacuum created by Washington’s creeping retreat from the Middle East is a major setback for Ankara, regardless of its accounts with Syria. Turkey and Russia fought 12 wars since the Middle Ages, fomenting the enmity that climaxed in World War I and continued by other means during the Cold War.\nNow, the expanding Russian enclave in Syria might not only save the Assad regime, but also serve Turkey’s historic enemies. Greece, Cyprus, Armenia, and Bulgaria all have historic bonds with Russia. A strong Russian presence on Turkey’s doorstep will greatly improve their position in their future dealings with Ankara.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:49:15.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
