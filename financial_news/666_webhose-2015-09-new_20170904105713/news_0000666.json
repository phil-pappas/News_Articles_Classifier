As a result, Nigeria will be removed from each of the six GBI-EM indices starting Sept 30,\" the bank said in a note.\nThe central bank had to devalue the naira and pegged it at a fixed rate against the dollar, turning trading into a one-way Quote: currency market whose lack of transparency angered investors and businesses.\nThe index provider said Nigeria would not be eligible for re-inclusion in the index for a minimum of 12 months and this was dependent upon a consistent track record of satisfying the index inclusion criteria such as a liquid currency market.
