While precious metal pros will buy silver and silver miners, typically it is below milk, bread, eggs and gold on their shopping list. Silver bulls often point to the 1974-1980 run in silver to $50 from $1.50 per ounce as aggressive buying by the Hunt family captivated bulls. Gold, by comparison, rallied only to around $850 from $100 per ounce in the same time period.\n\nIn the past 12 months,     ( SSRI - Get Report ) has rallied to around $7 and retreated. The selloffs first stopped at $4, but recently buyers became more aggressive and paid $5. A breakout over the recent highs could precipitate a rally to the $10 area, projecting the height of this pattern upward from the breakout point.\n\n\nPan American Silver   ( PAAS - Get Report ) has a less compelling chart, but it does show four tests of the $6 level with the On-Balance Volume line (OBV) inching upward. We can see that $6 is now decent support and the improving OBV line now shows that volume is heavier on up days. Aggressive traders could consider a small initial long probe with a sell stop below $6.\n\nSilver Wheaton   ( SLW - Get Report ) has attracted attention from hedge fund guru Ray Dalio in recent months, but the chart needs further base building before I would recommend a long position.\n\nIf you don't want the risk of owning a mining company, you can look at an interest in the metal through the ETF, iShares Silver Trust   ( SLV ) , see chart above. SLV is still in a downtrend and the OBV line is not yet showing us that new accumulation is under way. We would stand aside on the SLV for now.\nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Options Profits Our options trading pros provide over 100 monthly option trading ideas and strategies to help you become a well-seasoned trader.\nProduct Features: Actionable options commentary and news Real-time trading community View other subscription services that we offer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:13:13.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
