Two weeks ago property and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group announced it would buy the organiser of the Ironman extreme endurance contests for $650 million. \nEarlier this year Dalian spent more than a billion euros on Swiss sports marketing group Infront -- which holds some broadcasting rights to the football World Cup -- and took a 20 percent stake in Spanish football club Atletico Madrid. \nThe Alibaba announcement came a day before it is scheduled to host an event with US collegiate sports league PAC-12. \nThe new company has tapped Zhang Dazhong, former vice president of state-owned Shanghai Media Group, as chief. Zhang is credited with playing a crucial role in the set-up of SMG's interactive television subsidiary BesTV. \nNew York-listed Alibaba's Taobao platform holds more than 90 percent of the consumer-to-consumer market in China, while its Tmall platform is believed to command more than half the Chinese market for business-to-consumer transactions. \nThe company is also making in-roads into entertainment, investing in its first Hollywood film \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\", according to a separate statement, which gave no value. \nAlibaba Pictures Group is acting as promotional partner in China with Paramount Pictures for the film, which debuted in Chinese theatres on Tuesday, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:52:48.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
