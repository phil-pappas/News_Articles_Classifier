Over that period there has been a recurring question that has been asked in many different ways.\nThis question has everything to with tax, but has nothing to do with maximising the potential of a business or an individual's wealth. That question is, why should I earn extra income because I will only end up paying more tax?\nA simple answer to this question has always been, it is better to have at least 53 per cent of something than 100 per cent of nothing. This answer ignores other factors that need to be taken into account when considering whether it is worthwhile increasing income that results in extra tax being paid.\nQ. I am a business coach and have clients in the service industry who want to hold their business below the GST threshold to save complications. Is the additional impost of GST and the associated workload actually that costly?\nAdvertisement A. There is no simple answer to your question, just as there is no simple answer to earning extra after tax income question. To answer this question the problem must be broken down into its different components, the financial and tax effect of each of those components estimated, and then the business owner first assesses what option provides either the best net benefit or the least net cost.\nThe final assessment does not depend entirely on monetary issues but also quality of life and risk issues. The actual increase in extra work, by having a business increase its income to the point where it must register for GST, is not that great.\nThe work involved in collecting the information for preparing an income tax return is exactly the same as what is involved in preparing and lodging a quarterly BAS return. Income earned and expenses paid each quarter need to be calculated, with this information being used to prepare the annual income tax return.\nFrom a cost point of view if an accountant or a bookkeeper is used to process this information, having this done four times during the year to prepare and lodge BAS returns instead of once after the end of the year, should not result in the cost quadrupling.\nOne of the major considerations that must be taken into account, of earning extra income and having to register for GST, is whether the business deals with other businesses and whether the goods or services are price-sensitive.\nWhere a business deals with the public, and the goods and services are price-sensitive and cannot be increased by GST, it can often be left worse off by earning slightly more income and having to register for GST.\nThe final non-financial consideration is whether the work required is not justified by the extra after tax or GST income earned. Where there is not much extra work or cost involved in earning extra income, it does not make sense to artificially reduce the income earning capacity of any business.\nQuestions on small business income tax and other issues\nMax Newham is the founder of www.smsfsurvivalcentre.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:42:04.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
