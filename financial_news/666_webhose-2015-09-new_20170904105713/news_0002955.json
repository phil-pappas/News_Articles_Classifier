Since these apps operators have made transpiration a commodity, (auto) sales could be hit and volumes get impacted,” Mahindra said here.\nHe was talking to reporters after launching M&M’s first compact SUV, TUV300, from an all new platform at the company’s plant in Chakan, Pune.\nMahindra said the problem gets confounded as “a lot of youngsters who can own vehicles today don’t want to own one, but only need access to transportation.”\nMahindra, however, expressed hope “people will own those things which they love” and called upon the auto industry to create products with passion so that they induce a desire in customers to buy cars and not just meet their automotive needs.\n“The job of automobile manufacturers is to passionately build something that others love to own,” he said.\nIt can be noted that US-based taxi-hailing app Uber, which despite running into some troubles following the rape of a woman passenger by one of its drivers last December in Delhi and other regulatory hurdles, is investing USD 1 billion here so that it can ramp up its daily ridership to 1 million by March next year.\nUber wants to increase its India presence from the present 18 cities. Industry estimates peg Uber’s daily rides at around 2,00,000.\nSimilarly, its domestic rival Ola, which leads the market in terms of number of taxis, drivers and riderships by a wider margin, is also getting millions of dollars of investments to increase its market share. Ola is backed by Japanese and American firms and a clutch of other investors.\nOthers like Meru and Tabcab which are also growing rapidly and such app and phone-based taxi services are tilting the balance against cars faster than expected.\nLow cost of ridership is forcing many people in over-crowded cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru to opt to just hail taxis and not buy vehicles.\nWhile Uber charges Rs 10-13 per km, Ola offers at around Rs 13-16 per km, thus making a daily tax ride much cheaper than owning a financed car.\nMahindra further said the impact of the current age of access is that “a lot of people, who can afford a vehicle are deciding against owning one. They just need access to transport. So, our job is to offer wider choices to consumers with more innovative models.”\n 10, 2015 9:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:05:23.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
