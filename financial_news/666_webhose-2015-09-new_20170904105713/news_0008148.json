Renowned Ethiopian athletes also donated 52 television sets which would be used as prize for winners of the lot. In the first round of the programme more than 80 million birr was collected from individuals who send text message 'A' to service number 8100. The programme aims to solicit more than 100 million birr in the forthcoming second round. \nEver since the government of Ethiopia announced its readiness and determination to complete the project with or without foreign grant or loans, Ethiopians from all walks of life rallied behind the government's decision. As the Dam is an entirely Ethiopian-funded project, nationals both in the country and in the Diaspora have been doing everything in their capacity to finance and facilitate the construction of the dam through donations and purchase of bonds. \nThe involvement of Ethiopian from all walks of life, in the construction of the Dam has been quite remarkable and encouraging from the start. The government is giving due respect and recognition to the public's irreplaceable role in this regard. By doing so, it has continued to demonstrate its unflinching commitment to construct and finish the GERD with the active participation of the public at large. \nAs the project is a huge heritage, nationals of the country should work together without dividing themselves in religion, ethnic background or living standards. The construction of this historic Dam has continued to receive an unprecedented support from government organizations, private and public institutions, students, farmers, employees, employers and the public at large. And the government is duly recognizing this unreserved support and generous contribution of the public through various awards at different occasions. \nThe public have demonstrated its firmness to realize this huge project at every cost possible. The people are actively supporting the government's leading efforts to overcome the political and financial obstacles that have impeded Ethiopia from realizing the opportunities available through the use of the Nile River. The people of Ethiopia have been showing their perseverance to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and to beat the country's arch-enemy-poverty. They are practically proving their readiness to contribute their level best for the success of the construction of the Dam. \nThe successful completion of fundraising programs like 8100A is a demonstration of Ethiopians' zeal and passion towards the construction of the dam. The unreserved support of the public to the project has been quite tremendous even far beyond the expectation of the government. The government's expectations were focused on the purchase of bonds, but many millions of Ethiopians are more than willing to contribute their share without bothering to purchase bonds. \nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will remain a reminder of Ethiopians unity and unreserved support for a national cause of eradicating poverty. It will continue to be a symbol of the unity needed to bring about the renaissance of Ethiopia. While the construction of the project is going on round the clock reaching 47 per cent, the relentless efforts of all concerned bodies including the government, the private sector, civil society organizations and the general public should be redoubled. The successful completion of the construction of the Dam indeed is the symbol of Ethiopia's renaissance. Ethiopia \nThe involvement of entities like ethio-telecom guarantees the successful completion of the project. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Ethiopian Herald. All rights reserved.
