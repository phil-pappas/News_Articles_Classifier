Greg Newington by Karen Maley Maybe it's just that time of year.\nGlobal share markets have slumped in the past week, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep its key interest rate close to zero. Rather than seeing this as a sign that the US central bank is determined to keep the monetary stimulus flowing in order to boost the US economy, investors saw the decision as a sign that the outlook for global growth is even worse than they thought.\nBut investors may also be worried that we're now approaching that perilous time of year when markets are particularly prone to major accidents.\nNo one knows exactly why, but unusually large number of market upheavals have occurred in the months of September and October, including the 1929 Wall Street crash (share prices began to decline in September and early October, but it wasn't until October 29 that year that Black Tuesday hit), and the 1987 share market collapse (again, the US share market peaked in August, but Black Monday – which saw the US share market fall by almost 23 per cent– took place on October 19).\nBut these aren't the only calamities. The $US3.7 billion ($5.4 billion) bailout of the highly leveraged hedge fund Long-term Capital Management (which, in retrospect, looks like a small dress rehearsal for the financial crisis) took place in September 1998. A decade later, US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy (15 September, 2008) setting off a panic that threatened the entire global financial system.\nAs we head into this perilous period this year, there are three main worries weighing on investors minds: slowing growth in China, the potential for another emerging market crisis, and the threat of deflation.\nFor much of this year, signs that the Chinese economy is braking sharply have unsettled global markets.\nBut investors were disturbed when the US central bank highlighted the headwinds facing the US economy as a result of the slowdown in China and other emerging countries.\n In its latest policy statement, the Fed said that \"recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\"\nAs if to emphasise the weakness in the world's second-largest economy, the preliminary Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, an initial measure of Chinese factory activity, fell to a 6½-year low in September. The flash Caixin manufacturing PMI fell to 47 in September, down from 47.3 in August (a reading below 50 indicates contraction).\nThe index, which has been in contraction territory since February, highlights the difficulties that Chinese manufacturers face, as domestic demand is too weak to pick up the slack from the collapse in export orders.\nThe latest figures are likely to put pressure on China to allow the yuan to weaken further against the US dollar, in order to make Chinese-made goods more competitive in global markets.\nAlready, the slowdown in Chinese demand is taking a huge toll on commodity prices, pushing prices of iron ore, copper, coal and oil sharply lower. This has hit the earnings of big resource exporters, pushing countries such as Russia and Canada (major oil exporters) and Brazil (a big iron ore exporter) into recession.\nOther emerging countries – particularly in Asia – are also suffering as waning Chinese demand hits their export sales. At the same time, investors, worried about the sharp slowdown in global growth, have been rushing to sell their emerging market assets, pushing the currencies of many countries sharply lower.\nAs a result, many investors are worried that we could be on the brink of a fresh emerging market crisis.\nJohn Burbank, who runs the successful hedge fund Passport Capital, argues that the years of money-printing by the US central bank has resulted in a misallocation of capital, which has sown the seeds for the next financial diaster.\n\"The wrong people got the capital – emerging markets countries and corporates and a lot of cyclical companies like mining and energy, particularly shale companies – and this is now a major problem for the credit markets,\" he told the Financial Times.\nHe added that investors were not recognising the risks. \"I think we are on the precipice of a liquidation in emerging markets, and this feels the way that the fourth quarter of 1997 felt.\"\nAll the same, persistent concerns over the health of the global economy are causing an increasing number of investors to flock to the safety of US Treasury bonds.\nThis week a $US15 billion sale of short-term US government debt attracted record demand, even though the securities, which will mature in a month, were sold with a yield of zero.\nDemand for short-term US Treasury debt – known as T-bills – has been so strong that some of the yields on bills maturing in a week to a few months have been trading around zero, or even slightly below zero, over the past week. (Bond yields fall as bond prices rise).\nAn investor accepting negative yields buys at a price of more than 100 cents in the dollar, meaning that they will incur a small loss if the debt is held to maturity.\nMeanwhile, the yield on benchmark 10-year US bonds touched a one month low of 2.1 per cent this week (down from its peak of 2.5 per cent in June) as investors worried about declining global growth, problems in emerging markets and the dearth of US inflationary pressures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:14:24.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
