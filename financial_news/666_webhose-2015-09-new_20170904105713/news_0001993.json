Jim Rice Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The construction union and two officials have been penalised $272,500 for breaching right of entry laws, with the Federal Court ordering the officials to personally pay $47,500 in fines to deter further unlawful conduct.\nOne of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union officials, Anthony Kong, identified himself as the late Steve Irwin when asked for his name by the project manager of a building site at Sydney domestic airport in 2013.\nIn his decision on Thursday, Justice Geoffrey Flick imposed a $225,000 penalty on the CFMEU, a $27,500 fine on Mr Kong and a $20,000 penalty on a second official, Chad Anthony Bragdon, who has since left the union.\nJustice Flick said that Mr Kong and Mr Bragdon must pay their own fines, and that they must not be reimbursed by the CFMEU.\n\"A penalty, if it were to be paid or reimbursed by an employing union, would cease to act as a deterrent to the contravening 'individual',\" he said.\n\"An 'individual' so reimbursed could act with impunity in full knowledge that his employing union conferred what could be seen as a licence for him to continue his past transgressions,\" he said.\nMr Bragdon and Mr Kong claimed they were on site for safety reasons and directed workers to stop a concrete pour.\nThe project manager asked them for their right of entry permits, saying: \"Can I at least get your names?\" Mr Kong replied: \"Steve Irwin\". The project manager asked: \"What? As in the crocodile hunter?\" Mr Kong replied: \"Yeah, that's it.\"\n 'Deliberate and intentional' Justice Flick said both men both entered the site \"knowing they should have waited for personal protective equipment to have been provided, and to be escorted on site\". He said their conduct was deliberate and intentional.\nIn an earlier decision handed down in July, Justice Flick said the two men \"behaved in the manner they did, their conduct brought no credit to themselves or to the union that they represent\".\n\"Once on site, it has been further concluded that they purported to exercise powers which they knew they did not posses,\" he said.\n\"They behaved in a manner which was abusive and misleading. Their conduct can only be described as contemptuous of the limits to their power and the people on site with whom they were dealing.\"\nFair Work Building and Construction director Nigel Hadgkiss said on Thursday that he hoped the significant penalties imposed in the case would act as a \"strong deterrent to the CFMEU and officials, and any others considering flouting workplace laws in the construction industry\".\nHe said the fact that union officials were again using questionable safety concerns to try and access a site, only to disobey safety laws themselves, was disturbing.\n\"Safety rules exist to protect everybody on site. Safety is paramount on building and construction sites and it is appalling that union officials are abusing safety, which potentially puts them and others at risk,\" Mr Hadgkiss said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-10T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:54:35.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
