Cairns taxis driver trainer Chris Balsom is listed as the person behind the stop Uber campaign .\nUber was contacted for comment but could not confirm before deadline whether it had anything to do with the support Uber campaign by Karl Melrose .\nThe move comes as Canberra on Tuesday became the first Australian jurisdiction to regulate ride-sharing so that companies like Uber can operate legally by facing the same safety and insurance regulations as existing taxi services.\nSan Francisco-based Uber has long argued that it is a technology company and shouldn't have to face the same rules and regulations as the taxi industry.\nBut the taxi industry is furious and says that Uber is a taxi service and therefore needs to abide by the same safety, vehicle and insurance regulations as everyone else.\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews has said he is \"concerned\" to make sure that the government \"properly regulate[s] the pre-booked only trade\".\nHis comments came as a new report prepared for the government on Victoria's taxi industry found that Uber is potentially avoiding paying millions of dollars in government taxes.\nBut the company is also facing a battle in NSW where Roads and Maritime Services NSW has issued 40 suspension notices to UberX drivers.\nUber, which in July was valued at about US$51 billion, has for years been lobbying state and federal regulators worldwide in a bid to circumvent any regulations that would stop its international expansion.\nThe company had hired US President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe as its senior vice-president of policy and strategy (Plouffe now advises Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick), and in Australia has been aggressively lobbying federal leaders to reverse the recent Australian Taxation Office decision to make UberX drivers register for GST .\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has praised ride-sharing company Uber as part of the \"agile\" economy he envisages for Australia.\nUber is using its outlawed status to challenge the ATO's decision in the Federal Court. Uber has said the ATO guidance is \"a flawed interpretation\" of GST law and the ATO was acting beyond its duties as a tax administrator.\nBut the Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan earlier this year hit back at Uber for suggesting the ATO lacked integrity and has accused the company of playing dirty to try and influence the media.", "external_links": ["https://www.change.org/p/andrew-constance-nsw-government-minister-for-transport-and-infrastructure-warren-truss-federal-minister-for-infrastructure-and-regional-development-duncan-gay-nsw-government-minister-for-ro-change-laws-to-allow-uber-drivers-to-operate-in-nsw-in-perso", "https://www.change.org/p/queensland-government-protect-the-public-from-illegal-ride-sharing-apps?utm_source=action_alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=400530&alert_id=bFDrAeUWsj_7O7lwpFXw8PEZmURM1uXehttLQRHXxjOmr2AU0XMWOqF%2F%2FUPALHzZGxTzLSGdtMb"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:44:49.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
