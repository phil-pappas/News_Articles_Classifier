Citigroup joins banks including HSBC Holdings Plc and asset manager Ashmore Group in obtaining the license after the Arab world’s biggest stock market opened to direct foreign investment in June.\nThe license marks a breakthrough for the U.S. bank in the Middle East’s largest economy after it sold a 20 percent stake in Samba Financial Group more than a decade ago. The U.S. bank said at the time its strategy was to invest in countries where it could have majority control of banks it ran. The closure ended an almost 50 year presence in the kingdom and was called a “mistake” in 2007 by Mohammed al-Shroogi, the bank’s then managing director for the Middle East. Samba is now the third largest bank in Saudi Arabia by assets and profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:15:56.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
