Glencore’s profits are falling sharply, it no longer pays a dividend, and the value of the mines it owns are falling as commodity prices tumble because the world’s biggest buyer, China, is slowing down. \nThe holders of debt in this company will be more secure following the actions, but those holding equity are looking increasingly at risk. \nGlencore’s most recent results to the end of June show a debt pile of $47.3bn (£30.9bn), or $29.6bn excluding debt used to fund trading, against shareholder’s equity of $45bn. So, in the unlikely event it had to repay all its debts tomorrow, shareholders could get nothing. \nThe refinancing plan will take time to execute and involves plenty of risk. \nMany questions remain, not least at what price is the $2.5bn equity raise to be held and how dilutive will it be? The suspension of the mines will cut costs but also hit full-year revenue and profits. The group is now a forced seller of assets in a depressed market. \nQuestor advised shareholders to sell in January of this year at 244.2p and as the debt holders move closer to the driving seat in this situation we would avoid any temptation to go bargain hunting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:09:17.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
