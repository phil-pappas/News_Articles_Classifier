On the east side there is a low pressure area over north Gujarat and Rajasthan. There is another low pressure area in Jharkhand and adjoining areas of Gangetic West Bengal and Bihar. This will bring a good amount of rainfall till September 23,” IMD Director-General Laxman Singh Rathore said.\nIncidentally, the fresh round of “enhanced activity” of monsoon has also stopped the withdrawal of monsoon, albeit for a short period.\nSeptember, which is the last official month of the southwest monsoon, witnesses withdrawal of rains from several parts of the country. The “line of withdrawn” now passes through Amritsar, Hissar, Ajmer and Barmer, the IMD said.\nRathore said good rainfall activity will continue until September 23, but the monsoon will start withdrawing rapidly from several parts thereafter.\n“Heavy to heavy rainfall would occur at isolated places over sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar, isolated places in Assam and Meghalaya, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, East and West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, East and West Rajasthan on September 22,” IMD said.\n“Situation seems to be improving now. The low pressure area lying over North Gujarat will move in a northeasterly direction towards the plains of North India. The effects of this system will be complemented by the presence of a Western Disturbance over North Pakistan,” Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, said.\nSkymet added that the combination of these two systems will bring fairly widespread rainfall over North India. The entire plain region, including west Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and west Uttar Pradesh, will receive some rainfall till September 23.\n 21, 2015 9:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:00:41.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
