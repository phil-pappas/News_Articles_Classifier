Louie Douvis Mr Stevens repeated that he expects the US Federal Reserve to begin hiking interest rates this year, but noted global stock market turmoil caused by instability in China.\nOfficials have signalled an increasing reluctance to make further interest rate cuts for fear of stoking Sydney's housing bubble, and they have been alleviated of the need for further action because of the falling Australian dollar, trading close to a six-year low.\n\"Commentary in the statement was descriptive rather than prescriptive, with little in the way of judgments or forward-looking views,\" said Paul Brennan at Citigroup. \"This was despite some significant developments in the past month including the implications of weak profit growth and disappointing capex guidance by companies.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the current account deficit blew out in the June quarter to $19 billion after a slump in both prices and shipments of iron ore and coal.\n Economists had tipped a deficit of $16 billion.\nCritically, for Wednesday's much-anticipated national accounts, the ABS estimated that net exports would subtract 0.6 percentage points from growth in the June quarter - or double the amount forecast by analysts.\n\"Australia is still some time away from recording trade surpluses again,\" said Diana Mousina at Commonwealth Bank. \"While commodity prices remain weak, export values will remain under pressure.\"\nSigns are mounting that the strong export performance of the March quarter – which was the source of almost all of the quarter's gross domestic product growth – faltered in the three months through June after prices for Australia's main exports fell.\nIron ore exports fell 8 per cent - or by $1.6 billion - in the June quarter, with volumes down 2 per cent and prices down 6 per cent, the ABS said on Tuesday.\nCoal slumped 11 per cent, with volumes down 8 per cent and prices 4 per cent lower.\nThe commodities rout - which augurs badly for the government's hopes of a politically pain-free return to budget surplus - was not offset by any major improvement in rural exports.\nThe Abbott government seized on the March quarter's 0.9 per cent GDP growth as evidence of Australia's relative outperformance, but economists expect Wednesday's release to show growth slowed to around half that pace, taking the annual growth rate to just over 2 per cent, or one of the weakest expansions since the global financial crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:23:48.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
