The expectation is that the rate will likely remain unchanged at 5.3%. \nYet the market is anything but bullish, with the DOW remaining below last year. Despite the fact that the Great Recession ended technically in June 2009, as many as 72% of Americans believe we're still in a recession. \nWhy is that? \nSimply put, there are three reasons: Businesses fear another economic collapse and, therefore, are holding any available funds rather than investing them for growth. In the government's unemployment rate calculations (called \"U-3\"), part-time jobs count equally with full-time jobs Household income, as a result of #2, is actually down during this recovery , from $54,541 in 2009 to $52,250 in 2013 (latest figures available). This is the only economic recovery in history in which household income has gone down. \nToday, corporations seeking to trim expenses can cut 1,000 full-time jobs and replace them with 1,500 part-time jobs. This way, they save overall in labor expenses, and avoid costly employee benefits normally offered full-time employees. \nThe result: Everyone getting a paycheck makes less money, and 500 new jobs were added to the economy. And for those who decide to wait until a job becomes available that is similar to the one they lost, if they wait too long, they will be counted as having voluntarily retired, despite the fact that they may still be looking. The government considers them as having \"given up.\" \nTwo things to look for this Friday: August 2015's unemployment report, and the lack of enthusiasm from anyone over what should be stellar news.
