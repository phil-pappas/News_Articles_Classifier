Brent rose as high as $50.87 a barrel when trading began on Friday \nU.S. crude for October delivery (CLc1), also known as West Texas Intermediate, was down 21 cents at $46.54 a barrel, off the day's high of $46.85. It had settled 50 cents higher in the previous session. \nU.S. non-farm payroll and unemployment data for August is due for release at 1230 GMT. \n\"If non-farm payrolls turn out better, oil prices could increase as there would be more bullishness on the U.S. economy,\" said Phillips Futures in a note on Friday. \nA weak payroll figure could push prices down, causing the WTI and Brent benchmarks to test support at $44.92 and $49.69, respectively, the note added. \nU.S. fiscal policymakers are likely to use the jobs data as part of their assessment on whether to raise interest rates this year at the next meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve federal open market committee on Sept. 16-17. \nA strong dollar remained a \"clear and present danger\" for the oil markets, Le Brun said. A firm greenback makes oil and other commodities priced in dollars more expensive for holders of other currencies. \nInvestors are also keeping an eye on U.S. oil rig data due later on Friday. Any drop in rig numbers could bolster oil's price outlook. \nBNP Paribas lowered its price forecasts for oil on Thursday to $56 a barrel for 2015 and $62 for 2016 for Brent, and to $51 a barrel in 2015 and $56 in 2016 for U.S. crude. \n(Reporting by Keith Wallis; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:53:38.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
