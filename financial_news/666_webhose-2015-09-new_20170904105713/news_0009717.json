Despite the drop, India is still expected to raise imports as sanctions against the OPEC country ease. \nIn a pact clinched on July 14 between Iran and the United States, Germany, France, Russia, China and Britain, Iran would limit its controversial nuclear programme in exchange for a removal of economic sanctions. \nIran was India's second-biggest oil supplier in the fiscal year to March 31, 2007, but it slipped to seventh by last fiscal year as sanctions bit. \nIndia, the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer and Tehran's top client after China, bought 21 percent less Iranian oil at 214,100 bpd in the first eight months of this year, the data showed. \nApril-August imports rose 21 percent to 266,000 bpd from a year ago. \n(Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:54:14.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
