In one sense, self-employed health care plan participants have acted as guinea pigs, as they were on the front line of the Obamacare's rocky rollout. High premiums and deductibles, balky online sign-up experiences and a rash of insurers whose quick entrance and exit from the market forced self-insured consumers to look for new plans every year, all rankled the self-ensured. According to eHealth.com, more than 60% of self-insured health care customers say they \"would have difficulty paying their deductible in the event of a medical emergency .\" Another study -- by ConnectedHealth, an online benefits technology firm -- states that although consumers do their best to select a plan that's cost efficient, \"a large price tag is also Americans' biggest health care complaint.\" After purchasing their own health insurance, 44% experienced out-of-pocket costs that were higher than expected, including 51% of parents, the report notes. According to ConnectedHealth, $334 is the \"average amount of money Americans allocate each month to pay premium, co-pays, prescriptions and other out-of-pocket health costs.\" Rochelle Odesser, a vice president and financial planner at Madison Planning Group in West Harrison, N.Y., is both a self-insured health care consumer and someone who advises firm clients on selecting the best health insurance plan. \"I am concerned about costs, premiums, doctors and hospitals available in the plan that I choose as well as my own health and what concerns I have,\" Odesser says. \"As an older adult, not yet eligible for Medicare, I'm concerned about what exams and tests are covered, and hidden costs in lab fees or fees for other tests that were not anticipated. These extra fees are a big concern for me, as I've run into unanticipated fees for labs that were part of my annual check-up and follow up tests that were prescribed by my doctor, but not covered.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:39:51.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
