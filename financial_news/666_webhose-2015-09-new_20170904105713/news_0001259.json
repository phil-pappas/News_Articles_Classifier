In addition to nearly 1,000 bloggers, the conference was attended by the likes of [entity display=\"Vanguard\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"vanguard\" natural_id=\"fred/company/14683\"]Vanguard[/entity], Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, [entity display=\"Chase\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"chase\" natural_id=\"fred/company/8931\"]Chase[/entity] and many other household names in the investing and personal finance space. This year there were also companies that specialize in refinancing student loans.One student loan company that attended the conference was SoFi . I spent some time talking to one of SoFi's co-founders, Dan Macklin, about when refinancing is a good option, and when it's not such a good option. When refinancing debt, the two key factors generally are the new interest rate and fees. Thats' true whether you are refinancing credit card debt with a balance transfer offer , refinancing a mortgage, or even a car.Unlike most other loans, however, refinancing student debt comes with a unique twist--some loans are government backed while others are from private lenders. Many current and former students have both. Further, federal student loans offers certain advantages over private loans that are lost when they are refinanced. With that in mind, here are four things to consider before refinancing a student loan. 1. Refinancing vs. Consolidation Refinancing and consolidation are different but related animals. Refinancing generally involves replacing one or more loans with a new loan that comes with a lower interest rate. Consolidation involves replacing two or more loans with a single loan that may or may not come with a lower interest rate. The distinction can be confusing, particularly given that a borrower can refinance and consolidate her loans at the same time.Here's the key. Borrowers cannot refinance government student loans with another government loan. If you want to refinance loans to a lower rate, private loans are the only option.The government does offer loan consolidation. It's called a Federal Direct Loan Consolidation and it's free. It won't, however, lower your interest rate. In fact, it likely will increase your rate slightly. The new interest rate is the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded to the nearest higher one-eighth of one percent. If that sounds too confusing, you can use this loan consolidation calculator to determine the rate you'd pay.Consolidating federal loans can be a good idea if you don't want to replace them with a private loan (which is discussed below). Keep in mind, however, that it won't lower your interest rate. 2. Income Based Repayment Plans One perk of a federal student loan is the available repayment plans. A popular option is the income based repayment plan. As the name suggests, the monthly payment is calculated based on income.These plans come in three flavors: Income-based repayment plan, pay as you earn repayment plan, and income-contingent repayment plan. The idea behind each is that they offer a way to link your monthly payment amount to your income. The result generally lowers your monthly payment. It also lengthens the repayment period, potentially increasing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.While these plans do not lower the interest rate, they can help those who have lower incomes compared to their debt levels. These plans, however, are not available for those that refinance a government loan with a private loan. As a result, if you want an income driven repayment plan , refinancing to a private loan is not an option. And if you are on the fence, you can use this calculator provided by the government to estimate your monthly payments under an income based plan. 3. Public Service Loan Foregiveness Program Another benefit of a federal student loan is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program . This program is designed to encourage full time public service employment by forgiving federal Direct Loans after qualifying payments have been made for 10 years.There are several things to keep in mind. First, not all federal loans qualify under the PSLF program. The good news is that you can consolidate non-qualifying loans into a Direct Loan and then apply for the PSLF program. Second, you need to make sure your job qualifies under the program. The above link in this section provides details on qualifying employment. Finally, the PSLF program is not available on private student loans.So if you may take advantage of this program, refinancing federal loans with a private lender would be a mistake. 4. Your Credit Score If you've navigated the gauntlet thus far, there's one more hurdle to clear. Private student refinancing, like most debt, comes with a range of interest rates depending on the borrower's creditworthiness. The amount of debt you have and your income are important factors in the underwriting process. So too is your credit score .As an example, SoFi's current rates on a fixed student loan are 3.50% to 7.24% with auto pay. A borrower's monthly payment and total interest paid can vary considerably based on the rate for which they qualify. As a result, it may be prudent to improve your financial health before refinancing your student debt. Keep in mind that the rates noted above are subject to change. Furthermore, different lenders offer different rates, so it's important to shop around before making a decision .In the final analysis, deciding whether to refinance student debt involves a lot more than just comparing interest rates. Federal loans offer numerous advantages and repayment options that should be considered before making a final decision.", "external_links": ["https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven", "https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action", "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-loan-forgiveness-common-questions.pdf", "https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/loancalc/servlet/common.mvc.Controller?controller_task=startCalculator", "https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?page=loanConsol", "http://www.doughroller.net/debt/6-easy-ways-refinance-student-debt/", "http://www.doughroller.net/education/review-sofi/"], "published": "2015-09-21T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T03:22:18.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
