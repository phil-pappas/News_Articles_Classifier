When it went back into regular session, Alderman Brian Ramsey made the motion to keep the millage rate at the current rate of 20.03. \nMayor Gene McGee previously said the millage increase was needed to supplement the city's lagging sales tax. \nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:46:27.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
