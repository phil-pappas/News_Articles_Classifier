The euro, too was lower by a similar margin at 134.08 yen. .\nThe dollar index was last off 0.07 percent after trading ahead before U.S. data showed an unexpected decline during August of contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes. The data indicated the robust housing market could be losing steam.\nThe yen has been a traditional safe haven in the currency market, along with the Swiss franc, gaining during times of economic uncertainty or stress in financial markets. The dollar was off 0.30 percent against the franc.\nThe yen has gained nearly 4 percent against the dollar since China shocked global markets by devaluing its currency in early August.\nThursday's China Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), will be more closely watched than usual by currency traders, who reckon a sharply slowing Chinese economy could delay rate hikes by the Fed.\nNevertheless, attention will also be on U.S. jobs data due Friday for any clues on whether the Fed will raise interest rates in the near term or not. An upbeat report would strengthen expectations for a rate hike this year, some strategists said.\nThe euro was last up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.202 (Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London; Editing by Alison Williams and Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:43:28.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
