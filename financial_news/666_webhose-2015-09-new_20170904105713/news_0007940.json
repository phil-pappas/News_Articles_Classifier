When you've met the $1,000, say: 'Now I'm going to aim for $2,000.'\"\nSelling things you don't need online or getting a second job may also be options to jumpstart an emergency fund.\nWith household debt at a record level compared with income, Canadians are facing challenges putting money aside for an emergency.\nA recent survey done for the Bank of Montreal suggested 24 per cent of Canadians have little, if anything, put aside in an emergency fund and roughly 56 per cent have less than $10,000 saved for unexpected expenses.\nMedical expenses, job loss, major car repairs and unexpected home repairs were cited as the top emergency concerns by those surveyed.\nIncreased debt, higher stress when an emergency occurs and feelings of anxiety and lack of financial stability, even when not immediately faced with emergency, were all cited as consequences of not having an emergency fund.\nTony Tintinalli, BMO's regional vice-president for personal banking in downtown Toronto, says your emergency fund needs to be easily accessible.\nHe suggests cashable guaranteed investment certificates or a high-interest savings account would be good options because of their safety and accessibility.\n\"This shouldn't be the bulk of your savings. This should be that emergency fund,\" Tintinalli said.\nHe cautioned investors who might want to invest their emergency fund in search of a better return than the low interest rates paid by a savings account.\n\"If it's your emergency fund, how risky do you want to be with it?\" Tintinalli said. \"Decisions that you've made in your longer term financial goal, you're maybe willing to take a lot more risk because the horizon is a lot longer. In your emergency fund, that may not necessarily be the case.\"\nGeorge also stressed an emergency fund should not be anyone's only savings, but should be in addition to retirement savings as well as other medium and long-term savings for other purposes.\n\"When life happens, and life will happen and we will have emergencies coming up, it helps us to handle those emergencies by depending on our own money rather than going into debt,\" George said.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:32:31.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
