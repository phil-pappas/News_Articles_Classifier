This means that pubic debts have dropped to 83 billion Ghana cedis, as at July this year, from 95 billion Ghana cedis in June. \nGhana is thus hovering in and out of being a Highly Indebted Country. The Ministry of Finance remains confident of managing the debt levels. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) fears Ghana would breach the 70% mark by December 2015 if debt levels informed partly by borrowing and depreciation is not well managed. \nGhana is under an IMF program to inject some discipline into the management of finances following years of reckless expenditures leading to a budget deficit of 12% in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:28:08.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
