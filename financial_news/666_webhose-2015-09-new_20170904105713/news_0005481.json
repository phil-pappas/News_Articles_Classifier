Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jessica Gardner Pharmaxis was still reeling from a shock rejection of its cystic fibrosis drug Bronchitol by US drug regulators when Gary Phillips took charge in March 2013.\nAmid a frantic search for cash, the former chief operating officer also had to make some tough decisions about the kind of Pharmaxis needed to be if it were to survive.\n\"There was a strong sense during that period that we were clearly fighting for our lives and we had a limited amount of time to put everything in place,\" he says. \"As a CEO I had to, whilst at the same time as making people redundant, keep the people that were still in the company believing.\"\nPhillips says the key to keeping his 60 staff motivated, as they watched 100 of their peers leave, was to be as transparent as possible about his escape strategy, which was all about reducing risk.\nThe new Pharmaxis will avoid taking a drug all the way from lab bench to prescription pad. Instead for new drugs it will complete just the first of the standard three stages for clinical trials, which is generally when a drug is tested in healthy subjects for safety. For phase two and three trials, where a drug is tested in patients suffering the disease in question, Pharmaxis will get bigger partners to do the work.\nThe first of these kind of deals was signed in March. German pharmaceutical outfit Boehringer Ingelheim International made a $41 million downpayment to Pharmaxis for the right to take a drug targeting fatty liver disease, which is common among diabetics and obese people, off the Sydney-based company. Pharmaxis is in line for another $80 million as Boehringer starts phase two and three trials and could earn royalties if and when the drug is finally approved and put on sale.\nThe company's 12 scientists are focused on early trials three other drug candidates – another also targeting fatty liver disease, one for scarring of lung tissue, and a possible treatment for diseases that result from neuroinflammation like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\nBut for Phillips' new model to work he also had to sort out the remaining Bronchitol problems too. He outsourced a second attempt at the US approval process, as well as handing European distribution for the drug to Italian company Chiesi. The two agreements mean Pharmaxis can earn royalties but does not have to stump up for the expensive regulatory hurdle, nor for building up sales and marketing expertise. \"We have still got a piece of the future but we got rid of all the cash that it was going to take to get us to that future,\" he says.\n Costs more than halved Annual cash costs have more than halved from over $30 million. \"We've built a new small company,\" he says from the sparsely populated Chatswood laboratory and office.\nThe new model removes some risk for Pharmaxis, but also dampens the possible rewards. Its success also relies on choosing the right partners, because Pharmaxis signs over significant control. Phillips denies it limits the ability to build a big company. \"So long as you're working in attractive markets where industry wants to see new [candidates], then the potential for building a significant business … is always there.\"\nPhillips has taken heart from San Francisco-based specialist biotechnology fund BVF Partners, which this month increased its stake to 13 per cent. \"Having them on board is a sign that people who understand the business model get what we're trying to do and think we're a good prospect,\" he says.\nBVF may be well-timed to benefit from Phillips' new plan, but he will have to sign many more deals before long-suffering shareholders are back in the black. After listing at 50¢ a share in 2003, Pharmaxis traded at 22¢ on Monday, well down on an all-time high of $4.45 in October 2007. But Phillips is upbeat. \"There is a lot of value points within our grasp now compared with where we were 12 months ago.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+JessicaGardner1", "https://twitter.com/jessigardner"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:08:36.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
