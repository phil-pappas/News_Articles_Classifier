The WEF’s flagship report said Britain’s ability to draw top talent from abroad through its universities and burgeoning digital economy meant the country could “count on a well educated workforce”. “The country has created a good set of conditions for its vibrant service sector to develop and for London to become the epicenter of the European tech and start-up scene,” the WEF said. However, its global competitiveness report said Britain’s broad improvement this year was smaller than its peers, and the country slipped down a place to 10th in 2015. The WEF said poor maths and science skills remained a “long-term problem” for the UK , while Britain’s stubbornly high deficit and debt ratios placed it 108th out of 140 countries. Switzerland, which was ranked the most competitive country for the seventh consecutive year, was praised by the WEF for its world-class research institutions and high spending on research and development. Singapore was ranked the second most competitive country, followed by the US and Germany, while Sweden’s top education system and high rank for innovation helped it to leapfrog the UK into ninth place. However, the report said there were “worrying signs” that a “new normal” of lower growth was emerging . The UK performed better than many other advanced economies “Seven years after the global financial crisis, the world economy is evolving against the background of the “new normal” of lower economic growth, lower productivity growth, and high unemployment. \"Although overall prospects remain positive, growth is expected to remain below the levels recorded in previous decades in most developed economies and in many emerging markets,” the report said. The WEF urged policymakers to implement “productivity-enhancing reforms” to avoid low growth becoming entrenched. A spokesman for the UK government said: “Today’s figures show that the UK remains one of the top 10 best places in the world to start and grow a business. Our focus is firmly fixed on increasing productivity.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T07:06:51.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
