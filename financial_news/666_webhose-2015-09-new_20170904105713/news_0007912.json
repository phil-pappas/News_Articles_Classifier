Accenture, which has been providing the RSLDC with strategic project-management support, recently helped develop and implement an information technology system for real-time monitoring of the organization’s work to build skills and reduce unemployment in Rajasthan. The two-year effort has supported RSDLC’s goal of closing the skills gaps and reducing unemployment in concert with national skills-training and placement service providers. Accenture is also providing action plans to help RSLDC build a stronger skill development ecosystem in Rajasthan. “This association with RSLDC marks Accenture’s first foray into the skills and livelihood space at the state level in India,” said Sanjeev Gupta, managing director of Accenture’s Health & Public Service practice in India. “Our deep experience with training systems, broad range of work for other government agencies in India, and prior involvement with other skill councils provided a solid foundation to implement this project.” Shri Gaurav Goyal, managing director of the RSLDC, said “This partnership with Accenture has helped us advance our objective of implementing appropriate and innovative strategies to promote and facilitate, on a large scale, improved livelihoods for the poor and vulnerable members of society. India’s quest to become a highly influential nation globally requires that the right framework be developed and put in place.” Learn more about Accenture and Delivering Public Service for the Future .
