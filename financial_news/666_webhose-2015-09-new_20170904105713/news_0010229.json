Freiku \nKumasi — A business executive has criticised the issuance of Roadworthy Certificates by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) as a condition for vehicles to ply on the roads, and called for its suspension until the roads are safe. \nMr. Patrick Adu-Gyamfi has stated that it is not relevant to issue roadworthy certificates in the face of the dangerous nature of our roads. He has, therefore, called for the suspension of the Roadworthy Certificate, and asked Parliament to seriously consider an amendment of NRSC Act 567 of 1999, to ensure that attention is given to improving the roads. \n\"It is time politicians fight for the rights of the citizenry,\" he stressed. The debate of the advocate is that one acquires a brand new vehicle at $60,000, and is required to get a Roadworthy Certificate, without which it cannot run on the roads, which are in themselves very deplorable. \nHe said supposing this vehicle owner acquires the certificate and plies the Kumasi-Kenyasi road, for instance, the vehicle depreciates in condition, and sometimes breaks down. \"How worthy are the roads then for which we must get the Roadworthy Certificate?\" he queried. \nMr. Adu-Gyamfi, Chief Executive Officer of Century Investments Limited in Kumasi, noted that instead of the state agencies addressing the dangerous nature of our roads, which is a major cause of accidents, they are much more interested in sanctions and tyre-related accidents. \nHe blamed the relevant agencies for not helping to educate the public and keeping the government on its toes, regarding the rights of the public on the roads, and called lawyers to help in the redefinition of the role of NRSC to include improving the state of our roads. \nMr. Patrick Adu-Gyamfi said the continued issuance of Road Safety Certificates by the DVLA is nothing, but an exploitation of vehicle importers, owners and drivers. The National Road Safety Commission is a state agency promulgated by an Act of Parliament NRSC Act 567 of 1999, which is responsible for road safety education and promotion in Ghana. \nIt is mandated to provide strategic leadership for developing and implementing interventions and counter measures towards the sustainable management of road safety in Ghana. \nIn collaboration with other state agencies like MTTU, DVLA, GHA, Departments of Feeder Roads and Urban Roads, the NRSC, which comes directly under the Ghana Police Service, also provides road safety activities and uses funds it receives to expand and implement road safety programmes. \nMr. Adu-Gyamfi also wondered how the Road Fund, under the Ghana Road Fund Act of 1997, which is to finance routine and periodic maintenance of roads in the country, is being put to use in the maintenance of the roads. \nAccording to him, the Fund is not responsive to the rehabilitation of deplorable roads in the country. He noted the Ghana Road Fund, which funds and sustains 60% of national road maintenance, has generated GH¢1.21 billion from 2000 to 2011, and that in spite of the payment of $110 million into the Ghana Road Fund annually, since 2005, road maintenance is still a problem. \nIn Ghana, the main source of financing road development and maintenance are the Road Fund, the Consolidated Fund and development partners like the World Bank, European Union and the African Development Bank. About GH¢322.1 million has been projected to be accrued by the Ghana Road Fund this year. As at March 2015, the Road Fund carried forward over GH¢230.86 million indebtedness from 2014. \nAgainst these accruals from the Ghana Road Fund annually, Mr. Adu-Gyamfi, who is also the Bekwai NPP Constituency Chairman, has criticised the inconsistency in the use of the Road Fund to fund and sustain road maintenance, and called on the government and Parliament to give priority to maintenance of our roads. \nHe said that until the worthiness of the roads is guaranteed for the safety of vehicles which ply on them, it would be exploitation on the part of the government, via its collaborating agencies, to require Roadworthy Certificates for vehicles.
