The new program, called SEEDS, provides tools to communicate the true business impact of PrismHR to PEO and ASO clients. SEEDS includes templated content, including datasheets and demos, to help market and sell PrismHR enabled services. SEEDS is open to all sales and marketing professionals and executives of any PrismHR customer.\n“Our customers have asked for sales and marketing support and we’re thrilled to deliver the SEEDS program today,” said Gary Noke, President and CEO, PrismHR. “The launch of SEEDS is a first step to help our customers prosper, not just through great technology, but also through innovative programs that enable them to accelerate their growth. We’re devoting significant resources to this program and it is yet another example of our commitment to help our customers improve their businesses.”\n“PEOs and ASOs are seeing increased competition for their prospects and customers, and how you position technology within the sales process is critical to winning new business,” commented Ray Dile, Principal, Pathway Strategies. “Every PEO can improve how they communicate the business value of technology, and this new offering will quickly become required education for PrismHR customers to help improve close ratios and acquire new clients.”\n“SEEDS is a key resource to fuel our growth. We are experts in selling HR services, not technology,” noted Doug Snowman, President, Payplans and Benefits. “The content and resources from SEEDS will significantly streamline and simplify our sales and marketing, while also increasing its effectiveness.”\nSEEDS is currently free for all PrismHR customers.
