The prospect of a U.S interest rate rise has also weighed on equity markets, and Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen said late on Thursday that she expects the U.S. central bank to begin raising interest rates later this year as long as inflation remains stable and the U.S. economy is strong enough to boost employment. Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open up by 59-69 points, or 1-1.2 percent higher. Germany's DAX was seen opening up by 119-143 points, or 1.3-1.5 percent higher, while France's CAC 40 was seen up by 53 points, or 1.2 percent higher. Volkswagen shares will be in focus again in the wake of the company's U.S. emissions test rigging scandal. Volkswagen will name Matthias Mueller, the head of its Porsche sports car brand, as its chief executive, a source close to the matter said on Thursday. California was also preparing a major enforcement action against Volkswagen over its admitted cheating on tailpipe emissions tests.
