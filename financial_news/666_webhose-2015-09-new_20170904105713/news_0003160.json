My visit will not only help to strengthen our partnership with the country, but it will also enable me to see firsthand how the country has steadily put in place plans to control the Ebola epidemic and to support the post-Ebola recovery,\" Ms. Lagarde, IMF Managing Director intoned ahead of visit to Liberia. \nMeanwhile, the IMF has provided Liberia up to US$130 Million through various arrangements to brace the nation's resilience and the well-coordinated leadership provided by the government to fight the Ebola Virus Disease.
