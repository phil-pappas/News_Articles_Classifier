It already drew down a $400m facility amid talks with bankers to restructure debt, two people familiar with the matter said this month. Lonmin may cut as many as 6,000 jobs and annual output by 100,000 ounces, the company said in July.\n\"The priority for banks and equity holders to bail out a platinum company must be pretty low at this point,\" Ben Davis, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital, said by phone from London on Wednesday.\n\"It’s going to be pretty tough for them unless the platinum price increases miraculously.\"\nLonmin fell as much as 5.3% and was down 1.3% at 18.75p by 12.52pm in London. It is the year’s worst performer on the FTSE all share index of equities.\nIn Johannesburg, where the company has a secondary listing, the stock has declined by 87% in 2015.\n\"One cannot see how banks or shareholders will support them if they cannot stop the cash-burn,\" Hurbey Geldenhuys, a mining analyst at Vunani Securities in Johannesburg, said by phone.\nJames Clark, a spokesman for Lonmin at Cardew Group in London, wasn’t immediately able to comment when contacted by phone and said the company may respond later on Wednesday.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=LON"], "published": "2015-09-24T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:48:24.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
