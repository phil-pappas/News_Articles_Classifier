The bank sees the effects of a weaker currency and some sector-specific factors as temporarily boosting the core rate.\nPrices were up on an annual basis in seven of the eight major components of the overall consumer price index.\nFood saw the biggest increase, with prices up 3.6 percent compared to August of last year. Meat prices jumped 6.3 percent.\nBut gasoline prices continued to drop and were down 12.6 percent annually. The transportation component, which includes gasoline, was the only main segment to decline.
