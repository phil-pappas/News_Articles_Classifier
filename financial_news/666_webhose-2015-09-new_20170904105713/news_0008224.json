Yuantong Express holds a 90% stake (with a CNY360 million investment) while Yuantong Express chairman Yu Huijiao and vice chairman Zhang Xiaojuan each hold a 5% share (with a CNY20 million investment, respectively).\nYuantong Airlines is expected to operate three Boeing737-300 freighters initially—one has been put into formal operation while the second and the third aircraft are scheduled to be introduced in November and December.\nOver the past five years, China’s domestic express delivery market has experienced an annual growth rate of more than 30%. However, domestic carriers operate fewer than 120 freighters; only a small number are used for the express delivery market as China’s air cargo service mainly relies on using the bellyhold of passenger aircraft.\nShunfeng Express and EMS have already launched their own cargo carriers to explore the fast-growing market potential. Shunfeng Express operates a fleet of more than 30 freighters and EMS owns a fleet of more than 20 freighters.\nTianjin-based Okay Airways also plans to launch its own cargo carrier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:25:41.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
