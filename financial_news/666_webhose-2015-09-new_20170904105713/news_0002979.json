Commonwealth Bank fell 2.1 per cent to $75.13, Westpac Banking Corporation fell 3.3 per cent to $30.76, ANZ Banking Group shed 3.1 per cent to $27.65, and National Australia Bank fell 3.5 per cent to $30.18.\n\"The banks are actually underperforming the miners, or at least doing just as badly, and this is an interesting dynamic that has been playing out the past few months,\" Mr Boey said.\nThe turnaround on the ASX was mirrored around Asia, with all the major bourses, except Korea's, falling.\nFed still on investors' minds The Asian markets were excited by the prospect of fiscal stimulus from Japan on Wednesday, with the Nikkei soaring almost 8 per cent, but the looming themes of US rate rises and slowing regional growth overwhelmed the buoyant mood on Thursday.\n\"The market had put aside Fed interest rate concerns, but the strong economic data in the US proves the issue is still very much alive,\" AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said. \"That has caused a rethink around Asia today.\"\n\"We are still in this fickle period, the underlying issues regarding Chinese growth and what the Fed will do are still driving markets day to day,\" Dr Oliver said.\nThe stronger jobs data in the US were second order and usually not closely watched, he added.\n\"Investor horizons have shrunk back to a very short-term focus.\"\nBetter than expected Australian jobs data also confused investors, as federal Treasurer Joe Hockey had prepared the market for the worst, Mr Boey said.\nMr Hockey warned changes to unemployment benefits could skew the numbers substantially higher.\nBut they came in at 6.2 per cent, \"well above downtrodden expectations, and the market didn't know what to do with that\", Mr Boey said. A meagre attempt at a rally after the data was released quickly faded.\nDefensive stocks were no refuge on Thursday – Woolworths fell 2.2 per cent to $24.76 and Wesfarmers lost 1.8 per cent to $39.42. Telstra lost 2.9 per cent to $5.62.\nJust nine stocks recorded gains for the day, including vet chain Greencross, up 2.6 per cent, and aged care provider Japara, up 2.2 per cent.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/china-cpi-rises-but-producer-prices-tumble-most-in-six-years-20150910-gjjas9.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-the-big-payback-20150909-gjj3r5.html"], "published": "2015-09-10T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:09:54.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
