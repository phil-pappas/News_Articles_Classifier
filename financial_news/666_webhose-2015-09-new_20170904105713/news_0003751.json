( SSRI ) ( SSO.TO ) (\"Silver Standard\") announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") to acquire 2,844 hectares contiguous with our Marigold mine in Nevada (the \"Valmy Property\") for $11.5 million from Newmont Mining Corporation ( NEM ) (\"Newmont\").\nPaul Benson, President and CEO of Silver Standard stated, \"This acquisition complements our strategy at Marigold to increase resources and add operating flexibility. Securing formerly operating open pits with exploration potential near Marigold's Mackay pit provides our team another opportunity to create value for shareholders at Marigold.\"\nTransaction Highlights\nSilver Standard will acquire 100% of Newmont's interest in a prospective land package contiguous with the Marigold mine with 196,000 ounces of historical gold production, under the terms of the Agreement.\n\nPotential to develop Mineral Resources at the Valmy and MUD deposits as well as test extensions to Marigold's Basalt pit mineralization.\n\nOpportunity to improve and expand existing Marigold mine infrastructure in support of future mining operations. Valmy Property and Exploration Program Overview\nThe Valmy Property is a 2,844 hectare land package surrounding portions of the Marigold mine to the east, south and west. The addition of the Valmy Property increases our total land holding at the Marigold mine by over 35% to 10,759 hectares. The eastern portion of the Valmy Property contains the Valmy and MUD deposits which are less than 1,000 meters east of Marigold's Mackay deposit. Due to the proximity of the Valmy Property to our existing or planned infrastructure, the additional landholding affords the opportunity for improved haul road, waste rock storage area and leach pad designs at the Marigold mine. See Appendix A for a map of the Valmy Property and the current Marigold mine.\nMining of the Valmy and MUD deposits concluded in 2005. These areas will be the initial focus of our exploration program at the Valmy Property. The Valmy pit produced 196,000 ounces gold from 6.8 million tonnes of ore at a gold grade of 0.89 g/t between 2002 and 2005, as previously reported by Newmont in 2005.\nWe intend to commence a program to validate the Valmy Property drillhole database and develop a Mineral Resources estimate . Exploration will initially target resource extension around the Valmy and MUD pit surface excavations, in addition to the higher grade Basalt pit extension. The exploration program will consist of surface geological mapping, geochemical sampling and ground geophysics to support drilling. We anticipate drilling on the Valmy Property to commence in the first quarter of 2016, subject to obtaining the requisite permits and other approvals, as part of Marigold's resource development program for 2016.\nTransaction Overview\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Silver Standard, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Marigold Mining Company, will acquire 100% of Newmont's interest in the Valmy Property for cash consideration of $11.5 million. The purchase price will be funded from cash on hand.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Under the terms of the Agreement, Silver Standard will be required to provide financial assurances to the environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the Valmy Property's long-term environmental and reclamation obligations. We expect the transaction to close in October 2015.\nQualified Persons\nThe scientific and technical data contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Thomas Rice and James Carver, each of whom is a SME Registered Member and a Qualified Person under NI 43-101 â€” Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic U.S. reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. In addition, the SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning \"Measured Mineral Resources,\" \"Indicated Mineral Resources\" or \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute \"reserves\" by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. U.S. investors should understand that \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Moreover, the requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of \"reserves\" are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by us in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as \"reserves\" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nAll figures in this news release are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nCommodity Markets Silver Standard Mineral Resources Silver Standard Resources Inc.
