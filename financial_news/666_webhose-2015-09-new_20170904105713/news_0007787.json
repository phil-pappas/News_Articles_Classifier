He just has to wait.\nTake Tony Abbott 's corporate warrior and climate change sceptic, Maurice Newman .\nHis term as chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council expires this Saturday.\nIllustration: John Shakespeare. Illustration: John Shakespeare\nThe terms of the rest of the male-dominated board expire before Christmas, but there is no doubting that it is Newman who will be top of mind for the new PM.\nAdvertisement In May, Newman dismissed global warming as a conspiracy theory and said the real agenda was a \"new world order\" led by the United Nations.\nHe received a scathing response from former NAB boss, Cameron Clyne , who criticised the \"wilful ignorance and blindness\" of political leaders and some sections of the business community.\nClyne said that he accepts the \"overwhelming\" scientific consensus that climate change poses an \"existential\" threat \"quite unlike any that we have faced before\".\nCatherine Livingstone , a former CSIRO chairman and current BAC board member, could send a powerful message as its new chair.\n\"The Business Council of Australia (BCA) congratulates Mr Malcolm Turnbull on being elected as Prime Minister and welcomes the strong messages he has sent about building lasting prosperity through a more agile, innovative and creative nation,\" said Livingstone on Tuesday, wearing her hat as BCA chairman.\nTony's Shepherd It is not the only significant change Turnbull could make without the need for a wrecking ball.\nApplications for the National Disability Insurance Agency Board close Wednesday September 16.\nAbbott's team ambushed the current board earlier this month when it advertised their positions without warning. The application form includes experience requirements that would make it near impossible for the current board to retain their positions.\nOn safer ground is Tony Shepherd , who was the chairman of the Abbott government's National Commission of Audit, but has strong connections in NSW.\nThis has delivered Shepherd a much coveted seat on the Sydney Cricket Ground & Sports Ground Trust, chairmanship of the AFL expansion team, Greater Western Sydney Giants. And he also chairs the controversial WestConnex Delivery Authority – which will be tearing up parts of Sydney to build a new motorway.\nPM's Fiat \"This is a turn of events that I did not expect,\" Malcolm Turnbull told reporters on Tuesday after his ultimate political victory. And there is one particular reason to believe him.\nThe man for whom the Lodge will be a downgrade in accommodation recently traded in his trusty eco chariot – an ageing Toyota Prius – for a fire engine red Italian steed.\nNo, our Prime Minister to-be did not chuck away his political ambitions on a Ferrari, like his doomed Liberal leader predecessor, John Hewson .\nTurnbull has traded in what he labelled a \"pretty boring\" Prius​ for a nippy Fiat 500.\nCBD's spies could not make out the model, but the fact that Turnbull handed in the keys to his Prius​ and around $16,000 cash means he has not skimped​ on his new wheels.\nWhich might be why it will not be gracing the steps of Parliament House.\nTurnbull told CBD's spy on Saturday \"I don't think I will be able to drive it to Canberra any time soon.\"\nNever mind, he still has his trusty old Volvo station wagon for that trip.\nAnd at least he won't have to lock it up, as Hewson was forced to do to his Ferrari while he campaigned to become PM.\nIn 1991, when Labor Government MPs started taunting the Ferrari-owning Hewson for being a hypocrite, the Opposition Leader replied: \"You mock the fact that I own a Ferrari – I am proud that I had the opportunity to work hard in this country and earn enough money to buy a Ferrari. What's wrong with that?\"\nHe lost the federal election to Paul Keating in 1993.\nTGI Friday Turnbull will have other things to worry about right now, including whether he should still attend the Wombat Hollow Forum this Friday as guest speaker for the event run by former Liberal party treasurer, Michael Yabsley​ .\nCEDA still has Scott Morrison as the guest speaker for their lunch at Melbourne's Sofitel this Friday, telling CBD they have been in contact with Morrison's office and he is still expected to attend \"at this stage\".\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T19:39:56.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
