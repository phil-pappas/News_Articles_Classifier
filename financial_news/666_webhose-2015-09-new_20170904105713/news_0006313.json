After a slow pick-up in the first half of the year, energy bonds again plunged in August as oil prices reached six-year lows. The DNB High-Yield Norway Total Return Hedged Index fell 4 percent in August.\nOil service companies such as rig-owner Seadrill Ltd. are delaying deliveries and others such as Aker Solutions ASA are cutting jobs to cope with slowdown. Producers including Statoil ASA are cutting investments, triggering more than 20,000 jobs cuts in western Europe’s biggest crude producer.\nEven though spreads have widened, offering larger returns for oil-related debt, DNB is keeping its negative outlook for the industry.\n“We think these relatively small oil price changes, $40 or $50 a barrel, don’t change the immediate outlook for the companies,” he said. “Many companies must restructure their debt.”\nIn August there were no new bond issues in the Norwegian high yield market. While the market is “close to impossible” for oil service companies, the primary market for other issuers is open, according to DNB.\n“At some point people must start to invest,” he said. “We have redemptions and investors get money back from bond loans maturing. We think the primary market for non-oil related high-yield will wake up again now in September, October, but it will be will be calm, not that many deals.”\n(To be sent this Nordic Credit column, click here.
