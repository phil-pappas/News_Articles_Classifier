Instead of rushing to capture some of the losses they incurred earlier this week, retail investors need to be stalwart in their purchases of individual stocks or focus on increasing their monthly allocations of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds into their 401(k) or IRA. \nReacting too quickly after a large market gain can be a foolhardy decision, because too many investors fear missing out on a rally, which proves to be a “powerful bias,” said CJ Brott, founder of Capital Ideas, a registered investment advisor in Dallas and a portfolio manager for Covestor, the online investing marketplace.
