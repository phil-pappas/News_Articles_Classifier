The logic, and tragedy, of this joke, is that bankers lend money when times are good, but when business conditions or the situation at a company gets tight, the bankers run for the hills. Ask any business banker from Citibank, JP Morgan [entity display=\"Chase\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"chase\" natural_id=\"fred/company/8931\"]Chase[/entity], or [entity display=\"Wells Fargo\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"wells-fargo\" ticker=\"WFC\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4683\"]Wells Fargo[/entity], they’ve heard this joke a million times.Just think back to the mortgage crisis a few years ago — lenders pushed out loans when the housing market was scorching, but as soon as it took a dip, they became punitive, leading to the wave of foreclosures that we’re still recovering from today.Of course, from the banker’s point of view, this is a logical course of action: anything that helps them to avoid losing money on loans is a positive. From the borrower’s point of view, though, the joke explains the frustration of losing a loan when it is needed most.But, this joke could soon be dated. As we become immersed in the new world of big data, analytics, and data supply chains, business relationships — especially new forms of relationships based on flows of data between lenders and borrowers — are going to change dramatically. A new breed of lender, not just traditional banks, will have more information about the businesses they’re lending to than ever before; likewise, businesses will have extensive details about lending practices. There will be more transparency on both sides. But as anyone who’s ever been married knows, more honesty does not always equate to more happiness. It is crucial for both businesses and lenders to start preparing for the changes now in order to facilitate satisfying relationships in the future.At the forefront of this trend are companies like Credit Junction and Kabbage . In their model, the lender gets a much richer view behind the curtains of the businesses they lend to. They aren’t just underwriting a borrower using a FICO score that substitutes for a deeper understanding, they’re getting a real time view of the borrower’s business — a view that can reveal previously invisible strengths or problems.The basis for this detailed view is a real time flow of information from the borrower to the lender. For example, [entity display=\"Kabbage\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"kabbage\" natural_id=\"fred/company/101948\"]Kabbage[/entity], which has lent more than $1 billion to small businesses, says that it gathers information from data sources, which include [entity display=\"Intuit\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"intuit\" ticker=\"INTU\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2236\"]Intuit[/entity] QuickBooks, eBay, PayPal, Amazon, Authorize.net, relevant shipping data, and so on. Both Kabbage and Credit Junction don’t just collect information at the time of underwriting, but gather it in a continuous flow. While traditional banks do get updates on underwriting information during the term of a loan, this new breed of data-powered lender creates a rich model of a business that is updated continuously.This detailed model will illuminate strengths and weaknesses of a business. Good news about increasing sales, reduced expenses, and early payment of invoices will flow faster. On the other hand, lenders will be able to identify cash flow problems, see when a business is over-leveraged, or get immediate updates about falling sales. That’s obviously great for lenders, but if those insights are used only to justify pulling loans, relationships will quickly fray. If lenders repeatedly pull loans at the first sign a business is struggling, other borrowers will see that the data flows are a one-way street and will refuse to work with those lenders.The worst case for Kabbage and Credit Junction would be if the limited information of the current model, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” attitude about sharing the details of a business, turns out to be better for borrowers.For these new lenders to win, transparency must have an upside. Kabbage and Credit Junction must show benefits to sharing more data with respect to offering better credit terms, lending to borrowers now shut out of the process, or other advantages yet to be discovered. Lenders need to use the additional data to create an intimate understanding of borrower that is predicated as much on support as retribution. If increased data flows are truly mutually beneficial for borrowers and lenders, the data should indicate that some loans warrant more patience than they would have gotten in the past.Lenders will face less risk because of data. More knowledge means less uncertainty. They’ll be able to better predict which loans are too risky to make and which ones need to adjusted. However, it is key that lenders use this intimacy to remain engaged. Instead of running at the first sign of trouble, they must use data to help a business avoid potential challenges and weather the storm, perhaps with a new generation of value-added services, in which case both borrower and lender benefit in the long-term.Borrowers could also profit from increased transparency if they have greater access benchmarking data showing the terms other businesses are receiving, as well as the lender's historical peformance. The market will become more responsive, with borrowers better able to compare rates industry-wide. Lenders could also be incentivized to avoid being too punitive, as borrowers will factor in lending history when choosing a bank. It would be hard to argue that lenders should not become more transparent if borrowers are asked to be.Ultimately, what will be most beneficial to all parties is for loans to more accurately reflect the business’ standing. Flexibility will be key: loans can be adjusted over time to reflect current market conditions. If lenders are strategic, when a sound business suddenly struggles, instead of pulling the loan completely, they can adjust the rate to hedge for risk, while still providing support. Borrowers will get the umbrella they need — and a poncho to go with it. Big data will reduce the guesswork involved in the loan process. For Credit Junction and Kabbage to change the world of business banking, borrowers and lenders working together must find a way embrace this transparency so that everybody wins.Follow Dan Woods on Twitter: Follow @danwoodsearly Dan Woods is on a mission to help people find the technology they need to succeed.
