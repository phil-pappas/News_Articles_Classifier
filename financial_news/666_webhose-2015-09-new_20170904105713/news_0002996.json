Today, there is a lot of interest in the segment from the Indian investment community. \n\"We have to restructure ourself so that within 18 months we are able to launch the bank hopefully,\" he said. \nAnother player who emerged successful -- Janalakshmi Financial Services -- said that it would create the right legal structure to be able to ensure that it complies with all the conditions that the RBI has laid down. \n\"Our intention is to convert Janalakshmi into a bank and create a structure that the RBI has suggested under the universal bank category,\" said VS Radhakrishnan, the CEO of the Bengaluru-based micro-finance institution. \nThe licences were issued after a preliminary scrutiny of all the applications involving prima facie eligibility, including the ability to raise the minimum initial capital and the status of ownership and control by residents as per the guidelines, was carried out by the RBI team. \nThe findings of the preliminary scrutiny were presented to an External Advisory Committee (EAC) constituted under the chairmanship of Usha Thorat, former deputy governor, RBI. \nAs per the guidelines, a Small Finance Bank will primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved and under-served sections, including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganised sector entities. \nSuch entities can operate across the country as there is no area of restriction. \nHowever, at least 50% of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to Rs 25 lakh. \nThe Small Finance Bank will be subject to all prudential norms and regulations of RBI as applicable to existing commercial banks, including requirement of maintenance of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). \nThese banks would not enjoy any forbearance from complying with the statutory provisions. They have to follow the norms for scheduled commercial banks. \nAs far as foreign shareholding is concerned, this would be as per the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for private sector banks as amended from time to time. \nCurrently, private banks are allowed foreign investment of 74%.
