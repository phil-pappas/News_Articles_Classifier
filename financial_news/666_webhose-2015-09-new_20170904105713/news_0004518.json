In its 2013 fiscal year, the company said 36 percent of the employees in the unit of HPE called enterprise services worked in what it called low-cost locations. This year 42 percent do, and executives said they plan to increase that percentage to 60 percent by 2018.\nIn its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, HP’s revenue from personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent.\nOf the units to be housed in HPE, which will be run by Whitman, sales in enterprise services dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent.\nHPE will have revenue of more than $50 billion, and is expected to report adjusted profit of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2016, HP said on Tuesday.\nThe business is expected to report free cash flow of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.\nHP shares fell 1.4 percent to $26.73 in extended trading on Tuesday after the news.\nMaxim Group analyst Nehal Chokshi blamed the market reaction on the cash flow target, which he said looked short of the contribution needed from the enterprise unit to meet analysts’ forecasts.\nLate Tuesday, the company also released financial projections for HP Inc, the PC and printer businesses. Saying it expects the market for those products to remain tough for the “next several quarters,” it forecast 2016 earnings for HP Inc to be between $1.67 to $1.77 per share, excluding items.\nThe business is expected to report free cash flow of $3 billion to $3.3 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.\n 16, 2015 8:40 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:07:52.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
