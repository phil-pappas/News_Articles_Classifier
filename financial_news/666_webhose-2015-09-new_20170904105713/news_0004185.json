Wines such as Henschke Hill of Grace Shiraz are also revered by collectors around the globe.\nAustralia also is renowned in international circles for its extraordinary history of aged fortified wines from the Victoria’s northeast Rutherglen region, and its capacity for Hunter Valley Semillon to age for many years to deliver one of the most unique white wine styles.\n Penfolds Grange 1971 named best wine", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/09/1227519/372929-772eb81c-5698-11e5-ade8-2efb76e8d469.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/penfolds-grange-1971-best-wine-in-world-award-will-turn-world-on-to-australias-finest-wines/story-fneuz92c-1227519370201", "https://www.penfolds.com/heritage-and-winemaking/penfolds-winemakers/peter-gago", "https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/DM_912945/penfolds-grange-1971", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_wine#Marketing"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:20:33.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
