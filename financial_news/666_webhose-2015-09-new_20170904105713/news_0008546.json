It is estimated that there are over 10,000 rooms and apartments being made available for short-term rental across Sydney, many of which are operated as commercial businesses without the requisite permits. This is not good for future investors.\"\nAside from the short-term rental issues, the Pontiac deal comes as the hotel industry is riding high, with more than $4.2 billion in hotels transacting in the 12 months to June 2105, up 107 per cent on the previous 12 months.\nAccording to Savills, the Australian hotel market continues to be dominated by overseas investors, who bought 54 per cent of hotel assets sold in the 12 months to June 2015, for $2.7 billion.\nSavills Hotels valuations and consultancy director, Adrian Archer, said that this could be higher, with another 25 per cent comprising private investors whose geographic origin is undisclosed.\nSavills Hotels managing director Michael Simpson said the numbers were not surprising. \"Australia remains to be a safe investment destination due to its strong banking system, consistent and transparent investment market, relative legislative certainty, low cost of debt and strong real estate investment yields,\" Mr Simpson said.\nThe low Australian dollar, rapid growth of inbound tourism and increased business confidence has led to an increase in the average hotel room rates across Australia by 3.7 per cent, with both Sydney and Melbourne being the standout performers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:21:52.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
