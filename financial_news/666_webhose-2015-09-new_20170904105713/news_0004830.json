House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) held a press conference Friday, hours after he stunned Washington by announcing he would resign from Congress at the end of October . \nBoehner said he decided Friday morning that this would be the day he would resign. \n\" I decided today's the day I'm going to do this. It's as simple as that,\" Boehner said, tearing up at several points during the press conference. \nBoehner had planned to retire last year. His calculus was changed, however, by the unexpected Republican primary loss of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a close Boehner ally whose 2014 defeat shocked Washington. But amid rising tension within the caucus, he decided now was the right time. \"This prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable harm to the institution,\" Boehner said. \nBoehner announced the decision in a House Republican caucus meeting Friday morning, in which Republicans discussed a strategy going forward with a possible government shutdown looming at the end of the month. \nBoehner's most likely replacement is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California). Boehner stopped short of endorsing McCarthy, but did say he'd be an \"excellent speaker.\" He said he had to tell McCarthy five times that he was resigning because he didn't believe him. \nBoehner's speakership has been marked by constant tension with the conservative wing of the House Republican caucus. That pressure has intensified lately — Rep. Mark Meadows (R-North Carolina) in July filed a motion to force the speaker to vacate his post. \nMore to come...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:37:04.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
