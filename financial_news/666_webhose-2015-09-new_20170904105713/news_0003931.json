Getty Images by Bloomberg News Vale pushed back against claims steel consumption in China has peaked, saying demand in the top user still has some way to go in a view that contrasts with a rising number of global banks.\n\"China's steel consumption peak is still ahead of us but of course the growth will be much more gradual,\" said Claudio Alves, global director of ferrous marketing and sales. Vale aimed to boost its market share, he said.\nThe largest miners are seeking to figure out the implications of slowing growth in China on demand for everything from iron to copper. While Vale's view echoes outlooks from Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group brought forward its peak-steel estimate to 2014 from 2020 and Credit Suisse Group said local consumption will shrink 10 per cent by 2018. Citigroup warned Tuesday commodities may see further losses amid excess supplies and a sluggish global economy.\n\"Despite the slowdown of the growth speed, China still remains the economic engine of the world,\" Alves said in written remarks sent to Bloomberg before the start of a conference in Qingdao. Further urbanisation and infrastructure projects will underpin demand for iron ore, steel, copper and other base metals, according to Alves.\nIron ore sank in July to the lowest in at least six years as the three largest producers including Brazil's Vale raised low-cost supply even as demand growth stalled in China. A private factory gauge in China on Wednesday showed further weakness, dropping to the lowest since 2009. Ore with 62 per cent content delivered to Qingdao retreated 22 per cent this year to $US55.30 a dry ton on Wednesday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd.\nChina's crude-steel output will rise to about 1 billion metric tons by 2030, Rio Asia president of iron ore Alan Smith told the conference, reaffirming the company's outlook. Global steel demand ex-China will climb to about 1.5 billion tons by 2030 from 920 million tons, Smith said.\nChinese steel demand has plateaued at about 800 million tons, Nev Power, chief executive officer of Fortescue Metals Group said in an interview. Any rise beyond that will probably be driven by stimulus, infrastructure and property development growth, he said. Australia's third-largest producer is holding shipments at 165 million tons a year, Power reiterated on Tuesday.\nPeak-steel consumption in China occurred last year on a property downturn, ANZ said in a note on Monday, reducing price forecasts for iron ore for next year and 2017. Demand may contract to 695 million tons in 2018 from 773.7 million tons in 2013, Credit Suisse said in a report the same day.\n \"We expect moderate but sustainable growth in Chinese steel production over the next decade,\" BHP said in its annual report on Wednesday, citing steel stock per capita that's below the level in developed nations. \"In line with our expectations, the economy is growing more slowly as it matures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:04:32.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
