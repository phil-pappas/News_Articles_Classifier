How one's retirement is funded has a lot to do with the level of enjoyment and financial security that people have in their retirement.\nCanadians are blessed to have a plethora of ways to save for and create income in their retirement. These include government and employer pensions, Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), retirement income portfolio products and, for business owners, Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) and self-payment strategies.\nThe expectations of Canadians who are not yet retired are somewhat at odds with some of the realities of retirement highlighted in a recent report by the Angus Reid Institute.\nFor example, 72 per cent of Canadians who are not yet retired expect to work into their 60s even though 45 per cent of them would prefer to retire at age 55.\nNon-retired Canadians also tend to have a more pessimistic view of their financial security in retirement. Only 24 per cent expect to have enough money to do everything they want in retirement compared to 38 per cent of those who are currently retired and 28 per cent expect to be struggling to make ends meets versus 18 per cent of current retirees who reported having this problem.\nThose who are not yet retired also have different perspectives about what will be their primary financial support in retirement. Fewer of those not yet retired expect to rely on either a government and/or work pension as their primary source of income in retirement. Non-retirees say they are much more likely to rely on their own savings for retirement than those already retired.\n\"Underlying the trepidation many non-retired are feeling, a fair number said they expect to at least partly finance their retirement through downsizing assets and inheritance or family support,\" the report found.\nA recent report by Investors Group found that 40 per cent of Canadians are working with a financial adviser develop a financial plan and they appear to have a better grasp of their plans than those who are doing it on their own.\nThe Angus Reid report also looked at the overall satisfaction of life after work and what makes life meaningful and vital.\nFor retirees, quality of time with family, travel, rest and relaxation, participating in leisure activities, socializing with friend, volunteering, a rich spiritual life and part-time paid work were priorities.\nNon-retirees identified similar priorities when asked what they thought would enrich their retirement but were more likely to highlight travel and family time and less likely to single out socializing with friends and volunteering.\nHealth concerns cast a shadow on the retirement experience of both retired and non-retired Canadians alike. While many Canadians protect their loved ones by investing in life insurance, fewer consider critical illness and long-term care insurance as part of their financial plan even though the chances of becoming seriously ill and surviving are far greater than the sudden loss of life.\n\"Insurance is not a sexy investment - the decision can be emotional and the idea of it brings about visions that conflict with the future we see for ourselves,\" says Tim Cottee, vice-president of Retiree Planning with Investors Group. \"It is, however, protection against your future that can rid you of the 'what if' worries and allow you to live out the retirement you had planned if the unexpected happens.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:37:27.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
