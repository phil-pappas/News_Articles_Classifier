The new Dawn is the convertible version of company's smaller (but hardly small) platform, on which the four-door Ghost and two-door Wraith is built. This huge four-seater open top is powered by a 6.6-litre twin turbo V12 and weighs an extraordinary 2560 kilograms.\nIn launching the Dawn, the company's CEO, Torsten Müller-Ötvös, rather obtrusively described it as \"the most social of super-luxury drophead motor cars for those who wish to bathe in the sunlight of the world's most exclusive social hotspots\" before adding, \"Quite simply, it is the sexiest Rolls-Royce ever built.\"\nTaylor insists that although the newcomer is built around the Wraith's package, with two front-opening \"coach doors\", it isn't merely \"a Wraith with a roof cut off\".\nGilesTaylor, director of design, Rolls-Royce. \"It has a different character. The new car is very unique in its road presence and its gesture. It deserved its own name.\"\nAs for Project Cullinan – which may well be unveiled at the next Frankfurt Show (in 2017) – Taylor says it needs to be large with huge presence, without usurping the position of the brand's flagship Phantom limousine. \"There is no doubt that when that vehicle pulls into the hotel lobby in Beverly Hills and there is a Range Rover in the hotel already, that [ours] is the king of the heap. If not, then we have missed the brief completely.\n\"All we have to do is curate the line values to a new proportion. That's the challenge: to make that wheelbase a bit shorter, the vehicle length a bit shorter, then go up and still create the elegance.\"\nThe Cullinan vehicle will certainly be tall, he confirms. It has to be because the brand's flagship Phantom sedan is already as tall as a small/mid-size SUV, so this has to be higher again. \"We would never do a conventional SUV,\" says Taylor. \"The clear feedback from our customer base … is if I have the Rolls-Royce I will use that vehicle to go to the airport with my Louis Vuitton luggage, I will go to Saint Moritz skiing … so make sure you give me the space and I'll use it.\n \"Its premise is high drive practicality, whether it is the school run or sitting high in traffic and seeing over the top of the cars in front, that's a big demand we see for customer benefit.\"\nThere is the obvious question about whether, just because the new Rolls is big and SUV-like, it needs to be four-wheel drive. Will anyone really take it off-road? There are two reasons Taylor says it definitely will have 4WD. The first is the concept he describes as \"permission to own\". He says people shouldn't need to apologise for having bought it for symbolic value. In other words, it must have huge power and off-road ability if it is to be accepted by non-owners as something other than an indulgence.\nThe second reason is this: Taylor describes a scenario in a wet, grassy carpark at the Badminton Horse Trials. Everyone is watching, and \"his\" car, possibly with a trailer, is having a problem driving up the slope, while a Range Rover breezes past. \"That\", he insists with a flourish, \"will never happen.\"\nHe hinted too that the new vehicle may not have a conventional Rolls nose. \"The Parthenon grille is very important, but … it isn't it and only it.\"\nLots going on There is plenty else happening at Rolls-Royce, including the surprising revival of some older trends, such as pinstripe tyres. Why? \"The key thing is diameter,\" says Taylor. \"From a pure visual value, we are taking the immediate diameter read of the wheel from the metal bit to the outer pin stripe.\n\"It gives this sense of stance. Stance comes from wheels, and the relation of body to wheels and the overhangs. For us it just makes the car a little more seated, with a little bit more of a performance read.\"\nThe glamour associated with whitewalls goes back to 1920s and 1930s America; pinstripes are meant to capture that with a more contemporary feel.\nWhat about rear wheel spats then? Could we see them again? \"Maybe. I love that spatted 1930s elegance … but it doesn't quite work yet with the current range of cars.\n\"If you look at the classic 1930s Delahayes and Delages, the lines take you to a covered taper around the rear wheels.\" Since the current Rolls-Royces aren't designed for spats, Taylor says, adding them makes the rear look horribly heavy.\nAnother retro-trend finding its way into Rolls-Royces is solid colours with \"heritage resonance\".\n\"I'm talking putty – a grey with a pink value – there are also the sage greens which you will find in some of the Wraiths from the 1950s, and then we have primrose yellows – solid yellows with a very strong pastels tone which occurred on some of the pre-war Rollses … and some of the minty blues which are a bit Audrey Hepburn Tiffany, but you can update them.\"\nAnother major challenge is an all-new flagship, already well under way. Giles says \"we have softened any sense of arrogance or bombast\".\n\"It has a stylish level of elegance because it has movement to the line. That is something I would like to bring to the design language of future Rolls-Royces: a little bit more movement so the car looks it isn't quite so monolithic.\n\"The current car is beautifully executed and has served us well, but I'd like to bring a bit more movement, a bit more fluidity to the notion of travel, to the direction of travel.\"\nFACT BOX Price: More than $645,000 (current Wraith price)\nEngine: 6.6-litre twin turbo V12 (petrol)\nPower/torque: 420 kW/780 Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 14.2 L/100 km\nC02: 330 grams per kilometre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:05:17.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
