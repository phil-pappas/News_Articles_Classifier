Generally, investors who are more involved with their portfolios and enjoy investing are more likely to switch advisors than those who don't have the time or interest to follow the market, says a new report from Spectrum Group. Overall, 58% of high-net worth investors have fired their financial advisor at least once, while 23% have dropped the hammer on their financial planners within the past five years. The reasons for switching financial advisors , or dropping one altogether, vary among investors. But trust is always a cornerstone issue, and not showing a certain amount of respect is a red flag for a financial advisor. \"I was shopping for a financial advisor, and after I told the gentleman my job was running my own business and that I was married, he immediately assumed I worked for my husband who ran the business,\" says Lisa Parmley, founder of Patent Education Series, a publishing company in Denver.\"But it's actually my business I started before I ever met my husband. That was a good sign he wasn't the right advisor for me.\" Not listening to a client's concerns is another big red flag for investors. \"When you get a sneaking sense that your financial advisor is recommending specific products that aren't necessarily the best fit for your needs, but pay them higher commissions, it's time to move on,\" says Gregg Ward, chief executive officer at Gregg Ward Group, a management consulting group in San Diego, Calif. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:41:36.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
