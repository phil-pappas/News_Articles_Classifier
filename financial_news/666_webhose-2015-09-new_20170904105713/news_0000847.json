Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston One of China's top 500 companies, Fullshare Group, is betting on a rising market in Queensland's north with the launch of $15 million worth apartments and penthouses at Airlie Beach, with prices at about half of their boom time values.\nFullshare's sales departments manager Shubo Miao said the timing was right to release the first lot of luxury beachside properties formerly known as Whisper Bay and rebadged Mirage Whitsundays this year.\nHe said the the group was in no hurry to sell.\n\"We think the prices will increase as the local market picks up and as our redevelopment nears completion,\" he said.\n\"We have held the property for three years now and all indications are that it is the time to start doing some marketing.\"\nFullshare acquired 100 per cent ownership of Mirage Whitsundays in 2012 after having been a joint venture partner with Melbourne property developer David Marriner's Marriner Group. Fullshare, which is the owner of the Mirage brand in Australia, also took control of the Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas in 2011 and has a bullish outlook for Chinese tourism in Australia .\nApartments going for less than half of pre-financial crisis prices\nThe apartments range in price from $685,000 to $1.2 million varying according to views and location. The three-bedroom apartments being offered at $685,000 were once sold for about $1.5 million prior to the financial crisis after which the value of some Queensland coastal properties plummeted by up to 90 per cent .\n PRDnationwide Whitsundays principal Christie Leet, who is undertaking the marketing campaign for Fullshare said there was plenty of value on offer.\n\"These apartments are a truly phenomenal offering and are well below replacement cost,\" Mr Leet said.\n\"With the introduction of the Mirage brand and the reconfiguration of this project into a resort development we see this being arguably one of the best property investment opportunities on the eastern seaboard of Australia.\"\nThe Mirage Whitsundays has about $100 million in property still to hit the market. Fullshare is offering new owners to either live in the properties or have them managed by the Mirage hotel operator.\nAccording to a 2015 PRD Nationwide Research Report the Whitsunday region welcomed 684,000 international and overnight visitors in the year ending June 2014, an increase of 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.\nThe Whitsunday Shire Council is also pushing ahead with plans for international charter flights from New Zealand and Shanghai.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-09-24T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:08:45.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
