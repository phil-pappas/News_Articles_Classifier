Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey\nJoe Hockey's impending resignation from politics will trigger the second federal byelection this year and present the first real match-up between Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten.\nAfter losing Treasury in the ministerial reshuffle, Mr Hockey initially discussed with Mr Turnbull taking the defence portfolio but, ultimately, decided to leave politics, if only to see more of his young children.\nSources confirmed he will be sent to Washington DC to replace Kim Beazley as Australia's Ambassador to the United States.\nMr Hockey's seat of North Sydney is one of the safest Liberal seats and stretches from Hunters Hill to Willoughby. Mr Hockey first won the seat in 1996 and, at the 2013 election, won it by 66 per cent to 34 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.\nThe seat was held by independent Ted Mack between 1990 and 1996.\nA senior Liberal strategist said the byelection could be awkward for Mr Turnbull because there were often harsh swings in seats that had been vacated by a member who quit mid way through a term for no real reason.\nLast weekend's Canning byelection was caused by the death of Liberal MP Don Randall. Before Canning, the average swing against the incumbent party in a byelection caused by the death of a sitting member was 2.4 per cent.\n Credit claimed for reduced swing In Canning, the Liberals suffered a swing against them of 6.4 per cent but still won it comfortably by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. The polls had pointed to a swing of 10 per cent under Mr Abbott but this will never be tested as he was deposed by Mr Turnbull five days before the byelection.\nThe Turnbull camp claimed credit for the reduced swing whereas Abbott supporter Mathias Cormann said it would never be known what the swing would have been on the day had Mr Abbott remained leader.\nLabor sources said the party could not hope to win North Sydney, nor would it spend a lot of money and resources on a campaign there. But it should run a candidate, and given the Labor vote was so low at the last election, there was a good chance of a decent swing towards Labor, which would be good for morale and put pressure on Mr Turnbull.\nIt is likely the byelection would be this side of Christmas.\nNeither Mr Hockey nor Mr Turnbull would comment publicly about Mr Hockey's imminent posting, which cannot be announced until he leaves politics.\nMr Turnbull said \"I cannot possibly comment on diplomatic appointments\" but repeated that Mr Hockey \"has the capacity to serve the nation in the future\".\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said sending Mr Hockey to Washington would be \"Malcolm Turnbull's first big mistake\".\n\"If Malcolm Turnbull doesn't want Joe Hockey on his frontbench as treasurer, why on earth would we treat the Americans second class and send a failed treasurer over there?\"\nIt wasn't right to treat the position that marked one of Australia's key international relationships \"as some sort of consolation prize\" to buy peace within a divided political party, Mr Shorten said.\nThe posting has frequently been given as a political consolation prize, including by Labor.\nJohn Howard sent his his arch-rival Andrew Peacock to Washington in 1997 and Kevin Rudd gave the job to Mr Beazley in 2010. Mr Rudd took the leadership from Mr Beazley in a coup in December 2006.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:48:11.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
