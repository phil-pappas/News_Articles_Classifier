Joshua Mahony, of IG Group (Other OTC: IGGHY - news ) , said: “With the FTSE 100 tumbling over 120 points in two hours this morning, it is becoming clear that there is a distinct possibility of yet another crash in financial markets. \n“The steroids of monetary policy may have brought us to heights previously unseen in global markets, yet as the Fed and BoE begin weaning us off this artificial high, we are coming to find ourselves perilously exposed to another major selloff.” \nCommodity stocks were hit as copper prices hit a two-week low and Credit Suisse issued a bearish note on the sector, downgrading and revising target prices as necessary. \nThe bank said it is conditions in mining which remain highly uncertain, and it will remain challenging until “China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor”. \nAmid concerns investors had lost confidence in the beleaguered Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) following the recent dividend cut and equity placing, the stock plunged 13.5pc. The traiding and mining group fell below £1 for the first time ever in intraday trade to 99.6p. \nMeanwhile, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) fell 7.5pc and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) slid 6.9pc. \nEuropean bourses have also been hit, led lower by lower copper prices and Volkswagen (Xetra: 766400 - news ) , as it faces an investigation into cheating over emissions tests spread to Asia . \nMr Mahony said: “The issue here is one of reputation and coming from a rich pool of reputable and reliable German carmakers, this could take the sheen off a previously untouchable industry. \n“Today's sell-off across the German automotive sector has seen competitors such as Audi (Other OTC: AUDVF - news ) , Renault (Swiss: RNO.SW - news ) , Daimler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) and Porsche all suffer major losses today. The question on everyone's mind is, if Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) is doing it, the likeliness is that they all are.” * VW exec admits ‘we totally screwed up’ as South Korea opens probe The German DAX and the CAC in Paris both fell sharply - down 3.2pc after midday. \nMeanwhile, the opening bell on Wall Street also sent tremors across US equity markets. Despite closing in positive territory on Monday, falling oil and copper prices prompted renewed concerns about the health of the Chinese economy, dragging US stocks into the red. \nChris Beauchamp, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “US markets are being sold just as heavily as eurozone indices, as buyers search in vain for reasons to be positive.” \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6pc, while the S&P 500 was 1.7pc lower and the Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) slipped 1.8pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:04:30.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
