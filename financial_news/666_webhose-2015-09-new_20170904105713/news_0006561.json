In addition to the usual selection of movies set in the city, the event’s main slate features three world premieres from marquee talents set largely in New York.\nCritics, audiences and awards prognosticators will also have their first looks at a new film from two-time best director Oscar winner Steven Spielberg and two-time best actor winner Tom Hanks, as well as a buzzed-about biopic from director-star Don Cheadle.\nThe festival and the Film Society of Lincoln Center will again highlight the film-restoration work of native filmmaker Martin Scorsese and pay tribute to the late documentarian Albert Maysles.\nThe 53rd installment of the festival kicks off Friday and runs through Oct. 11. Here is a preview of premieres and events that are likely to be highlights over the next two-plus weeks.\n‘The Walk’\nThis love letter to the city and the Twin Towers makes its world premiere at the festival as the opening night feature. Director Robert Zemeckis, who will be present for the festivities, has made his mark on the business by using top-flight special effects to tell personal stories about flawed people rising to a seemingly impossible occasion, whether they’re time traveling (“Back to the Future”) or they’re stuck on an island (“Cast Away”). In “The Walk,” the director turns his gaze toward French daredevil Philippe Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who, in 1974, used the newly built Twin Towers for the ultimate high-wire act. This isn’t the first time Mr. Petit’s World Trade Center story has been told on film; his walk was the subject of the Oscar-winning 2008 documentary “Man on Wire.” Mr. Zemeckis’s movie, however, uses cutting-edge computer magic to put the audience alongside Mr. Petit on that wire. It will be shown in 3-D.\nENLARGE Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan in ‘Bridge of Spies,’ directed by Steven Spielberg. Photo: DreamWorks Pictures ‘Bridge of Spies’; ‘Miles Ahead’\nTwo other high-profile films with strong New York connections will make their world premieres at the festival. In director Steven Spielberg’s true Cold War story “Bridge of Spies,” which has its debut Oct. 4, a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) living in late 1950s Brooklyn is arrested and tried by U.S. authorities before he becomes a key figure in a prisoner swap involving U.S. spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers. Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, the New York lawyer who defends Mr. Abel and negotiates the trade. Meanwhile, Don Cheadle directs, writes and stars in “Miles Ahead,” a biographical film about jazz legend Miles Davis. The film, much of it set in the trumpeter’s Manhattan apartment during the late 1970s, focuses on Davis as he reflects on his life and career. Ewan McGregor also stars in “Miles Ahead,” which is the festival’s closing night selection (Oct. 10).\nENLARGE Cate Blanchett in ‘Carol’ Photo: The Weinstein Company Romance in New York\n“Carol,” director Todd Haynes’s 1950s-set tale of forbidden love, has already wowed festival crowds across the globe. Star Rooney Mara won the best actress award at Cannes earlier this year, and now the movie, based on Patricia Highsmith’s novel “The Price of Salt,” is making its push into the Oscar race. Ms. Mara, Mr. Haynes and star Cate Blanchett will be on hand when the film plays Oct. 10. In another period piece set during the 1950s, director John Crowley’s “Brooklyn,” Saoirse Ronan stars as an Irish woman torn between two loves and two futures: one in New York and one back home in Ireland. A more modern take on love in New York, “Maggie’s Plan,” from director Rebecca Miller, tells the story of a college administrator, played by critical and art house favorite Greta Gerwig, who falls in love with a married professor (Ethan Hawke). The film, which also stars Julianne Moore and Maya Rudolph, is making its U.S. premiere.\nScorsese’s Restorations\nThe festival is marking the 25th anniversary of New York native Martin Scorsese’s Film Foundation, which works to restore and preserve films. This year, the slate includes seven films, including John Ford’s 1940 Eugene O’Neill adaptation “The Long Voyage Home” and “Black Girl” (1965), storied director Ousmane Sembene’s first feature. Mr. Scorsese will be on hand for a question-and-answer session at the Oct. 1 screening of Ernst Lubitsch’s 1943 comedy “Heaven Can Wait.” Cannes best director winner Hou Hsiao-hsien, whose “The Assassin” is making its U.S. premiere in the main slate, will also be on hand for the Oct. 9 screening of his 1983 film “The Boys From Fengkuei.”\nThe Life and Work of Albert Maysles\nThe Film Society of Lincoln Center will pay tribute to documentarian Albert Maysles, who died earlier this year in New York, in an Oct. 4 program. Mr. Maysles and his brother David created several documentaries—including the Long Island-set “Grey Gardens” and the Rolling Stones-focused “Gimme Shelter”—which are acclaimed for pushing the boundaries of the form. The tribute, to be co-hosted by the filmmaker’s family, will also touch on Albert Maysles’s Harlem-based nonprofit documentary center and his work to expand the art of that kind of filmmaking.\nWrite to Michael Calia at michael.calia@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL495_NYFF09_M_20150923161000.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL504_NYFF09_M_20150923162227.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL504_NYFF09_P_20150923162227.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KL495_NYFF09_P_20150923161000.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-24T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:33:14.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
