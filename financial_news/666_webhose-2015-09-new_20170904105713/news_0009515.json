However, she noted that a segment of the population is still not sharing the fruits of this growth. \nThe project, which also includes a US$10 million from the Mauritanian national budget, will be implemented over a five-year period (2015-2020) and will enable the country to establish a social registry that will identify vulnerable households, using an objective and transparent targeting methodology. These households will be the main beneficiaries of the 'Tekavoul' program, which will assist the poorest households through direct, periodic, and sustained social transfers. \n\"This will help families improve their well-being and invest in the human capital of their children through best practice training that ensures the proper development of children. With this assistance, the program will promote the health and the education of the next generation of Mauritanians,\" Cord added. \nThe grant was approved on May 14, 2015 by the World Bank's Board of Directors. It also includes a subsidy of US$4 million for the Sahel Adaptive Social Fund, bringing the total amount of the NSPS to US$19 million.
