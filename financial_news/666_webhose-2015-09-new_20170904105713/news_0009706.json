Sinopec Group is the parent of Sinopec Corp , Asia's largest oil refiner. \nIn a statement released by the Communist Party's graft-busting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Sinopec said that the latest inspection by anti-corruption teams had been very effective at rooting out problems. \n\"It has hit the nail on the head, grasping the essence and crux (of the issue), helping us to find the root of the disease,\" it said. \nAs part of company efforts to rein in spending, all the hotels it runs will be sold off by late 2017, apart from a \"small number\" that are competitive or are in exploration areas with no other hotels, it said. \nState-owned firms in China tend to be very diversified and often own assets that have nothing to do with their core business. \nThe number of cars the company operates will also be slashed by 4,300, it added, a move in line with other government-run organisations and departments. \nThe probe found a series of other problems of waste, including a holiday two executives took to Taiwan in 2013 on the company dime, and four people who did not return to China immediately after a board meeting in gambling hub Macau. \nSinopec is not the only state-owned energy company to have been probed by the graft watchdog. \nIn a statement released late on Sunday, China National Offshore Oil Corp, better known as CNOOC, listed the steps it was taking to address the problems inspectors had found there, including promising not to use company money to buy high-end cigarettes and liquor. \n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T06:19:48.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
