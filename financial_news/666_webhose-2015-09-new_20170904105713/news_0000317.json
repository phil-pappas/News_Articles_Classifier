Last week, there were 805 land-based (or onshore) rigs, including five inland water rigs. Inland water rigs remained unchanged last week. In the last five weeks, 48, or 6%, of onshore rigs have been idled. Currently, the onshore rig count is at its lowest since February 2003. \nIn a statewide break-up of rigs, Texas lost three onshore rigs last week. Four other states also lost onshore rigs last week. In comparison, only New Mexico added one onshore rig last week. The US onshore rig count was on a continuous slide until the week ended May 22, falling for 25 straight weeks. After looking slightly stable for a bit, they’re turning downward again. Most prolific states \nIn the 12 months ended September 25, 2015, the land-based US rig count fell by 1,064, or 57%. The number of active land-based rigs decreased the most in Texas, where 533, or 60% rigs shut down. North Dakota lost 123, or 65%, rigs over those 12 months. \nDespite losing a significant number of rigs in the past year, Texas still has the most land-based rigs in the United States with 362, or 45%, of the total. Oklahoma is next, with 105 land-based rigs, and North Dakota follows with 66. Onshore rig count records \nThe onshore rig count hit a record high of 1,992 on November 4, 2011, the highest number of rigs in operation since January 1990, according to Baker Hughes. Then, the onshore rig count reached 1,876 in the week ended November 21, 2014. In total, 1,071 onshore rigs have gone offline since then, representing a fall of ~57%. Impact on energy companies \nThe total onshore rigs in operation mainly reflect the US shale boom. Apart from upstream oil and gas companies, the falling rig count can negatively affect oilfield service companies. These companies provide various land-based and offshore drilling services and technologies. They include Cameron International (CAM), FMC Technologies (FTI), Dresser-Rand Group (DRC), and Weatherford International (WFT). Cameron International forms 0.07% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). \nA decreasing rig count could also potentially hurt midstream MLPs like Targa Resources Partners (NGLS), Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP), and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) in the long term. Falling rigs could decrease these companies’ throughput volumes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:55:32.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
