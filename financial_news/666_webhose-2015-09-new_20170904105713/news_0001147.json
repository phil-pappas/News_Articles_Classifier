Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Australia's youngest minister Wyatt Roy is keen to bring the Aussie tech mafia home.\nAs Assistant Minister for Innovation in Christopher Pyne's Industry department, Mr Roy is now, at 25, the youngest minister; Kate Ellis became a minister at 30 in the Rudd government in the 2007 election and a 31-year-old Paul Keating was a minister for a brief period i n 1975.\nWithout finishing his university degree, Mr Roy beat other heavy hitters such as Rhodes scholar and former McKinsey consultant, Angus Taylor, to the frontbench , in a brutal reshuffle that also saw popular small business minister Bruce Billson sidelined.\nMr Roy said he feels \"lucky\" and \"humbled\" to have made the line-up, and is going to need all of his personal passion for tech and start-ups – cultivated in trips to Boston, Israel, Silicon Valley and New York – to make a difference in his portfolio, which is plagued by endless reviews and little action.\nJulie Bishop embraces Wyatt Roy before the ministry swearing in ceremony at Government House in Canberra on Monday 21 September 2015. Andrew Meares He said he was well aware of the issues crippling Australia's digital economy – those of scale, STEM education, skills and lack of venture capital investment – but said three things need to change.\nFirst, borrowing an \"Abbottism\", Aussies need to \"have a go,\" he said.\nThen, \"we need to reject the tall poppy syndrome, we need a culture that says risk is a good thing, that failure is ok\".\nBring home the Silicon Valley 20,000 \"The other thing is picking up the phone. There are 20,000 Australians living in Silicon Valley at the moment, they call them the Australian mafia, we want them to come home. We want to become a hub of entrepreneurship,\" he said.\nHe's also said he will push for more venture capital funding in tech and more collaboration between the private sector and universities.\n\"We are not cracking the nut of commercialisation,\" he said, adding he would like to see any government funding partnered with the private sector.\nHe said he would be sitting down as soon as possible with venture capital association AVCAL to see what other changes are needed. Increasing super fund investment into start-ups was \"something we need to have a discussion around,\" he said.\nMr Roy, who played a role in rallying support behind Mr Turnbull and toppling former prime minister Tony Abbott, is basking in the renewed popularity of his government and relieved that unpopular policies may be dropped.\nAsked if he is glad that Mr Abbott's opposition to \"ugly\" wind farms, same-sex marriage and his pursuit of university deregulation, particularly distasteful for his generation, were moving off the table Mr Roy said \"yes, very much so\".\nRepresenting winds of change And with lines straight out of Labor leader Bill Shorten's song book, Mr Roy represents the winds of change under new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\"The renewables sector is an amazing opportunity for us as a country. I think we should talk about it in an economic sense, innovation and entrepreneur sense, the renewable sector can create the jobs of the future,\" Mr Roy said.\nMr Roy said his elevation, lowering the average age of the frontbench, made the Turnbull government a more representative one, and he was already seeing the government rise in popularity in his demographic since the leadership change.\n\"One of the great things about Malcolm particularly, and increasingly this government, is that we break out of this slanging match that is politics,\" he said.\nAsked whether the Young Liberals had a women problem in light of the recent violent fracas over gender quotas in the party at a Young Liberal conference, Mr Roy simply said it was a problem throughout politics.\nHe said he did not support quotas, but said Liberals needed to reach out to encourage more women into pre-selection, and an internal campaign may be required.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/keating/before-office.aspx", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:10:32.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
