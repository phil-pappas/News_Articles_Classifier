Bloomberg by Michael Tomasky The \"Donald Trump situation\", as anxious Republicans and mystified commentators sometimes call it, only grows more anxiety-producing and mystifying by the week. His performance in the August 6 debate was not considered world-beating. Then, in the wake of it, he was widely perceived as having made reference in a CNN interview to the menstrual cycle of Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly, which was supposed to finish him off. It was about the fourth such dose of poison but, Rasputin-like, Trump has survived each one.\nThen, on August 11, Trump held his first real campaign-style press conference, in a Michigan town just south of Saginaw. It was rich in the usual self-aggrandising bluster – but he also showed that he can discuss issues and policy about as well as most of the GOP candidates. That is perhaps not the highest of bars, but he cleared it easily.\nOn August 21, he held a large rally at a college football stadium in Mobile, Alabama. It seems safe to conjecture that for this native of Queens and resident of mid-town Manhattan, this was probably virgin territory. He filled fewer than 30,000 of its 40,000 seats, but the point was made that he could go deep into the bosom of the Bible Belt and draw a crowd that no other Republican could begin to attract. And now, as autumn approaches and the campaign begins to intensify, we have careened our way into a reality in which the question \"who is the current front-runner for the GOP nomination?\" has only one plausible answer.\nOn the one hand, it has seemed impossible to believe that Trump's candidacy would evolve into something the political leaders and commentators would have to take seriously. For weeks after his June 16 announcement, the experts agreed that, surely, this would all just collapse at some point.\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush was the designated Republican establishment front-runner but might be losing votes to Donald Trump. AP Conservative resentment made flesh On the other hand, however, is Trump not the logical culmination of where Republican politics have been headed for many years now, going back to the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies, but especially during the tenure of Barack Obama? Two qualities more than any others have driven conservatism in our time. The first is cultural and racial resentment, felt by the mostly older and very white population the GOP increasingly represents – resentment against a fast-changing, more openly sexual US, as well as against dark-skinned immigrants and White House occupants, and gay people and political correctness and the \"moocher class\" and all the rest. The second is what we might call spectacle – the unrelenting push toward a rhetorical style ever more gladiatorial and ever more outraged (and outrageous), driven initially by talk-radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and now reproduced on websites, podcasts and Twitter feeds too numerous to mention. There is a strong tendency, perfected over the years by Fox News, to cover and discuss domestic politics as a combination of war, sport and entertainment all at once.\nWell, Trump is conservative resentment and spectacle made flesh. In the four or so years since he converted himself into a rage machine, banging on about Obama's birth certificate and so forth, he has become adept at stoking conservative resentment. And while it's true that Trump has moved beyond that to embrace a few heterodox and even surprisingly progressive positions, it was resentment – specifically, his remarks about Mexico \"sending\" us rapists and criminals, in June – that vaulted him to the top of polls. Trump has continued to stake out far-right positions on immigration, calling for the deportation of about 11 million undocumented people and an end to birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the 14th Amendment since 1868.\nAnd as for spectacle, Trump is one of the defining showmen of our new Gilded Age, whether we like that fact or not. It's very difficult to imagine him actually becoming president. But even if it all comes crashing down next week, Trump has already got quite a lot. He has altered Republican politics fundamentally. Certain assumptions about what a Republican politician could and could not get away with doing, assumptions shared by the entire political establishment – for example, that a GOP candidate would never dare pick a fight with Fox – have been shattered.\n A Donald Trump supporter wears a shirt autographed by the Republican presidential candidate in Nashville, Tennessee. Mark Humphrey Waiting for someone like him Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus is clearly terrified of him. Even Fox News head Roger Ailes – the effective co-chairman of the Republican Party for a number of years – treats him gingerly. Karl Rove wants desperately for the party establishment to block him. They all wish he would go away, even while they must know that they are responsible for Trump because they have spent many years creating an audience that was just waiting for someone like him to come along.\nThose are the long-term culprits behind the rise of Trumpism. The three big nearer-term explanations for his success are pretty straightforward. The first is his celebrity. Trump hosts a network prime-time show, NBC's The Celebrity Apprentice , which has run for 14 seasons (as The Apprentice for eight of those seasons). Seinfeld , one of the most popular television shows in history, lasted nine seasons.\nAlthough NBC renewed The Apprentice at the last minute for a 15th season, and though it might go on, the network severed its ties with Trump after his comments on Mexican immigrants. But the show, on which he ruthlessly judged contestants' competence and famously fired them as problems were resolved in one hour, has already brought him to a level of celebrity that made his formidable poll numbers possible.\nThe second reason is the surprising weakness of the rest of the GOP field. Here, the main story is Jeb Bush, because he is the one who was designated the establishment front-runner. But Bush's aura so far is definitely not that of the default choice. One has the sense that if he didn't have such a familiar name, he might not even have qualified for that first debate. A part of his problem is ideological. He's trying, with respect to immigration and a couple of other issues, to run a somewhat more centrist campaign than the others. As a result the hard-shell base is suspicious of him.\nDownright morose Another Bush problem is simply one of demeanour. He often looks as if he's just not that interested in what is happening to him and would rather be somewhere else. His debate performance was generally judged to be lacklustre, but it was energetic in comparison to some of his press conferences and speeches, which have been downright morose. Trump, in his characteristically brusque way, put his finger on it recently when he said, \"Jeb Bush is a low-energy person\".\nBush still runs fairly well in national polls – he's usually second to Trump, although a pretty distant second. Many observers continue to believe that he'll outlast everyone else by dint of money – at July 31 Bush had raised $US120 million ($168.4 million), well ahead even of Hillary Clinton's $US68 million. The closest Republican was Texas Senator Ted Cruz at $US52 million. But it's worth remembering that the billionaire Trump has virtually unlimited money without having to raise a cent.\nThe other Republican candidates all have their difficulties, too. The field's collective lack of charisma gave a huge opening to a man with Trump's outsized personality and ego.\nThe final cause of Trump's rise has been the intense attention given to him by the political media. The ratings obsessions of the three cable news networks drive the constant Trump coverage. For news websites from The New York Times down to individual blogs, Trump means traffic.\nIdentify more as Democrat The questions of what Trump actually believes and what policies he would advance have only recently started to attract attention. His record hardly demonstrates a fealty to conservatism. \"In many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in 2004. \"It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\" He also said recently Bill Clinton was the best of the past four presidents, while at the debate he went out of his way to point out he was the only person on the stage who opposed the Iraq war. He recently defended Planned Parenthood's non-abortion-related services, something no other Republican candidate would dare to do. In a book he wrote in 2000 he backed universal, single-payer healthcare.\nThe other, normal candidates would be savaged over such apostasies, but Trump can get away with them, for now, because the occasional heterodoxy continues to publicise him as unbought and unbossed and poking a finger in the Republican establishment's eye, while also promising to build a great wall on the border and \"build up our military so strong … that nobody will mess with us\".\nAnd now we have Time to Get Tough . Trump wrote the book in 2011 as he was preparing for a 2012 run that he did not pursue. It sits comfortably within the standard campaign self-promotion genre, and within the ideological bounds that should please conservatives. What makes the book a bit different, though, and what separates Trump from your typical candidate, is the degree to which he sees politics as a negotiation. He, being the world's greatest negotiator bar none, because he's become a very wealthy man through the art of negotiation, will set lots of things right by force of will. His top targets are the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and China:\n\"It starts with China and OPEC. The hundreds of billions of dollars they steal from us each year must end right away. We need a president with a titanium spine who will stand up to these shakedown artists and demand that they get their greedy hands out of our pockets effective immediately.\"\nHis proposal is to sue OPEC under US antitrust law. This is not a new idea. In fact it's a very old one. From virtually the moment the cartel raised oil prices for Americans in the 1970s, politicians and international law experts began examining the question of whether an extra-state international organisation could successfully be sued in an American court. Opinion is divided on the question, to say nothing of whether OPEC wouldn't simply laugh an adverse verdict away.\nWants to impose a tariff With respect to China, Trump wants to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all goods made there that are sold in the US. Once that happens, Trump writes:\n\"End of story. You think the Chinese wouldn't respond constructively? No businessman I know would want to turn his back on the US market – and the Chinese wouldn't either.\"\nPerhaps not, but surely the Chinese government would retaliate by slapping tariffs on US-made imports, and that would hurt American exporters. This sort of thing goes on all the time now anyway. The Obama administration has put huge tariffs on Chinese tires and solar panels, and the Chinese have imposed high duties on American cars and trucks.\nIn the real, complicated world, solving one problem generally means creating another. But Trump's moral universe has no space for such disorder. All it takes is some resolve, titanium again being the key element:\n\"I do deals – big deals – all the time. I know and work with all the toughest operators in the world of high-stakes global finance. These are hard-driving, vicious cut-throat financial killers, the kind of people who leave blood all over the boardroom table and fight to the bitter end to gain maximum advantage. And guess what? Those are exactly the kind of negotiators the United States needs, not these cream puff 'diplomats' Obama sends around the globe to play patty cake with foreign governments. No, we need smart people with titanium spines and big brains who love America enough to fight fiercely for our interests.\"\nUnderstandable yearning That's the essence of it. His supporters seem to believe that he can do these things, or even if they don't quite believe they long for someone who can – who can tame OPEC and China and Iran as if world affairs could be made to be like a reality TV show. This is an understandable yearning to some extent, in an age in which the US' ability to call the global shots is so much reduced from what it was 50 years ago. But it has a more sinister aspect, this wish for a strong man who can just fix everything. And surely it's also the case for some Trump supporters that after eight years of Obama, a bullying white man is exactly what is needed to restore things to their natural order.\nUsually, there's a lot of loose talk in the pre-election year, but once the general election is eight, six, four months away, the wilder speculation gives way to more conventional habits. For example, it's now less certain than it was two months ago that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. But if she is, by next summer all the Democratic voters who say today that she leaves them totally cold will start thinking more about the Supreme Court and all the horrors a Republican president would visit upon the nation and start making their peace with her.\nThe same dynamic seems likely to occur on the other side. By next spring, Republican voters should have a good sense of which of their choices matches up most competitively against Clinton. If that's not Trump, he'll fade away. But what if he's still popular? After years of settling for the conventional candidate (John McCain, Mitt Romney), maybe Republican primary voters will follow their collective id and embrace resentment and spectacle. It's certainly where they've been heading for a while now.\nNew York Review of Books\nTime to Get Tough: Make America Great Again! , by Donald J Trump, published by Regnery.
