Activity can grind to a halt. That's a growing risk.\" New Zealand's strong growth over the past couple of years is expected to slow down as slumping global dairy prices erode dairy export receipts, and as the tailwind from the Canterbury rebuild starts tapering off. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's last week said it anticipates gross domestic product will expand 2.4 per cent in 2016, slowing from a three per cent pace in 2015. Monday's survey was the fifth monthly decline in business confidence and its second in negative territory, with agriculture the most downcast among the sub-sectors. Of the 473 respondents, 0.4 per cent expected investment to contract, compared to 11 per cent seeing expansion in July, while 2.8 per cent plan to take on new staff, down from 9.3 per cent.
