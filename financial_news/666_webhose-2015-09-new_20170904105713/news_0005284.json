MoMA is the only venue for the exhibition, the largest U.S. presentation of his sculptures in nearly a half-century.\nGiven the Spaniard’s profound influence on 20th- and even 21st-century art, and the stratospheric prices his paintings can command at auction, it would be a stretch to describe any aspect of his work as under-the-radar. But if there were a candidate for that distinction, it would be the sculpture , which hasn’t received nearly the same number of dedicated exhibitions as his paintings.\nRelated Coverage\nAn Opportunity in Picasso Sculpture? Where MoMA Will Put the Pollocks Picasso’s Determined Granddaughter Catalogs His Sculptures Picasso Painting Fetches $179 Million at Auction Trained as a painter but self-taught as a sculptor, Picasso made three-dimensional work throughout his career, but intermittently, with lapses that sometimes lasted years.\n“The restless imagination of this artist, the almost crazy sense of invention, comes through in the sculpture like nowhere else,” said Ann Temkin, MoMA’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, and co-curator of the exhibition, which runs through Feb. 7, 2016. “He’s making it up as he goes along.”\nAccording to Diana Widmaier-Picasso , an art historian and granddaughter of the artist who is preparing a multivolume catalog raisonné of the sculpture, he made more than 2,000 three-dimensional works, a number that includes editions—multiple identical works cast or otherwise reproduced from the same mold or template—but excludes his ceramics.\nBronze, plaster, terra-cotta, cardboard, cement and wood are just some of the more than two dozen mediums and materials represented in the show—not to mention found objects ranging from upholstery fringe to bicycle parts to kitchen colanders.\nThe show is organized into eight chronological chapters. Opening with Picasso’s early experiments in clay, bronze and wood, it quickly progresses to early cubist sculptures, like the 1909 bronze “Head of a Woman” and a beguiling little plaster apple, before vaulting into the constructions and assemblages of the early teens.\nENLARGE Pablo Picasso, next to one of his sculptures. Photo: Bunk/ullstein bild/Getty Images Innovations of the later 1920s and early ’30s include fanciful found-object collages and the wire sculptures that Picasso’s dealer, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, dubbed “drawings in space.”\nThe postwar decades saw Picasso ensconced on the French Riviera, where everything from beach pebbles to sheet metal became raw material for his work.\n“We hope that every single room in this exhibition is like discovering a different artist,” said co-curator Anne Umland, curator of painting and sculpture at MoMA.\nTo do justice to the approximately 140 sculptures on view, Ms. Temkin and Ms. Umland made a radical decision: Wherever possible, each free-standing sculpture would be displayed for 360-degree viewing. And no paintings—sculpture only.\nTheir mission, said Ms. Temkin: “To give sculpture its first-class status.”\nThat takes space. At about 22,000 square feet, the exhibition’s footprint is approximately twice that of last autumn’s “ Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs ,” which drew some 724,000 visitors. And it isn’t necessarily because the sculptures are huge—many are surprisingly modest in scale.\nENLARGE Conservators look over items from Pablo Picasso's ‘Bathers’ sculptures during the installation of the ‘Picasso Sculpture’ exhibition at MoMA. Photo: Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal “Picasso Sculpture” is likely to be as popular as the Matisse show, if not more so, but its generous space allotment brings a welcome bonus: no timed ticketing. However, there may be queuing and controlled entry during peak hours.\nLate last month, the fourth floor was a work in progress, with custom pedestals in place and crafted-to-scale replicas—some flat and photographic, others three-dimensional—standing in for much of the art.\nAlthough the curators had assigned the works to specific galleries, final placement within in each room has been an organic process, Ms. Temkin said. For example, “Bathers,” a group of life-size, playful sculptures from 1956, has been moved twice in pursuit of the most effective sight lines. In its final spot, it is the first thing visitors see when they enter the penultimate room.\nEleven of the works in “Picasso Sculpture” hail from MoMA’s own collection, including perennial favorites like the 1950 “She-Goat” and 1951 “Baboon and Young.”\nThat leaves about 130 sculptures coming from other institutions and private collections internationally—and a delivery schedule resembling a military campaign, with the last pieces arriving just a few days ahead of the exhibition previews. Many required personal couriers, a logistical challenge during late-summer vacation time, especially in France.\nENLARGE Pablo Picasso’s ‘She-Goat’ sculpture. Photo: Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York Some 50 sculptures and eight works on paper come from the Musée national Picasso-Paris, along with 24 images of Picasso’s sculptures taken by the photographer Brassaï in the 1930s and 1940s.\nBecause the artist kept so many of his sculptures until he died, and left no will, the Musée, a state institution established after his death, received many of those works in lieu of estate tax, with the remainder going largely to family members. The Musée is collaborating with MoMA on the exhibition.\nIn the galleries, the willingness to give each work its elbow room was apparent. In the second room, for instance, the 1914 “Glass of Absinthe”—an edition of six bronzes, each distinctively hand-painted—is dramatically showcased, each of the works on its own pedestal with several feet of viewing space between them.\nA few galleries farther on, a flat maquette, or replica, of the 1942 bronze “Bull’s Head” claimed an entire wall. Despite the work’s modest dimensions, the curators had no fear of the real thing being dwarfed by its backdrop. “It’s that imposing,” said Ms. Temkin.\nMs. Umland concurred: “It has a force field.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD442_NYPIC0_TOP_20150903115059.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD442_NYPIC0_M_20150903115059.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD421_NYPIC0_P_20150903112605.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD421_NYPIC0_M_20150903112605.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD439_NYPIC0_TOP_20150903114756.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD439_NYPIC0_M_20150903114756.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:33:28.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
