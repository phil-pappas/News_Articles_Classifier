However, under the new rules those who own flats that measure less than 500 sq ft, who would otherwise have paid more under these new rules, will not pay the increase since they have been granted relief by the Chief Minister. There will be no increase for this section for a period of 5 years. This is reported to benefit around 17 lakh families who live in houses with an area of less than 500 square feet. \nHow is the property tax calculated under the new rules? \nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has changed the property tax calculation from the earlier Rateable Value System (RVS) to the new Capital Value System (CVS). Under the RVS, the tax was calculated based on the maximum amount of rent that the property could fetch in a year. The CVS is based on the market value of the property. \nCapital value is calculated as follows: \nMarket value of property (X) total carpet area (X) weight for construction type (X) weight for age of building \nUse the Ready Reckoner (RR) to arrive at market value. RR is a compilation of the rates that denote a fair value price for a property set by the state government. The builder may charge a premium over such rates but cannot under sell it. The RR gives the base value and the stamp duty and registration amount payable cannot be lower than these rates. Check the ward / zone in which your property falls. \nWeights for construction type are calculated in units and are as follows; \nBungalows & RCC construction 1 unitOther than RCC (semi-permanent / chawls) -0 .60 unitUnder construction or vacant land 0.50 unitWeights for age of building are calculated in units and are as follows: \nProperties constructed before 1945 0.80 unitProperties constructed between 1945 and 1985 0.90 unitProperties constructed after 1985 1 unitProperty tax calculation would be: \nCapital value of property (X) current property tax (X) weight for user category \nWeights for user category are calculated in units and are as follows: \nHotels and like businesses 4 unitsCommercial properties (shops, offices) 3 unitsIndustries & factories 2 unitsResidential & charitable institutions 1 unitWhere can you pay the property tax? \nThe property tax can be paid at the Office of the Assistant Revenue Officer or at the BMC Help Centers or at the Citizen Facilitation Centre at all the Ward Offices. Online payments are also possible. Visit the BMC website: http://cvs.mcgm.gov.in:7001/MCGM_CVS/ \nHow to make online payment \n1. Log on to the BMC website mentioned above. 2. Enter your account number. There is also a search facility in case you do not remember your account number. The account number is also mentioned in your property tax bill. 3. Choose your option of payment: half-yearly or annually 4. Enter the amount to be paid. You will be directed to the payment mode. Currently only net banking is permitted. 5. After payment is made the system will generate a receipt. Print this and keep it as your record. \nMake sure that the system updates your record and no ‘outstandings’ are shown against your account. There have been errors of this nature and the onus is on you to get it corrected. \nStanley Varghese for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: By Deepak Gupta from West Lafayette, United States (Mumbai Skyline) [CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons \nBy: indiaproperty.com Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic Taxation Q Interest rates are going to go down.
