Sam Hodgson Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak Australian stocks are poised for a heavy sell-off on Monday as the implications of the United States Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates at close to zero per cent last week worked through financial markets.\nFutures indicated the S&P/ASX 200 Index would be down 76 points or 1.48 per cent at the reopening of trading after closing at 5170.5 points on Friday. This follows heavy losses on Wall Street on Friday night, including a 1.7 per cent loss for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 1.6 per cent drop for the S&P 500. The Euro Stoxx index was down 3 per cent.\nMarkets were troubled by the Fed's admission that it held concerns around the pace of global growth and the nature of the slowdown in China. The Fed on Thursday in Washington voted to keep interest rates at the zero bound at its September meeting, accompanying its decision with strongly dovish commentary and lower projections for the direction of interest rates.\nFed officials sought to reclaim the narrative on Friday and Saturday with public statements that supported the still dominant view that US interest rates will rise in 2015, at either the October or December meeting.\nAFR Graphic James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis branch of the Fed said: \"I argued against the decision [to leave rates unchanged].\" However, Mr Bullard does not get a vote on policy. John Williams, president of the San Francisco branch, said: \"I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates, most likely starting sometime later this year.\"\nJeffrey Lacker of the Richmond Fed, a known \"hawk\" who surprised no one as the sole voter for hiking in the 9-1 decision, said inaction increased the chance of \"adverse\" outcomes.\nThe Australian dollar on Friday night rallied to as high as US72.76¢ before finishing the week at US72.19¢.\nTreasuries rallied, reducing the yields on 10-year debt to 2.13 per cent. They were as low as 2 per cent in August, coinciding with China's \"Black Monday\" sell-off.\n Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak late on Thursday on monetary policy, in Massachusetts . In the press conference following the meeting last week, Dr Yellen said: \"I do not want to overplay the implications of these recent developments, which have not fundamentally altered our outlook. The economy has been performing well, and we expect it to continue to do so.\"\nCautious tone at odds with RBA Stephen Walters, JPMorgan's top economist in Australia, said the Fed's observation of slowing Chinese activity was interesting but the Fed's tone of sudden caution was slightly at odds with that conveyed by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens.\n\"I think we're right to be watching closely what's going on there because we're arguably more leveraged to the China economy than the US economy is,\" Mr Walters said. The governor on Friday delivered a more optimistic assessment of Australia's outlook .\n\"[Stevens] was saying perhaps there is a bit too much pessimism around not only China but what's going on domestically,\" Mr Walters said. \"We've got our own central bank saying 'keep calm and carry on'. I tend to put more weight on what governor Stevens is saying.\"\nEven a slowing China was still providing a large degree of stimulus to the Australian economy, he said, and \"it is a very heavily planned, controlled economy, so they can pull the levers and get a pretty quick bang for their buck... there's been five interest-rates cuts since November\".\nMr Walters sees no change to interest rates in Australia, meaning an extended period at the record low rate of 2 per cent.\n\"We're advocating for no change in Australia because as governor Stevens said on Friday, we're pretty content where we are. The current policy rate is very, very stimulatory.\"\nThe People's Bank of China cut interest rates last month as well as pumping greater liquidity into its banking system.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fed-sitting-still-deals-blow-to-americas-great-recovery-story-20150918-gjq25j.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:14:44.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
