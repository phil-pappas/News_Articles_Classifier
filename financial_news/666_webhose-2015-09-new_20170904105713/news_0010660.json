Morgan Chase . \nWhile China is \"the third largest destination for U.S. exports ($124 billion annually, or 7.6% of total goods), we estimate that U.S. companies in aggregate have only 1.6% direct revenue exposure to China,\" the Sept. 9 report said. \"This stems from a simple fact that China is largely an importer of raw materials/unfinished goods for manufacturing while majority of U.S. companies generate sales from finished goods and services to domestic and DM markets.\" \nWhile \"China alone will not be enough to trigger a complete reversal in company fundamentals,\" it will be \"a source of additional market volatility and investor pessimism, especially for companies with higher China revenue exposure,\" the note said. More Headlines 10 Dividend Stocks Set for Big Gains or Huge Losses \nStill J.P. Morgan analysts point to more than two dozen U.S. companies in the S&P 500 Index that generate at least 10% of total revenue from sales in China. \n\"After strong double-digit earnings growth in 2014, U.S. stocks with high China exposure are now expected to deliver -6.4% in 2015 followed by an earnings recovery of +12% in 2016,\" the analysts wrote. \nIn addition, stocks with high China exposure \"have seen short-interest rise over the past year (from 2.4% of float in February to 4.3% more recently) compared to a more muted increase for rest of the market,\" the note said. That said, \"the Street's ratings have remained resilient despite growth concerns in China and a pickup in short-interest, which we believe is a risk for these names.\" \nHere's the list, paired with ratings from TheStreet Quant Ratings for added perspective. The list excludes technology component makers given that \"their high China revenue exposure is due to re-export (product assembly rather than end-user demand by China),\" the analysts wrote. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nYTD Return: 16% \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, A+ \nTheStreet Ratings team rates NIKE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate NIKE INC (NKE) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, revenue growth and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook. \" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Powered by its strong earnings growth of 25.64% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 40.63% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, NKE should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. NIKE INC has improved earnings per share by 25.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, NIKE INC increased its bottom line by earning $3.70 versus $2.98 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.18 versus $3.70). The company, on the basis of net income growth from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly outperformed against the S&P 500 and exceeded that of the Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods industry average. The net income increased by 23.9% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $698.00 million to $865.00 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 4.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. NKE's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.10 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.49, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems.
