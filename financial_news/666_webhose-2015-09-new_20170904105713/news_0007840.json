During the day’s trading, Nifty did not rise significantly higher than 7,880 and the major indices in the Indian stock market continued to move sideways, eventually closing with small gains. \n\nThe Indian stock markets are in a wait and watch mood with both the US Fed and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) due to take routine decisions on interest rates. High interest rates in the US are expected to wean away foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from India. It is also expected to dent business margins as access to capital from the US will become expensive. Foreign funds have sold around $3 billion, mostly in Indian equities since August. Analysts however, said a hike in US interest rates will show that the US Fed is confident of the US economy's ability to start generating growth and employment. This will be beneficial for Indian exports to US. On the rupee front, if a hike takes place then a free fall is not being ruled-out. The RBI is however, expected to intervene and arrest the fall. The silver lining on the cloudy horizon is the hope that the US Fed will maintain interest rates accompanied with a fairly dovish outlook. This, said market observers, will spur the recovery in both equity and currency markets. Good buying was observed in banking, healthcare and auto sectors, while selling pressure was seen in consumer durables sector. Chinese shares rose sharply on Wednesday, after two days of decline and following gains overnight in US equities. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index went up 4.89% to end at 3,152.26 points. The Shenzhen Component Index rose 6.45% to close at 9,890.43 points. Total turnover on the two bourses was 566.78 billion yuan ($88.98 billion) -- up from the 477.61 billion yuan registered on Tuesday. China on Wednesday rebutted reports that it had recalled 1 trillion yuan of un-spent budgets from local governments, but said it is reallocating a much smaller amount of fiscal funds. US stocks rallied over 1% on Tuesday following positive data in the US.
