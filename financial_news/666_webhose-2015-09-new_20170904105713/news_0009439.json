That means customers will be able to order items online, select a time to pick them up, and have an employee deliver the food to their car when they arrive. Wal-Mart is currently offering the service in five other markets, part of a test that first began in 2011.\nThe move puts Wal-Mart in closer competition with companies tackling the online-grocery market, an area seen as an elusive prize ever since the original dot-com boom in the 1990s. Target has said it plans to aggressively go after grocery delivery and announced this month that it would begin testing a same-day grocery delivery service with Instacart Inc. in Minneapolis. Amazon, meanwhile, offers a $299-a-year service called AmazonFresh in certain markets. Google announced plans this month to begin testing a delivery service for groceries and fresh food later this year in San Francisco and one other city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:50:12.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
