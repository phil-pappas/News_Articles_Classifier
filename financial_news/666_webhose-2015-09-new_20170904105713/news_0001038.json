The contract was issued under the Architects and Engineers Technical Assistance Contract, which carries out the statutory authorities of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The contract has a six-month base period with an additional six-month option period. The undisclosed contract amount will be booked in the third quarter. \nFluor will support FEMA in the restoration of vital infrastructure, public facilities and services, rehabilitation and reconstruction of private and commercial properties, restoration of the economic base and coordination with voluntary agencies and administration of assistance to households and individuals. \n“We are proud to be part of this important humanitarian effort,” said Bruce Stanski, president of Fluor’s Government Group. “For almost two decades Fluor has consistently and successfully provided technical support services to the FEMA Public Assistance Program. Regionally, we have supported relief efforts for Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Katrina and Rita. Nationwide, we have assisted individuals and communities to recover from the devastation of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.” \nSince 1997, Fluor has worked closely with FEMA to provide technical assistance in disaster-stricken locations.

In 2005, Fluor played a vital role in supporting FEMA’s delivery of aid to victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and Fluor continues to provide disaster recovery support to restore infrastructure in Louisiana 10 years after the hurricanes. \nAbout Fluor Corporation \nFluor Corporation ( FLR ) is a global engineering and construction firm that designs and builds some of the world's most complex projects.
