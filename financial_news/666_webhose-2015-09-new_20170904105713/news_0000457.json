Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Australia and New Zealand Banking Group has signed on for a new five-year agreement valued at $450 million with IBM, which will provide technology to underpin its sprawling super-regional Asian strategy .\nThe new deal will give the bank access to all of the tech giant's products, and marks an upgrade on a long-standing commercial relationship between ANZ and IBM. As part of the deal, the two companies co-invest in a so-called innovation lab, in which ANZ developers will build, test and deploy new applications and services.\nANZ has followed a different technology strategy from its banking peers such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which won plaudits for its ambitious overhaul of ageing internal technology systems. Instead of a \"big bang\" core systems overhaul, the bank is focusing its $1.5 billion annual technology spending on building its networks in Asia, including a continued focus in China.\nANZ chief information officer Scott Collary told The Australian Financial Review , the new deal with IBM was significant for both companies, and would mean development work on its tech systems would now be completed quicker than in the past.\nAs well as housing developers, the innovation lab will be used to run hackathon events, in which the bank will tap into innovations from start-ups and other businesses.\nSupporting Asian growth \"We will use the lab to support the entire super-regional network. As we look at digital and data capability, a lot of that will be supported by the new hardware and software platforms and tested out in the lab,\" Mr Collary said.\n\"We have had a lot of IBM hardware and software in the past, it was very specific in terms of buying specific licenses or equipment, this new deal gives us the full range of its capabilities.\"\n The contract win is also significant for IBM, which is undergoing a tough few years as it seeks to transition to the change in corporate technology purchasing ushered in by cloud computing.\nIBM's managing director for Australia and New Zealand Kerry Purcell said the new deal was an important step in its 40-year relationship with ANZ.\n\"It has thrived on a mutual focus to use innovation to deliver unique experiences for the bank's customers. Bringing together the best of IBM innovation, industry-leading solutions and talent is how we continue to support the bank in its mission to be a super-regional bank,\" Mr Purcell said.\nThe deal will see ANZ using IBM's cloud products such as the Bluemix platform that enables developers to build, test and deploy new applications and services at a fraction of the time and cost it would previously have taken. ANZ will also deploy IBM's new z13 Mainframe and POWER8 infrastructure to its own private cloud computing environment.\nThe bank said the upgraded infrastructure would be more reliable, secure and would be better equipped to service the needs of mobile customers across the bank's network.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-08-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:12:19.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
