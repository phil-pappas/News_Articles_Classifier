He hopes to overturn this veto quickly to allow corporate donations to parties in next October's local elections.\nRenan Calheiros, President of the Senate, said the joint-session could still be held later on Wednesday.\nThe spending bills that Rousseff vetoed include a hefty average 59 percent increase in salaries of judiciary employees, adding 36 billion reais to state payrolls over four years.\nRousseff's government has projected an unprecedented primary budget deficit of 35.5 billion reais in 2016. The primary deficit, which excludes spending for interest payments, was one of the motives that led ratings agency Standard & Poor's to downgrade Brazil's debt to junk status earlier this month.\n($1 = 3.9669 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Anthony Boadle ; Editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:46:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
