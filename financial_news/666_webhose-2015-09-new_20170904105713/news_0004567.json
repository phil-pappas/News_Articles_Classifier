Where a decade ago many women were held to ridiculous grooming standards just to hold down a job, now they work in a pair of Keen hiking shoes and Columbia trail pants.\nTwo of the highest-profile Australasian outdoor manufacturers – Kathmandu and Phoenix Leisure Group (BlackWolf, Vigilante) – are now designing outdoor clothing and footwear with a fashion edge.\n\"It has to be the best of both worlds,\" head of sales and marketing at Phoenix, Steve Edmonds says. \"Our jackets have to be windproof, water-resistant, warm and durable. They have to be technically up to the task, but also good-looking enough you want to wear them. The market is fashion-meets-function.\"\nTechnical lifestyler: Vigilante makes technical outdoor clothing but it’s often worn in the suburbs. Edmonds says the days of technical functionality and zero fashion sensibility are gone. Just as four-wheel drive vehicles have to take you anywhere in suburban comfort, the clothing that will keep you warm and dry on the Overland Track must also be at home in the 'burbs.\n\"We saw this with board shorts. They are tough, quick-dry garments designed for surf sports, but now we live in them.\"\nUS led outdoor trend The United States has lead the outdoor trend with brands such as The North Face and Columbia using technical fabrics and construction, but deployed in different ratios depending on the usage.\n \"Our Vigilante brand is the Columbia of Australia,\" Edmonds says. \"We design for a core outdoor consumer and a lifestyle consumer.\"\nSo a pair of Vigilante hiking pants may be made of rip-stop, fast-dry, UV-protected polyester, while the lifestyle version might use a cotton-blend because they're more comfortable to sit in.\nEdmonds says the Vigilante brand's head designer is from a streetwear background and the brand also keeps the \"traveller\" market happy, with jeans and shirts for the outdoorsy tourist.\nThis year's IBISWorld report on the outdoor retail industry, Breaking Camp , shows the outdoor business dominated by two retailers – Kathmandu and Super Retail Group (BCF, Anaconda) – who between them have 40 per cent of the $1.2 billion retail industry. But IBISWorld finds the outdoorsy trend isn't always a money-spinner for traditional camping and hiking stores. Not only are healthy people going to the gym rather than the mountains, but they buy fashion items that look technical, rather than the real thing with a fashion element.\nSo IBIS is forecasting outdoor retail sales to grow by only 0.2 per cent a year to 2020-21, and for the outdoor stores to chase fashion consumers to maintain their profits.\nCan't sell 'daggy' any more Managing director of Paddy Pallin, Tim Pallin, says it has been many years since a store like his could sell something daggy. \"The fashion aspect in outdoor clothing is now absolutely expected.\"\nAt the same time, functional design is the main allure of hiking boots and action pants for the pavement adventurer.\n\"The major reason is comfort and utility,\" says Pallin, whose 11 national stores have stuck with the outdoors end of the market. \"You can spend all day in this gear, in great comfort.\"\nPalling says the mainstreaming of technical wear through mega-stores such as Anaconda and BCF has improved the technology while also stretching the appeal. This has confused the market because urban wearers are not as engaged in the \"proof-points\" of outdoor gear, as climbers or skiers.\n\"Urban customers often have less expertise so they are driven by price and brand – if it's more expensive and they recognise the brand, it must be better.\"\nNot every participant in the outdoor industry can move into fashion. One Planet, the Melbourne-based maker of technical outdoor gear, enjoys a steady business but it sticks with the technical end of the market.\nCan't go fashion route \"We make gear for people going to Antarctica and workers on the Overland Track,\" One Planet owner, Andrew King says. \"The market is moving to fashion but it's a direction we can't go in.\"\nKing says a growing trend is the technical \"look\" – clothing and accessories that look as if they could hack a week of trekking, but would probably start leaking in the middle of day two.\nHe says the technical fabrics that are breathable and waterproof – Gore-Tex is the most famous – have come down in weight and increased in water resistance in the past 20 years, but their durability has fallen because urban wearers don't demand ruggedness.\nThe dilution is not just about breathability ratings or Gore-Tex membranes, which in 30 years have reduced from 250 grams per square metre to 50. There are simpler differences: most 20 to 30-litre daypacks are now sold with 5-millimetre zips, making the zip the weak point. One Planet daypacks use 10-millimetre zips, because outdoors people demand the durability.\nThe highest-profile outdoor brand in Australasia is Kathmandu, and it is unique because it designs and manufactures its brands, then wholesales and distributes those brands to 160 of its retail sites.\n\"We pursue a hybridisation approach to our products,\" says Ben Ryan, group product manager at Kathmandu. \"They fulfil fundamental performance needs for serious outdoor people, without compromising the appeal for everyday wear.\"\n'Human-based design' Kathmandu has moved out of the mountain sports and camping/hiking niche it occupied when it was started in the late 1980s, and now designs for three consumers: mountain sports, adventure-traveller and lifestyle.\n\"We have to include fashion in our products, but we're not a fashion brand,\" Ryan says. \"We're human-based design – it's more than aesthetics, it's a solution.\"\nRyan says the hybridisation trend means maintaining a very close watch on what consumers want in their clothing. It throws up interesting trends, especially in the 18 to 30-year-old cohort.\n\"We now make a tough, rugged backpack for the mountain sports customers, and in the urban version we include an RFID-blocker so you can't have your credit cards skimmed through your pack.\"\nBut as the $1.2 billion outdoor industry morphs into fashion and lifestyle, Kathmandu is finding that what the 18 to 30-year-olds really want isn't simply warmer, dryer, lighter.\n\"They want a conversation with a brand that's committed to sustainability and social responsibility,\" Ryan says, especially in the sourcing of down, wool and cotton.\"\nWhich means the Bear Grylls of the future may not be able to eat what he kills. But he will certainly be wearing something that wasn't nasty to geese and sheep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:05:14.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
