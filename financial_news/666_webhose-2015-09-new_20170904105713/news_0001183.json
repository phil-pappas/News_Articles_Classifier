Preclinical data demonstrating the potential of IPI-549 to disrupt the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and enable a heightened anti-tumor immune response are being presented today at The Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. In vitro data showed that IPI-549 blocks both the migration of murine myeloid cells and the differentiation of myeloid cells to the M2 phenotype, which is a type of myeloid cell known to promote cancer growth and suppress anti-tumor immune responses. In vivo data in murine solid tumor models demonstrated that IPI-549 treatment also decreased tumor-associated myeloid cells found in the immune suppressive microenvironment. Additionally, IPI-549 treatment increased the number of intratumoral CD8+ T-cells, which are known to play a role in inhibiting tumor growth. IPI-549 demonstrated dose-dependent, single-agent, anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor models, including murine models of lung, colon and breast cancer. Additionally, mice treated with IPI-549 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors showed greater tumor growth inhibition than either treatment as a monotherapy. Preclinical in vivo data also demonstrated that T-cells are required for the anti-tumor activity of IPI-549, which is a hallmark of immunotherapy. \n7:39 am Freeport-McMoRan completes its $1 bln ATM common stock offering, announces filing of prospectus to sell an additional $1 bln in ATM sales of common stock; provides update on strategic actions ( FCX ) : \nFCX intends to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and other borrowings and the financing of working capital and capital expenditures.
