It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) didn't even bother to find out what the rules were and its badly thought out marketing campaign made people's lives a misery.\" \nThe investigation also found that the calls were misleading because the solar panels being marketed were not necessarily free as implied by the recorded message. \nPaul Santoni, the solicitor representing the company, said: \"Home Energy and Lifestyle Management had in fact stopped using the campaign before the ICO investigation commenced. \n\"(It) used a reputable third party company to provide software for the marketing campaign and for the making of all calls, which were carried out by an automatic dialing machine.\" \nAccording to Mr Santoni, Home Energy and Lifestyle Management will appeal the decision and will also be taking proceedings against the Third Party Company in relation to this issue. \nThe £200,000 fine will be reduced by 20% if an early repayment is made. \nThe company, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, is also part of the Government's controversial Green Deal energy efficiency initiative which is to be scrapped following low take up. \nJust last week the ICO handed out another cold-calling fine to a company called Cold Calls Elimination - the £75,000 sanction was issued for making unsolicited marketing calls. \nAccording to data from the ICO the most common topic for automated nuisance calls is Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), whilst 'live' calls most regularly relate to accident claims. \n:: Have you made a complaint over cold calling?
