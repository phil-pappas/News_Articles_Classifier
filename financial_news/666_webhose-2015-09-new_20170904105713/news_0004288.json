Elaine Thompson Share on twitter by Angus Grigg China is set to introduce a nation-wide emissions trading scheme by 2017, in a further sign of how the world's biggest polluter is reducing its reliance on coal in a bid to clean up its chronic air pollution.\nPresident Xi Jinping is expected to make the announcement on Friday in Washington, where he is meeting his American counterpart Barack Obama.\nCiting Obama administration officials, The New Times, said the cap and trade scheme would begin in 2017 and aims to halt the growth in China's emissions by 2030.\nThe move by Beijing should help strength any agreement reached at United Nationals climate talks in Paris later this year and will put further pressure on the new Turnbull Government in Australia to take stronger action on climate change.\nThe expected climate announcement will have significant implications for Australia's coal industry and for the global shift to controlling emissions. MICK TSIKAS The deal builds on an agreement between China and United States struck in November 2011 where Beijing agreed to generate 20 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. It also said its emission would peak around 2030, but gave no details on how this would be achieved.\nAt the same time Mr Obama said he would use administrative measures to reduce US emissions by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025.\nThe climate agreement between Washington and Beijing is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise fractions relationship between the world's two super powers.\nBut it is further bad news for the Australian coal industry which is suffering from low prices due to declining demand in China.\n China's coal consumption was flat last year and is expected to decline this year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-25T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:05:57.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
