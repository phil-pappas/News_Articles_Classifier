All these issues make Brazil a less attractive place to do business,\" Peter Dixon of Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) said. \n\"If you are exposed to emerging markets, you have to try to find other markets that are doing better.\" \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.6 percent at 1,426.91 points by 0930 GMT after rising 1.4 percent in the previous session. \nLingering concerns about the pace of economic growth in China, the world's biggest metals consumer, hit mining stocks, with the STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index falling 1.5 percent.

The producer price index retreated 5.9 percent in August from the same period last year, its 42nd consecutive month of decline. \n\"Chinese producer prices have been slowing for more than three years now so another month of declines shouldn't really come as a great surprise. But the market appears to be hyper-sensitive to Chinese economic data at the moment,\" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , said. \nGerman utility E.ON fell 4.7 percent after saying it would book a significant net loss in 2015. \nOn the positive side, Next rose nearly 2 percent after Britain's second-largest clothing retailer by sales value posted a 7.1 percent rise in first-half profit. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:29:58.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
