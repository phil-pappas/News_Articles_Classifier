( AGX ) today announced financial results for its second quarter and six month period ended July 31, 2015. \nSecond Quarter 2015 Highlights: \nRevenues of $97.4 million for the current quarter vs. $85.5 million in the first quarter ended April 30 th . Revenues of $182.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2015 vs. $153.2 million for the six months ended July 31, 2014. Net income attributable to our stockholders was $11.3 million and $18.8 million for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2015 vs. $8.6 million and $12.0 million for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2014. EBITDA attributable to our stockholders was $19.4 million for the current quarter and $31.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2015. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled just under $300 million at quarter-end. Our continued strong management of two large, gas-fired power plant projects has resulted in increased revenues and gross profit for the six months ending July 31, 2015 vs. the same period in 2014. Year to date revenues increased by $29.7 million to $182.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2015. Our year to date gross profit increased to $49.7 million, or 27% of corresponding revenues, from $31.6 million, or 21% of corresponding revenues, for the six month period July 31, 2014. For the current quarter, revenues declined slightly to $97.4 million. However, our gross profit for the current quarter increased to $28.5 million, or 29% of corresponding revenues, from $21.6 million, or 21% of corresponding revenues, for last year’s second quarter. \nDue primarily to the strong performance of the power industry services business, net income attributable to our stockholders for the second quarter was $11.3 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to our stockholders of $8.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share for the second quarter last year. Net income attributable to our stockholders for the six months ended July 31, 2015 was $18.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, and was $12.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year. \nLikewise, consolidated EBITDA attributable to our stockholders increased by $5.5 million to $19.4 million for the current quarter, and increased by $12.5 million to $31.9 million for the six months ended July 31, 2015. \nContract backlog increased during the current quarter to $660 million from $345 million at the end of the first quarter due to the addition of our recently announced EPC contract with Moxie Freedom. Subsequent to the quarter ended July 31, 2015, we added contract value of approximately $650 million to our backlog as a result of three EPC contracts; a $100 million contract with Exelon and 2 contracts totaling $550 million with NTE Energy. \nCommenting on Argan’s second quarter results, Rainer Bosselmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our effective management of large gas-fired power projects has resulted in consistently strong revenues and gross margins. We look forward to the next three to five years, given our strong and improved backlog.” \nAbout Argan, Inc. \nArgan’s primary business is providing a full range of services to the power industry including the engineering, procurement and construction of gas-fired and biomass-fired power plants, along with related commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development and consulting services, through its Gemma Power Systems and Atlantic Projects Company operations.
