A fortnight ago, HDFC Bank reduced its base rate — the floor rate below which banks do not lend — by 0.35 percentage points to 9.35%, the lowest in the industry. However, none of the large commercial banks, including State Bank of India and ICICI Bank , announced even a marginal cut. The top two banks have pegged their base rate at 9.70%. Senior bankers do not expect any migration of loans to HDFC Bank due to the rate cut. \"I don't think it will create a threat to the remaining banking industry because credit demand is not rate sensitive. It is sensitive to the economic demand,\" said Kishor Kharat, managing director and chief executive of state-run IDBI Bank. \"Today, there is no demand in the economy.\" He said the private bank could lower rate because it has low establishment cost and lower share of bad loans. According to analysts, HDFC Bank was able to cut its base rate sharply because its average cost of deposits was lower than peer banks. Its share of low-cost deposits — current and savings account, or CASA — is 40% of all loans. Secondly, only 20-25% of its loan book is linked to base rate. \"HDFC Bank, having just 20-25% base rate-linked loans and +40% CASA is likely to see minimal margin pressure,\" said a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This means that 75% of HDFC Bank's loans are linked to a fixed rate and thus the new rate will not benefit all its borrowers. In effect, the bank's margin will not be as much hurt with the fall in its rates. Speaking to media at the launch of its mobile app-cum-wallet, Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma also ruled out the possibility of banks sharply lowering their rates. However, during an interview with ET Now, Aditya Puri, MD and CEO of HDFC Bank, said he expected rates in the economy to come down. \"Base rate, at least for our own bank, has come down by almost 1%. So, will interest rates come down? I would say they will. Is it a component that would help in growth? I believe it would. Is it the only component? I don't think so. Do I expect interest rates to go down? Yes , I do.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T21:00:32.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
