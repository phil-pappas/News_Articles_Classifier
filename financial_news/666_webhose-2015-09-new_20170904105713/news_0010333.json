Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates Banks say a growing number of customers are getting in touch to change their investor home loan to an owner-occupied loan, after interest rate rises targeted at landlords revealed gaps in lenders' records.\nFor the first time since the 1990s, banks are charging housing investors higher interest rates than owner-occupiers, part of their response to regulators' concerns that the housing market is overheated.\nThe change threatens to catch out borrowers living in properties that they used to rent to tenants, because their bank may not be aware they are now owner-occupiers.\nThese customers previously had little incentive to tell their lender they had moved into the home, but banking giants Westpac and ANZ Bank say a growing number of these borrowers are now contacting them to prove they are in fact owner-occupiers.\nIndustry sources said the trend was likely to affect thousands of customers across the country and may weaken the rate of investor loan growth expressed in official statistics.\nThe trend highlights the complexity for the banks' internal systems of charging higher interest rates for investors, and adds to uncertainty over the statistics on housing investor lending, after ANZ and National Australia Bank have in recent months reclassified billions of dollars worth of owner-occupied loans as money borrowed by investors.\nDavid Ryman, a mortgage broker at Yellow Brick Road, is one such customer who has changed his home loan from an investor mortgage to an owner-occupied mortgage.\nAfter buying a property with his partner two years ago and initially renting it out, they have now moved in.\n While Mr Ryman knew to alert the bank to the change, and only a \"small percentage\" of his clients had needed to update their records in this way, he said there was a \"big chance\" other borrowers could be caught out.\n\"People are very dormant in relation to their finances. When changes like this happen, most people don't even know what interest rate they are paying, let alone whether they should be on a different type of rate,\" he said.\n\"There would be plenty of people who are unaware of the change and are basically sitting on a rate that's higher than it should be.\"\nTo change an investor loan to an owner-occupied loan, customers must prove to the bank they are living in the property, which often requires providing a licence or utility bill.\nWestpac confirmed a growing number of customers had contacted it to change their loan from housing investor to owner-occupied since the bank announced it would raise interest rates for investors by 0.27 percentage points in July.\n\"We are seeing an increase â€“ and that this increase is industry wide,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"We are proactively seeking out customers in order for them to update their records, as you would expected after such a change in policy.\"\nANZ Bank also confirmed the trend, which it is reporting to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\"We expect this will have a downward impact on the size of our investor portfolio and we are keeping the regulator updated,\" an ANZ spokesman said.\nNational Australia Bank has not been affected by the same trend, as its rate rise was for interest-only customers rather than investors. A NAB spokesman confirmed some customers had since switched into principal and interest loans. The Commonwealth Bank, the country's largest home lender, did not comment.\nAPRA has capped housing investor loan growth at 10 per cent a year, but UBS analyst Jonathan Mott this week said credit statistics were \"too noisy to extrapolate\" after the recent data reclassifications and a wide range of changes to lending policies.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042"], "published": "2015-09-02T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:06:47.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
