The group said it expected the slow pace of growth to continue, resulting in financial results which were “at the bottom end of the range of current market expectations.” \nIn addition to those improvements in the group’s existing sites, Mitchells & Butlers opened 14 new sites and converted another 48 locations. \nThat includes 38 of the Orchid pubs that the group acquired in June 2014. These have been turned into branded pubs under names such as Toby Carvery, Ember Inns, Miller & Carter and Harvester. \nAnother 40 conversions are planned for next year. \nChairman Bob Ivell welcomed Mr Urban and thanked Mr Darby for his work at the group. \n\"The non-executive directors have considered the issue of the leadership of M&B very carefully and are delighted to announce Phil's appointment. Phil is a strong leader with industry experience and a proven track record of operational delivery, who we are confident will build on the progress made under Alistair,” said Mr Ivell. \nMr Urban was previously managing director at Grosvenor Casinos; before that he worked in Whitbread’s pub restaurant division , and Scottish and Newcastle Retail’s restaurants and accommodation division. \nHe will receive a basic salary of £510,000 as chief executive, while Mr Darby will receive payment of £543,500 in lieu of his one-year notice period. The outgoing boss will be eligible for any bonuses in from this year’s work, but the firm said it does not expect him to hit the threshold for any performance-based payouts (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:57:56.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
