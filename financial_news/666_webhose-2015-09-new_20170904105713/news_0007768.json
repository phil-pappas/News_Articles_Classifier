So, for a laugh or two, thankfully there is a new book called “Where’s Karl?”\nIt features illustrations in the style of “Where’s Waldo?” but in lieu of searching, in crowd scenes, for a bespectacled man in a red-and-white shirt and cap, you look for the fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and his cat Choupette at places like Art Basel Miami Beach and in St. Moritz. The book, the first in a probable series, was created by Stacey Caldwell, who works at Thakoon, and Ajiri A. Aki, a fashion video producer, with illustrations by Michelle Baron.\n“Everyone in fashion complains about how they hate traveling,” said Ms. Caldwell at a party for the book at Barneys New York on Wednesday, where cardboard cutouts of Mr. Lagerfeld filled the ninth floor and waiters passed cookies featuring the visage of the black-clad designer. “We love our own miseries. Everyone is such a character. You have to laugh.”\n“That’s critical,” added Simon Doonan . “Fashion should never be too formal or stuffy. That would feel very 19th century.”\nENLARGE One of Mr. Anthony’s dishes Photo: Elizabeth Lippman/Bon Appetit Down at One World Trade Center, now an epicenter of fashion in this city because it houses Condé Nast Publications, a rather serious dinner was under way in the Bon Appétit test kitchen. This was a kickoff for the monthlong program of Lauren Bush Lauren’s Feed self-started suppers, which raise money for childhood hunger.\nThere was no kidding around at this meal, which was cooked by chef Michael Anthony of Untitled at the Whitney. It included tomato-and-melon sashimi, as well as tilefish with summer squash, shell beans and peppers and corn salad with freekeh, salsa and Parmesan.\nIn a conversation with Bon Appétit editor Adam Rapoport, Mr. Anthony called tilefish an “up-and-coming fish.”\nMs. Bush Lauren, who will give birth to her first child in November, is about to embark on a tour of several of the Feed dinners that take place around the nation. Does she surprise the diners Taylor Swift-style when she shows up?\n“No, but that would be fun,” Ms. Bush Lauren laughed, digging into her peanut butter-and-concord jelly cake. “Maybe next year, I’ll pop out of the super stew.”\nENLARGE TK Quann, Cipriana Quann== The Worldwide Editors of Harper's Bazaar Celebrate ICONS by Carine Roitfeld and Jean-Paul Goude - Arrivals== The Plaza Hotel, NY== September 16, 2015== ©Patrick McMullan== Photo - Sean Zanni / PatrickMcMullan.com== == Photo: Sean Zanni / PatrickMcMullan.com Over in Midtown, the Plaza was, indeed, a super stew of most everyone who would like to be relevant in fashion right now, including the comedic Instagrammer the Fat Jew (who had his own comedic fashion show that afternoon, featuring clothes for dads), 17-year-old model Lucky Blue Smith , Kendall Jenner, Kate Upton, Jaden Smith and Rita Ora.\nThe party celebrated Harpers Bazaar’s second Icons portfolio by Carine Roitfeld and Jean-Paul Goude. Everyone was asked to wear black tie, and, amazingly, they did. Upon attending, they were plied with Covergirl lipsticks and Moët Champagne and the opportunity to pretend they weren’t gawking at each other’s unmitigated beauty or expensive clothes in an overcrowded room while waiting for Katy Perry to perform.\nENLARGE Carine Roitfeld and Jaden Smith Photo: Nicholas Hunt / PatrickMcMullan. This was a facsimile of what the CW thinks a fashion party looks like and that, under the best circumstances, could be an extremely fun thing. But the frustrating layout of the hotel make this event look better in aerial shots than in reality, and the poor acoustics in the Plaza ballroom didn’t help Ms. Perry, even though she was backed by a trumpet, a trombone and was dressed like a tree in autumn, complete with actual butterflies dancing around her.\nThe truth is, the Icons party was straight out of a crowd scene in “Where’s Karl?”, though Mr. Lagerfeld was nowhere to be found. Perhaps he was in St. Moritz, eating a cookie featuring himself as he looked for himself, with a Chanel magnifying glass, in the depths of the book’s pages.\nWrite to Marshall Heyman at marshall.heyman@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI874_nyscen_FR_20150917133338.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI890_nyscen_H_20150917134935.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI890_nyscen_M_20150917134935.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI875_nyscen_FR_20150917133338.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:18:28.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
