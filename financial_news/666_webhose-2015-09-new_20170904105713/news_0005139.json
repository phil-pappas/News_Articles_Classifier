The increase, expected for months, would be the centerpiece of a budget that is $426 million out of balance .\nMolly Poppe, a city spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond to e-mail or voicemail queries about the plan.\nChicago needs to pay down a $20 billion debt to its retirement funds that’s left it with a lower credit rating than any big U.S. city except Detroit, which went through a record bankruptcy.\n“It serves as a clear demonstration of Chicago’s willingness to make the difficult but necessary decisions,” Ty Schoback, a senior analyst in Minneapolis at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said in an e-mail. The company manages about $30 billion in municipal bonds, including some Chicago debt.\nThe city faces a reckoning after years of failing to save enough to pay the benefits it promised employees. Over the past decade, Chicago has put $7.3 billion less into the pension funds than actuaries recommended. Its next annual pension payment is projected to jump 10 percent, to $976 million.\nChicago’s effort to reduce its liabilities hit an obstacle in July, when a judge ruled the benefits cuts it sought were illegal. The city will appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, which in May threw out a pension overhaul adopted by the state, saying workers’ pensions are protected.\nThe challenges and subsequent credit downgrades have spurred a drop in the price of Chicago bonds. A portion of $44.9 million of federally tax-exempt securities maturing in 2033 traded Thursday at an average of 91.8 cents on the dollar. That’s down from $1.01 when it was first offered in 2014. The yield averaged 6 percent Thursday, 3.2 percentage points more than benchmark debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:37:23.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
