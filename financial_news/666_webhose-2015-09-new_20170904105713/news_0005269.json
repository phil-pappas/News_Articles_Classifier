ECB President Mario Draghi warned conditions could worsen.\nThe revisions raise doubts about the effectiveness of the ECB's $1 trillion-euro asset-buying program, which is aimed at stimulating growth and boosting consumer prices after years of low inflation.\nDraghi said inflation risks remained to the downside, mainly because of low crude oil prices, and that the bond-buying program would run at least another year.\n\"Draghi at his press conference raised the risk of additional monetary support by the central bank,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. \"We were expecting some dovish comments, and he delivered.\"\nDuring Draghi's news conference, the euro dropped 1.4 percent against the dollar to touch a two-week low of $1.1108. It was last off 0.90 percent at $1.1122 after earlier this week reaching a high of $1.1332 as investors spooked by markets turmoil in China moved heavily into the euro and yen.\nThe euro also sank against the yen and was last down 1.1 percent at 133.48 yen.\nThe greenback was also up against most other major currencies, with the dollar index last ahead 0.60 percent. The dollar declined 0.20 percent against the yen to 120.09 yen.\nWeekly unemployment claims data bolstered optimism about U.S. economic growth, as did a government report showing the U.S. trade deficit fell in July to a five-month low on a broad increase in exports.\nThe Institute for Supply Management reported its services industry index slipped to 59 last month from a reading of 60.3 in July, which was the highest since August 2005.\nMeanwhile, the Swedish crown surged to a six-week high of 9.3755 crowns per euro after Sweden's central bank kept rates unchanged.
