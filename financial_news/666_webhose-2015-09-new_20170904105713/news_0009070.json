Fairfax by Lisa Murray China's coal imports are forecast to fall dramatically over the next five years due to the slowing economy, a move toward greener fuels and government protection of local miners.\nAmong the most bearish on the outlook for Australia's second-biggest export is Capital Economics .\nThe independent research group's commodities economist Tom Pugh said at the end of this decade China's thermal coal imports, which have fallen by almost a third so far this year, could be \"at virtually nothing\".\nWhile Indonesia will be hit particularly hard, Capital expects even imports of high-quality Australian coal are likely to suffer.\nHis comments come as new figures show China's electricity from coal-fired power generation fell 2.2 per cent in the first eight months of the year, while electricity from hydro and nuclear power, rose 5.7 per cent and 33.9 per cent respectively.\nThey also follow President Xi Jinping's announcement last week that China will introduce a nation-wide emissions trading scheme in 2017 as part of efforts to reduce chronic air pollution in its major cities.\n'Political move' \"This is just another political move by the government to move away from burning coal,\" Mr Pugh said from London.\n \"At the same time, China is promoting the use of domestic coal and improving transport links between mines and power plants. Even if Chinese coal demand doesn't fall as sharply as we think, that doesn't mean they will still be importing lots of coal.\"\nSuch a shift would actually be a return to business as usual. With its ample domestic reserves and substantial production capacity, China has historically been self-sufficient in thermal coal.\nThat changed in 2009 when it became a net importer because of a jump in demand and the relatively cheap prices for imports, particularly for cities in China's south. Much of the country's coal deposits are in the north and have to be shipped by sea to southern locations, which attracts additional transportation costs.\nHowever, just as demand is being crimped by slowing economic activity and the government's more pro-active environmental policies, that price competitiveness is also eroding.\n\"Not only is the Chinese economy going through a structural change which is reducing overall coal demand, but the price gap between Australian and domestic coal has narrowed substantially,\" said Wang Xufeng, an analyst at Shanxi Fenwei Energy Consulting Company. \"It is now less than 10 yuan ($2.24) per tonne.\"\nIf you add in storage costs, Australian coal is more expensive, he added. Mr Wang expects Australian coal imports to China will fall significantly in the second half.\n\"I have been talking with a lot of coal traders and they are taking a wait-and-see approach,\" he said. \"Unless Australia lowers the price, we will see a dramatic decrease of Australian coal imports.\"\nAnother issue for the level of China's coal imports is the retreat of private commodities traders due to the uncertain outlook.\n\"Lots of coal traders have left the market because it has become a high-risk business with slim profit margins,\" said Lin Xiaotao, an energy analyst at ICIS consulting.\nMs Lin noted China's coal imports from Australia fell 35 per cent in August from a year ago and she expected that decline to steepen.\nShe also said the tariff reductions for coal under the China-Australia free trade agreement would not be enough to improve price competitiveness.\nWith Lucy Gao", "external_links": ["https://www.capitaleconomics.com/"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:44:20.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
