The firm modelled the possibility of a government involvement.\nIt was this work which led to the decision to put the infrastructure project out to tender with the trade-off being a government guarantee of the debt required to fund the construction.\nThe competitive bidding process for the North East Gas Interconnector closes next week.\nIt has attracted interest from all the leading industry players including APA Group .\nIt is estimated that the NT has more than 200 trillion cubic feet of gas resources in six onshore basins and 30 trillion cubic feet of offshore reserves. All of the Territory's gas basins are under active exploration.\n Although LNG export is an option, while the Eastern Coast gas market is experiencing unprecedented demand and price increases, it too is an attractive market for NT gas.\nThe tender has managed to deal with the traditional need by pipeline companies to have low utilisation risk before proceeding to construction.\nWithout the pipeline NT-based explorers will not invest to commercialise even known or highly-prospective gas fields.\nIt is estimated a pipeline will deliver direct economic benefits of about $1 billion in the NT and $3 billion nationally.\nMacquarie chair change It is fitting that someone directly involved in one of the best deals ever done by Macquarie Group should end up leading its board of directors.\nWhat is unusual about the appointment of Peter Warne as chairman of Macquarie is that he was on the other side of the brilliant transaction by Macquarie in 1999 to buy the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.\nThat was a seminal transaction because Macquarie paid virtually nothing for a business that was a veritable money machine and was overflowing with extraordinary talent.\nWarne, who replaces Kevin McCann from March 31 next year, was head of the financial markets group at Bankers Trust Australia in 1999 when Macquarie became the new owner.\nHe will take over as chairman at a challenging time for diversified financial services groups like Macquarie.\nFinancial markets are more volatile than ever. High-frequency trading and the widespread use of algorithms have escalated the risks involved in financial markets-facing businesses.\nCentral banks are struggling to understand how to stimulate investment and investors are uncertain if they will be able to come to the rescue if there is another crisis.\nWhile Macquarie is growing its revenue and profits from its annuity-style funds management businesses there are signs of a bubble emerging in infrastructure markets.\nWarne's rise to the head of the Macquarie board table is unusual because it means that none of the outstanding Macquarie alumni who have been in the orbit of the company for the past decade managed the switch to the boardroom.\nCompare that with Wesfarmers which stands out for its unique culture.\nIt recently appointed a former chief executive of the company Michael Chaney as chairman to replace Bob Every.\nChaney's moves in recent times have been interesting because they provide some indication of what might happen at Macquarie. He did not leave National Australia Bank until he had found a new chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, to replace Cameron Clyne.\nAt Macquarie, McCann's departure has all the signs of the organisation being caught on the hop.\nThe most obvious replacement for McCann was perceived to be Gordon Cairns. But he is facing two challenging appointments at the same time: Woolworths and Origin Energy.\nCairns is ranked among the elite in Australian business able to take on a tough boardroom challenge. Others who fit this bill are Catherine Livingstone at Telstra and Diane Smith-Gander at Transfield.\nWarne has work to do if he is to leave the sort of legacy that is attached to some of the legendary bank chairman in Australia.\nAmong them were Charles Goode from ANZ Banking Group and John Uhrig who chaired Westpac following its near-death experience in the 1990s.\nThe appointment of Warne will inevitably viewed through the prism of succession planning at Macquarie.\nThat is a perennial topic even though chief executive Nicholas Moore has earned the right to name his own departure date. He has been CEO for seven years.\nThere are echoes of Wesfarmers in the Moore career path. Chaney stayed for more than a decade and his successor Richard Goyder is on track to do the same.\nMoore will want to go out on a high. Based on the latest profit forecasts Macquarie is travelling as well as it has since the financial crisis.\nMoore's predecessor, Allan Moss, went out on a high in February 2008, just before the crisis hit.\nSoul Patts and Brickworks Lawyers are usually the only winners when publicly-listed companies face off in court. That is turning out to be the case in the long-running battle between Perpetual and Brickworks over its cross shareholding in Washington H. Soul Pattinson.\nBrickworks revealed on Thursday it spent $1.6 million in the year to July 31 on the costs of litigation between itself and Perpetual and M.H. Carnegie & Co. It would be fair to assume total legal fees of more than $3 million so far.\nThis all started in October 2013, when Carnegie and Perpetual called a general meeting of Brickworks to appoint a new independent director and vote on the cancellation by Soul Pattinson of all shares held by Brickworks in Soul Pattinson and the receipt by Brickworks of consideration for the shares so cancelled.\nBrickworks commenced proceedings against Carnegie and Perpetual in the Federal Court and Carnegie and Perpetual served cross-claims against Brickworks and Soul Patts. The meeting has been cancelled and Brickworks terminated proceedings.\nCarnegie terminated its cross-claims against Brickworks and Soul Patts but Perpetual is proceeding with its cross-claims which seek to have the cross shareholding between Soul Patts and Brickworks unwound. Soul Patts is defending Perpetual's cross-claim.\nDuring a procedural hearing last week, Perpetual sought discovery of documents. Brickworks said on Thursday this would take months.\nAt the core of this fight is the claim by Perpetual that unwinding the cross shareholdings between Soul Patts and Brickworks will release up to $1.7billion in hidden value. Hunter Green this year valued Soul Patts at about $23 a share. The stock trades at a 40 per cent discount to this number.\nFinancial results released on Thursday show the gross value of the Soul Patts share portfolio was $5.5 billion at July 31, 2015. That compares to the market capitalisation of Soul Patts of $3.4 billion. The bulk of the value in the portfolio is the 26.9 per cent holding in TPG Telecom.\nSoul Patts said the tax payable if all of these assets were sold would have been about $1.1 billion. It has to be said Soul Patts and Brickworks continue to deliver sound returns for shareholders.\nDirectors of Brickworks said its investment in Soul Patts returned an underlying contribution of $54.6 million for the year ended July 31, up 23 per cent from $44.4 million in the previous corresponding period.\nThis was due primarily to increased underlying earnings in TPG Telecom and New Hope Corporation. The statutory contribution from Soul Patts was $29 million, after including significant items associated with non-cash impairments in subsidiaries New Hope Corporation and CopperChem.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-24T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:06:05.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
