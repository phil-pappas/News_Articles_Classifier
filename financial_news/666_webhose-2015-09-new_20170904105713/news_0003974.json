Rob Homer Share on twitter by Patrick Commins Is this the year BHP finally beats CBA?\nThe last time the mining giant's shares had a better year than the banking behemoth's was in 2010. Since then it has been nothing but tears for those unlucky souls who bought in at the beginning of 2011. Their $100 invested then is now worth $57, or $68 if they reinvested their dividends (instead of spending them shopping online when our dollar was worth more than the greenback – remember that?).\nThe happy CBA shareholder's stock is now worth close to $150, and almost $200 on a total return basis.\nBut maybe 2015 has the look of a watershed year for beleaguered BHP investors, which, let's face it, is just about everybody in this country with a superannuation account. So far the two ASX titans' shares are neck and neck, both around a dismal 12 per cent lower.\nIt must be said it's a case of the banks losing their shine rather than miners coming roaring back into favour, but for the contrarian-minded investor, this past week served up three tentative signs we are approaching peak pessimism in commodities markets. First we had Glencore capitulating, announcing a capital raising and cancelling dividends ; then a news report showed listed miners now make up the smallest ever proportion of global market capitalisation outside the dotcom boom ; and, finally, Woodside announced its opportunistic tilt at Oil Search – classic bottom-of-the-cycle stuff.\nUnfortunately, the bad news that nobody was talking about this past week was that the big broking firms, in the words of Credit Suisse analysts, were \"copping a reality check\" and finally admitting that, after halving in 2015, oil prices are going to stay lower for longer than they had expected nine months ago.\nWhich is where BHP comes in, and why its embattled shareholders (again, most of us) may see its losing streak against CBA extend to a frustrating fifth straight year: an extended lower oil price environment would undermine management's promise never to take a backward step on dividends.\n\"Value investors out there are buying BHP on a yield of 7 to 7.5 per cent, which is apparently attractive until you understand that there are forecasts out there of the company earning half what it's paying out,\" says Pengana Capital portfolio manager Tim Schroeders.\n Those forecasts are from the aforementioned Credit Suisse, which, after the oil downgrades, has slashed its profit forecasts and now has the company earning US60¢ (85¢) per share this financial year, against a forecast dividend per share of $US1.24 ($1.75). Over FY17 and FY18, the broker expects EPS of US72.8¢ ($1.03) and US92.76¢ ($1.31) against an unchanged payout.\n\"Ah-ha!\" you say, \"but that's earnings, not cash, from which dividends are paid.\"\nWell, the outlook there is just as bleak. Before this week's oil-fuelled profit forecast downgrade, the Credit Suisse team had BHP earning enough free cash flow to meet its dividend payments in each of the coming three financial years. Now that cash flow covers only around 72 per cent of the expected total shareholder payout in FY16, and around 88 per cent in the next two.\nThe UBS analysts are less pessimistic but, nonetheless, see free cash flow this financial year accounting for only around three quarters of the expected dividend payout, before more than covering it in the following two financial years.\nLet's be clear: none of these analysts and investors are forecasting BHP will cut its dividend. But it should highlight the risks of treating even the mighty, diversified, tier-one-asset-owning BHP as an income stock.\n\"Those dividends are a function of commodity prices,\" Arnhem Investment Management managing partner Neil Boyd-Clark points out. He also calculates that if prices continue at the levels they are at now, BHP as well as Rio are paying out more than they are earning in dividends.\n\"They have strong balance sheets so can manage to sustain these dividends for a period of time – maybe two or three years – even at prevailing commodity prices,\" he says. \"But as a general comment they can't continue to pay out the earnings they are paying forever, and they will need either continued cost relief or some commodity price increases to sustain those dividends.\"\nSo what would it take for BHP to cut dividends?\nIn terms of commodity prices, it wouldn't be one thing in isolation, says Citi analyst Clarke Wilkins, who remains relatively relaxed about the miner's ability to meet its dividend commitments. Put on the spot, Wilkins reckons we would need a combination of something like iron ore at $US30 ($42.44) a tonne, copper below $US2 ($2.83) a pound and oil below $US40 ($56.59) a barrel. And that's without any corresponding offset from a lower Aussie dollar that has partially cushioned the fall in commodity prices and helped to drive cost reductions. That disaster scenario for an 18-month or two-year period \"would be enough to do it\", he says.\n\"Yes, I'm confident they will maintain the dividend,\" says Wilkins. \"But the market is telling you it doesn't necessarily like them paying dividends out of debt rather than cash flow.\"\nMeanwhile, BHP continues to cut capital expenditure.\nA lot can happen over two years – and not just bad things. The three swallows I pointed to at the start may indeed be signs that we are approaching the bottom for commodities. The improvement could be gradual or sudden. OPEC could turn around and announce a cut in production – which would be a game-changer for the oil price. China's economic slowdown may not prove as bad as feared or, less palatably perhaps, it may announce a \"big bang\" infrastructure spend to offset undesirably weak growth.\nIn the meantime, expect dividends to become a growing part of the discussion around BHP. And don't be surprised if by the end of the year CBA has come out ahead of the miner – again.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2c0eada-557c-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3lOZMtjjw"], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:11:06.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
