Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The national disability insurance scheme took its biggest step to full fruition on Wednesday when the NSW and Victorian governments signed agreements with the federal government for the full rollout of the scheme over the next few years.\nThe signings mean more than half the 460,000 Australians with disabilities can now look forward to receiving the benefits of a scheme which seeks to guarantee the support services they need no matter how they acquired their disability.\nWhile pilot schemes have been in place across the country, the agreements will mean full services start to roll out – on a region by region basis – from July next year.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and NSW and Victorian Premiers Mike Baird and Daniel Andrews hailed the NDIS as \"one of the largest social policy reforms in Australia's history\".\n\"Working together, our governments are building a sustainable scheme that will stand the test of time\".\nThe annual $22 billion price tag of the scheme has meant there has often been a question mark over whether sufficient funding would be available from both federal and state governments.\nDisabilities Minister Mitch Fifield said on Wednesday that the scheme had been operating effectively within the $22 billion envelope to date but admitted that there was still a portion of funding at the federal level which had to be found down the track.\nOf around $9 billion of new Commonwealth contributions (once existing disability funding is taken into account) around $5 billion is not covered by the current NDIS levy in the future, he said.\n Funding top up \"It falls to the Coalition to ensure full funding for the NDIS in the long term\", Mr Turnbull and Senator Fifield said. \"The scheme is just one of many reasons why the Coalition is working to repair the budget.\nThe Opposition – which set up the fund – disputed this, with disabilities spokeswoman Jenny Macklin insisting the funding for the scheme was \"in the budget\".\nHowever, the question mark is over the period after the budget forecasts.\nIn New South Wales, the rollout will start with the Central Coast, Hunter-New England, Nepean-Blue Mountains, Northern Sydney, South-Western Sydney, Western Sydney, and Southern New South Wales regions.\nFrom July 2017 the Illawarra-Shoalhaven, mid North Coast, Murrumbidgee, North NSW, South-Eastern Sydney, Sydney, Western NSW and the Far West regions will start entering the scheme.\nIn Victoria, the Northern East Melbourne, Central Highlands and Loddon regions will join the scheme from July 1 next year. The regions of Inner Gippsland, Ovens-Murray, Western District, Inner Eastern Melbourne, Outer Eastern Melbourne, Hume-Moreland and the Bayside Peninsula will commence from July 2017, followed by Southern Melbourne, Western Melbourne, Brimbank-Melton, Goulburn, Mallee and Outer Gippsland from July 2018.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-09-16T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:12:40.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
