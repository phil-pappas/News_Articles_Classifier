Fortescue Metals soared 6.6 per cent to $2.09.\nEnergy stocks were another strong improver, up 0.9 per cent as Woodside Petroleum recovered some of yesterday’s 3 per cent losses by rising 0.6 per cent to $29.84 while Santos jumped 4 per cent to $4.57.\nElsewhere, Oil Search lost some of its 17 per cent takeover-related gains from Tuesday’s session, retreating 3.1 per cent to $7.655 while peers Beach Energy rose 1.7 per cent to 60.5c and AWE lifted 4.5 per cent to $75.25.\nConsumer staples were largely flat as a whole, ticking up 0.04 per cent but Wesfarmers gained 0.9 per cent to $40.145 while Woolworths fell 1.5 per cent to $24.96.\nMeanwhile, Qantas lifted 1.7 per cent to $3.59 while Telstra gained 1.1 per cent to $5.74.\nOn Tuesday, the Australian sharemarket was driven higher by energy stocks as Woodside’s takeover bid for Oil Search sparked enthusiasm among investors which more than offset the effect of oil price declines.\nIn that session, it gained 84.8 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 5115.2. The broader All Ordinaries had lifted 82.5 points, or 1.63 per cent, to 5133.5.\nOriginally published as Aussie stocks open 1pc higher ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc&title=Aussie+stocks+open+1pc+higher", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc&h=Aussie+stocks+open+1pc+higher", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc&title=Aussie+stocks+open+1pc+higher", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Aussie+stocks+open+1pc+higher&c=THE+Australian+sharemarket+opened+strongly+today+with+financial+stocks+leading+the+way+forward+following+strong+leads+from+the+US+and+Europe.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-fni0dcne-1227519197988", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/aussie-stockmarkets-rallies-on-strong-leads-from-us-europe/story-e6frfm1i-1227519197988?sv=1404f7c97d842b1b46828d6d650ff3dc"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:23:00.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
