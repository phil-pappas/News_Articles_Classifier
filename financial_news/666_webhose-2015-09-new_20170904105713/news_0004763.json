Gold's gain helped to also pull higher sister metal silver. \n\"Commodity markets initially welcomed the US central bank?s decision to keep rates on hold yesterday, but the moves have been small,\" noted Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics research group. \n\"This makes sense, as rates are still likely to rise soon, and the delay could simply prolong the uncertainty. Worse still, the Fed?s hesitancy may yet reinforce investors? worries about the health of the global economy, rather than reassure them, leaving gold as one of the few lasting beneficiaries,\" he added. \nWeaker commodities demand from China, the world's second biggest economy after the United States, is weighing hard on financial markets generally. \nChina at the start of the week released another set of figures that underline weakness in its huge economy -- the main driver of global growth. \nThe government said growth in industrial production increased below expectations in August while retail sales accelerated a little more than forecast. \n\"With global financial markets remaining sensitive to fresh news from China, the latest set of Chinese data proved fairly disappointing and cemented concerns about the economy,\" Rabobank said in a note to clients. \nIndustrial production, which measures output at factories, workshops and mines, rose 6.1 percent year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics announced, describing the sector as still weak. \nThe data pressured prices of industrial, or base, metals, with copper. aluminium and lead all down Friday compared with one week earlier. \n\"The biggest factor weighing on prices was clearly the weak Chinese data,\" said analysts at Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:44:50.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
