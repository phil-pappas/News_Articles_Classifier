Lennar fell 5.7 percent, PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM - news ) 4.7 percent and KB Home (NYSE: KBH - news ) 8.0 percent. \nMany technology stocks suffered drops, including Amazon (-3.7 percent), Facebook (-3.6 percent) and Netflix (Hanover: NFC.HA - news ) (-2.7 percent). \nOn the winning side was aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE: AA - news ) , which jumped 5.7 percent on news it would split into two companies. \nAlso higher was Media General (NYSE: MEG - news ) , which vaulted 22.3 percent on news it received an unsolicited buyout offer from Nexstar Broadcasting Group valued at about $4.1 billion. Nexstar dipped 2.3 percent. \nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 2.10 percent from 2.17 percent Friday, while the 30-year dropped to 2.88 percent from 2.96 percent.
