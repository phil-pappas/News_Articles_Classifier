The Aug. 5 spill occurred during excavation work at an inactive gold mine near Silverton, Colorado.\nRepublicans charge that EPA is treating itself more gingerly than if a private company were responsible for the spill, which sent lead and other heavy metals rushing toward communities downstream.\nMcCarthy said Wednesday \"there's no way EPA should have downplayed this. I certainly did not.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T20:54:52.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
