Written by: Jeremy Josse 09/04/15 - 1:47 PM EDT \nThis article has been updated to reflect the nonfarm payroll numbers and the markets today. \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --Today's jobs numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics may not have hit the \"Goldilocks\" zone -- just right to calm market jitters. \nThe August data, which showed that so-called non-farm payrolls rose by 173,000, were weaker than expected, although unemployment data was good leaving the market confused about likely timing of future rate hikes. U.S. markets were down significantly in early trading on the last day of trading before the long Labor Day weekend driven in part by this confusion (although an afternoon rally is of course still possible). The jobs report is compelling reading as one of the most important barometers on the health of the U.S. economy. It offers investors about as close an indicator as exists for up-to-date, accurate information on the U.S. economy. And, further, the Federal Reserve has said that it will be making its decision about when to raise interest rates in part on the health of the jobs economy.

(But if the data is poor, this can also spook the market even as it may not inspire a rate increase.) Only, when the numbers are within the \"Goldilocks\" zone (so named for the fairy tale where the hero will only eat porridge at just the right temperature), stocks are apt to move higher. Today, at least in early trading, it looks like the market thought the number was too low or just too confusing for comfort. \nMust Read: 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling \nThe paradox is that, way up or way down, equity markets were vulnerable if the jobs numbers weren't just right. \nWhy? Well, we have been living in a low-interest rate environment for a long time and this is not really the usual way of things in the banking system. The desire to raise rates has been called by Fed Chairman Janet Yellen a move toward \"normalization\" of monetary policy. While low rates help borrowing costs across the system (and can stimulate the economy), they can make it hard for banks to earn a significant margin on their lending. Very low rates are not a \"normal\" banking environment. \nThe result of such a long period of low rates, is that (as many have argued) it has become a type of drug. Economic performance may depend on it and certainly the health of the stock market probably depends on it. \nThere is a fairly universal and well-known correlation between rate rises (say, postrecession) and subsequent, lagged declines in the equity markets. This has been true not only since the credit crisis but dating back 50 years. Low rates are sometimes also sometimes blamed partly for the Internet bubble in 2001 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:13:36.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
