Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup The race to corner the emerging market move connecting home sellers with real estate agents, is heating up as local start-up LocalAgentFinder kicks off a $5 million funding drive before an aggressive marketing push to change how people sell their homes.\nThe service provides a platform for sellers to find real estate agents, who bid for the right to sell their property. The company has booked 500 per cent growth in the past 18 months, with 5000 properties now listed on the platform every month.\nLocalAgentFinder chief executive Michael Banks said it was the second time this year the start-up had tried to raise capital, but a few months ago the business had not been ready.\n\"A lot of questions came back which proved to us that the business had some things it needed to prove before raising capital. We were going through a massive expansion in marketing activity, so the revenue ... didn't seem solid,\" Mr Banks said.\nLocalAgentFinder is competing with local rival OpenAgent, founded by McKinsey & Company consultants Zoe Pointon, left, and Marta Higuera. James Alcock But this time Mr Banks said the business had been well received. It had explored mass market branding opportunities on TV and its revenue was now solid, having grown by 60 per cent since it first went to the market.\n\"We've already gotten away a good portion of the raise,\" he said.\nThe company is going up against local rival OpenAgent, which was founded by McKinsey & Company consultants Zoe Pointon and Marta Higuera, and raised $6 million in July from South African-based financial services firm Hollard Investments.\nIt was the second round of funding for the firm, which has also received backing from a group of angel investors, including Pete Flint, who founded United States real estate giant Trulia.\n \"There's every potential here for an Australian company to become the world's best,\" Mr Banks said.\niSelect hire LocalAgentFinder recently hired former iSelect marketing chief Roger McBride and previous iSelect chief executive Matt McCann has joined the board.\nThis capital raising round will bring the comparison website's total funding to $10 million. Its major investors are co-founder at Strandy Investments and former LocalAgent chief executive Andrew Menzies, and angel investor Rupert Greenhough, both of whom sit on the company's board.\nIn Australia, when an owner put a property on LocalAgentFinder he or she gets on average nine bids from agents wanting to sell the house.\nIn November 2014, the business expanded to Britain and now has 1500 agents signed up.\nMr Banks said the most efficient way for the company to manage this expansion was to run a 24-hour Australian office.\n\"We initially thought we'd have to set up a London office with a manager and staff, but we found that because a lot of the marketing activity we've done has been online, and the Brits are used to hearing Australian accents, it's more efficient if we just start running shifts in our Melbourne office,\" he said.\n\"That now forms a core part of our international strategy.\"\nRapid growth plan Over the next 12 months the business is aiming to grow from 5000 customers a month using the service, to 20,000.\nTo do this LocalAgentFinder is investing heavily in a traditional media marketing strategy to expand its advertising on TV, radio, billboards and in print.\n\"If we can't grow to four times our size in the next 12 months, then I don't think we've gotten it right,\" Mr Banks said.\n\"We could be profitable now if we wanted to be, but that doesn't suit our growth trajectory.\"\nIt's free for real estate agents to be on the website, LocalAgentFinder gets a commission based on a percentage of the final sale price.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:03:23.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
