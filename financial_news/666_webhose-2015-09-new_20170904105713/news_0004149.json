Technology companies’ share of U.S. initial public offerings has fallen to a seven-year low, and a number of once-hot IPOs have underperformed recently including Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and social-media site Twitter. There are now at least 117 private companies valued by venture firms at $1 billion or more, nearly double the number from a year ago. The current trend threatens the outlook for what has been one of the most robust segments of the U.S. investment landscape. That said, some of the most valuable startups are intentionally holding off IPOs and growing at rates that could be eagerly welcomed by public investors.\nWelcome to Germany A bureaucratic tweet from an obscure German agency helped lead to a turning point in Europe’s migrant crisis, when hundreds marched from Budapest in an act halfway between political protest and mass exodus. The wave of migrants now streaming into Germany could be exactly what the country needs to rejuvenate its graying workforce . Or it could become a burden on its generous welfare system. How those two forces balance out is likely to depend largely on how quickly the country can integrate newcomers into its booming economy. Meanwhile, the U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a sixfold increase over the number currently in the country. For more on why this crisis is happening now, check out our video .\nThe End of the Road U.S. President Barack Obama won the biggest foreign-policy fight of his second term yesterday when supporters of his nuclear accord with Iran thwarted an effort to cripple it, paving the way for the deal’s implementation. The vote spares Mr. Obama from the need for a veto to safeguard the deal. After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) made clear that he wouldn’t let Democrats bring up legislation that he said would make them look tough on Iran unless they had enough support for it to become law. Some Democrats who said that they reluctantly endorsed an imperfect deal have already called for renewing the 20-year-old Iran Sanctions Act, which expires at the end of 2016.\nThe 360 Degree Furniture Some homeowners are taking their cars for a spin—literally. Serious auto buffs and luxury developers are installing electronic car turners in their homes to help address narrow driveways or to boost the bling factor. “It’s one of the highlights to see the car spin—it’s like living in the future,” said the owner of one luxury home, who bought a Tesla for his turntable. A number of spin-happy homeowners are even adapting revolving platforms for bedrooms, living rooms and patios. And in other luxury trends, some well-heeled buyers are returning to a throwback layout that first gained popularity in Manhattan in the 1920s—the Classic Six .\nFashion Report Among Hollywood’s legendary leading men, Robert Redford is in a league of his own .

Lindsey Graham’s comments relating to the GOP and the Iran nuclear deal , Ken Keller of California commented: “The Senator is correct. Our best hope is to maintain a GOP legislature and elect a GOP president in 2016 to void this lose-win treaty with Iran. It’s a lot faster method than a lawsuit.” And Brian N. Quote: : “Mr. Graham has a point but as normally occurs in Congress it misses the larger picture. Simplify this process to understand that we have nuclear weapons as do many other nations. We own a weapon for our protection and we are essentially saying to another nation that they cannot do the same thing that we did. In the international court (not the court of public opinion) that may not go over well. Beside, we tell bad people that they cannot have guns every day and every day we read about bad people getting guns. We can tell Iran “no” forever but they will just do it anyway. That is what bad people (and nations) do.”\nThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.
