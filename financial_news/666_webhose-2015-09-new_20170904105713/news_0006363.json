The report said several unnamed financial industry sources told Krebs that the incident may still be ongoing and could date back as far as November 2014.\n\"Unfortunately the possibility of fraudulent credit card activity is all too common for every company in today's marketplace,\" a Hilton spokesman said in a statement. \"We take any potential issue very seriously, and we are looking into this matter.\"\nThe spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement.\nKrebs, who broke the news of a massive 2013 breach at Target Corp a day before the company announced it, said the cards had been used at the McLean, Virginia-based company's flagship Hilton locations as well as Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Suites, and the upscale Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts.
