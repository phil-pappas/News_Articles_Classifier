Photo: Josh Robenstone\nMr Whippy is making a comeback this summer – but not as you know it.\nAfter a 15-year absence, Franchise Food Company (FFCo) this week confirmed it was revitalising the ice-cream brand and taking it back on the streets.\nBut not everything that's old is new again: the big pink-and-white vans are gone and the trademark Greensleeves music will now herald nifty little tuktuks.\nMr Whippy is trading in his ice-cream van for a tuktuk.\n​FFCo chief executive Stan Gordon did not want to give too much away, but it's understood the new and improved Mr Whippy could be selling soft serves in the suburbs of Melbourne before Christmas.\nAdvertisement And there are plans to build the franchise operation into a fleet of 200 tuktuks buzzing through the suburbs of Australia.\nFFCo runs six franchised businesses, including the Cold Rock ice-creamery and Trampoline gelati shops, and Mr Gordon tried unsuccessfully to buy Pie Face late last year after the business was put into administration.\nMr Whippy will sell the traditional soft serves, with some new updated varieties on the menu.\nIt bought the Mr Whippy business back in 2000, when it had 30 retail outlets in shopping centres on the east coast.\nMr Gordon said the business was in bad shape when he bought it and over time the franchisees abandoned the brand and there were now no stores.\nBut FFCo retained the rights to Mr Whippy as well as the Greensleeves tune, and it has fought to protect it, even taking legal action to stop MasterChef George Calombaris selling his 'Mr Whippi' dessert in 2012.\nFFCo​ tried to revitalise the brand in 2010 and sought a partner to run the vans under licence and sell its Cold Rock ice-cream, but the venture did not get off the ground.\nThis time FFCo plans to run Mr Whippy as a franchise and it will sell the traditional soft serves, with some new updated varieties on the menu.\n\"This will be a low-cost franchise with Australia's most iconic brand,\" Mr Gordon said.\nWhile Mr Gordon finalises the Mr Whippy business plan, franchised businesses are under intense scrutiny amid revelations of the underpayment of staff at 7-Eleven.\nMr Gordon said he was not aware of similar practices at FFco operations and he would not tolerate it from any of his franchisees.\nHowever, he said penalty rates in Australia were punitive and blamed them for issues like the underpayment of staff as well as the thriving cash economy.\n\"If I found out one of my franchisees was doing that, I would breach them and terminate their contact,\" Mr Gordon said \"We don't tolerate breaking the law.\n\"I think Australia is a tough market and I think it's survival of the fittest, but the laws that control franchising are really good; we are stricter than anywhere else in the world.\"\nMr Whippy was originally a UK brand and it was brought to Australia in the early 1960s before it was listed on the stock exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:21:32.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
