Brands can step up their game in producing ads that grip viewers with emotion, Mr. Spinney said, adding that the best commercials tell a story. “Quite a lot can be said” in a spot that’s only 20 seconds long, Mr. Spinney said.\n“Commercials are not always something you want to avoid. Some of them are actually fun,” Mr. Spinney said.\nWhile Big Bird has built a loyal following among generations of viewers, “Sesame Street” – like the broader television industry – has had to adapt to keep up with a changing media landscape.\nStarting this fall, new episodes of “Sesame Street” will be broadcast on cable network HBO first before they appear on their long-time home of PBS. The deal allows “Sesame Street” to produce 35 new episodes a year, up from 18, and also beefs up children’s content available for HBO’s online services as young viewers increasingly watch on-demand streaming services.\n“It’s a marvelous thing that’s happened,”Mr. Spinney said. “All of this will help us broaden our reach.”\nAnd even as computer-generated animation gains in popularity among children, there’s still an appetite for puppetry, Mr. Spinney said.\n“With puppets, they can be instant. They can react to something you just said,” Mr. Spinney said. “That’s the beauty of puppetry.”\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T23:28:58.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
