Bloomberg by David Stringer At the peak of the iron-ore boom, the world's biggest producers were spinning out profit margins the envy of luxury goods makers such as Christian Dior and Hermes International. What's surprising is how much money some are still making, even after prices plunged.\nIron ore has tumbled more than two-thirds from a 2011 peak, squeezing owners of higher-cost mines. But some of the biggest producers continue to boast hefty margins. Earnings before some expenses at BHP Billiton were 50 per cent of revenue in the year ended June 30, more than for industries like health-care services and software.\nBy boosting capacity and exploiting labour-saving technology including driverless trains and automated drills, the top suppliers have cut costs by an average of 40 per cent since the second half of 2012, according to CLSA. Wide margins are helping BHP and Rio Tinto to bankroll about $US10 billion ($14.26 billion) in full-year dividend payments to shareholders in the depths of a rout in raw materials that sent commodity prices to a 16-year low.\n\"The idea that iron-ore was at its peak and that Rio and BHP had lost their mojo has probably proven to have been presumptuous,\" said Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager who helps oversee about $US1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital in Melbourne, including holdings in the two companies.\n'Absurd margins' Rio's earnings before tax, interest, amortisation and depreciation - or EBITDA - were 44 per cent in 2011, when iron ore prices peaked at $US191.70 a dry metric ton. In the first half of this year, Rio's margin was 41.5 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThat is more than some of the biggest names in luxury fashion and cosmetics, including Christian Dior, with a 24 per cent EBITDA margin in the first half, and a 23 margin for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE - which produces Moet & Chandon Champagne. Hermes, the maker of Birkin bags that can fetch $US9400 to $US68,000 for a version in crocodile skin, had a 36 per cent margin.\nIron-ore \"margins are still very, very good\", despite being down from \"absurd\" levels four years ago, when they outperformed even the gross margins of luxury goods makers, said John Hempton, chief investment officer of Bronte Capital, a Sydney-based hedge fund. \"That is the joy of being the low-cost producer in a mineral.\"\n 'Most attractive' Rio's iron-ore unit \"is one of the most attractive businesses in the world\", Andrew Harding, the division's chief executive officer, told investors in Sydney on September 3.\nThe London-based company reported an average margin of 54 per cent on iron ore in the first six months of 2015, and chief executive officer Sam Walsh said on August 6 that its open-pit mines in Australia had averaged 62 per cent over the past 14 years. At BHP, iron-ore margins that the company reported at 59 per cent in the year ended June 30 \"remain outstanding\", chief financial officer Peter Beaven said last month.\nThe average EBITDA margin for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, excluding banks, was 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Real estate topped 24 industry groups at 56 per cent, the data show.\nBHP had $US31 billion of total debt as of June 30, or 1.42 times bigger than EBITDA, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. EBITDA will be 47 per cent company wide in the 12 months to June 30 next year, according to the average of analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Rio, with $US25 billion of total borrowings, will have a margin of 35 per cent this year, according to the forecasts.\nRout shelter Cash flow from low-cost operations in Western Australia's iron-rich Pilbara region is helping shelter BHP and Rio from the price collapse, according to Citigroup. Brazil's Vale SA, the biggest exporter, is trying to boost margins by replacing sales of lower-quality ore with premium products from newer mines. Brazil has higher costs than Australian competitors and is three times farther away from China, the top buyer.\nPeter Poppinga, Vale's executive director for ferrous minerals, said on a July 30 conference call: \"Margin is more important than volume.\" The company had an EBITDA margin of 30 per cent in the three months to June 30.\nPrice crunch Benchmark iron-ore prices have plunged about 70 per cent from their peak in February 2011 as low-cost output rose and demand growth slowed in China. About 230 million metric tons of new supply is scheduled to be added in the next two years, sustaining a supply glut through to 2017, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nShould prices tumble further, suppliers such as BHP and Rio may have limited capacity to cut production costs more than they already have, said Chris Drew, an analyst in Sydney for RBC Capital Markets. Iron-ore may fall to $US45 by the end of the year, according to Capital Economics.\nAs smaller and costlier suppliers are forced to exit, the low-cost producers can claim an even greater share of the 1.7 billion-ton global market. At least 120 million tons of production will be shuttered this year, Rio forecasts.\nCost cuts by the biggest supplier have \"been simply astonishing\", said Phil Ruthven, Melbourne-based founder and director of business research provider IBISWorld. \"I can only praise them for how quickly they've responded to the challenge of falling prices.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:04:11.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
