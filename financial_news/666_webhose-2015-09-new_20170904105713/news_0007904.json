However the government has been adamant it wanted a hotel rather than offices in the area it promotes as Sydney's tourism and financial hub.\nHotel operators and developers have been circling the site at a time when the tourism sector is improving, both domestically and from overseas visitors, who are taking advantage of the lower Australian dollar.\nJLL hotels & hospitality group chief executive Australasia Craig Collins said the sector has been in hot demand. .\nHe said for year to June 2015, most major Australian hotel markets have posted revenue per available room rate growth, according to latest STR analysis. The Sydney and Melbourne five-star markets continue to be star performers, with Sydney up 5.6 per cent to an average $250 and Melbourne up 5.8 per cent to an average $245 room per night.\nNSW Minister for Finance, Services and Property, Dominic Perrottet, said the redevelopment of the properties has been on the agenda for some time as maintenance of the sandstones has cost the NSW Government in excess of $2 million per year over the last two years.\n\"This flagship hotel is all about making smarter use of our property assets,\" Mr Perrottet said.\n\"Proceeds from the lease will be reinvested in infrastructure, and there will be substantial savings to NSW taxpayers on avoided maintenance. Importantly, these iconic heritage assets will be enjoyed by locals, tourists and visitors, rather than just being used as offices for bureaucrats.\"\nPontiac Land will be responsible for all design and planning approvals, with construction expected to commence after the buildings are vacated in 2018, by the Department of Education, and the Department of Planning and Environment, with the hotel anticipated to open about 3 years later.\nPontiac's portfolio includes luxury hotels in Singapore such as The Ritz-Carlton Millenia, Capella, Conrad Centennial and Regent (A Four Seasons Hotel), as well as apartments and retail sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:43:02.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
