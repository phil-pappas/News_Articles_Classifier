Enhanced annuities pay more each year because of shorter life expectancy and JLT said that around 50pc of retirees qualified for them. \nBased on these figures, the firm said savers were missing out on an additional £213m a year, which adds up to about £1.5bn between 2008 and 2014. \nThere are concerns that insurers have widely mis-sold annuities by not making savers aware that they could qualify for a better deal. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has recently ordered a detailed examination of thousands of retirement contracts sold by Britain’s major insurers since 2008. \nMore than 600,000 pensioners are believed to have been sold annuity contracts that failed to account for their health in the six-year period under review. \n• The pension freedom mistake that will halve your pension pot \nThe regulator could force companies to pay compensation to customers who were sold inappropriate annuities. \nDuncan Howorth, of JLT, said it was difficult to predict how much compensation pensioners were likely to receive. \n“Because mis-selling is very difficult to prove, there is a possibility that compensation could be just a fraction of the amount that pensioners have lost by not getting the best value annuity deals,” he said. \n“The regulator’s move might further tarnish the reputation of annuities, but it is important that people do not dismiss annuities outright as it might be an appropriate choice for some people, given their circumstances.” \nTom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , the investment shop, said that it was essential that today’s retirees shopped around to make sure they got the best annuity rates, broadest investment choices and lowest charges. \n“The fact that so few people are shopping around shows that much more needs to be done,” he said. \n“Politicians and regulators must focus on improving the pension withdrawal process. The goal should be for engaged and well-informed investors to be shopping around in a competitive market place. This is clearly not happening adequately at present.” \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:10:24.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
