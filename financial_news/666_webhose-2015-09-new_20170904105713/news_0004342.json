It will operate them for American Airlines.\nThe new aircraft will bring its fleet of CRJ900s to 64 aircraft and of large regional jets to 115 by the end of the year..\nRelated Content FAA fines Mesa and Empire for safety violations StandardAero to maintain Mesa E175 APUs Mesa promotes new maintenance executive American cash falls to $8.9bn in Q2 Mesa and pilots reach tentative accord Mesa to add seasonal Mexico flights for American Mesa firms CRJ900 order for American Mesa adds seven CRJ900s to American fleet Mesa commits to seven CRJ900s Mesa to operate American CRJ900s on two Mexican routes Mesa finances growth with $30m working capital loan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:16:06.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
