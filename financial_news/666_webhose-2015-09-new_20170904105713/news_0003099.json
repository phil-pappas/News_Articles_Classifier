Photo: James Boddington\nThe kitchens, living rooms and laundries of Australia are at the front line as the dollar falls.\nIt's bad news for consumers, yet another headwind for retailers relying on imported goods and even, potentially, part of a macroeconomic headache as increases in the price of furniture and whitegoods drives inflation.\nHardest hit are volume operators like Harvey Norman, which is putting up prices as it balances its diminished buying power with shaky shopper confidence.\nHarvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey says customers will probably cope with price increases as the dollar falls.\nStill it's nothing that Harvey Norman founder Gerry Harvey hasn't seen before, he recalls when the dollar was buying US50¢ and he's not concerned the weakening dollar is eating into sales growth yet.\nAdvertisement He said prices were rising but not as much as people might expect.\n\"Everything we import gets a little bit more dearer so all our prices have to go up but it doesn't correlate with the amount the dollar has fallen,\" Mr Harvey said.\n\"Furniture is going up in price, we will see 20 per cent plus increases in that at the moment … but if a washing machine is $799 or $899 it doesn't seem to affect the units sold because people don't think its expensive at $899.\"\nMr Harvey said the electronics and computing segment was less effected by the currency because of the global nature of the industry and ongoing price deflation.\nHe said customers compared prices internationally, which made it harder for manufactures to carry large price discrepancies from market to market.\nEffects of low Australian dollar \"And on the technology side of things, prices just keep decreasing, my first plasma cost me $11,000 and now a similar thing costs $900.\"\nOnline furniture operation Milan Direct is also grappling with the effects of the low Australian dollar but there's been an upside to the falling currency and it could just benefit the business.\nChief executive Dean Ramler said the currency was one of the \"biggest issues\" Milan Direct was facing but he said hedging arrangements as well as negotiations with suppliers was limiting the effect.\nMost of Milan Direct's furniture comes from China but it also has manufacturing operations in Vietnam and India.\n\"We've spent a lot of time in negotiations with the factories in China over lowering their margins and because we've been in business for 10 years we have good bargaining power with our manufacturers, in some cases we are their biggest customer.\"\n\"Our view is that we should be able to make a profit at any rate … we have to be smarter when the dollar is in the 70s or 60s.\"\nAs well as being smarter, Mr Ramler said the higher cost of importing had knocked a number of Milan Direct's competitors out of the market.\n\"When we started nine years ago, we saw a massive influx to the market because the Australian dollar made importing very easy, we've seen a really big drop off in that competition because the market conditions are so tough,\" he said.\n\"If it's challenging for us it must be really hard for a businesses that isn't as strong.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:51:32.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
