The summit came together as an event only after the September 14 consensus adoption by the General Assembly of a negotiating document and the decision to commence text-based negotiations on UNSC reforms in the current session.\nMinistry of External Affairs Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said the “four leaders are meeting once again to give a very strong push to inter-governmental negotiations for UN Security Council reform.”\nThe 193-member General Assembly had adopted by consensus a negotiating text that encapsulates all proposals made by various UN members include UNSC reform, the veto and number of new permanent and non-permanent members in a reformed Council.\nThe text will now form the basis for negotiations to resume when the Inter-Governmental Negotiations resume in November.\nSwarup said the G-4 summit assumes significance in the backdrop of the UNGA decision.\nIt is only the second time that a G4 summit is being held, the first was in 2004 when the grouping was formed with the four very important countries coming together to give a strong push to Council reform.\nSwarup further said that UN reform is not restricted to an overhaul of the Council but also includes reforms in the world body’s governance structure.\nUnderscoring that the expansion and reform of the 15- nation Council is very important, Swarup said when the world body was formed there were only 51 countries but today its membership has reached to 193 countries.\nThe Council has been expanded only once between 1963-1965 when a resolution was passed to increase the non-permanent members from 11 to 15.\n“This gives a feeling to us that the UN Security Council of 2015 is a mirror of the geo-political realities of 1945 and not that of the 21st century,” Swarup said, adding that only a reformed Council would be capable to properly address the challenges of the present days.\n“We have the challenge of cyber security, international terrorism. There are wars in three continents, but Security Council is incapable of addressing them. Why? Because it is neither representative and there are questions on its legitimacy,” Swarup said, adding that there is also a need to determine the relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly.\nFirst Published on September 26, 2015 9:29 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T04:29:35.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
