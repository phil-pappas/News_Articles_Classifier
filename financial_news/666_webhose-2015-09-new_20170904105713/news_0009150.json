The proposed transaction will value Jasper Infotech at about $6.5 billion, 35% more than its last reported valuation of $4.68 billion, when Foxconn picked up a 4.27% stake in August for $200 million.\nThe purchase by Canada's largest single-profession pension plan will be a purely secondary transaction as some early-stage investors in Jasper Infotech are selling out, either partly or completely, three persons aware of the plan told ET.\n\"Among the main selling shareholders are eBay, Sequoia Capital and Saama Capital,\" said one of the persons cited above. Ontario Teachers' and Jasper declined comment.\nThe funds said to be selling stakes did not respond to ET's emailed queries. After the August round of fund raising, Jasper has cash of more than $1 billion and isn't looking for fresh capital in the near future, a company executive said. \"We are spending cash very judiciously and have sufficient cash right now,\" he said, asking not to be named.\nOntario Teachers', which has $154.5 billion in net assets, had approached the company previously for investment possibilities before settling for this latest deal, said the people cited above.\nIndia's ecommerce companies, led by Flipkart and Snapdeal, have been raising funds from investors seeking to gain entry into a segment that's expected to grow exponentially over the next few years as more people shift to buying online. While some commentators have suggested that valuations are getting excessive, a stake purchase by the pension fund would mark a shift in the nature of investors in the segment, said a top banker aware of the development.\n\"This is possibly the first time that a pension fund is joining the booming ecommerce market place in India, which is very encouraging news,\" he said. \"This in effect means that the Indian ecommerce marketplace, which was till now being funded by early-stage venture funds or private equity funds, is getting long-term capital.\"\nThe $6.5-billion valuation proves that the Indian ecommerce space is still attractive, even for conservative investors, he said. As per audited figures, Snapdeal has a net asset base of $861 million. It incurred a loss of $206.14 million in the year ended March compared with the previous year's loss of $41.35 million.\n\"The losses are more on account of capital expenditure and not of the nature of cash burn on sales due to discount or any promotional strategies,\" said the Snapdeal executive cited above. Snapdeal has about 7,000 employees, compared with rival Flipkart's 40,000. The latter was valued at about $15 billion in the last round of fund raising.\neBay had invested about $100 million in two phases between 2013 and 2014 for a 9.3% stake in Jasper and became one of its strategic investors. It is set to offload a significant portion of its ownership, said the persons cited above.\nIn August, eBay sold a 1.16% stake to Foxconn for a little over $50 million. As a result, its ownership has come down to about 8%. Based on the valuation of $6.5 billion, eBay would make a return of more than six times in a twoyear time frame if it exits fully.\nFoxconn acquired another 3.11% stake by way of fresh shares in Jasper Infotech for about $150 million. Foxconn along with China's Alibaba Group Holding and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, together invested a total $500 million in the firm. The move was a vote of confidence from three of the world's biggest technology companies in Snapdeal, which in October had got a $627 million investment from SoftBank, also an early backer of Alibaba. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:41:48.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
