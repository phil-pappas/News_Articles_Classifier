All are actively traded in the market and this could be part of the problem.\nMost investors try to make a quick profit by buying or selling these swaps instantly. Few invest with the view to holding the asset until in matures in 2025, and that is why factors like sudden oil price moves gain such focus.\n\"All of these measures will be driven by the quirks of the way the inflation markets behave and investor psychology, and you always have to take that into consideration,\" said Mirfendereski at HSBC.\nThat is why many economists, including UniCredit's Valli, prefer survey-based measures of inflation. The ECB has been eager to stress in recent meetings that it takes an array of measures into account.\nQuestions about the reliability of the five-year, five-year rate echo general disillusionment with inflation forecasting.\nBased on the ECB's inflation forecast from September last year, consumer prices should be growing at 1.1 percent. In fact, they grew at just 0.2 percent in August and are predicted to be just 0.1 percent by the end of the year.\nMany still expect the ECB to put less emphasis on the five-year, five-year forward in the future, although it would be hard to completely ignore it.\n\"It is the main indicator Draghi looked at when the ECB launched sovereign QE, so it will be difficult for them to back-pedal at this stage as their credibility would suffer,\" said UniCredit's Valli.
