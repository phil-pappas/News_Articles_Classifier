The company says the problem happens because of a weak electrical connection in the module that powers the defroster, located in the driver's side rear pillar.\nThe problem happens after the defroster is cycled a lot or run continuously. GM says fewer than 1 percent of the cars have the problem.\nDealers will update climate control software to remove a function that automatically turns the defroster on. Drivers will still be able to turn on the defroster manually.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:56:13.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
