Estimates of the cost of compensating homeowners for lost value and strengthening buildings in the affected region are far higher.\n\"We are going to study the considerations carefully and consider potential further steps,\" NAM spokesman Martijn Verwoerd said in a statement. \"We recognise the concern of inhabitants and agree ... that, in specific cases, falls in value may be caused by earthquakes.\"\nThe company acknowledges its responsibility for damage caused by quakes, but has maintained that it should compensate homeowners only after they sell their homes at a loss.\nWednesday's ruling specified that homeowners need not show that their property had suffered any physical damage, only that its value had been affected by its location in the quake area. It also found that homeowners could request compensation immediately, rather than waiting for a sale.\nThe case against NAM was brought by a group of 900 homeowners and 12 housing cooperatives.
