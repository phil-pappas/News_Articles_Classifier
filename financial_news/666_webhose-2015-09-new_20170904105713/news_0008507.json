Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Private equity firm Crescent has launched a $215m bid for a majority stake in Cardno, saying it wanted to overhaul the struggling engineering firm's board as part of a \"3 to 5\" year rebuilding process.\nCrescent's bid, which comes less than a month before new chief executive Richard Wankmuller is due to lay out a turnaround plan he promised within 100 days of taking up the job, could see it take up to 58.9 per cent of the firm.\n\"It is Crescent's intention to drive a process of board change and renewal, and to see the board take an engaged and active role in driving the strategic and operational performance of the business,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\"Given the current level of financial performance and debt levels, it would be Crescent's intention to lobby the board to either reduce or suspend dividends for the foreseeable future. This would allow a focus on reinvesting in the business and paying down debt.\"\nCrescent, which already controls a 19.6 per cent voting stake in Cardno, is offering $3.15 for one of every two shares currently held by Cardno shareholders, a 26 per cent premium to the stock's $2.50 closing price on Friday. It said it was making a partial, rather than full, offer to keep the equity-owning employees of Cardno – many of whom took stock when their own firm was acquired by Cardno – aligned with, and motivated throughout, a renewal process.\n\"Crescent Capital Partners has a proven track record in improving business performance and is willing to actively work with and support a renewed Cardno board and management team globally,\" Crescent Capital Partners' Managing Partner, Michael Alscher said in a statement.\n\"We wish to build on the \"owner\" mindset of Cardno's employee shareholders and encourage these employee shareholders to retain their shares, be active owners and, alongside Crescent, help drive Cardno's future performance.\"\nThe private equity firm's plan, which it said could require \" significant investment\" in the next 12 to 24 months, does not plan to change any member of management but leaves open replacement of the entire board, The Australian Financial Review understands.\n Despite Australia-derived revenue accounting for a decreasing share of the total – the Americas alone makes up almost two-thirds – six board members, including US national Mr Wankmuller, are based in Australia, with only one, Elizabeth Fessenden, based in the US. Three – Grant Murdoch, Ian Johnston and Tonianne Dwyer – are Brisbane-based.\nCrescent capital said the board had overseen a \"significant\" reduction in shareholder value, from $7.56 per share in July 2012 to $2.40, as a five-day weighted-average price prior to the bid, instability in senior management with the departure of the two chief executive officers since the start of 2014 , a five-month period without a permanent CEO in 2015 and the recent resignation of the company's chief financial officer . These had put the company in a situation where it faced \"increasingly low levels of headroom\" with respect to its lender covenant leverage ratio.\n\"This may require Cardno to review its capital structure and financial risk management if the current trends in earnings, net debt and/or foreign exchange rates continue,\" Crescent said in the statement.\nCardno's NSW-based chairman John Marlay could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-14T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:09:24.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
