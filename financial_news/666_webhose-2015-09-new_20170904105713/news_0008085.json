(File photo) Top Projects: Washburn Center for Children By: Marisa Helms September 30, 2015 7:05 am 0 \nEditor’s note: This is the 27th installment of Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects of 2014 series. Previous installments are available here . \nProject Name: Washburn Center for Children \nAddress: 1100 Glenwood Ave., Minneapolis \nProject cost: $24.5 million \nProject size: 56,000 square feet \nOwner: Washburn Center for Children \nContractor: Mortenson Construction \nArchitect: DLR Group (Architect); Lawal Scott Erickson Architects Inc. (Interior Architect); Oslund & Associates (Landscape Architect) \nEngineer: DLR Group; Clark Engineering (civil and structural) \n\nBefore the Washburn Center for Children built its new home in north Minneapolis, the 132-year-old nonprofit spent decades serving its clients in a dark and cramped storefront in south Minneapolis. \nSo, when it came time to build a larger center for Washburn’s staff and the 2,700 children they serve each year, CEO Steve Lepinski says he knew the organization had both the burden and the opportunity to design the new space from the ground up. \n“There aren’t a lot of stand-alone children’s mental health centers to look at,” says Lepinski, adding that Washburn serves children coping with a variety of illnesses, including anxiety, depression and trauma. “So, our starting point was: ‘How could the new building support the therapeutic work we do, and how do we create a healing environment?’” \nLead Designer Mohammed Lawal, of Lawal Scott Erickson Architects, focused on natural light and spaces. He found inspiration in Richard Louv’s book, “Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder,” which espouses the importance of nature to a child’s healthy emotional and intellectual development. \nLawal brought in author Louv to consult on the project, and the result of this unique design collaboration is a three-story, 56,000-square-foot L-shape building anchored by a light-filled glass and steel, leaf-shaped atrium. \nThe building’s narrow footprint allows the structure to harvest daylight and pull more natural elements inside. Central to the urban 2.5 acre site are gardens, green space, and a whimsical playground nestled into the building’s L-shaped wings. \nThe LEED Gold certified building’s interior is awash with light and color, purposefully resisting an institutional feel. Lawal designed curving hallways with cubbies, and created flexible modules to allow a single outpatient therapy room to be expanded into a conference room for group therapy. \n“The primary thing I was concerned with as an architect was the well-being of the kids and families at Washburn,” says Lawal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:25:04.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
