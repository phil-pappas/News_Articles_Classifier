Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak Cash is on track to outperform equities this year because of the correction in the Australian sharemarket, but what is sometimes referred to as the world's safest asset class still has its shortcomings and advisers do not see a strong enough case for individuals to rethink their cash allocations.\nReturns are still ultra-low in cash management accounts and term deposits, and that's unlikely to change over the next 12 months. If anything, some economists see the Reserve Bank of Australia having to cut interest rates again in 2016 if unemployment starts rising, which would further cut into cash returns.\nOnly last week, United States investor Bill Gross said savers were being \"cooked alive\" by zero per cent interest rates in the world's biggest economy.\nOver the past 12 months, cash has delivered 2.5 per cent as of August, compared with the 1.6 per cent loss for Australian equities, according to BetaShares figures.\nIn Australia, property and bonds have done better, returning 14.4 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively over the same period.\nMarket wisdom suggests that investors should never have more than 10 per cent of their portfolio allocated to cash â€“ it is poor protection against inflation.\nNot uncommon for cash to outperform So far this year, Australian equities are down 6 per cent, or a loss of 2.5 per cent once the benefit of dividend payments is factored in. The dividend yield for the average S&P/ASX 200 stock is now up to 5 per cent, and higher in banks.\n \"What is unusual is how low the return from cash is, relative to dividend yields,\" said Catherine Robson, who is the principal at wealth manager Affinity Private. \"If you are not a forced seller of equities and can withstand short-term volatility, the dividend yield from the Australian market is still higher than the return from cash.\"\nWealth experts such as Ms Robson say it's not uncommon for cash to outperform shares over short periods of time.\n\"When looking at comparative returns, it's important to see them in the context of real-life investor outcomes and not just abstract returns,\" she argued.\n\"While total returns from cash will sometimes be higher than total return from equities during periods of market volatility, this is cold comfort for those wanting to live on the income from their portfolio while at least maintaining the capital value of their assets after inflation.\n\"At 2 per cent to 3 per cent per annum total return from cash, it is difficult to see how an undiversified cash investor can maintain their long-term standard of living.\"\nTough patch Australian equities are having a tough period as the collapse in commodity prices hits earnings in the resources sector and the banks raise capital to meet regulatory requirements. The high concentration of these sectors within the domestic index means most investors have been unable to dodge the fall-out.\nAdding to the unease is a global sell-off triggered by slowing economic growth in China and investor discomfort with the US Federal Reserve's intention to raise interest rates, possibly later this year.\nShares may only be down 6 per cent for the year to date, but they have been as much as 15 per cent below April's high.\nThe latest Mercer survey of Australian share manager performance indicates the median fund manager, in the 12 months ending August, beat the S&P/AS 300 Index by 2.6 percentage points.\nMany fund managers increased their allocation to cash earlier this year when the market's value was elevated, providing some safe haven until shares fell, and that cash could be deployed at more attractive prices. Not all investors have the same flexibility around cash weightings, depending on their mandates.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/bill-gross-says-us-savers-being-cooked-alive-by-zero-per-cent-interest-rates-20150923-gjtni6.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:06:35.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
