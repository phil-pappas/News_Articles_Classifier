It had hoped to position itself as a rival to Tokyo Disneyland but failed to gain traction. It was delisted in 2009 after struggling with falling visitor numbers and was sold to a consortium led by Goldman Sachs. \nBut USJ is now enjoying solid business on the back of its \"Wizarding World of Harry Potter,\" which opened July last year as well as other attractions, and also plans to build a new theme park in Okinawa. \nIt had its best year in the last financial year ended in March with 12.7 million visitors, though that trails the 31.4 million visitors to Tokyo's Disney Resort, which includes Disneyland and DisneySea. \nComcast said it expects to close the deal in the first half of November. \n(Additional reporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T08:52:09.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
