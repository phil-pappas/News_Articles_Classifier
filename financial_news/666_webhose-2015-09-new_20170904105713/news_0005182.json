The Seattle-based project coordinator for a health insurance company saw that her industry was going through some turbulence and wondered if she should put some money away should she lose her job and fall behind on her condo payments.Then she saw a chart make its way through social media, showing that if you put $1 away the first week, $2 the second, $3 the third, and so forth, you’d save $1,378 over the course of a year. Smith realized she could just stash $26.50 each week and get the same result, so she set up an automatic deduction, which funneled the money to a savings account that, in her mind, she couldn’t touch. [caption id=\"attachment_629\" align=\"\" width=\"500\"] Jaime Smith stashed $7,000 and didn't miss any of it.[/caption] “I think when I started, I had about $800 in the account left over from taxes I'd gotten back the month before,” Smith says. “I saved nothing before, and I mean nothing. … It was hard to swallow at first, until I realized it was just taking the place of expensive coffee and dinner out more often. Now, I don't even notice it.” Study: “Commitment is appealing” A recent study authored by Harvard, Yale and University of Chicago researchers backs this up. The study showed that [tweet_Quote: display=\"Even the worst savers put their money in a “committed” account, @Yale @Harvard @UChicago study says. #personalfinance\"]even the worst savers, when given a choice between a liquid and non-liquid account, put their money in a “committed” account where they couldn’t access it.[/tweet_Quote: ] And even when the restrictive account, which couldn't be touched for a designated period of time, had a lower interest rate, or a higher penalty for early access than their normal account, participants still funneled money into it. “We find that commitment is appealing,” the study says.[caption id=\"attachment_619\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Odysseus would have opened a restrictive savings account, guarding against his future temptation-ridden self. (John Waterhouse painting, image from www.flickr.com/photos/ngmorieson/)[/caption]Yale’s James Choi, one of the study’s authors, likened using a restrictive account to Odysseus ordering his sailors to lash him to the mast so he wouldn’t be tempted by the songs of the Sirens, following them to his watery grave. “If people are aware they have self-control problems with their spending, they might say, ‘I want right now to bind myself in the future so that I can’t spend this money that I’m saving.'”And surprisingly, even money stashed in IRAs and 401(K) plans is accessible, though there is a penalty. \"The study suggested, in fact, that it would be attractive for some people to have this option of a no-withdrawal 401(K) or at least a much more restrictive 401(K),\" Choi said. Even the worst savers can do this After a few months, Smith bumped her savings to $40 a week, then up to $50. A year later, her balance topped out at $7,000.And then tragedy struck. Her mother became gravely ill, and Smith used the extra money to help pay medical bills, which thwarted her progress on goals to save up six months’ worth of home payments and bills. “It’s a commitment I made and once you start living without the cushion in your checking account, you see how stupidly you spend your money. When you see a big chunk of money in your savings, and you know you can make it through an emergency, you stay very motivated.”Smith says she’s had to “borrow” from herself a few times, but has always paid herself back. “For someone like me who never saved, it's a big deal to know that cushion is there,” she says. Enlist support for your goals Choi says that those with low self-control can take certain steps to increase their savings, but the first step is having a plan.“A lot of people have no financial plan whatsoever, so they don’t really know what they plan to be saving this year, next year, all the way to retirement. And they therefore have never contemplated the consequences of their current savings pattern. Just sitting down and having a plan is huge.”The next step is figuring out if your current spending pattern is sustainable. What happens when you reach retirement?In addition to setting up a separate account, Choi suggests getting a support by teaming up with a friend or family member to be accountable to your savings plan.“A personal trainer works mostly because they commit you to go to the gym,” he said. “Can you have a personal trainer for your financial life who is committed to helping you stick to your goals?”", "external_links": ["http://faculty.som.yale.edu/jameschoi/commitment.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-04T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:31:27.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
