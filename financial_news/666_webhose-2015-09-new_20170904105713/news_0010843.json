( http://reut.rs/1PI2jjh ) \nHer approach to motherhood stoked a debate about whether her example would help or hurt the cause of women in the workplace. \nYahoo said in its corporate blog on Tuesday that it was \"extremely happy\" for Mayer and supported her plans and approach. ( http://bit.ly/1PI0liP ) \nMayer, who has been married to start-up investor Zachary Bogue since 2009, was an executive at Google Inc before taking the helm at Yahoo in 2012. \nSince then she has sought to boost morale at the nearly two-decade-old Internet company, including by increasing the amount of paid leave offered to new parents, bringing Yahoo closer to the policies of some of its Silicon Valley peers. \nThe changes in 2013 allow new mothers to take up to 16 weeks of paid leave and fathers eight. Previously, mothers could take eight weeks, while no paid leave was offered to fathers. \nHowever, Mayer's ban on employees working from home in the same year sparked nationwide outrage, with critics saying the policy would make life difficult for working parents. \nMedia reports that Mayer paid to have a nursery built next to her office further fanned the controversy. \nMayer has a net worth of about $380 million, according to Forbes. Her pay package jumped 69 percent to $42 million in 2014, mostly due to gains in Yahoo's stock price despite concerns about the health of its business. \n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and Ted Kerr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T13:26:47.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
