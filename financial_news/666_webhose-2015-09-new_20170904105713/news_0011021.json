Advertising Print This Post \nEurex Group has reported its volumes for the month ending August 2015, which secured a healthy growth MoM from the exchange’s figures this past July, according to a Eurex statement. \nEurex’s average daily volume (ADV) during August 2015 came in at 8.8 million contracts, which corresponds to an advance of 3.5% MoM from 8.5 million contracts in July 2015. Across a year timeframe however, Eurex’s August 2015 ADV surged higher by 25.7% YoY from just 7.0 million contracts in August 2014. \nLast month, Eurex witnessed a notable downturn in its volumes, with July 2015 incurring a double-digit figure loss of -22.7% MoM across its ADV . The downtrodden results appear to have bottomed out however, with volumes once again pointed upwards from its lowest figures this year. \nEquity Index Derivatives Lose Momentum \nAcross its leading installment of equity index derivatives (aggregating both equity options and single stock futures), Eurex Exchange saw a volume of 69.9 million contracts in August 2015, waning -2.4% MoM from 71.6 million contracts in July 2015. Despite the weak figure however, August’s volumes do constitute a 36.5% YoY jump from 51.2 million contracts in August 2014. \nIn August 2015, Eurex’s single largest contract again was the future on the EURO STOXX 50 Index, seeing over 27.4 million traded contracts (25.0 million in July 2015) – alternatively its blue chip index totaled just 28.6 million contracts (33.7 million in July 2015).
