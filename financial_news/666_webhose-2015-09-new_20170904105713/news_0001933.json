Mark Carney of the Bank of England (ex-Goldman Sachs), Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank (Goldman again) and Bill Dudley of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (yes, Goldman too) are three prime exhibits. Yet the nomination of François Villeroy de Galhau, until recently a senior executive at BNP Paribas, as the new governor of the Bank of France has prompted an unusual rumpus.\nMr Villeroy de Galhau (pictured) is the impeccable product of French elite education. He graduated from not one but two of the country’s top public graduate schools—the Ecole Nationale d’Administration and Polytechnique—and is a former member of the inspection des finance s, an elite corps of finance-ministry officials. Situated on what friends call “the Catholic left”, he also has long had ties to the Socialist Party of President François Hollande. Before joining BNP in 2003, he was chief of staff to two Socialist finance ministers, Christian Sautter and Dominique Strauss-Kahn.\nIn this section Becalmed Looking for the lifeboats Flow dynamics Caste iron Whose model is it anyway? Part-time palaver European Central Bank France Mark Carney Goldman Sachs Business\nIn the past figures like Mr Villeroy de Galhau have glided without comment between grand civil-service and private-sector jobs, a phenomenon known in France as pantouflage . But the public mood is shifting. Mr Villeroy de Galhau seemed to sense this, vowing to forgo a tidy package of stock options and shares, and resigning from BNP earlier this year. But this has not quelled concerns, in part because previous governors of the Bank of France have been career civil servants. His nomination posed a “grave problem of conflict of interests”, declared 150 French economists, among them Thomas Piketty, in an open letter to Le Monde this week. It was “totally illusory”, they added, to imagine that he could do his job “with full independence”.\nTheir objection carried a hint of bruised amour-propre : the economists deplored the fact that a background in academic economics is not judged an asset, as it is in America, for example. But it also reflects growing frustration at how difficult it is to prise open top French jobs. To this day, plenty of private French firms are run by ex-civil servants. As one dissenter points out, nobody for a moment considered a foreigner for the Bank of France (Mr Carney is Canadian). Even the candidate the disgruntled economists seemed to favour—Benoît Coeuré, a senior ECB official and a published economist, as well as a Polytechnique graduate and former finance-ministry official—is not exactly an outsider.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150919_FNP005_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:18:14.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
