You need real time information,\" said the 65-year-old Modi, who has 30 million fans on Facebook and tweets multiple times a day. \nModi used the session, which lasted almost an hour and was streamed online, to promote his Digital India drive and promote the country as a place worthy of tourists, investments, and entrepreneurs with visions of disruptive technology start-ups. \nZuckerberg opened by telling of a time, about a decade ago, when Facebook was going through a \"rough patch\" and there were thoughts of selling the startup. \nHe said he visited one of his mentors, late Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) co-founder Steve Jobs, who told him to visit a certain temple in India that he visited during Apple's early days. \n\"I went, and travelled for almost a month,\" Zuckerberg recounted. \"Seeing the people and how people connected, reinforced what we were doing and is something I've always remembered.\" \nModi's stop at Facebook was part of a tour of Silicon Valley. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is the first time since 1982 that a prime minister of India has visited the West Coast of the United States. \nModi left Facebook to visit Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) 's main campus in nearby Mountain View. He was later to star at an event attended by some 18,000 people in a convention center in the city of San Jose in Silicon Valley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T01:46:04.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
