It’s a new frontier y’all!” \nHe said that it would be a lifestyle media site, hosting information about marijuana products and a location-mapping tool to find dispensaries. \nAccording to the United Nations, 158.8 million people around the world use marijuana—more than 3.8pc of the planet’s population. \nSeveral states in the US have either decriminalised marijuana or legalised it for medical use . \nThe site, which will launch in October, will also produce a video interview series called Deflowered to profile proponents of the weed-smoking scene around the world. \nThere will be news on cannabis policy, the business of marijuana and its economic effects, he added. \n“There are so many people in the closet,\" Snoop Dogg said. \"We are giving them an opportunity to come out of the closet and just admit they like to smoke. I’m a smoker, my name is Snoop Dogg, and I’m a stoner.” \nThe singer b ehind hits Drop It Like It's Hot and Smoke The Weed has launched the business alongside media entrepreneur Ted Chung. \nMr Chung said “advertising is definitely part of the plan” and claimed that the demand for Merry Jane was significant, with 420 users signing up to the beta site. \nMerry Jane is supported by the actor Seth Rogen and backed by Snoop Dogg's own venture capital firm Casa Verde Capital. \nThis isn't Snoop Dogg's first foray into marijuana-based business . \nEarlier this year, he joined a consortium of investors backing Eaze , a California-based startup that promises to deliver medical marijuana to your doorstep in less than 10 minutes. \nIn 2012, the rapper released Rolling Words: A Smokeable Songbook , which was printed entirely on hemp seed paper, with perforations for easy rolling. He has also lent his name to a brand of rolling papers. \nAccording to CB Insights, the weed industry raised $104m (£67m) in venture capital over in 59 deals during 2014. \nPrivateer Holdings, which sells Bob Marley-branded weed, secured a $75m investment from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:57:06.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
