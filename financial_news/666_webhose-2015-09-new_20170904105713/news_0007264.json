A four-year degree now usually takes six, which is one of the reasons why it's more expensive than ever. And the loans you need can outlive your date of graduation by decades. As a result, schools are trying cut down on all three—the amount borrowed, the number of credits and the time it takes to graduate. \nThe extended time-to-degree has hit brand-name public universities hard. According to Department of Education data, only 34% of students graduate in six years at the University of Arizona, and at Michigan State University, it's 48%. At state flagship universities, only 36% of students are getting their degrees within six years. \nSmaller state schools with fewer resources are beginning to take their cues from their larger counterparts. Cleveland State University is an example, having embarked on tuition and credit downsizing. CSU is part the Ohio state university system that includes Bowling Green, Kent State and Ohio State among ten other campuses.
