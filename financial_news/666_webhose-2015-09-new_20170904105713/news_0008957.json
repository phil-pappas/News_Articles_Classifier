Luis Ascui Mr Boyton said further falls could save the dollar from recession in coming years if the national economy failed to pick up in time.\n\"A weaker Australian dollar is a necessary part of the adjustment to a post-mining economy,\" Mr Boyton said.\n\"An important historical precedent is during the Asian crisis of the 1990s, the Aussie's falling by a lot helped cushion the economy and saved us from following all of our major Asian trading partners into recession.\"\nHSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham, a former RBA economist, told Bloomberg the dollar \"will continue to do more of the work for the RBA and it won't be necessary for them to cut interest rates to continue to support this rebalancing of growth in the economy\".\n The Australian dollar's fall from parity since May 2013. On Wednesday, the dollar sank below US70¢ for the first time since April 2009, touching a low of US69.78¢ after the government reported that second-quarter GDP expanded a less than expected 0.2 per cent, the slowest pace since March 2013.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the dollar had recovered to US70.1¢, but analysts were scurrying to revise their projections for the Aussie lower.\nMr Boyton expected the dollar to keep falling to US60¢ by the end of 2016, and after that possibly into the US50¢ range.\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if the Australian dollar is printed with a 'five' handle in the next three years,\" Mr Boyton said.\n\"As far as reaching a bottom, I don't think we'll know what that is until Chinese growth picks up, and our economy adjusts from the mining boom enough [that] the RBA will be considering raising rates. All of those things seem quite some distance away and I don't think the Australian dollar is likely to rise until at least 2017 or 2018.\"\nMr Boyton was not alone in this view.\nIn June , Kaizen Capital's chief investment officer, Connor Grindlay, warned the dollar had far further to fall and could sink to barely more than half the value of the US dollar based on similar behaviour in the past.\nSuncorp senior economist Darryl Conroy also expected the dollar to fall towards US50¢.\n\"Historically, such periods introduce much change and volatility in exchange rates, whereby currencies tend to overshoot. As such, we may revisit currency levels we have not seen for many years,\" Mr Conroy said.\n\"The Aussie dollar at US50¢ represents overshoot to longer term fundamentals.\"\nThe local currency had been tumbling for more than two years. It was trading about US93.5¢ this time last year. However, the downward trend accelerated in recent months as concerns about China's slowing growth caused a commodity price crunch.\nChina's waning appetite for key commodity exports had compounded Australia's struggle to develop from a mining-led to a more services-led economy.\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver was forecasting a multi-year decline for the Aussie because of these challenges.\nOn Wednesday, he lowered his end of 2015 forecast to US68¢ from US70¢ and expected the dollar to hit US60¢ by the end of 2016.\n\"The Aussie is a volatile currency but the broader trend is downwards. We've got to US70¢ earlier than we thought and it's got a lot further to go,\" Mr Oliver said.\nWestpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow said Westpac was yet to update its forecasts, which were revised on Fridays.\n\"We had US70¢ for the year end and we've already hit that so that means we need to consider the possibility of a lower number. Although we do not expect the RBA to cut rates, there are several changing factors.\"\nThe Commonwealth Bank was yet to update its currency forecasts of US70¢ in the first quarter of 2016.\nCurrency strategist Elias Haddad said it was waiting for at least another fortnight before revising its forecasts so it could include employment data released on Thursday and the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting on September 16.\nThere is a slim chance the US Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.\nThe dollar hit a historic low of US47.9¢ in April 2001.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/currencies/australian-dollar-may-hit-us50-as-commodities-prices-fall-kaizen-capital-says-20150728-gimn8l.html"], "published": "2015-09-03T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:03:42.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
