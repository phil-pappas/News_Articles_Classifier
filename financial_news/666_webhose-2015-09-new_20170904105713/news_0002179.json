Yuriko Nakao With Japan's economy struggling to gather momentum after a contraction last quarter, more than a third of economists see the central bank expanding monetary stimulus next month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.\nEleven of 35 respondents see the Bank of Japan stepping up its easing on October 30, while two forecast a move as early as next week, the September 7-10 survey shows. Barclays, Credit Agricole and JPMorgan Chase - which predict the BOJ will hold off until next year - see growing risk of action on October 30. The central bank last expanded asset purchases in October 2014.\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda is under pressure as the BOJ's inflation gauge languishes at zero, and declines in production and spending sap a rebound from a contraction last quarter. A slowdown in China, which has sparked turbulence in global markets , also risks hurting exports. The October 30 meeting -- when the central bank releases updated projections -- would be a \"good opportunity\" to boost stimulus, says ruling party lawmaker Kozo Yamamoto.\n\"The China shock has changed the whole picture,\" said Hajime Takata at Mizuho Research Institute, one of the two economists who forecast added easing at the September 14-15 meeting. \"Even it doesn't move next week, it will have to take action soon. As in the early 2000s and in 2007, it's always been external shocks that have destroyed Japan's recovery.\"\nThe domestic picture is also a challenge, with households reluctant to step up spending even amid rising wages, and companies failing to respond fully to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's calls for sustained capital spending increases. Economists have steadily trimmed their forecasts for growth in 2015 as disappointment with Abenomics spreads.\nInvestors should be aware of the risk of the BOJ conducting \"emergency\" easing at its September 14-15 meeting, said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities economist Naomi Muguruma.\nWhile her main scenario is for the BOJ to add to stimulus on October 30, it's unclear whether the central bank can stay on hold until then, given China's currency devaluation last month, volatile stock markets and weaker-than-expected economic indicators in Japan , she wrote in a note.\nThirteen of the 35 economists in the survey said they didn't expect the BOJ to add any more stimulus. Kuroda last October expanded the asset-purchase program he introduced in April 2013, aiming to drive inflation to 2 per cent in about two years.\n The BOJ chief said on Thursday that recent economic data have been \"mixed,\" though chances are high that the economy will grow this quarter.\nWhile the central bank projects consumer price gains will pick up to its 2 percent target around the six-month period through September 2016, a change in the BOJ's inflation outlook may be unavoidable, depending on oil prices, Kuroda said in parliament.\nThe BOJ won't reach its price target in that time frame, according to all 34 economists who responded to a question in the survey on that goal.\nJPMorgan economist Masaaki Kanno sees economic growth slowing to 0.9 per cent in the second half of 2015 from 1.7 per cent in the first six months of the year. While he sees January as the most likely timing for a boost in BOJ stimulus, chances of a move on October 30 have risen to as much as 45 per cent from as much as 35 per cent, he said.\nSome BOJ officials see a growing likelihood the central bank will cut its inflation outlook and again delay the time frame for reaching its goal due to the drop in oil prices, people familiar with the discussions have said.\nOfficials at the same time are placing increasing weight on an alternative inflation gauge that excludes fresh food and energy, which shows consumer prices rising 0.9 per cent in July, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Any need for further stimulus will be determined by the next few months' economic data, they said.\nSome data have indicated inflation expectations are turning downward. The number of articles mentioning \"price rise\" in five major Japanese newspapers fell to 248 in August from a peak of 718 in March 2014, indicating companies are finding conditions less conducive to announce price hikes, according to Yasunari Ueno, an economist at Mizuho Securities Co.\nNobel laureate Paul Krugman said the risks of failure for the \"Abenomics\" campaign to revive Japan's growth are growing. Japan needs to reach a point where everyone believes that it has pulled out of deflation, he said at a conference in Tokyo on Wednesday.\n\"I'm still really, really worried,\" said Krugman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T05:07:32.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
