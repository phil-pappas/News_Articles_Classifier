Alex Ellinghausen \"The average punter sees a bank deposit on their savings as an absolute rip-off. That's the bottom line,\" he said.\nDespite cabinet being scheduled to discuss on Tuesday proposals by Small Business Minister Bruce Billson to introduce an effects test into the Competition Act and toughen the \"take advantage\" provisions , the discussion was deferred indefinitely. Had the discussion gone ahead, Mr Billson's proposal would have most likely been rejected, sources said.\nThe Business Council of Australia led corporate Australia's opposition to the changes and sources said the big-business lobby group threatened a public campaign had the policy been adopted.\nOn top of this, Mr Billson faced stiff opposition in cabinet, mainly from lawyers led by Attorney-General George Brandis, who has extensive experience in this area.\n â€‹Others who were opposed included Julie Bishop, Joe Hockey, Malcolm Turnbull, Mathias Cormann and Andrew Robb. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was initially supportive, throttled back in recent weeks, keen to avoid another fight.\n\"Bruce could not convince enough colleagues,\" a source said. \"All the lawyers were against it. They think it will be a lawyers' picnic.\"\nDouble backflip The bank deposit levy backflip seeks to sharpen the difference between the Coalition and Labor going into the next federal election and is similar to Mr Abbott's edict in April that the Coalition would not touch superannuation taxes if it won the election.\nThis was made after Labor announced policy proposals on super taxes and after Mr Hockey said nothing should be ruled out.\nMr Abbott said the \"government is constantly on about lower, simpler, fairer taxes\" and he and Mr Hockey said the bank tax backflip was now a test for Labor to also drop its support for the policy.\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said Labor would not be rushed into making a decision.\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed on Tuesday that when Parliament resumed three weeks ago after the winter break, Mr Hockey had agreed to apply the tax just to the big four banks to appease the backbench and the small banking lobby .\nHe told Labor he would be taking this to cabinet and sought its support if and when the legislation came to Parliament.\nMr Bowen said on Tuesday that Mr Hockey had been rolled by cabinet and was a lame duck.\n\"Joe Hockey was championing a proposal for a bank deposit levy applying only to bank accounts held by the big four banks only a few weeks ago,\" he said.\nMr Hockey contended that he dropped the idea after consulting the chief executive officers of the big four, who were opposed, and after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority issued requirements for banks to increase their capital reserves. But the APRA decision had already been made when Mr Hockey approached Labor on August 10.\nThe bank deposit levy would have been a 0.05 per cent levy on every deposit of up to $250,000. It was scheduled to start on January 1, 2016.\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Tuesday he never supported the proposal and the lost revenue would be made up for in savings to be announced in the mid-year budget update to be released in December.\nThe tax was opposed by David Murray's financial system inquiry. Mr Murray said such a tax should be proposed after a bank collapses, not before. Mr Hockey said in April that made no sense and that such a tax should be collected in advance.\nThe Australian Bankers' Association welcomed the decision.\nABA executive director of industry policy Tony Pearson said \"millions of Australians who rely on their savings for current and future income would have been hurt by this tax, including many self-funded retirees\".\nGreens MP Adam Bandt, who first proposed exempting small banks, said Mr Hockey had caved in to the big four.\n\"The big banks already get a big leg-up from the public, as everyone knows the government will support the big four if they look like falling over, which allows them to get funds more cheaply than their smaller rivals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:11:51.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
