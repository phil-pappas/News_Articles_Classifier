The fund will be closed to new investors beginning September 30, 2015. \n\"Since our founding in 2001, we've endeavored to be excellent stewards of our clients' capital,\" said Tom Florence, President and Chief Executive Officer of 361 Capital. \"With that in mind, we've put forth great effort into measuring the capacity of our strategies, in order to ensure that asset growth doesn't degrade return potential.\" \nWith AUM just over $1 billion as of September 8, the fund will be closing to new investors but will still allow additional capacity for current investors. The executives and investment team at 361 Capital understand that when firms lose sight of performance objectives and chase assets under management, investors ultimately pay the price. \n\"We are grateful to our clients and investors who have helped us achieve this accomplishment and thankful for their investment in our philosophy, people and strategy,\" said Florence. \nFor more information about the 361 Managed Futures Strategy Fund closing or questions about implementing alternative investment products, contact 866-361-1720. \nAbout 361 Capital \n361 Capital is a leading boutique asset manager offering institutional-quality alternative mutual funds to investment advisors and their clients.

Please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. \nPast performance does not guarantee future results. \nAll mutual fund investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Futures prices can be very volatile. Leverage (the small margin required for futures contracts) means that a relatively small market movement can have a disproportionately large effect on the Fund's investments. Leverage can result in large losses as well as gains. The potential loss from a contract could exceed the Fund's initial investment. With short contracts, the loss is theoretically unlimited since the appreciation of the underlying asset also is theoretically unlimited. Fund assets not invested in futures are invested primarily in investment-grade debt. The value of debt instruments generally falls when interest rates rise. The Fund may engage in frequent trading, the costs of which may reduce returns and result in a greater number of taxable transactions. The Fund may invest a large portion of its assets in relatively few issuers, potentially making it more volatile than a diversified fund. \nThe 361 Funds are distributed by IMST Distributors, LLC.
