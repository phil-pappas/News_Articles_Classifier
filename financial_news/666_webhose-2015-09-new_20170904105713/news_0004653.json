Beth McKenna TMFMcKenna Sep 3, 2015 at 6:22PM \nAre you in search of the best 3D printing stock, despite the fact that the market has been clobbering this space since the start of 2014? Since then, 3D Systems, Stratasys ( NASDAQ:SSYS ) , ExOne, Arcam ( OTC:AMAVF ) , voxeljet ( NYSE:VJET ) , and Materialise ( NASDAQ:MTLS ) are down 75%, 72%, 78%, 53%, 64%, and 32%, respectively. (Materialise has only been public since mid-2014.) \nBeyond stock prices, the business performances of most of the 3D printing companies has been subpar. As for the leaders, Stratasys' expansion into the consumer market via its MakerBot acquisition and Triple D's seeming shotgun approach to acquisitions are looking like poor strategies -- or at least poor executions of strategies. That said, industry analyst Wohlers Associates projects the 3D printing industry will grow at an average annual rate of more than 31% through 2020. So, if you believe that the torrid projected growth means it's likely there will be at least one winner among the current players, how do you decide which is the best 3D stock to buy? \nDo you go with Stratasys, figuring its size should provide it with staying power? Do you choose Arcam, voxeljet, or Materialise, believing that their narrower focuses are a positive? Do you use one-year revenue growth as your main criteria, which would lead you to Arcam, voxeljet, or Materialise? Do you use positive cash flow from operations as your top screen, which would leave you with Triple D, Arcam, and Materialise? \nThese are legitimate arguments that you might factor into your decision. The following presentation uses a process you might also consider: the process of elimination. You might not agree with the finding, but this process should help in your efforts to choose the best 3D printing stock. \nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.
