The startup also supports 4K ultra high-definition services, including some delivered by the BBC during last year's World Cup coverage, according to Amazon. \n\"Together, we'll collaborate on deeper technology integrations and new infrastructure offerings so that media and entertainment companies can evolve their hybrid and cloud models,\" Amazon Web Services senior vice president Andy Jassy said. \nElemental technology will be woven into Amazon's platform for hosting services in the Internet cloud and be aimed at providing \"solutions to efficiently and economically scale video infrastructures as the media industry increasingly moves to Internet-based delivery.\" \nElemental will also continue to operate as its own brand, according to Amazon. The acquisition was expected to close in the final quarter of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:45:50.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
