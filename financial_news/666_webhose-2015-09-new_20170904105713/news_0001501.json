Andrew Meares by Joanna Mather Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen has flagged superannuation policy changes that would make it easier for companies to make top-up payments to women.\nA Labor government would also consider allowing spouses to establish joint super accounts, in a bid to bridge the retirement savings gap between men and women, which is estimated at 47 per cent.\n\"In 2011‐12, women held just 36 per cent of Australia's superannuation savings,\" Mr Bowen will tell a Committee for Economic Development of Australia event on Tuesday.\nBut Labor would not \"stand by as we condemn millions of women to a less than adequate income to see them through retirement\".\nANZ top-ups Mr Bowen will praise ANZ, which recently announced it would provide top‐up superannuation contributions of $500 a year for female staff in Australia. The bank will also pay super contributions on parental leave for up to 24 months.\nMr Bowen will flag new laws to make it easier for companies to provide such top-ups without needing to seek approval from the Human Rights Commission. \"At the moment, getting permission [for] this involves a bureaucratic process of approval which could sensibly be done away with,\" he will say.\n\"I can see some advantages to allowing voluntary joint superannuation accounts,\" Mr Bowen will say.\n \"We've worked hard to reduce the number of accounts in the system to improve efficiency and reduce the whittling away of super by fees. Perhaps introducing joint accounts might assist considerably.\n\"Joint accounts might also assist in dealing with the matter of gender inequality.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:57:05.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
