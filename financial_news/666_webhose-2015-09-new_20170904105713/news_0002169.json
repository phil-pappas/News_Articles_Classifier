In a research report BofA-ML said, “We see possibility of smaller telcos could hand over their spectrum to larger telcos like Bharti Airtel or Idea Cellular in a particular circle and exit the relevant circle; Telco like RComm could liberalise its 800 MHz spectrum and hand it to Jio to use for LTE.” We consider these norms to be positive for the industry as it would facilitate consolidation in absence of any friendly M&A rules.”\nAs of now only government is allowed to allocate spectrum to telecom firms through auctions.\nThe move is expected to increase efficient use of radiowaves by enabling telecom operators, who have a low subscriber base or unutilised spectrum lying with them, to trade in radiowaves.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 2:51 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:20:04.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
