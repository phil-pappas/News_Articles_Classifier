A surge in U.S. gasoline prices was also supportive. \nOfficial U.S. crude inventory data is scheduled to be released later on Wednesday. \nYet outside the United States, international crude markets remained weak largely because of high supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) clashing with Asia's slowing demand. \nAustralian bank Macquarie said China's economic outlook for the fourth quarter of the year was not convincing. \n\"There are green shoots showing scattered evidence of improvement ... However, as of yet these signs are not broad-based so it's hard to conclude whether they are the beginning of a genuine recovery or just normal economic fluctuations,\" the bank said. \nIn other commodities markets, coal prices fell to levels last seen before the financial crisis in 2008/2009 as high mining output clashes with falling demand. \nMarkets are keeping a close eye on Washington in the next two days as the U.S. Fed begins a two-day session to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. \nHigher U.S. interest rates would likely attract cash from money traders, lifting the dollar. That would be seen as a bearish signal for oil as it makes fuel imports costlier for buyers holding other currencies. \n(Editing by Tom Hogue and Subhranshu Sahu)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:21:20.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
