The mobile-first platform works on any device, including through mobile applications and web through videos, presentations and other formats.\n\n\"Companies have focused on recuitment and training of direct employees but not the frontline staff who are impacting revenues and brand of the company,\" said 39-year-old CEO Mrigank Tripathi, who cofounded the company with Sachin Grover.\nTripathi, an Insead MBA, earlier founded mobile advertising company Applied Mobile Labs while Grover was VP technology at Applied Mobile Labs before which he had worked at companies like Yahoo, Microsoft and HP.\nThe funding will be used to expand into the international markets, expand the team from 25 to 50 and enhance the technology platform.\nCapabiliti claims that it overcomes challenges like low-buffering speeds and high cost of streaming, compressing the data. And managers can assess and monitor the progress through a dashboard anywhere.\nIt already has clients like Airtel, Flipkart, Shopclues and Indus Towers.\nCapabiliti charges on a pay per use basis and has already seen over 700,000 transactions.\n\"The Qustn platform targets the large opportunity of skilling India effectively. Converting people to be productive and industry ready at nationwide scale necessitates a radical reform in multiple aspects and is a key agenda for the Modi Government whose ambitious 'Skill India Mission' seeks to skill 40.2 crore workers by 2022,\" said Gururaj, chairman of Frictionless Ventures & Chair Nasscom Product Council. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:02:04.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
