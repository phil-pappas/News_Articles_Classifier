Shantanu Starick The unique partnership has produced a range of products marrying contemporary design to Indigenous art forms, including the Yuta Badayala lighting range, which will feature in the Rigg Design Prize 2015 .\n\"We loved the idea of juxtaposing these precious metal components with the irregularities and beauty of the woven elements,\" Titchkosky says.\nBilled as the top award for object and furniture design in Australia, the $30,000 triennial prize will be announced at the National Gallery of Victoria on September 16.\n'Complete artistic licence' The Elcho Island artists began with a standard light frame created by Koskela, and then had \"complete artistic licence\" to weave, Titchkosky says. \"It's like Christmas every time we get a delivery as we never know what the women will do with the frames.\n\"It seems as though the project has given them more freedom to experiment with their weaving and challenge themselves as the frame provides the form.\"\nTheir collaboration also produced the Shelter and Hoodie flexible work spaces for an office environment, and a large wall mural by artist Megan Yunupingu.\n\"The idea behind Shelter is a marriage of these spaces with the idea of people gathering around a campfire, congregating, talking and sharing stories,\" Titchkosky says.\nKoskela and the weavers of Elcho Island, which is also home to acclaimed musician Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, are one of seven entrants in the Rigg Design Prize.\nOther designers featured in the prize include Adam Goodrum, who will show a series of flat-pack houses designed to be emergency shelters, and Melbourne-based Kate Rohde.\nRohde's one-room installation is a lurid Rococo fantasy of tables and chairs, a chandelier, wall mirror and wallpaper decorated with a menagerie of rabbits, peacocks, snakes and other animals.\nA 'greatest hits' moment \"It's my greatest hits moment,\" she says. \"It's very colourful, very handmade and very much inspired by historical decorative arts but made with very contemporary material â€“ resins, plastics and polymers.\"\nThe Rigg Design Prize is an initiative of the NGV's newly formed Department of Contemporary Design and Architecture, replacing the Victorian-based Cicely and Colin Rigg Craft Award.\nCurator Simone LeAmon says the prize aims to identify designers whose work is independent, original and expresses contemporary issues.\n\"The department was conscious that there was no national prize championing creative design practice in Australia,\" she says.\nLeAmon describes the practices featured in the Rigg Design Prize, which will be judged by US curator Wava Carpenter and Dutch designer Gijs Bakker, as \"immensely valuable\".\n\"Like artists, contemporary designers are conscious of their creative potential and apply it to explore ideas and contemporary issues,\" she says. \"They use design to inquire, experiment, test and propose things for the world.\"\n'Creation, intentional change' LeAmon says design is not simply about styling or the manufacture of commercial goods, but is an \"agency for creation and intentional change\".\n\"As a curator I am interested in understanding how designing and making (in a time) reflects upon the designer, society and the world at large,\" she says.\nWorking with Elcho Island artists reflects Koskela's philosophy of generating opportunities for others as well as profit, Titchkosky says.\n\"It was important to us that we try and find a way to create alternate independent income sources for the women we work with, and that together we try and bridge the divide that exists between our two cultures and worlds,\" she says.\n\"We know this project won't be able to change generations of disempowerment. But if in our own small way we can affect a group of people positively through this project then we think we have done something pretty special.\"\nThe Rigg Design Prize is at NGV Australia, Federation Square from September 18 to February 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/rigg-design-prize-2015/"], "published": "2015-09-07T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:02:26.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
