Joshua Roberts Share on twitter by Patrick Commins The big news this week and which everyone is talking (and talking, and talking) about is, of course, the meeting of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy setting committee.\nDid you know that if the Fed moves on Friday at 4am AEST it would be the first rate rise in almost a decade? Of course you did. This is, after all, \"the most anticipated change in the whole history of anticipated changes\" , as Russell Investment's resident wag and head of investment strategy, Graham Harman, has succinctly put it.\nAnd yet investors are still, and indeed increasingly, tying themselves in knots trying to figure out what the latest drip feed of news or market gyration means for the chance of a rate rise. Talking heads now reckon chairwoman Janet Yellen and her compadres will factor the recent global turmoil in financial markets into their decision on whether to raise. That's right, the decision is now not only \"data dependent\", but apparently also \"market dependent\".\nThat has sparked some through-the-looking-glass style commentary in recent weeks. For example, that last Thursday's vicious and rather mysterious snap-back in sharemarkets was a result of investors worrying the previous day's equally powerful relief rally had raised the odds of a rate rise. In other words, any rally will raise the risk of a rate rise, causing a sell-off, which in turn decreases the odds of rate rise, and so on and so forth until the entire market disappears up its own fundament. Cue paralysis. And volatility.\nMeanwhile analysts at Societe Generale are casting doubt on whether the actions of the Fed are even that big a factor in the recent emerging market currency falls that have so vexed central bankers and led them to rethink the timing of a rate rise. The SG analysts note that in the recent emerging market (EM) currency turmoil \"it's no longer the fears of a Fed hike that are in the driving seat, but the EM slowdown and policy changes\".\nIn other words, it's not worries of a rate hike that are pushing the US dollar higher on a broad basis, they say: \"The weakness in EM currencies is now sourced in the EM slowdown, which has only been aggravated by the sharp fall in commodity prices\".\nThat relates more to what's happening in China – which consumes roughly half the world's commodity production – than what is happening in Washington.\nYet, avoiding more turmoil in emerging markets is exactly why many experts are now warning the Fed not to move.\n All of which obscures the two biggest threats to investors around the world: that the world's central banks risk losing credibility in the eyes of investors by not following words with actions; and the prospect of the US economy at some stage down the track entering into a recession with interest rates at zero and a gridlocked Congress.\nThe third worry with maintaining a zero interest rate policy well past its use-by date is that inflation takes off and the Fed is forced to play catch-up to control runaway prices, tightening rates faster and precipitating an economic crash.\nThat last fear looks less pressing because of the weak state of the world's economy , but all these risks are growing. The much-touted dangers of a single rate rise killing the US economic recovery, while not totally unfounded, seem overstated, particularly when the Fed will almost certainly accompany any action with soothing words about how gentle and gradual the tightening cycle will be.\nWe – investors, economists, analysts, journalists – need to move on and shift the debate forward.\nThe Fed has been signalling its intention to raise for some time. In July, Dr Yellen said she needed \"some\" improvement in jobs.\nWell, she got it, so get on with it: hike.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-09-16T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:10:58.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
