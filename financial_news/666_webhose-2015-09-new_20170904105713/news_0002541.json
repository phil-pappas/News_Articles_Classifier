They took first place.\nThe event is the world's largest wearables and fashion tech startup competition where renowned technology and fashion experts assemble together for a hands-on battle over sharing ideas, forming teams and launching startups in just 54-hours.\nThree Zimmerman associates entered the competition with ideas that were representative of the agency's \"Responsible Ambition\" approach that is designed to apply bold innovation to solve real world, transactional business challenges. Natalie Zauhar (Sr. UX specialist), Nick McKenzie (Managing Technical Director) and Jessica Gutchess (Jr. UX specialist) took their concepts to Miami and proved to venture capitalists and startup experts that their ideas were the best.\nThe winning entry was called Precision in Motion - an idea based on chronic issues that arise when someone is working out using bad form. The solution they found was to create fitness clothing equipped with sensors that monitored the body in motion while performing the activity. This technology is able to detect bad form and correct it by providing real time feedback with sensory cues that will sync with an app to track your form showing a 360-degree view. While this idea could be sold in partnership with a brand like Reebok or Under Armour for incremental product sales, the app experience can extend to monetize further - from contextual ad push to partnerships with insurance companies, service providers and like minded active brands.\n\"We work in innovation, so as a team, we're constantly thinking of ideas, creating concepts and finding solutions to issues we face every day. That's how Precision in Motion came to fruition, serving as a catalyst for change in the CrossFit world utilizing the technology and talent this agency has to offer. I had the idea, Zimmerman provided us the platform to go out and pursue it,\" says team lead Natalie Zauhar, who next travels to Poznan, Poland on October 19 th , to pitch their concept in front of thousands of tech enthusiasts and international judges. Interestingly, Zimmerman's alternative concept placed second, making the agency the top contender at the event.\n\"I am so proud of the team, as they continue to prove that the sexiness of innovation has a critical place mixed with the responsibility of retail business,\" says CEO Michael Goldberg\nAbout Zimmerman Advertising\nZimmerman Advertising, an Omnicom Group company, is the leading integrated, retail agency in the country.
