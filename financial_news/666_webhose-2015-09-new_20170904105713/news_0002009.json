Getty Images Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens has challenged his US counterpart Janet Yellen to shun fears of upsetting financial markets by getting on with hiking for the first time in nine years the world's most important official interest rate.\nIn a sign of deepening frustration at the Federal Reserve's failure to hike official interest rates early on Friday, Mr Stevens said there would always be some market move, some weak piece of economic data or some argument to say \"don't do it just yet.\"\n\"One day you are just going to have to do it,\" said Mr Stevens, who argued before a House of Representatives committee on Friday that doing so would be in America's best interests, and by extension the rest of the world.\nMr Stevens said \"they need to [go up] for the US's sake.\"\nAfter one of the longest and most fevered pre-meeting build-ups on record, Dr Yellen left the US benchmark at close to zero citing China-driven financial market volatility and renewed worries about the global economy.\nThe Fed's decision to delay yet again a retreat from the most stimulatory monetary policy stance in its history - despite ever-growing fears of adding to dangerous asset-bubbles around the world - highlights the degree to which it has become captured by market sentiment and factors outside the US.\nMr Stevens suggested that while it was right for the Fed to be conscious of its impact globally it should get started with what had been a comprehensively telegraphed move.\n\"It is a better thing, really, if the Fed can get the lift-off achieved,\" Mr Stevens said, characterising the pending move as \"easing off the gas a little bit\" rather than \"jumping to the brake.\"\n\"There will now be furious debate for the next eight or 10 weeks, until we get up to Christmas, on whether they will go in December.\"\n Mr Stevens' comment was reflected throughout markets in the wake of the Fed's delay, with analysts expressing exasperation at the lack of action after so long a build-up.\nBetashares chief economist David Bassanese slammed the Fed decision as \"ludicrous.\"\n\"The Fed is fighting the wrong war, with misplaced concern over persistently low US inflation and insufficient regard to build-up of financial risk associated with keeping interest rates so low,\" he said.\nThe failure to reload its monetary policy \"canon\" also leaves it vulnerable should a new economic shock push the US off course, he said.\nThe Australian dollar strengthened after the Fed outcome to just shy of US72¢, while financial market traders put a 100 per cent bet on the Reserve Bank cutting its cash rate from a record-low 2 per cent to 1.75 per cent by May.\nBill Evans, the chief economist at Westpac, had factored a September Fed rate increase into his forecasts.\n\"These sorts of decisions are often fine lines and whilst it came as a big surprise to me, you can understand the degree of caution given the enormity of the decision,\" Mr Evans said.\n\"The risk that people run is just spitting the dummy really and saying 'if they didn't go now, they'll never go'. Of course they will, they're central bankers.\"\nMr Stevens, who spent much of his three-hour testimony talking up the economy, the speed of the transition away from resources and his comfort with the Australian dollar at its current levels, also strongly acknowledged the growing risk of leaving interest rates too low for too long.\n\"It is possible and, if it happened, it would not be the first time,\" Mr Stevens said, pointing to widespread criticism of the Fed for leaving rates too low in 2003, 2004 and 2005, something that has been widely blamed for the US subprime mortgage crisis.\nWhile historically such mistakes normally resulted in a surge of \"standard\" goods and services inflation rates - in turn requiring policy makers to \"crunch the economy to get it down\" – the more likely risk in the current environment was that low rates would lead to too much risk-taking in the hunt for yield.\nThis then could result in people running into trouble when rates eventually go up, he said.\n\"That risk clearly exists, given that we have not only the Fed but the Bank of Japan having zero rates more or less for 13 years. The ECB has a zero, even negative, rate, and it will do so for some time.\n\"Clearly, that set of issues is on the minds of some people. That is a risk that attends these very unorthodox policies — very unusual policies. It is a risk that the relevant central banks think that they have to take.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-18T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:39:24.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
