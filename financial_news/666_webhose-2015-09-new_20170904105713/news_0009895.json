Thomas Davidson Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Former Liberal Party prime minister John Howard will hit the trail in the West Australian seat of Canning on Thursday in a campaign from which Prime Minister Tony Abbott has moved to firewall himself from the end result.\nMr Howard, who has another engagement in Perth, will use the opportunity to campaign with the Liberal Party's star candidate Andrew Hastie . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will make another visit to the seat on Thursday to campaign with Labor candidate Matt Keogh.\n​Mr Abbott made his second visit to the seat on Wednesday, during which Mr Hastie, a former SAS captain, stepped in to defend the Prime Minister against questions regarding the impact on his leadership, should there be a large swing against the government.\n\"I am very busy on the ground. I don't have time to take counsel from the east coast twitterati,\" he said.\n\"There is a significant disconnect between what people are saying over in the east and what is happening here in Canning.\"\nMr Abbott said \"this election is not about me\".\n\"I know that people in Canberra will try to make it that way, but as far as the people of Canning are concerned, quite rightly, they think it is about them and I think it's about them – who can best represent them in Canberra.\"\nMr Keogh said the byelection was about local representation as well as the Abbott government's performance. The two issues could not be divorced, he said.\n Liberals clinging on The Liberals hold the seat by 11.8 per cent. The byelection was caused by the death of popular member Don Randall, but several polls in the past fortnight show the Liberals clinging on with a 51 per cent to 49 per cent lead.\nIf this was replicated at the byelection on September 19 it would represent a swing of about 10 per cent and stoke further anxiety in Coalition ranks about Mr Abbott's leadership.\nOne senior conservative Liberal told The Australian Financial Review there was a growing view that it would be improper to sack a sitting prime minster, even if Canning was lost.\n\"We will go to the next election with him. If we win, good. If we lose, well, so be it,\" the MP said.\nMr Abbott also rejected a view, put to cabinet on Tuesday by his deputy Julie Bishop, that Labor was running dead in the seat. This was because there has been a redistribution in Western Australia and after the byelection Canning will be come a safer Liberal seat, while the newly created seat of Burt will be notionally Labor and Mr Keogh can win that at the general election.\nMr Shorten dismissed this theory, as did Mr Abbott.\n\"We're certainly expecting Labor to throw the kitchen sink at this seat in the last few weeks ... because Labor want this seat,\" he said.\nSenior Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos played down the consequences of a Liberal loss. He pointed out the Howard government lost the blue-ribbon Queensland seat of Ryan in a February 2001 byelection but won the seat back, along with government, at the federal election later that year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-02T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:07:09.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
