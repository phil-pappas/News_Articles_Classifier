The United Nations refugee agency puts the figure at around 1.1 million. \nThe crisis in Europe has prompted some leaders to announce a greater refugee intake. Germany says it expects an estimated 800,000 people to arrive this year while Britain has said it will take in the 20,000 Syrians over the next five years. \nThe war has killed 250,000 people and forced half of all Syrians from their homes, creating the worst refugee crisis since World War Two. \nAnother 7.6 million people are displaced within the country. \nSalam said Lebanon was struggling to cope with the influx from its much larger neighbour, especially given that some international aid had been cut. \n\"We are convinced that the refugee crisis which reached the crux of Europe today is a phenomenon that cannot come to a halt unless we find a political solution to put an end to the war in Syria,\" he said. \nThe two men also discussed the \"threat of Islamist extremism,\" Cameron said, adding that Britain would continue its support to the Lebanese security services. \n\"Of course that threat is more acute here with ISIS-held territory just 60 miles from your border,\" Cameron said, referring to land held by Islamic State militants in Syria. \nBritain has promised 100 million pounds ($154.5 million) to help Syrian refugees in several countries, with up to 29 million going to Lebanon.
