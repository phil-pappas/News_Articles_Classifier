For Malcolm Turnbull, disruption offers opportunities. Photo: Supplied, AP\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull seems to have a favourite new word.\nIn his first couple of speeches since becoming Liberal leader, he's said \"disruption . . . is our friend\", and that we must embrace the \"disruptive environment\" that we are living in.\nIt's music to the ears of Australia's fledgling start-up scene, and absolutely true. But what the hell does it actually mean?\n\"Disrupt\", \"disruptive\" and \"disruption\" have become annoying and overused terms in technology and business in recent years.\nAdvertisement It all stems from a theory developed by Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, almost two decades ago, in his seminal book The Innovator's Dilemma .\nChristensen defines a disruptive technology as one that \"takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors\".\nHis theory is basically that successful companies are inclined to pursue \"sustaining innovations\"; ones that allow them to charge high prices from their richest customers at the top of the market and generate the biggest profits.\nHowever, doing this leaves a gap at the bottom of the market – which the successful firm views as undesirable – for someone else to exploit.\nA truly disruptive innovation creates a whole new market by opening up a product or service to a wider range of consumers who previously couldn't afford to use its predecessor (which becomes less relevant or even redundant).\nThink of what personal computers did to mainframes, or what discount retailers like Walmart did to the full service department store.\nThese days, you could say Netflix is disrupting pay TV; Uber's ride-sharing service is disrupting traditional taxis, and Airbnb is disrupting the hotel.\nYet, while disruption has become synonymous with almost any trailblazing company in tech, that's actually not the case.\nApple, the world's biggest company, confounds disruption theorists because its key product, the iPhone, was more expensive than the early smartphones it so ruthlessly superseded.\nChristensen said as much.\n\"[The iPhone is] not [truly] disruptive. History speaks pretty loudly on that, that the probability of success is going to be limited,\" he told Businessweek in 2007.\nOops!\nTesla, Elon Musk's electric car maker, is another company that doesn't conform to the disruption narrative because its vehicles (which cost about $100,000) are so pricey.\nHowever, we're getting into semantics here. And \"disrupt\" is not the first word in business theory (or language) to evolve into a new meaning.\n\"Innovate\", another word the Prime Minister seems to be fond of, \"used to have chiefly negative connotations: it signified excessive novelty, without purpose or end\", wrote the New Yorker in a piece heavily critical of Christensen's theory.\nDisruption poses a risk to Australia.\nAs I have written previously , the advantages local businesses have enjoyed for decades – like proximity to customers – are being rapidly undermined by new technologies, mainly owned by companies operating from overseas.\nFor instance, Netflix has struck fear into the hearts of Australian television executives but doesn't employ a single person in this country.\nSooner or later this disruption is going to be a problem for the economy. It's also a huge opportunity.\nThat our leaders (on both sides of politics) seem to recognise this is good news indeed.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/technology/startups-welcome-innovation-focus-20150921-gjr5ye", "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine", "http://www.claytonchristensen.com/key-concepts/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2007-06-15/clayton-christensens-innovation-brainbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice", "https://theconversation.com/why-apple-and-its-iphone-confound-disruption-theorists-38205"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:45:56.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
