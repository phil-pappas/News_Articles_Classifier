Shariah Advisory Group is advising conglomerate HNA Group on what could be the first Islamic financing by a mainland firm. Photo: Reuters \nIslamic finance is gaining prominence as a channel for China to expand its economic influence abroad as banks strengthen ties with Muslim-majority countries and Chinese companies start to tap offshore pools of Islamic funds. \nWith a Muslim population of about 20 million, China has little reason to develop Islamic banking at home. But there are powerful reasons for it to get involved in the sector overseas. \nChina wants to build stronger trade ties with Asian countries under its \"one belt, one road\" strategy to rebuild Silk Road trade links with Asia and Europe. \nThe network will include the world's main centres of Islamic finance, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, where sharia-compliant assets account for as much as a quarter of total banking assets. \n\"With 'one belt, one road', (Chinese) state-owned enterprises and private companies are now more willing to explore Islamic finance,\" said Hong Kong-based Ben Ping Chung Cheung, Asia Pacific head of consultancy Shariah Advisory Group. \nThe firm is advising conglomerate HNA Group on what could be the first Islamic financing by a mainland firm: a US$150 million deal to buy ships. \nHNA also plans an offshore issue of sukuk (Islamic bonds), Cheung said. \nA railway project in the eastern province of Shandong was also exploring issuing sukuk to raise as much as 30 billion yuan (HK$36.4 billion) for a high-speed rail link, Cheung said. \nIf successful, such a deal would rank among the largest sukuk ever issued. Hurdles remain, however, as discussions were still preliminary and any financing would face stiff competition from domestic banks, Cheung added. \nIn July, Singapore-based adviser Silk Routes Financials said it had been mandated by a unit of state-owned Sichuan Development to advise on Islamic financing options. \n\"There is certainly some momentum, a consequence of the large and growing trade links between China and the Gulf,\" said Jonathan Fried, a partner at law firm Linklaters in Dubai. \nAt a governmental level, Chinese participation in Islamic finance may be mainly via the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a new multilateral lender backed by Beijing. \nThe AIIB has discussed using Islamic finance with the Islamic Development Bank, two lenders which have 20 member countries in common. \nIslamic deals could help AIIB differentiate itself from rivals such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
