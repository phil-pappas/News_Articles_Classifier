WMT is reportedly putting pressure on suppliers to cut prices of goods produced in China in a bid to benefit from the yuan devaluation.\nAccording to sources, the retail giant is in talks with more than 10,000 suppliers worldwide for a 2%-6% reduction in the costs of general Chinese goods such as apparels, shoes, beauty products, and electronics. The company wants its suppliers to share the savings generated from currency headwinds in China to provide its customers with lower prices.\nWe note that in August, the Chinese government devalued its currency by nearly 2% in a bid to boost domestic growth by making its exports cheaper. However, the move failed to calm investors and markets continued to decline due to a global slowdown.\nWal-Mart is not the only one looking to benefit from the currency devaluation. Companies like Toys R Us and Home Depot HD are also looking at vendors for cost savings. The weaker currency has made China's exports cheaper, especially when purchased with the strong dollar as the yuan is down 2.9% compared to the dollar so far in 2015.\nThe company expects to use its bargaining power and wide distribution network so that suppliers would agree to its terms. In the past too, the retail giant had asked its vendors to pay to store inventory in its warehouse and to extend the payment period.\nThe company is looking to increase margins, as it has already pledged to spend $1 billion to raise employees’ wages and give them extra training. We note that Wal-Mart had increased its minimum wage to $9 an hour in April, and expects to increase it to $10 per hour in Feb 2016. Higher labor costs along with the company’s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations have weighed on its earnings.\nBentonville, AR-based Wal-Mart has been posting disappointing results for the past several quarters due to sluggish U.S. sales. Wal-Mart delivered weak results in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. While earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues beat the same. Higher expenses along with lower margins at Wal-Mart U.S. and unfavorable currency impact took a toll on the company’s earnings. The company also slashed its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance due to lower-than-expected earnings in the quarter.\nCurrently, Wal-Mart is gearing up for the holiday season and will leave no stone unturned to attract holiday shoppers with the best deals.\nWal-Mart carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nStocks to Consider \nBetter-ranked companies in the retail sector include The Kroger Co. KR and Ingles Market Inc. IMKTA. Both of them carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
