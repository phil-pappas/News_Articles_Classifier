When in fact, it's just one factor of many.\"\n\"Eligibility criteria amongst lenders varies enormously. For example, does the borrower fit the mortgage providers lending profile? Are they a previous or existing customer? How is the lenders existing loan book weighted? And what is their attitude to risk?\"\nGraham continues, \"Many people in the UK are still feeling the effects of austerity since the financial crisis. Subsequently, mortgages for bad credit are in huge demand. Our aim with this guide is to educate consumers in a jargon-free way about how they can improve their credit score and increase their chances of getting a mortgage.\"\n\"The guide explains what to check for on a credit report, and how to go about removing or amending incorrect information. It can be surprising just how much information the credit reference agencies hold.\"\nActing as an introducer, the website connects consumers across the UK with specialist bad credit mortgage brokers whom have access to adverse credit mortgage lenders, as well as more mainstream lenders.\nMr Cox explains, \"The chances of getting a mortgage deal often improve dramatically if the client's credit event, such as discharge from bankruptcy , or payment default, occurred more than 2 years ago. But the brokers can sometimes source deals where the credit event was more recent.‚Äù\nThe company has invested heavily in the site's online application form, making it possible to submit a basic application in less than 60 seconds. But a local rate telephone number is also available for visitors who prefer a more human touch.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/badcredit/mortgagebroker/prweb12917867.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.badcreditmortgagebroker.co.uk/how-to-improve-credit-score", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/badcredit/mortgagebroker/prweb12917867.htm", "https://www.badcreditmortgagebroker.co.uk/discharged-bankruptcy"], "published": "2015-09-17T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:24:54.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
