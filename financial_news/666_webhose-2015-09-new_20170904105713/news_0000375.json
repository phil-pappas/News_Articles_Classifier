While some top executives saw substantial overall compensation increases, salary levels remained relatively flat in 2014 compared with prior years, according to The AIS Report.

Donald Gallo, a leader in Towers Watson’s health insurance team in its executive compensation practice who works closely with Blues plans, tells The AIS Report CEO compensation levels were fairly consistent between 2013 and 2014, and didn’t move much in 2015. From 2014 to 2015, base salary among all not-for-profit health plan CEOs increased 2.6%, total cash compensation grew 2.9% and targeted total direct compensation was up an average of 4%, according to Towers Watson data.\nAccording to AIS data, Joseph Swedish, CEO at Anthem, Inc., earned the most of any Blues plan executive — despite earning 20% less than in 2013 — taking home $1.2 million in salary and more than $12 million in other compensation.\nDue to tax regulations, only a handful of not-for-profit Blues plan CEOs had a base salary in excess of $1 million, according to The AIS Report — including Patricia A. Hemingway Hall from Health Care Service Corp., Daniel Loepp from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Richard L. Boals from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, and Daniel J. Hilferty from Independence Blue Cross.\nVisit https://aishealth.com/archive/nblu1015-01 to read the article in its entirety, which includes a table ranking 33 Blues plan CEOs by 2014 total compensation.\nAbout The AIS Report on Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans\nThe AIS Report on Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans delivers timely news and insightful analysis of new products, market share, strategies, conversions, financing, profitability and strategic alliances of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which are major players in every U.S. health insurance market.
