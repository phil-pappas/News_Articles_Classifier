Roughly 5% of clients' assets are invested in Chinese companies through Hong Kong-listed shares. \nMartin Gilbert, Aberdeen's respected chief executive, has continued to reaffirm his commitment to the group's strategy, insisting that its exposure to faster-growing markets will pay off over the long term. \nMr Gilbert is also a director of Sky plc (LSE: BSY.L - news ) , the owner of Sky News. \nAberdeen has seen its shares fall by nearly a quarter during the last year, but it has continued to be acquisitive, buying Advance Emerging Capital, a specialist investment manager, earlier this week. \nThe Aberdeen deal will be one of a number struck during the Chancellor's visit, with companies including Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , Deloitte, HSBC and Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) all represented on the trip. \nMr Osborne said on Friday: \n\"I want us to forge closer economic and cultural links with China. Our partnership for growth, reform and innovation is helping to deliver record levels of investment and trade in both directions, but there is much more we can do. \n\"This trip is all about exploring new opportunities to open up new markets to benefit both economies.\" \nIn a statement, the Treasury added that the Chancellor would argue that \"far from backing away from China after the events of the summer, Britain aims to increase cooperation and understanding between the two countries and open up billions of pounds of potential opportunities between what remains the world's fastest growing major economy and the UK\". \nAn Aberdeen spokesman declined to comment on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T04:22:21.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
