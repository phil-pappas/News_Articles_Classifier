Photo: Brendan Esposito\nWith ad-blocking reportedly leading to a $U22 billion ($31.3 billion) loss in advertising revenue worldwide in 2015, brands and publishers are on the hunt of new revenue streams and ways of connecting with audiences.\nMedia investment firm GroupM's third annual mLab exhibition sought to show media agencies how new technologies can be used to connect with audiences and run compelling campaigns.\nInstagram, Fairfax Media (publisher of The Australian Financial Review and BusinessDay ), Adshell, UTS, Kantar and social media start-ups FanFuel, TRIBE and Social Status partnered with GroupM to show media buyers what's picking up and what marketing could be like in the future.\n\"Marketers need to understand the ecosystem of their entire campaign and use each channel properly,\" Instagram creative strategist Claus Stangl said.\nAdvertisement With 400 million active users, brands have a chance to connect with this massive audience but it's not the traditional selling model, Mr Stangl said.\n\"Nike have a multitude of accounts but the main thing is the athletes. They use a lot of user-generated inventory, every single shot is aspirational, it makes you want to train as well,\" he said.\n\"It's about making relevant content for the platform. It needs to be talking to the right people and it needs to be executed in an authentic manner.\"\nFairfax Media presented a home of the future, integrating its publishing assets, such Good Food, into a connected fridge and kitchen bench to help decide on a meal with what ingredients were on offer, as well as guiding the cooking process. It also sought to show how, by using data, brands could reach customers on content relevant to them, such as travel and Domain.\nDaniel Paronetto, from social media upstart FanFuel, said customers were getting bombarded with ads daily, so there was an opportunity for brands with a different message.\n\"When we unlock our phones we're not looking for ads, we're looking to be inspired, to be entertained, to have a laugh. We're looking for stories, and those stories are being told on social media,\" Mr Paronetto said.\n\"The best people telling these stories are influencers, and influencer can be an actor, actress, model and we at FanFuel work with athletes.\"\nRugby league-turned-National Football League star Jarryd Hayne has more than 1 million followers and is able to generate 50,000 views on every video he posts online and generate a 120,000 interactions, Mr Paronetto said.\n\"We created an algorithm that captures the size of the athlete's audience, how engaged that audience is with his content and finally how many times that athlete is mentioned online, and that gives us a price per post. Now we're able to measure what a post is worth on any of the many platforms.\"\nRadio presenter and founder of social media marketing company TRIBE Jules Lund said there are 250,000 Australians with 5000 or more followers on any of the major social platforms, and that opens up a whole new world for marketers.\n\"Naturally, brands and marketers are going to start to integrate their marketing messages within content that can't be blocked. They'll be collaborating with creators,\" Mr Lund said.\nA recent reported by Abode and Pagefair estimated $US22 billion of advertising would be lost to publishers in 2015 thanks to ad-blocking software.\n\"It's a marketplace that connects brands with not only celebrity influencers, but citizen influencers â€“ everyday Australians that have built an incredible-sized tribe around a particular expertise or passion.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:51:54.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
