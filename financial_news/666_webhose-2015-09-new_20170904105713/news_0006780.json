Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Joanna Mather A plan to expand the GST to financial services has earned the support of two of the nation's most popular political leaders, but will be opposed by the banks.\nNSW Premier Mike Baird has joined South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill in supporting the taxation of household consumption of financial services if extra money is raised for health.\nThe AFR-KPMG tax reform summit will hear that NSW Premier Mike Baird and SA Premier Jay Weatherill will support the taxation of household consumption of financial services if extra money is raised for health. Louise Kennerley The push will not be well received by banks, which have previously warned against extending the 10 per cent GST to financial services because the costs will be passed on to consumers.\nMr Weatherill will outline a plan to tax bank profits when he speaks at the AFR Tax Summit in Sydney on Wednesday.\nThe change would mean the margin of profit earned by financial institutions on services such as home loans would be taxed at 10 per cent.\n\"Consistent with the need to keep all options on the table – and for politicians to explain complex issues and make the case for change – the possibility of closing the finance-sector tax gap should not be ruled out,\" Mr Weatherill will tell the summit.\n Mr Baird said he was open to the idea of a GST on financial services – which are GST-free, along with fresh food, health and education.\nFigures acknowledged as rubbery \"As is widely known, I believe the basis of any such [reform] package should be an increase in the rate of the GST,\" he said ahead of the summit, hosted by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG.\n\"However, inclusion of financial services within the GST, lower income and corporate tax rates, and superannuation reform can all potentially be made consistent with the fundamental principles I have outlined.\"\nTreasury estimates under-taxation of financial services at $4.7 billion in 2015-16, although these figures are widely acknowledged as being rubbery.\nSouth Australia's share of the extra revenue would be $332 million, according to a report commissioned by the state Labor government and written by former KPMG tax partner and now University of Melbourne senior fellow Michael Evans.\nThe report recommends a \"supplementary\" tax on margin-based financial services. That is, the difference between what it costs a bank to lend money and what the bank charges its customers, for example.\n\"In the case of deposit taking and lending, it is the difference between the interest paid and the interest earned over a period,\" Mr Evans said. \"It would essentially be taxing the profits and wages of the banks.\"\nMr Evans said several countries already had mechanisms in place to tax the \"value added\" by financial institutions. France and Denmark levied a higher rate payroll tax of businesses that were undertaxed via that country's domestic value added tax or VAT, he said.\nProfits-based tax to cover VAT exemptions \"Most of the revenue from this additional payroll tax comes from financial institutions,\" he said.\n\"Israel levies a profits-based tax on financial institutions that are exempt under Israel's value added tax.\"\nKPMG tax partner Nick Kallinikos said it was globally recognised that financial services were difficult to tax under a GST regime.\nIn Europe, some countries have signed up for a financial transaction tax, he said, but the scheme had been delayed.\n\"These methods are not ideal [and] introduce their own complexities and distortions,\" he said.\n\"The impact of [financial transaction taxes] and similar proposed taxes on the competitiveness of our financial services sector needs to be carefully considered, particularly as compared with that of our Asian neighbours.\"\nUniversity of NSW professor Michael Walpole said households would inevitably pay more for financial services if such a change were to occur.\nACCC surveillance on price changes urged \"Although the [report suggests] competitive forces should limit the impact of the taxation being passed on in prices, and it rightly urges surveillance of any price changes by the ACCC, it is important before making this change to see by means of a proper study who is likely to bear the higher costs and whether they can afford them,\" he said.\nMr Weatherill and Mr Baird have taken the lead on the discussion about tax reform.\nBoth have said they hope the new line-up in Canberra will reboot meaningful debate.\nMr Weatherill will tell the summit that the GST is not the big revenue generating tax the states were promised before its introduction in 2000.\nHe says the gap, between what the GST might have been expected to collect if it had kept pace with household income, had widened to between $11 billion and $12 billion, or about $500 a head. This is the result of changing consumption and savings patterns.\nMr Baird has argued for a GST increase to 15 per cent, as long as all households earning under $100,000 are compensated.\nFederal Labor does not support any changes to the GST.\nLabor state governments in Victoria and Queensland have pushed for a 2 percentage point increase in the Medicare levy to fund health.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:58:54.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
