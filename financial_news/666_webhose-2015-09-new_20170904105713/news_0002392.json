Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Natasha Zohrabi says Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's clampdown on lending to property investors did not affect her.\nThe full-time investor bought three apartments at Toga Group's $140 million apartment project Macquarie Green, which launched Saturday in Sydney's north.\nMs Zohrabi said that while she was able to use two other existing properties as equity for her new investments, new investors might be caught.\n\"APRA hasn't affected me yet … New investors might have some risks,\" she said.\nShe sold an apartment in the same area – Macquarie Park in North Ryde – in 2011 for a 20 per cent capital gain.\nWhile large capital gains are still attracting confident investors in the Sydney market, BIS Shrapnel warned last week that investors who buy new apartments \"off-the-plan\" could be at risk of settling the property down the track.\nDomain group's senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said the APRA rules also won't deter foreign investors.\n\"In fact I see increased levels in foreign interest in Australian property,\" he said. \"If we are dissuading local investors, through lending conditions, it might make it easier for foreign investors.\n \"The two-tier market – foreign versus local market – will continue. It's the old old story of the \"law of unintended consequences\".\nMs Zohrabi said: \"For me, there is a big chance I will come out on top, for a property which is 20 minutes to the CBD, you can't go wrong,\" she said.\n\"Worse come to worse, I will sell two of of them if I don't make money and I'll come out even. I just don't think prices will drop, it might plateau if anything. So many people work in this area.\"\n\"These properties came to me as a blessing. It it works, great. If not, I never had the money to begin with.\"\nConstruction for Macquarie Green will begin in late 2015 and scheduled for completion in mid-2017.
