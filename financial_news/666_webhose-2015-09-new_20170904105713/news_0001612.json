Getty Images Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey New Treasurer Scott Morrison has given his strongest hint yet he is open to funding income tax cuts to reverse bracket creep with an increased GST.\nMr Morrison, who will attend Thursday's snap reform summit called by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , said while the features of tax reform were important, so was the question as to \"whether you need to do this at all?\"\n\"When you you have the average wage earner in this country about to move into the second-highest tax bracket at $80,000 next year, you've got a problem with the incentives in your tax system,\" he told Sky News when asked about using the GST to fund tax cuts.\nHe reiterated that any tax increases agreed to by the government would be fully offset by tax cuts to ensure no net increase in the tax take. He saw this as the demarcation point with Labor which believed tax increases and reform were necessary to tackle debt and deficit.\n\"When you grow income, you grow revenue,\" Mr Morrison said. His predecessor Joe Hockey, and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann previously flagged funding income tax cuts with a higher GST rate.\nClosed session Mr Morrison, Senator Cormann, and Industry, Innovation and Science Minister Christopher Pyne will join Mr Turnbull on Thursday for the two-hour closed discussion with about 10 representatives from unions, community groups, and the business and industry sectors.\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver, who with the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Social Services, wrote to Mr Turnbull last week seeking a meeting, said former prime minister Tony Abbott had never once phoned him seeking a meeting or discussion. Mr Turnbull rang Mr Oliver and others on Monday inviting them to Canberra.\n Ian Yates, chief executive of Council on the Ageing, is in London and hopes to appear by video link.\nHe told The Australian Financial Review that it was incumbent on the attendees to \"put more work into what we agree with and what we don't agree with\".\n\"If the government is stepping up to the plate, we must work harder to reach agreement,\" he said. \"In the end, the government makes decisions and must wear them.\"\nMr Turnbull called the meeting to harness momentum generated by last month's National Reform Summit , organised by the Financial Review , The Australian and KPMG.\nAgreement on company tax At the end of a day-long discussion, the only consensus was that company tax was too high but there was vehement disagreement on how to fund any cut.\nThere was broad agreement that superannuation tax concessions were being abused.\nMr Yates welcomed Mr Morrison and Mr Turnbull putting superannuation taxes back on the table as part of a proper look at retirement incomes. Labor has already announced plans to trim super tax concessions but Mr Yates urged it to abandon its ideas and look again at the system holistically, including pensions..\nBeing summoned by Mr Turnbull was \"a positive step\" because the National Reform Summit \"was borne out of frustration\" he said.\nSenator Cormann accepted super taxes would be looked at but was not effusive about making changes.\n\"We don't have any plans to increase taxes on superannuation, unlike the Labor Party which, of course, in government increased taxes on people saving for their retirement,\" he told the ABC.\n\"Having said that, obviously retirement income arrangements have been part of the tax reform discussion paper all the way through.\"\nAnother participant, Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox, said industrial relations reform must be front and centre of any reform discussion.\nHe said there had been a lift a business confidence after the dumping of Mr Abbott but \"what we need to do now is turn some of that sentiment into action\".\n\"The Prime Minister, I think, has some political capital that he could usefully spend on the reform agenda.\"\nHe was glad Mr Turnbull had recognised the challenges highlighted by digital disruption and innovation, saying it was \"a recognition from government of the highest levels, that our economy is changing and we need to have these discussions\".\n\"We would hope the government will be able to put together a coherent narrative around the sort of principles that we talked about at the reform summit to take to voters at the next election and push forward the reforms we need.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:03:42.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
