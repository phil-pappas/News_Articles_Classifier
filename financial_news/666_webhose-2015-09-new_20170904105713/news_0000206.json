A UK scientist believes he can stop the £1.1 trillion counterfeit business By Rebecca Burn-Callander | Telegraph – 1 hour 31 minutes ago 2,415.00 -99.00 \nA scientist claims he can save brands around the world £1.1 trillion with new hi-tech ID \nScientist Dr Damian Gardiner, of Cambridge University, has spent 10 years developing a “liquid crystal” material that can be printed onto any product, from pill bottles to banknotes, to help tackle the global counterfeit goods industry, which costs brands between £330bn and £1.1 trillion a year, according to recent estimates. \nDr Gardiner, who was made an enterprise fellow by the Royal Academy of Engineering this year, has developed a technology with several levels of authentication that are impossible to fake. \nHe said: “You can tilt the object and the unique ID will show a different colour irridescence. But you can also probe the printed feature with a reader to see a further signature.” \nA university spin-out company called Ilumink was launched three years ago to commercialise the technology, creating a “black box” that could be installed on any production line. \nThe material can be applied using standard inkjet printers, bringing down the cost of adding the technology to the supply chain considerably, Dr Gardiner said. \nCounterfeiters are becoming ever-more sophisticated and organised , the International Criminal Police Organisation has warned. The World Health Organisation estimates that as many as 1m people die every year worldwide from ingesting counterfeit medications. \nAt the Interpol world congress in Singapore earlier this year, the organisation said that counterfeiters had vastly improved their technological capacity for labelling , and could even reproduce holographic labels to fake provenance or quality. \n“It’s an arms race,” Dr Gardiner said “Criminals can now buy the same machines that brands use to make old-fashioned holograms. We’ve decided to adopt the same strategy as new banknotes, with simple overt features as the first line of defence for the consumer, backed up with a multi-layered approach.” \nDeveloping this kind of technology requires large-scale take-up by global brands. Consumers, retailers and law enforcement officials around the world have to be educated in how to spot the authentic marks and equipped with readers, which costs money. \nDr Gardiner, who is currently conducting trials with a number of potential customers, said: “It’s challenging to find those early adopters. Getting anything that’s new and radical out there is always difficult. You need one big customer to make the first move.” \nTo help Ilumink achieve scale, the start-up was acquired by Tracerco, the diagnostics and detection giant owned by Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) , in March this year. \nTracerco is a significant player in the oil and gas industry, and uses fuel tagging to prevent adulteration of diesel, for example. Dr Vince Croud, Tracerco’s technology director, said: “The acquisition of Ilumink will allow us to expand our portfolio of technology offerings to ensure we keep pace with the changing needs of customers. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is an excellent fit with the Tracerco business, and will allow Tracerco to offer a greatly enhanced range of solutions to its customers.” \nWithout this deal, Ilumink’s technology would probably never have seen the light of day, Dr Gardiner said. \n“This was the best route forward for us,” he said. “Some start-ups can grow organically, but with authentication and security, there is a reticence to work with start-ups. The blue-chips won’t put their trust into a tiny company with no turnover and a handful of employees.” \nThe acquisition has helped open doors for Ilumink at some of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical and luxury goods brands. “Once we establish traction in these two sectors, we will spread out from there,” Dr Gardiner said. “We focused on industries where counterfeiting can destroy the business overnight.” \nIlumink is not the only UK company focusing on this lucrative niche. Rivals include Sofmat , a small Yorkshire company that has developed a 3D barcode that can be printed directly onto medicine pills; Cobalt Light Systems, which has created a new machine that can identify the chemical composition of liquids sealed within non-metallic containers without opening them ; and Alpin, which has technology that allows plasmas to be implanted into glass, creating a unique pattern on the surface that can be used to identify specific batches of bottles, such as medicine, alcohol or perfume. \nDr Gardiner, however, believes that the Tracerco deal, and the relatively low cost to adopt its technology, gives Ilumink the edge over its competition. \nBeing based in Cambridge, which has become renowned for innovation , has also given the company a boost, he said: “I’m lucky to be here. It’s a hotbed of activity, with lots of successful people wanting to help others on their start-up journey. If you want to start a company, this is the place to do it.” \nDr Gardiner, 37, is hopeful that more scientists will follow in his footsteps and find practical applications for their theories. “I wanted to see the results of the work I’d completed, and see it in daily use,” he said. “As a scientist the worst thing you can do is just stay in a lab. You need to solve challenges in real life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:47:19.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
