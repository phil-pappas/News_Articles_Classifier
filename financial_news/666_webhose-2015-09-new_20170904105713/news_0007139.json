It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) would have also helped to conceal from bankers Mr Glasenberg’s Achilles’ heel, the rising cost of financing Glencore’s $29.5bn net debt pile . \nAfter a month of turmoil, which has seen Mr Glasenberg fail to convince investors that the mining and commodities trading giant can survive the current downturn in resources, the Rio Tinto deal looks to have been a defensive ploy. Buying Rio Tinto effectively through a reverse takeover would have allowed Glencore to bury its worrisome debt under its larger rival’s balance sheet. \nToday, lingering fears over the company’s ability to service that debt have helped wipe almost £10bn off value of Glencore in the matter of a month, while a growing number of banks have given a withering analysis of its business in the current downturn. \nIn the words of Mr Glasenberg, the company tried to “bullet proof” its balance sheet by unveiling a $10.5bn package of drastic measures, including cutting its dividend, selling assets and a capital raising that was intended to avert the crisis in confidence that it currently faces. \nThis followed a global roadshow of meetings with major investors where it became apparent to the company’s senior management that it would have strengthen its balance sheet in order to calm nervous backers. \nHowever, the strategy appears to have failed, with its shares opening the week nearly 30pc down and the five-year spread on insuring the company’s debt blowing out to 822 basis points (bps), from 549 bps. \nInvestec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) and Jefferies have both issued damning reports on Glencore, claiming that should commodity prices remain at, or drop further below, their existing depressed levels then the company’s equity value would effectively be wiped out. \n“The risk now is that if commodity prices fall further and Glencore’s credit rating is downgraded to non-investment grade, the cost to fund its marketing business would materially increase,” wrote analysts at Jefferies. \n“In that lower commodity price scenario, profitability of its industrial businesses would weaken as well, and the Glencore balance sheet would be an even greater concern. The company should aggressively act now to reduce this downside tail risk or its share price freefall could have further to go.” \nGlencore vigorously rejects these concerns, claiming that its “business remains operationally and financially robust ”. \nHowever, according to Jefferies, because Glencore’s market value has fallen so dramatically in such a short period of time it has few options left other than to launch a fire sale. Although raising further capital from shareholders, especially deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds, is possible, the option is unlikely to be enough to stabilise its share price. \nFor that to happen it may be forced to broaden the scope of the assets the company is prepared to offload. Jefferies estimates that Glencore could raise $9.5bn from the sale of its stakes in the Collahuasi, Antamina and Antapaccay copper mines, even at a low valuation of $20 per tonne of the metal ore. If Glencore gets really desperate it could also raise a potential $12bn from the sale of its agricultural commodities trading business. \nAlthough Glencore has pulled up the drawbridge at its Swiss headquarters and Mr Glasenberg is stoical about the need for further action to reinforce its balance sheet, analysts fear that the company is running out of time as the cost of insuring its debt is now at worrying levels. Should ratings agencies downgrade its debt and push up its borrowing costs, then Mr Glasenberg would have little choice other than to launch that fire sale. \n“Glencore is now under pressure to strengthen its balance sheet via asset sales or a capital injection, and time is of the essence. There is value in Glencore shares if the company can pull the appropriate levers now, but risks are clearly very high. We maintain our ‘Hold’ rating on Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) shares as the risk/reward trade-off is still not attractive despite the potential upside,” said Jefferies. \nOne option would be to split the company in two. Jefferies values its industrial mining business at around $40bn and its trading unit, which is more vulnerable to debt due to its greater exposure to price fluctuations at around $20bn. Including the cash it has on hand from its recent $2.5bn equity raising, the combined business has fair value of 69p per share. \nHowever, breaking up Glencore would be a bitter pill for Mr Glasenberg to swallow. Since becoming chief executive in 2002, the South African mining mogul has built the business on the basis of being the world’s only truly integrated trader and miner. The pinnacle of this strategy was reached three years ago with the $46bn takeover of the coal mining giant Xstrata. \nIn the current context, that deal which was the largest completed in the mining sector appears to have marked the top of the so-called commodities super-cycle; and Glencore, like many of its peers in the sector, remains shackled with a business model that is still geared towards the high growth of meeting rising demand for resources from China. \nUnfortunately, China can no longer be relied upon to consume everything the miners dig up, which is the bigger and more worrying problem that is entirely out of Mr Glasenberg’s control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:51:17.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
