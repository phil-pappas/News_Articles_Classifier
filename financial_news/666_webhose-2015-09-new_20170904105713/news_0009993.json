All because an IRS representative had called into the talk show and was placed on hold. According to reports, while the agent was on hold, he took a call from a taxpayer calling in to discuss her tax situation. His call into the talk show was taken off hold and the conversation went live.”\nWillis adds, “As an attorney dealing with IRS tax issues on a daily basis, helping the innocent American citizens who do their best to meet their obligations, it is news like this that makes me work even harder for my clients. Whether the IRS comes crumbling down sooner or later due to the continuous erosion of trust or not, I will continue to fight within the limits of the law to help my clients maintain their integrity as responsible taxpayers.\nThe entire article can be read at: http://www.irsallstar.com/articles/the-irs-reaches-a-new-low-by-broadcasting-taxpayers-private-information.php\nABOUT JOHN WILLIS\nMr. Willis believes strongly in supporting and representing the “underdog” and has devoted his entire professional life to protecting and defending those who need it most.
