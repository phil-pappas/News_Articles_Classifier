Plus: Changes make 2015 tax returns doubly important. Follow @k_pitsker \nApplying for financial aid will soon be less of a hassle for college students and their families. Beginning with the 2017-2018 academic year, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid—used to determine financial aid from the government as well as colleges—can be filed three months earlier, or as early as October 1, nearly a year before a student would start classes the following fall. This shift in timing will allow completed tax returns to be used to report income and assets on the FAFSA. SLIDE SHOW: 10 Colleges That Don't Require Student Loans \nUnder current rules, families have to wait until January 1 to start filling out the FAFSA and often file the aid application before completing the income tax return required to verify income for the previous year. For example, if you file the FAFSA in January 2016 for the 2016-17 academic year, you’ll have to scramble to file your tax return early or estimate your 2015 income and verify it later, after you’ve filed your 2015 tax return. But under the new rules, when you file the FAFSA for the 2017-18 academic year, you’ll use your 2015 tax return rather than your 2016 return to report income and assets. \nWith the new FAFSA schedule, you’ll be able to start thinking about financial aid earlier in order to maximize an aid award. You’ll still have until June 30 to complete the form, but applying as early as possible remains important. Most schools dole out financial aid on a first-come, first-served basis, and a college’s free money runs out fast. Advertisement Steps to Take Before the End of 2015 \nIf your child is currently a high school senior, college freshman or college sophomore, your 2015 tax information is doubly important because 2015 income will count twice for financial aid purposes —first for the 2016-17 academic year, before the FAFSA changes go into effect, and then again for the 2017-18 academic year, when FAFSA switches to the new timeline. Taking steps to reduce income before the end of 2015 could lower your expected family income and boost your student’s financial aid award two years in a row. \nFew colleges fill all of the gap between your expected family contribution and the cost of attendance, but lowering your income can lead to substantial increases in financial aid. Income, not assets, is by far the biggest factor in financial aid. “Generally, every $10,000 increase in parent income will cause about a $3,000 decrease in need-based financial aid,” says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a college planning Web site. If possible, hold off on taking distributions from retirement plans or realizing capital gains because the money will count as income on the FAFSA. \nThe financial aid formula excludes assets held in retirement accounts, the cash value of life insurance policies, and the value of your home and other personal property (including cars, clothing and furniture). So consider directing a larger portion of your paycheck to your retirement accounts during your FAFSA-filing years. \nA fat savings account can also lower financial aid because the federal financial aid formula considers up to 5.6% of parents’ assets to be available to pay for college. If you’re planning to use cash to buy a new car, do a home-renovation project or make some other large purchase—even to pay down debt—pull the trigger before you file the FAFSA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:46:09.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
