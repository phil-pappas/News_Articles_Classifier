Yet revenue was still just over a third of the $14.1 billion banks racked up in 2008 at the height of the commodities boom. \nMany investors have shunned commodities in recent years due to lacklustre performance and as the sector was buffeted by economic events, moving in step with other assets. \nThe 19-commodity Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) /Core Commodity CRB index shed 18 percent last year and is down 7.5 percent so far in 2015. \nBanks continued an exodus from commodities trading in 2014 due partly to tougher regulation and higher capital requirements after the global financial crisis. \nCoalition tracks the following banks: Bank of America (Swiss: BAC.SW - news ) Merrill Lynch, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) , Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , Credit Suisse (Other OTC: CDSSF - news ) , Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) .
