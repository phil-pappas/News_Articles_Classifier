By late afternoon, a few thousand protesters remained. \nAn IMF mission began a two-week visit on Sept. 22, a day after Moldova's central bank governor Dorin Dragutanu resigned following protests over $1.5 billion that disappeared from three Moldovan banks before parliamentary elections in November last year. \nThe banks were put under the National Bank of Moldova's administration in December and the losses covered by state reserves. \nMoldova, one of Europe's poorest nations, has been mired in political instability since then. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T17:00:50.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
