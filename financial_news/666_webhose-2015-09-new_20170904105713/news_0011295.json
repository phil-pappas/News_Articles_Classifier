Facebook , on the other hand, is still 14 percent in the green year to date, and shares of Netflix are trading 135 percent higher.\nWhile some traders see the latest downturn as an opportunity to buy shares of blue-chip companies on the dip, others aren't so sure.

Rowe Price and Warren Buffett .\nBut even if an investor squabbles with the details of investment strategies, Katz and Perkin said there are technology stocks that meet both value and growth criteria, like Hewlett Packard , trading down 30 percent year to date, and Google , trading up 18 percent year to date.\nDisclosure: Eddie Perkin owns shares of Google.\nRead More 6 trades on momentum tech stocks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:19:57.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
