But if it has serious concerns, it could instead open a full-scale investigation. \nThe U.S. company sought EU approval for the deal on Sept. 24, according to the filing on the Commission's website. \nThe industry has seen a spate of mergers and acquisitions in recent months, with operators keen to expand their networks to attract multinational clients and tap into demand for cloud technology linking data from smart devices to remote servers. \nTelecity dropped a $2.2-billion offer for Dutch peer Interxion Holding NV (INXN.N) following the Equinix bid. \n($1 = 0.6567 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:05:48.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
