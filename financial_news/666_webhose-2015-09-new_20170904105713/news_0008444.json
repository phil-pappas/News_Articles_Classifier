In the first survey, which was conducted at the beginning of the month, more than half of the respondents believed a rate hike was imminent. However, when the question was posed later this month amid market volatility, only 40% of economists believed a rate hike would occur this month. \nFriday's jobs figures are among the last pieces of economic data the Fed will have to review before its meeting in the middle of the month. Analysts, economists, and investors alike were hoping that Friday's data would give a clear indication on whether or not the Fed would raise interest rates . \nThe last time the Fed raised rates was in 2006. Rates were cut to nearly zero at the end of 2008 to encourage economic growth during the financial crisis. The economy has made great strides since the harrowing days of 2008 and 2009. But pressures overseas -- from the eurozone working to stimulate its economy to struggles in China -- have caused many in the international community, particularly the IMF, to urge the Fed to rethink its rate hike. \nIn a report released on Thursday, a team of Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts led by Michael Hartnett said the August payroll figures were bound to be \"tricky.\" In his view, if the new jobs figure was 190,000, the Fed would be justified in waiting to raise rates. A true \"stinker\" scenario would have been a figure of less than 125,000. Friday's figure of 173,000 is closer to Hartnett's assessment that the Fed would wait to raise rates out of an abundance of caution. \nAfter Friday's release, many financial experts took to Twitter to voice their uncertainty about the Fed's next move. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:37:01.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
