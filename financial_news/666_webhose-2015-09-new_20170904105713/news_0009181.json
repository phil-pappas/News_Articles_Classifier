Statistics show that over 9 million companies in the United States are owned by women and generate $1.6 trillion in annual revenue. Women-owned businesses are starting at a rate of 1 ½ times the national average. Additionally, a fact sheet from the National Association of Women Business Owners indicates that one in three new jobs in the United States will be generated by women-owned businesses by 2018. Balboa Capital created a “Women in Business” infographic with these and many other statistics that is free to download and share.“Balboa Capital has been an advocate and champion for women-owned businesses since our inception in 1988,” said Ms. Freberg. “We have had the privilege of working with women in a wide variety of business industries, and we will continue to support them with our fast, dependable small business loans and equipment financing solutions.” Throughout the month of October, Balboa Capital is inviting women business owners to submit their success stories to be considered for the company’s widely read blog. “We want to hear from women entrepreneurs whose companies are doing well, and find out how they made their businesses stand out among the competition,” said Ms. Freberg.
