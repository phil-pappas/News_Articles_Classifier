Taxi drivers plan another demonstration in the Belgian capital on Sept. 16.\nThe company has also faced court injunctions and cars have been seized by authorities.\nIn July, Uber suspended UberPOP in Paris after facing violent protests.\n\"It's our ambition to continue with UberPOP,\" Filip Nuytemans, head of Uber Belgium, told a news conference.\nUber says existing Belgian legislation will allow UberX to operate, but it will not be allowed to use taxi lanes. The Brussels ministry for transport had no immediate comment regarding Uber's announcement.\nThe news conference to announce the new service was held in a venue in Brussels' European district but the location was only communicated 45 minutes before the start to avoid protests outside.\n\"When there is a minority of taxi drivers that delivers ultimatums to the state, that attacks Uber drivers and pulls passengers from the cars, clearly there is an issue of security,\" Mark MacGann, Uber's head of public policy in Europe, said.
