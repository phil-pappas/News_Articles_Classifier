Photo: AP\nEverything you need to know about the world's biggest economy is contained in these weird dots.\nWell, not quite everything, but at least the future path of borrowing costs in the US, which tends to affect every financial market and economy on the planet.\nOnce a quarter since January 2012, the US Fed's monetary policy committee has been releasing its \"dot plot\", which details members projections for interest rates in the world's biggest economy.\nThe \"dots\" are very hard to decipher, they come across a bit like a Rorscharch test used in psychological examinations, so if you can actually make sense of them, maybe you are smarter than you realise.\nAt any rate, traders and market participants study these dots closely to try to figure out the future path of interest rates.\nThe Fed provided a new \"dot plot\" for people to look at in the early hours of this morning, following its decision to leave rates on hold.\nAs you can see, one (cheeky?) FOMC member decided to project rates would go negative next year. As Jonathan Shapiro explains , it seems to indicate one member thinks more stimulus should actually be injected into the economy, rather than any discussion about raising rates.\nOr as the Wall Street Journal put it, \"the dots suggest the Fed is going to take its time\" on any hike.\nWhy does the Fed convey this message in dots, which are really hard to read? As Bloomberg reported this week , the Fed was looking for a way to increase transparency around its forecasts and future decisions.\nThe dots \"turned out to be a good way of showing the distribution, but where — if a bunch of people have similar views, and a bunch of dots are close together — it draws your attention\", Andrew Levin, a former Fed economist who helped design the dots told the news service.\nIt's all in the dots.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/gjphc2/USFed.gif", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/how-the-fed-s-most-important-message-became-enshrined-in-dots", "http://www.afr.com/markets/federal-reserves-dot-plot-drama-could-more-qe-come-before-a-rate-hike-20150917-gjpeov", "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/09/17/dots-suggest-fed-will-move-slow-and-steady/"], "published": "2015-09-18T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:18:44.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
