Photo: Rob Homer\nAt around 70 US cents, the Australian dollar is 36 per below its $US1.10 peak in July 2011, and down almost 14 per cent since mid-May. It will go lower, but the forces that created the commodity price boom have changed this economy permanently. The currency shouldn't reach the depths it plumbed before China awoke.\nAgainst a basket of trade-weighted index of currencies, the $A has fallen by about 24 per cent since the middle of 2011. It's down more against the $US because the greenback has been rising against all currencies, a trend that may continue later this year when the US Federal initiates a rate rise programme for the first time in nearly a decade.\nThe decline against the trade-weighted basket shows, however, that the Australian dollar is adjusting to the end of a once-in-a-lifetime boom in commodity prices, and the hesitant journey the economy has been making towards more balanced growth.\nA weaker $A helps, by making Australian companies more competitive, overseas and in competition with imports, and the Reserve Bank is less concerned than it was that the currency is not tracking commodity price declines closely enough.\nAdvertisement It has been holding its cash rate at 2 per cent since May, but as late as July 7 when the $A was 74.5 US cents was saying that further dollar depreciation was both \"likely and necessary\" given how far commodity prices had fallen. In statements since then including its statement on Tuesday after it again left rates on hold it has said only that the currency is adjusting to lower commodity prices.\nIf you are looking buy anything overseas or from overseas, be it shares, cars, heavy equipment, software, underpants or a holiday, you are probably less happy about the $A's dive.\nIt may have been ridiculously high in 2011, but the \"Big Dollar\" was in some ways validation, and vindication. Australians had been beating themselves up for decades about being off the pace economically. Suddenly the currency was at record highs, and delivering undreamed of purchasing power. Was it possible that we had it right all along?\nIt wasn't. Howard government tax cuts and middle-class welfare payments and Labor government structural spending commitments including the disability insurance scheme had assumed that a commodity price bubble would last. It didn't and the government now needs to cut spending when it should be delivering fiscal stimulus. It's a policy vice, and there's an undefined discount in the $A because it was allowed to develop.\nCan the $A fall further? Undoubtedly, and it almost certainly will. Commodity prices are the key determinant, but a US rate rise or an Australian rate cut would also pull our currency down.\nThe currency's all-time low against the $US was 48.3 US cents in April 2001, according to Bloomberg. It was below 50 US cents again in September of that year after the 9-11 terrorist attacks on America, and was below 60 US cents in 1986 and 1998.\nIt still looks a bit high compared with some past periods of turbulence and weakness.\nAgainst the US dollar it is for example still about 18 per cent above the low it set in 1986, when persistent large current account deficits prompted Paul Keating to declare that Australian was in danger of becoming a banana republic. On a trade-weighted basis, it is two thirds higher now that it was then.\nIt is five per cent and 12 per cent higher against the $US than it was in 1997 and 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, and on trade weighted terms 29 per cent and 24 per cent higher.\nIt is 17 per cent and 11 per cent below its average US dollar exchange rate in 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis, albeit level-pegging with that period against the trade-weighted basket.\nThe main fulcrum is commodity prices. They change Australia's terms of trade ( the relative strength of export and import prices) and through that change national income. According to a Reserve Bank discussion paper released this week, they have also been structurally boosted by China's emergence.\nCommodity prices tripled between 2003 and 2011 under the pressure of Chinese demand and supply shortages in Australia and other commodity-producing countries.\nThe pressure eased as resources groups expanded their production and China's economy matured and grew more slowly, and prices retreated.\nThe iron ore price for example averaged $US32 a tonne between 1980 and 2005, hit a high of about $US175 a tonne in 2011, and was $56.50 a tonne on Friday.\nThe Reserve Bank's commodity price index has fallen by 56 per cent in US dollar terms since the iron ore price peaked, and the base metals portion of the index has fallen 66 per cent. It is only half as high as it was in 2008 when the global financial crisis was expanding, and is as low as it was in 1997, during the Asian financial crisis.\nThe Reserve Bank commodity price index is however still twice as high as it was in April 2001 when the $A hit its record low against the US dollar. That may be because China's emergence has structurally lifted the prices of commodity exports that are higher than they were because of the resources investment boom.\nA Reserve Bank discussion paper released this week calculated that China had delivered a structural commodity price increase of 40 per cent since mid-2003. It's a much smaller uplift that tripling of prices that the bubble fleetingly produced, but it is long-term, and generates big economic changes.\nThe discussion paper says it could boost the resources sector's share of exports from 35 to 52 per cent, cause Australia's real exchange rate to \"appreciate permanently,\" and cause the trade deficit to widen by about 2 percentage points of GDP for a decade (as the stronger $A sucks in imports).\nIf the discussion paper is right or close to it, the $A shouldn't test its pre-China depths. Or shouldn't against the trade-weighted basket, at least: the US dollar's strength makes the $A-$US exchange rate more difficult to predict.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:17:16.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
