Alex Ellinghausen Treasurer Joe Hockey, who previously argued for the bank deposit tax on the basis of the revenue it would raise, recommended on Tuesday the Coalition drop its plans after compromise proposals designed to appease the backbench and the banking sector failed.\nLast month, The Australian Financial Review reported small banks and credit unions would be exempt.\nThe idea of applying it to the big banks only is that they would be reluctant to pass on the cost to customers because it would put them at a disadvantage to the smaller banks, credit unions and friendly societies, which would all be exempt.\nBut Mr Hockey said the idea proved \"unworkable\" and was opposed by the chief executive officers of the big banks when he met them.\n The Prime Minister in Canberra on Tuesday. Alex Ellinghausen \"I did as was expected of a Treasurer,\" he said.\nThe Greens, who first proposed exempting small banks, said Mr Hockey had caved in to the big four.\n\"Joe Hockey has caved in to the big banks and blown another hole in government revenue,\" said Adam Bandt.\n\"The big banks already get a big leg-up from the public, as everyone knows the government will support the big four if they look like falling over, which allows them to get funds more cheaply than their smaller rivals.\nThe bank deposit levy proposed by Labor government would be a 0.05 per cent levy on every deposit of up to $250,000.\nIt was scheduled to start on January 1, 2016, and was budgeted to raise about $500 million a year and cover the cost if a bank needed to be bailed out.\nMr Hockey's support for the tax has always been qualified on the basis of the capital adequacy requirements, which the prudential regulation would impose on the banks.\nThey were announced last month and Mr Hockey said on Tuesday he did not think a bank tax was now necessary.\n\"We have decided to dump the tax forever,\" Mr Hockey said.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott said the decision was now a test for Labor to drop its support for the policy.\n\"It was a tax on savings. It was a tax that was going to affect everyone with a bank account. Now is exactly the wrong time to apply such a tax to bank accounts, when people are receiving lower returns than they may have expected,\" Mr Abbott said.\nThe tax was opposed by David Murray's Financial System Inquiry. Mr Murray said such a tax should be proposed after a bank collapses, not before. Mr Hockey said in April that made no sense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:24:39.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
