Mt Morgans, near Laverton in WA, dates back to 1896, when a prospector named Harry Lilley started a mine he named Lily of the Valley.\nThe name was changed to Westralia in 1901 when the field was taken over by a group led by Alfred Morgans. There were also other deposits which became mines on the field, mainly the Jupiter, Craic and Transvaal.\nAlf was a prominent citizen, being MP for the state seat of Coolgardie and even becoming Premier for a month in 1901 when Lord Forrest departed for federal politics. The Westralia was famous too, with one excited newspaper describing it as the richest in WA.\nThat may well have been true, but only for a brief period in the early 20th Century. The main lode at 200ft (60m) was 30ft (9m) thick and averaging 70 grams a tonne, or more than two ounces in the old measure. But those high early grades rapidly fell.\nThe WA goldfields went into recession a few years later, exacerbated during World War I as many miners joined the armed forces. By the 1920s the industry was severely depressed, with little activity outside the big mines of the Golden Mile. With the gold price below $8 an ounce, remote areas such as Laverton were hard hit.\nAt its peak, the town of Mt Morgans had boasted three breweries and was the first outside Perth to have gas street-lighting. But production at the Westralia mine fell to zero in 1912 and 1913. The four major lodes had broken up and their continuation could not be found. The boom town was gradually razed, eventually becoming one of Australia's numerous ghost towns.\n The area was almost abandoned until 1988 when Whim Creek started an open pit at the Westralia. Whim Creek was taken over by Dominion the following year. Under Dominion, the open pit was recovering grades of 3.5 grams per tonne and a new plant was treating 1.2 million tonnes a year. Dominion also acquired the whole of Jupiter by buying the 49 per cent it didn't own from Croesus Mines (a name Pierpont always liked) in 1993.\nOwnership shuffle From that point ownership of the mine changed hands more often than a chip at a poker table. In 1995, Mt Morgans was one of a package of gold properties sold by Dominion to Plutonic. Then in 1998, Homestake took over Plutonic and the field became a plaything for the American gold giants. In 2001, Barrick took over Homestake and sold Mt Morgans to Placer Dome in 2003. Then in 2009, Barrick took over Placer Dome and so got Mt Morgans back again, along with other mineral odds and ends.\nIn all those transactions, the buyers and sellers were concentrating on larger mines in their portfolios. Mt Morgans was just being thrown in as an incidental property. The Mt Morgans mines were closed throughout Barrick's ownership.\nAdmittedly the gold price wasn't helping. For the benefit of readers with short memories, gold was under $A500 an ounce until early 2000 and didn't really go through $A600 until late 2005.\nNevertheless, Mt Morgans was a neglected field from 2005 until 2009, when the small listed Range River bought the field from Barrick. That made Range River the first company in a decade to actually concentrate on the field.\nThe neglect is rather difficult to understand, because geologically Mt Morgans is within the highly prospective Laverton tectonic zone. There are multi-million-ounce gold mines hereabouts, with Wallaby, Granny Smith and Sunrise Dam only 26 kilometres to 40 kilometres to the east or south-east of Westralia.\nBut by 2009, geologists had been pessimistic about the Westralia for a decade. The underground mine had closed in 1998 because the gold price had fallen to $A460 an ounce. It was a small mine in the Plutonic group and had only been taken over because it was part of a package from Dominion. When Range River took possession, the Barrick profile described the main Westralia lode at depth as \"flattening zone – no ore\".\nRange River was deterred by the 500 metre deep targets at Westralia, with the orebody​ apparently truncated at depth, and focused instead on the satellite deposits of Craic and Transvaal. But their costs were high and drove Range River into administration in 2011.\nThen a white knight arrived in the form of Rohan Williams. Williams is a modern hero of the WA goldfields. He founded Avoca Resources in 2002 with a $7 million float and was valued at $1 billion. when it became Alacer in 2011. In late 2011, he formed Dacian Gold (DCN) to take over Mt Morgans. Since then Dacian has done an extensive reinterpretation of the old field and made four new discoveries. They are:\nan 850,000 ounce resource at Westralia over a strike length of a kilometre intersections on the hangingwall lode beyond the previous cutoff zone for up to 2 kilometres unmined footwall lodes possibly 3 kilometres long a deposit at Jupiter that could be treated by heap leaching Goode says Dacian is targeting production of 150,000 ounces a year at a total cost of about $1000 an ounce. Not bad for a mine that's been largely neglected since 1998. Better still, Dacian has only 96 million shares on issue, so if it ever scrapes together the capital to get Westralia running again, it will be a stock worth watching. Right now, it's doing a pre-feasibility study.\nAnother revival A second example of a neglected mine that is being revived is the Woodlawn polymetallic mine outside Goulburn. Woodlawn is primarily a zinc-copper deposit, but also contains lead, silver and gold. It was discovered in 1970 by St Joseph International and Phelps Dodge. The mine operated for 20 years from 1978 to 1998, initially as an open pit. It was acquired by Denehurst in 1987. After the pit had gone down 200 metres (and was 1 kilometre wide at the top) it was exhausted, and subsequent mining was underground.\nWoodlawn's closure in 1998 had less to do with its economics and more to do with a massive corporate misjudgment. Denehurst had acquired the Metropolitan colliery near Helensburgh, one of the oldest continuing coal mines in Australia. Unfortunately, it also became one of the oldest continuing lossmakers.\nDenehurst poured so much money into Metropolitan that the company went belly-up and both Metropolitan and Woodlawn wound up with the administrators. Woodlawn was closed and all the plant sold, which meant that a formerly economic mine has been shut down for 17 years.\nWoodlawn was bought from the administrators by TriOrigin of Canada, which put Woodlawn into an ASX offshoot named TriAusMin and did some drilling before TriAusmin merged into Heron Resources (HRR) a year ago.\nHeron has been exploring the deposit energetically. The best discovery has been the Kate Lens (oddly, in the heart of the old workings but previously unknown), where grades of up to 10.1 per cent zinc have been recorded.\nThe current resource estimate is that Woodlawn – including Kate - contains 2.4 million tonnes averaging 7.47 per cent zinc, 1.9 per cent copper, 2.77 per cent lead, 57 grams per tonne silver and a little gold. In addition the tailings contain an estimated 9.4 million tonnes of recoverable metal.\nAlthough Pierpont is deeply suspicious of equivalent calculations, Heron reckons that by the time it has received smelter credits for all the other products, the cost of the zinc will be zero. In other words, whatever price they get for the zinc should be profit.\nHeron's biggest asset is the location. Woodlawn is only seven kilometres from the village of Taraga and should be able to recruit loads of workers from Goulburn and Canberra (if anyone in Canberra does actual work, that is). So there will be no need for a permanent campsite at the mine, let alone fly-in, fly-out workers. Directors visiting the mine usually catch the train from Sydney to Taraga.\nWoodlawn's prospects have enthused the London private equity group Greenstone Resources, which in July invested $6.8m in Heron shares and has promised another $13.2 million towards Woodlawn's development. The shares were bought at 12.6¢, well above Heron's recent market price of 10¢.\nHow the development will be funded is a moot point. Heron has some $25 million cash, but digging the underground and installing the plant could cost $140 million. Payback is estimated at two years, which should encourage financiers, but the recent rocky market has made courage a scarce commodity.\nPierpont would prefer a quicker, staged development, starting with tailings treatment to generate cash flow and digging the underground a bit later, but it's easier to be heroic when you're not an accountable director.\nAlert readers will have noticed that Pierpont hasn't mentioned the open pit. That's been taken over by the global waste disposal group Veolia, which is using it to bury Sydney's garbage. When Pierpont visited the site last month, bulldozers were busy at the bottom of the pit, crushing down loads of feral rubbish. As the dozers finish working each sector, a system of pipes is laid in to tap methane from the putrefying garbage. The gas is currently providing enough electricity to supply 2500 homes.\nVeolia has used water from the site to start a small barramundi farm and is planning to recycle some of the garbage as compost. On current estimates it will take at least 20 years to fill the entire pit. That's good news, because Australia has so many old exhausted pits that we may never run out of landfill sites.\nAs a final investment tip, the Taraga pub is up for sale. The local truckies must finish the day with something of a thirst after hauling container loads of garbage all day, so it could be a reasonable proposition. As the town has a Henry Lawson connection, the pub is called The Loaded Dog.\nPair charged Readers with long memories will recall that in April and December of 2013 Pierpont wrote about the financial escapades of Erwin Filler and Ray Rahoul. In the Brisbane Magistrate's Court on August 18 they were committed to stand trial on several fraud charges. The District Court is unlikely to hear the cases for at least six months. Pierpont is keeping an eye on proceedings.\nPip!
