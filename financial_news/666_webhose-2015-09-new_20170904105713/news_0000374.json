Some 2,000 bonds, mostly government debt, out of 50,000 traded in the EU will face greater transparency, ESMA said.\nESMA said it had decided on a bond-by-bond selection process rather than looking at classes of bonds. The Investment Association said on Monday it would have preferred the classes of bonds approach, but others said the approach chosen by ESMA will come as a relief to the market.\n\"There were genuine concerns about misclassification risk for individual bonds under a category-based approach,\" said Damian Carolan, a lawyer at Allen & Overy.\nESMA also set out Europe's first set of position limits or caps on market share in a commodity, ranging from 5 to 35 percent.\nIn addition MiFID II will cap how much trading in a stock can be done in a \"dark pool\" or anonymously and ESMA said the final rules make no major change to what it previously proposed.\nHigh-frequency trading (HFT), which uses ultra-fast computers to place trades, will also be directly regulated, having been blamed by critics for accentuating volatility.\nESMA's recommended rules will need endorsement from the European Commission before coming into force in January 2017.
