Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith Westpac Banking Corp boss Brian Hartzer has set some ambitious shareholder return targets and outlined a program to invest heavily in digital technology and cut the size of bank branches while picking up an additional 1 million customers along the way.\nThe chief executive's first strategic update since taking over from Gail Kelly six months ago did not contain any bombshells but set out some firm goals, which Hartzer believes can withstand the pressure on banks to hold more capital and become more productive as the economy slows.\nTechnology is the key to just about everything Hartzer announced on Monday. He is relying on digital platforms such as iPad applications, internet banking and video conferencing to cut costs as well as attracting more customers. At the same time he doesn't want his executives to become obsessed with technology at the expense of the customer.\nHartzer's targets are ambitious but not unachievable, although there is a degree of scepticism in the analyst community about how he will cut costs and increase the bank's customer base by 10 per cent in an environment where there is not a lot of growth.\nJob cuts and branch closures are inevitable but Westpac is tackling the issue cleverly to avoid a community backlash. With about 5000 staff out of a total of 40,000 coming and going each year, the bank will seek to reduce numbers quietly over time rather than through a big redundancy announcement.\nAnalysts have been saying Hartzer needs to embark on a wide-scale cull in branch numbers, which are higher than the other majors because they encompass Westpac's stable of brands including St George, Bank of Melbourne and Bank SA. Kelly's multibrand strategy remains in place for now, but your typical Westpac branch in the future will be 25 to 30 per cent smaller, with fewer staff.\nThis means they cost less to run, hence the cost savings, but Hartzer needs to ensure he doesn't sacrifice old-fashioned face-to-face service in branches by focusing solely on the bank's 4.1 million online customers.\nScale dramatically reduced Related The scale of transactions, security and the back office staff traditionally needed in branches has been dramatically reduced, but Hartzer says human contact is still important for bigger transactions, small business and elderly customers who are not internet savvy.\nHe also outlined specific targets around costs and productivity as part of an update of Hartzer's five strategic priorities flagged earlier in the year. This is a contrast to the wait-and-see approach some other banks are taking, given the tough market conditions, and the question now is exactly how will Westpac achieve its target of positive jaws​.\nThe bank has reaffirmed its target return on equity – a closely watched measure of shareholder returns – of 15 per cent. This does not look significant given the bank is there already, but viewed in the context of the additional $3 billion Westpac is expected to raise to meet new capital requirements, it will not be easy to meet. \"We don't think higher targets should be used as an excuse not to manage our capital efficiently,\" he told investors. Hartzer likes the \"discipline\" of the target, which he believes will make the bank more forceful about how it manages capital.\nDigital will be the main driver of the bank's targeted expense-to-income ratio below 40 per cent within the next three years. He is increasing investment spending by 20 per cent to $1.3 billion a year and most of this will go into technology.\nThe goal of adding 1 million customers will rely heavily on its ability to increase products per customers. It is targeting growth in wealth, the SME sector and Asia. This is the Holy Grail for banking at the moment and is behind Westpac's approach to its branch network, which will seek to make it easy for customers to combine a raft of products, such as wealth, with their everyday banking.\nThe new look, or smaller branches, will represent 55 per cent of the network by 2018. The cost target of 2 to 3 per cent is in line with underlying inflation and will not be good enough for some analysts.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-07T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:30:31.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
