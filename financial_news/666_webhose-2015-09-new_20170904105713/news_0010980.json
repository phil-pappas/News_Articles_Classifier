Reuters by Trevor Hoey The Ashley Madison hack certainly brought the issue of IT security under the spotlight. But while it received plenty of media attention because of the nature of the information released, it pales into insignificance compared with other major breaches at companies including JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, Anthem and eBay, where the number of records stolen ranged between 50 million and 145 million. As major financial institutions, retailers, health insurers and e-tailers, these enterprises store high-level confidential data.\nA relatively small Australian company Covata has developed technology that has been adopted by the $130 billion Cisco Systems, a group that relies heavily on industry-best security products to wrap around the broad range of products and services it offers to the communications and information technology industry.\nCentral to Covata's offering is the fact users own and control their data, and choose where it is stored and who should have access to it. They also have the added protection of encryption so that illegally accessed data is indecipherable.\nThe Cisco deal is extremely important for Covata. It is a long-term licensing agreement spanning 10 years whereby Cisco will use Covata's platform and related products in a software as a service (SaaS) technology system distributed to its affiliates and clients.\nNot only has this substantially boosted the group's profile, but the potential exposure is significant given Cisco supports about 70,000 businesses in 165 countries. Though this endorsement of the group's technology is large scale, the signing of a reseller agreement with leading Australian telecommunications group Macquarie Telecom has been an important step in terms of gaining acceptance in this region.\nThe agreement enables Macquarie Telecom to distribute its flagship product, Safe Share, to Australian federal government agencies. Revenue generated from deals such as these are calculated on a per user basis, potentially pointing to licence fees from about 170,000 employees.\nWhile Covata only began trading on the ASX in November 2014, it has provided secure file sharing services to various Australian government agencies for six years.\nThe Safe Share product will be an integral part of Covata's growth. The group has already negotiated agreements with other major telecommunications providers. Founder and chief executive Trent Telford explained Covata's philosophy regarding security when discussing the Macquarie agreement: \"Safe Share is a product built on the Covata security platform and its DNA as a product from the outset – not as an afterthought – was security-focused,\" he said. Nominal income can be expected in fiscal 2016, with a substantial ramp-up in 2017.\n Accelerated growth This is broadly the case with the group's telco agreements, although management says the time from activation to revenue recognition has reduced significantly and this should be an ongoing feature in terms of the company achieving the accelerated growth predicted by analysts over the next three years.\nFor example, Kyle Twomey from Moelis came up with some impressive numbers based on a nominal 5 per cent market penetration by fiscal 2018. These indicate revenue of $6.7 million in fiscal 2016, increasing more than threefold to $22.4 million in fiscal 2017 and nearly doubling to $42.6 million in 2018.\nBased on Twomey's projections Covata should deliver its first year of positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in fiscal 2017. However, it is a very scalable business model, and he estimates EBITDA of $7.7 million in that year to increase more than threefold to $27.4 million in fiscal 2018.\nThese metrics support Twomey's buy recommendation and price target of 70¢, a level the company went close to touching in April and a substantial premium to the issue price of 20¢.\nDiscussions with management confirmed the scalable nature of the business, but one of the most impressive aspects is that it will be generating a balanced mix of income from one-off partnerships through to recurring revenue from channel usage achieved through the group's relationships with global telcos.\nAside from Macquarie Telecom, these include Deutsche Telekom T-Systems and Colt Technology Services, a group that provides capital markets services to more than 400 financial institutions.\nThis was an important development for the group given the critical nature of financial services security, particularly in view of the hack of JPMorgan Chase, one of the worst in history in which 76 million records were stolen.\nOne of the most important questions to pose when considering investing in an IT group is the strength of the intellectual property central to generating revenue. In Covata's case there are high barriers to entry, evidenced by the substantial regulatory approvals required to bring its product to market.\nManagement estimates the process for launching a competing product would require a timeline of at least 12 months. Another factor working in Covata's favour is its ability to quickly forge first mover relationships with telcos which, once locked in, have no need for a secondary product.\nWorking in Covata's favour is that the convergence between IT and telecommunications has advanced considerably. And, as telcos find it increasingly difficult to compete on traditional products, they are looking at offering add-on services such as enhanced security, particularly to enterprise clients, to provide a point of difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:29:40.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
