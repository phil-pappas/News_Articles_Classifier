E-commerce and the buy-in-bulk warehouse model, it turns out, are better uses of labor than Wal-Mart's supercenter model, which is part of the reason those companies are generally able to offer lower prices. Costco and Amazon are also both renown for their customer service, which may be partly because they are able to pay their employees better. Not surprisingly, both Costco and Amazon are growing sales consistently, while Wal-Mart is struggling. \nThat disparity presents an ongoing challenge for Wal-Mart as it tries to drive comparable sales upward. Increasingly, it's become apparent that Wal-Mart's supercenters are becoming a drag on its performance, and the company instead is turning its focus to its smaller-format Neighborhood Markets and e-commerce. \nIt's a smart move, but it won't restore growth since its supercenters make up more than half of the company's sales. With the stock price down nearly a third from its highs earlier this year, the company needs to find a way to reinvigorate growth at its big-box stores. Improving pay would seem to be a step in the right direction, but not if it leads to lower morale and disgruntled workers. \nSolving that problem and improving customer service along with it are key to Wal-Mart's future. It's clear change won't happen overnight, but the bigger question is if it will happen at all. \nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.
