With the party split since its leader, Alexis Tsipras, gave in to demands by Greece's creditors, it may struggle to remain in power at an election on Sept. 20.\nSome strategists said the prospect of a Greek coalition or the return of a conservative New Democracy government would be welcomed by markets. Others said the illiquidity of Greek bond markets meant little could be read into recent price moves.\nTen-year yields were 28 bps lower on the day at 8.52 percent, but remain lower than two-year equivalents, a sign that the country may still be headed towards default.\nPortuguese 10-year yields were flat on the day at 2.50 percent, keeping their yield premium over German benchmarks at their tightest in nearly a month.\nPortuguese bonds have so far withstood growing political risk from an Oct. 4 general election. Polls show a tight contest that could result in a political logjam.\n\"Despite the ultimate composition of the government still being unclear we remain quite relaxed about the risks that this could pose to Portuguese government debt,\" Rabobank strategists said in a note.\n\"This is because both main party blocs still seem to remain committed to the budget deficit targets agreed with the European Commission.\"\nThat contrasts with the market's view of Spain, where polls show separatists are likely to win a Sept. 27 vote in Catalonia.\nSpanish bonds have been underperforming their southern European peers, with their 10-year bond yield premium over Italian 10-year debt rising this week to its highest in two years, at more than 20 basis points.\nAlso in primary markets, Belgium sold 4 billion euros of a new bonds maturing in 2028.
