CMCSA, Universal Pictures’ latest dinosaur flick Jurassic World achieved yet another key milestone accumulating more than $1 billion from international (outside the U.S.) markets. So far, Jurassic World’s worldwide ticket sale stands at around $1.65 billion, of which the U.S. market sale accounts for approximately $646 million. Comcast currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With this, Jurassic World has become the fourth movie to cross the $1 billion sales threshold mark in international markets. The ones that have already broken the mark are - Avatar ($2.03 billion), which was released in 2009 by 20th Century Fox, currently a division of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. FOXA, Titanic ($1.53 billion), released in 1997 by Paramount Pictures, a division of Viacom Inc. VIAB and Furious 7 ($1.16 billion), which was released in 2015 by Universal Pictures. Moreover, in terms of worldwide ticket sales, Jurassic World currently stands as the third biggest movie of all times after Avatar ($2.78 billion) and Titanic ($2.18 billion). A major achievement for Universal Pictures is that most of its 2015 releases have been runaway hits in the international markets in addition to their immense popularity in North America. Universal Pictures has become the first studio ever to have three of its films’ ticket sales cross $1 billion worldwide in a year. Furious 7 , Jurassic World and Minions (all released in 2015) collected more than $1 billion each. Universal Pictures has been no stranger to success in 2015, so far. The studio released Jurassic World , which had the all-time biggest opening weekend, while Furious 7 was the fifth money spinner of all times, Fifty Shades of Grey also witnessed the highest first week sales of all time in February. Additionally, Minions observed the second biggest opening weekend for an animated movie and finally, Straight Outta Compton recorded the highest August opening weekend for an R-rated movie of all times. For the first eight months of 2015, Universal Pictures' worldwide box office collection was approximately $6 billion, outpacing the previous record of $5.53 billion in full year 2014 achieved by 20th Century Fox. We expect the studio’s strong business momentum to continue through the rest of 2015. Having acquired the entire stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co. GE, Comcast is leaving no stone unturned to revamp Universal Pictures amid strong competition. In 2014, revenues from the Filmed Entertainment segment of NBC Universal declined 8.2% year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. This year, this segment has already exceeded full-year 2014 total revenue. This should naturally ramp up Comcast’s top as well as bottom line for the year.
