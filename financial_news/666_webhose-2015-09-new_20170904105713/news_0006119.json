Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our operations, we help people around the world save money and live better - anytime and anywhere - in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital and physical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. � Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. \n� Walmart International consists of operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These businesses consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and, in recent years, has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and by expanding digital retail. \n� Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. \nEach of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently, but each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. As previously disclosed in the Company's Form 8-K furnished on August 18, 2015, we have been engaged in a review of the accounting treatment of leases. As part of this ongoing global review, we are assessing our historical application of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 840, Leases, regarding lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets. While we are in the final stages of management's assessment and review of the impact of the related errors, management believes that the maximum cumulative adjustment to the accompanying Balance Sheets, Statements of Income and Statements of Cash Flows is immaterial for all periods. We anticipate recording the immaterial cumulative adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. These immaterial errors resulted from the failure to appropriately consider the implications of ASC 840 with respect to lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets. In a number of our leases, payments we have made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets will result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, regardless of the significance of the payments, ASC 840 defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost on the balance sheet with a corresponding financing obligation. Generally, in these situations, the Company has not historically accounted for the total project costs of the lessor as owned assets. Additionally, upon completion of the lessor's project, the Table of Contents \nCompany must perform a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC 840 to determine if the Company can derecognize these assets and the related financing obligation from its Balance Sheet. In a substantial number of our leases, due to many of the same factors that required the Company to originally account for the total project costs as owned assets (for example, a portion of the construction costs is reimbursed to the Company via lowered rental payments), we are deemed to have \"continuing involvement,\" which precludes the Company from derecognizing these leased assets when construction is complete. In such cases, the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Balance Sheet and are amortized over the lease term. This discussion, which presents our results for periods occurring in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016\") and January 31, 2015 (\"fiscal 2015\"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of July 31, 2015, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 31, 2015, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended January 31, 2015, and incorporated by reference in, and included as Exhibit 13 to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales. We measure the e-commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and fulfilled through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online, but fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Changes in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in retail square feet of more than five percent. Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. We made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not impact the Company's operating income or consolidated net income. Table of Contents \nCompany Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the countries in which we operate. For several years, our performance metrics have emphasized three financial priorities: growth, leverage and returns. We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integration of digital and physical retail. These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everyday low cost. During this time of increased investments, we have shifted our financial priorities to focus primarily on growth, balanced by returns. We will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, and through increasing comparable store and club sales, which include our e-commerce sales. While leverage remains important to everyday low cost, during this time of increased investments, operating expenses may grow greater than or equal to our sales growth, and operating income may grow equal to or less than sales growth. Our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing working capital to deliver strong free cash flow. We will also continue to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Table of Contents \nGrowth We measure growth primarily by monitoring net sales and comparable store and club sales. We also review the progress of our digital retail investments by measuring the impact e-commerce sales have on our comparable store and club sales. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales in the near term. Net Sales Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (Amounts in Percent Percent Percent Percent Percent Percent millions) Net Sales of Total Change Net Sales of Total Net Sales of Total Change Net Sales of Total Walmart U.S. $ 73,959 62.0 % 4.8 % $ 70,601 59.1 % $ 144,204 61.8 % 4.2 % $ 138,453 59.3 % Walmart 30,637 25.7 % (9.6 )% 33,872 28.4 % 60,915 26.1 % (8.1 )% 66,296 28.4 % International Sam's Club 14,734 12.3 % (0.9 )% 14,863 12.5 % 28,213 12.1 % (1.9 )% 28,754 12.3 % Net sales $ 119,330 100.0 % 0.0 % $ 119,336 100.0 % $ 233,332 100.0 % (0.1 )% $ 233,503 100.0 % \nOur consolidated net sales were flat for the three months ended July 31, 2015 and decreased 0.1% for the six months ended July 31, 2015, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Net sales were negatively impacted by $4.2 billion and $7.4 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and $490 million and $1.1 billion of decreases in fuel sales due to lower fuel prices for the three and six months ended July 31, 2015, respectively. The decreases were offset by 2.5% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our calendar comparable store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store and club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 1.9 % 0.2 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 1.3 % (0.1 )% 0.0 % 0.0 % Sam's Club (2.2 )% 0.6 % (3.6 )% 0.5 % (3.2 )% (0.3 )% (3.9 )% 0.0 % Total U.S. 1.2 % 0.2 % (0.7 )% 0.1 % 0.5 % (0.2 )% (0.7 )% 0.0 % \nComparable store and club sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 1.2% and 0.5% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2015, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted Walmart U.S. comparable sales approximately 0.2% and 0.3% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2015, respectively, compared to positive impacts of approximately 0.3% for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2014. E-commerce sales positively impacted Sam's Club comparable sales approximately 0.5% for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2015, compared to positive impacts of approximately 0.2% for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2014. Strategic Growth Investments During the six months ended July 31, 2015, we made capital investments globally of $5.0 billion. These capital investments primarily consisted of payments to add new and remodel stores and clubs, construct distribution centers and invest in technology. In addition, we made operational investments of approximately $630 million in e-commerce, compared to approximately $430 million in the same period in the previous fiscal year. We also made investments of approximately $435 million in connection with the new associate wage structure and comprehensive associate training and educational programs announced during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Table of Contents \nReturns While we are focused primarily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced. We generate returns by efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital. We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, which we discuss below. In addition, we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section. Return on Investment Management believes return on investment (\"ROI\") is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROI was 16.2% and 16.7% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to continued capital investments, as well as our decrease in operating income. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. We consider return on assets (\"ROA\") to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI before comparing our ROI to that of such other companies. Table of Contents \nThe calculation of ROI, along with a reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2015 2014 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,963 $ 26,590 + Interest income 100 95 + Depreciation and amortization 9,304 8,995 + Rent 2,755 2,896 = Adjusted operating income $ 38,122 $ 38,576 Denominator Average total assets of continuing operations(1) $ 201,191 $ 202,261 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization(1) 67,192 61,328 - Average accounts payable(1) 37,027 36,765 - Average accrued liabilities(1) 18,264 18,427 + Rent x 8 22,040 23,168 = Average invested capital $ 235,132 $ 231,565 Return on investment (ROI) 16.2 % 16.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Income from continuing operations $ 15,932 $ 16,214 Denominator Average total assets of continuing operations(1) $ 201,191 $ 202,261 Return on assets (ROA) 7.9 % 8.0 % As of July 31, 2015 2014 2013 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets of continuing operations $ 198,620 $ 203,762 $ 200,760 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 69,582 64,801 57,855 Accounts payable 37,225 36,828 36,701 Accrued liabilities 18,290 18,237 18,616 \n(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. Table of Contents \nFree Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We generated free cash flow of $5.1 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2015, compared to free cash flow of $6.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2014. The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and the timing of payments. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,102 $ 11,900 Payments for property and equipment (5,044 ) (5,113 ) Free cash flow $ 5,058 $ 6,787 Net cash used in investing activities(1) $ (4,602 ) $ (4,340 ) Net cash used in financing activities (8,774 ) (8,755 ) \n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.
