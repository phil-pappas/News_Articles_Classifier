Source: Supplied\nSpring has also brought an unusually high spike in listings, which promises to ease pressure off of house hunters — more than 700 homes go to auction today, with even higher volumes expected later in the month. But Real Estate Institute of NSW president Malcolm Gunning said it may take a while for the softening conditions to impact Western Sydney.\n“Price growth looks to have maxed out in the inner city, but Western Sydney is probably about six months behind,” he said.\nFour bedroom home 40 Driscoll St is one of three homes in Abbotsbury going to auction today. Source: Supplied\nAuctioneer Rocky Bartolotto added that demand for Western Sydney homes remains rampant, pointing to a Horsley Park home sold at auction this week for $855,000 above its reserve price as proof of a still booming market. “Western Sydney is doing remarkably well,” he said. “Most people have been priced out of suburbs 15km to 20km from the CBD and it has made the west extremely popular because people know they can buy more with their money.”\nOutside of the west, buyers would likely have the upper hand at auctions because of the influx of homes for sale, Mr Bartolotto said.\n“Unique and well positioned homes will continue to sell for high prices, but other home sellers may need to revise their expectations down a little.”\nMya Ly is auctioning her Hinchinbrook home at 2B Pegasus Avenue today and said she decided to sell under the hammer on the advice of agent John Hana of Raine and Horne and because she realised competition for sales remains stiff.\n“Looking at other sales, every home in the area is selling through auction now,” she said. “It’s rare to be able to negotiate with the seller like you used to.”\nOriginally published as One region to heat up as property market cools ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1&h=One+region+to+heat+up+as+property+market+cools", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-nsw-hinchinbrook-120575013", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=One+region+to+heat+up+as+property+market+cools&c=SYDNEY%26%238217%3BS+housing+boom+is+ending%2C+but+property+prices+will+continue+to+soar+in+one+major+city+region%2C+analysts+say.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/realestate/news/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fni0cly6-1227513150847", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1&title=One+region+to+heat+up+as+property+market+cools", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/western-sydney-home-sellers-in-prime-position-as-spring-selling-season-kicks-off/story-fnd91nhy-1227513150847?sv=39eac76f854b117682e805a686ed5ce1&title=One+region+to+heat+up+as+property+market+cools"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T03:00:45.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
