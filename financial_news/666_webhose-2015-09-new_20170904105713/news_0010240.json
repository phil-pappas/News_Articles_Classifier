Airphoto Australia by Mercedes Ruehl A Hong Kong developer has paid nine homeowners on Holdsworth Avenue and Canberra Street in St Leonards $66 million to turn the block into a development site that could yield up to 257 apartments.\nThe sale resulted in one homeowner on Sydney's north shore turning a $2 million residence into a more than $10 million windfall.\nLane Cove Council has recently agreed to rezone a large portion of southern St Leonards where the properties are located and many more homeowners in the area are also hoping to see a multi-million payday by grouping together and selling out.\nIt is a complicated process but in this instance having one lawyer, one town planner and one contract for all owners made it possible according to selling agent JLL.\n\"Whilst there has been a lot of talk around residents consolidating to sell, this is one of the first real examples of such a large unconditional transaction,\" JLL's head of metro sales and investments Sam Brewer said.\n\"The sale campaign yielded over 100 interested buyers split evenly between local and off-shore.\"\nJLL's director of international investments Ben Hunter said the sale proves Sydney is still witnessing strong inflows of Asian-based capital for residential opportunities in prime locations.\nThe sale price of the total property equates to almost $7.34 million per house on average but prices differed according to lot sizes. The biggest netted $10.4 million when on the market it would have sold for about $2 million. The deal is unconditional with the 10 per cent deposits released to the owners.\n There is also the opportunity for the nine owners to receive bonus payments if the developer can get approval for a higher floor space ratio. The sales figure reflects a rate of 11,600 per square metre and a FSR of 2.9:1.\nMany local councils in Sydney have rezoned large tracts of land over the last several years to take advantage of low supply and soaring demand for apartment sites.\nChinese-backed developer Loftex paid another group of St Leonards residents $48 million to buy homes on the high side of Marshall Avenue from 2011 to 2013.\nIn Epping a group of eight residents netted three times what their homes were individually valued at when they sold them in one line for higher than $30 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:03:05.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
