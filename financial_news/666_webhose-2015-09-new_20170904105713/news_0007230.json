Even after 12 months of care his prognosis remains poor and he still requires 24-hour hospital care. \nKiwiRail yesterday pleaded guilty to charges relating to its failure to ensure employees – including subcontractors – were kept safe while working. \nAn investigation by WorkSafe New Zealand identified numerous failures by the state-owned company, with WorkSafe NZ's chief inspector Keith Stewart saying the accident was completely preventable. \n\"Every worker has a right to trust that their employer is looking out for their safety and that the necessary safety precautions and systems for managing potential risks are in place. \n\"Multiple failings by KiwiRail have had a devastating impact on the victim's life. He continues to live with these tragic consequences to this very day.\" \nWorkSafe NZ ordered the company to pay the reparations to the victim's family. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:09:37.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
