Sydney is about to host Sydney Contemporary (2013's inaugural SC is shown here), a boutique art fair, a fair for unrepresented artists – and even one just for art books. by Jane O'Sullivan The opening night of the Art Basel Hong Kong art fair was manageable. \"But every single day after, the crowds got bigger and bigger and bigger,\" Sydney art dealer Joanna Strumpf says.\niPhones hovered constantly around Sam Jinks' hyper-realistic sculptures of human figures and the gallery had to post two staff members to protect the artworks. Says Strumpf, \"At any one time in the stand we might have had 70-plus people, and that's a lot in a small space … It was quite fantastic and a little bit daunting.\"\nThe three-day fair in March, one of the most popular in the Asia-Pacific region, drew almost 60,000 visitors. Next week it's Sydney's turn. The second edition of the biennial Sydney Contemporary is at Carriageworks; a boutique art fair takes up residence in the Establishment Hotel in the central business district; a fair for unrepresented artists is at Central Park; and there's one just for art books at Artspace in Woolloomooloo.\nIt's a long way from the days when the biennial Melbourne Art Fair, which ran in 2014, was Australia's only major event for the contemporary art market.\nThe hugely successful Art Basel fairs have put travelling to look at and buy art on the map of the world's cool citizens. In March, Art Basel Hong Kong drew almost 60,000 people. Jessica Hromas As a new breed of collector emerges in the global art market, hungry for international art and increasingly willing to travel to see it, art fairs are becoming big business around the world. We live in an era where gallery closures are common and most of the money is concentrated at the very top, as seen, for example, in the stratospheric prices recorded at the London and New York auctions. Dealers are desperate to connect with new audiences.\n\"It's a global phenomenon that art fairs are where a lot of people are meeting,\" says Strumpf, who runs Sullivan+Strumpf alongside Ursula Sullivan. \"It's not just the collectors – it's the museums, the curators, the consultants, it's the media.\n\"It's a very easy venue for everyone to come together and see what's happening at that particular point in time. As a gallery, we feel it's very important to be a part of that conversation.\"\nGlobalisation different for art market Geoff Newton, director of Neon Parc gallery in Melbourne, is also a co-founder of Spring 1883, an art fair held in a hotel. This year Spring 1883 comes to The Establishment in Sydney. Arsineh Houspian The latest global art market report from The European Fine Art Foundation says the 180 major art fairs last year generated an estimated €9.8 billion ($15.6 billion) – or 40 per cent of all dealer sales and 20 per cent of the total annual global art market, including auctions. But the true impact could be even higher. Many sales go unrecorded because they take place after the event as dealers follow up new contacts.\nIt's not a cheap exercise. Sullivan+Strumpf goes to fairs in Asia, Europe and the United States as well as locally. Its two dealers pay anywhere from $US10,000 ($14,000) to upwards of $US60,000 at the bigger international fairs, but there are other costs. \"The freight, the hotel accommodation, the flights, the build-up of the stand, building of walls, stockrooms, the lighting … The stand costs are just the tip of the iceberg,\" Strumpf says.\nIf this fixation on physical events seems strange, it's worth noting globalisation seems to have run a different course in the art market than in other industries. There's one simple reason.\nWith the exception of some new media art, art is still best seen in the flesh. Internet shopping has its place – most galleries have slick, image-rich websites and online marketplaces such as Artsy are cutting ground, though mostly overseas. But it's the art events such as fairs and biennales that time-poor collectors are turning to, to find out what is going on outside their city.\nThe founders of Spring 1883 in 2014, at the Windsor Hotel which hosted the fair. From left: dealers and founders Luisa Bosci, Vasili Kaliman, Kate Barber Geoff Newton and Vikki McInnes. Justin McManus Get in fast Clinton Ng is one. The Sydney-based doctor was one of the first to embrace online art buying in the early 2000s. Initially it was an escape from the pressures of studying for a PhD but it has since turned into a more serious habit and he's a now well-known fixture of the Australian art world.\nNg still scouts exhibitions online, but also travels frequently. This month, he returns home from the Lyon and Istanbul biennales just in time for Sydney Contemporary.\nHe describes art fairs as \"highly charged … There is a very real urgency to get to the desirable booths and coveted works quickly – if the works are not already presold.\" He still enjoys going to see the wide range of art on show but says \"the pressure to decide and buy quickly is tremendous. Personally I prefer a little more time and consideration.\"\nVisitors to Hong Kong Art Basel take photos of \"Untitled (Kneeling Woman)\" by Australian artist Sam Jinks. Art Basel is held annually in Hong Kong, Miami Beach and Basel, Switzerland. AP Strumpf argues that the crowded environment of fairs – both literally and visually – is a great art leveller. \"They put a lot of people in the same room as each other and the good things will stand out.\" (She admits it's not the right venue for all art and that some is best shown in a quieter gallery space.)\nSydney collector Max Germanos is the the head of investment banking at Investorlink and a fan of artists such as Euan Macleod and McLean Edwards. For him, art fairs are part art reconnaissance mission, part social occasion. But he admits buying is not a high priority.\nHe was at Sydney Contemporary's first edition in 2013. \"Fortunately I went early,\" he says, in reference to the total gridlock that took place in the aisles later on opening night – it was one well-attended party, and over the four days the fair attracted 28,000 people.\n\"I did buy a Brent Harris work … from Tolarno Galleries but [dealer Jan Minchin] didn't have the work with her – does that count?\" he laughs. She showed it to him on her phone.\nReaching collectors like Germanos was one of the biggest costs when Tim Etchells set up Sydney Contemporary. His company, Art Fairs Australia, invested about $500,000 in the fair's first edition with most of that going towards marketing and staffing. (Art fairs, says Etchells, need people who are \"unique to working in the arts\".)\nHe also owns the separate British events company SME London and has staged fairs in the fashion, food and motor industries – this year he even has a big Doctor Who festival in London and Sydney on the cards. But increasingly it's art fairs that are taking up his time. ArtHK, which he set up in Hong Kong in 2008, was sold to the owners of Art Basel and Art Basel in Miami Beach in 2012 – it's now called Art Basel Hong Kong. He's also had a hand in setting up new fairs in London, Istanbul and Hong Kong (again) and is researching another in Singapore.\nHe acknowledges sales are at \"a lower level\" in Australia than in places like Hong Kong, but believes there's a strong future for Sydney Contemporary, although it will be a long play.\nUnusual things to do in a hotel room Etchells is not the only one seeing opportunities in this changing landscape. In 2014, a group of Melbourne dealers piggybacked on the Melbourne Art Fair to stage a new boutique art fair, Spring 1883, and they are now bringing it to Sydney. This year there are 24 hand-picked galleries.\nNeon Parc director Geoff Newton was looking for something \"more on its own terms, for its own people\" than the traditional art fair, and the idea led to conversations with colleagues and friends Vasili Kaliman from Station and the co-directors of Sarah Scout Presents, Vikki McInnes and Kate Barber.\nAs dealers themselves, they also wanted a more affordable option. At Spring 1883, participants pay between $5000 and $10,500, significantly less than the typical gallery's outlay for a stand at Melbourne or Sydney.\nInternationally, hotel art fairs are not new but for the Australian audience it was unusual. Visiting last year's fair in the Victorian-era Windsor Hotel felt like exploring a stranger's house, with sculptures in bathtubs and art works half hidden in drawers.\nVeronica Kent's installation with Sarah Scout Presents included a karaoke jukebox. When it wasn't being used for art performances, visitors could choose their own track. \"We had some lovely moments with that, people singing unexpected duets with strangers,\" Barber says. \"People took part in something they would never expect to do in a hotel room on a Sunday morning.\"\nThe location, Kaliman says, meant \"you kind of had to be there, and you can't say that about many classical kind of art fairs\". (Sydney Contemporary's director, Barry Keldoulis, might disagree. He's introduced performance art to Sydney Contemporary, as well as a program of talks, screenings and events both in and around the fair.)\nFor collectors like Germanos, it was a new experience – he describes it as \"a bit like listening to commercial music and then listening to alternative labels as well\". But the line-up is hardly underground, with veteran dealers such as Sydney's Sarah Cottier Gallery and, new this year, Adelaide's Gagprojects with artists including Nasim Nasr.\n\"There weren't big works, and the hanging space was a little bit limited in terms of what they could and couldn't do in the hotel, and it was a little dim. But I liked it,\" Germanos says. \"Different ways of showing art and different avenues – it has to be applauded.\"\nHow to get there Sydney Contemporary (tickets from $25, sydneycontemporary.com.au ), Spring 1883 (free, spring1883.com ) and The Other Art Fair (tickets from $15, theotherartfair.com.au ) open September 10, with VIP preview events beforehand.
