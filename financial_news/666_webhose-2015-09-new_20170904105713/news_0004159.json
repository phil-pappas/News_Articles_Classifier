Justice Gordon is now a member of the High Court.\nAdvertisement IMF Bentham, which is funding the case, said in an announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange a similar case against National Australia Bank Limited \"has been the subject of settlement discussions\", while cases against other banks, including Westpac Banking Corp and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have been stayed until a final decision is made in the ANZ case.\nIMF said the High Court was likely to hear the appeal in early 2016.\nOne of the key legal issues in the case is whether late credit card fees are a \"fee for a service\". Justice Gordon found that a late credit card payment didn't require the bank to do anything other than wait to be repaid and there was no damage from the late payment because the rate of interest on the credit card is better than the bank could get by putting its money elsewhere. Because it was not a fee for a service, she found it an illegal penalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:07:34.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
