If you are an HSBC Advance or Premier (NasdaqGS: PINC - news ) account holder you could qualify for a reduced fee. \nMoneyfacts.co.uk, the mortgage and savings rates analyst, has awarded the product its highest rating “outstanding” because of its very low rate coupled with an unusually low deposit requirement. \nBut how does it stack up against other similar deals on the market? \nMortgage calculators \n- How much can I borrow? \n- Monthly cost of your repayments \n= Verdict: = \nThere’s no denying that the rate, and crucially the fee, are competitive. \nOverall, fixed rates have started creeping up in recent weeks ahead of a widely anticipated interest rate rise, but deals for borrowers with a small deposit have been largely unaffected. \nThere are a few rates on the market that are slightly lower than HSBC's offering, including Norwich and Peterborough and First Direct’s 3.47pc deals. But these come with higher fees: £1,295 and £1,450 respectively. \nPeter Gettins, of mortgage broker London and Country, said West Bromwich Building Society’s new five-year fix could beat HSBC's deal for some borrowers, particularly those who want a small loan. \n“It’s a higher rate of 3.69pc but with a small £199 fee, free valuation and £500 cashback, it is very competitive. This is particularly true for loans worth up to about £200,000 or so. Beyond this amount the higher rate will start to outweigh the small fee. \n“So I wouldn’t say the HSBC deal is setting a new standard, but with a 10pc deposit it’s about as good as you’ll get.” \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:49:43.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
