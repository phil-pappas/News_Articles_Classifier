Winterkorn's contract was due to expire in 2016. \nWinterkorn is revamping Volkswagen's corporate structure into a decentralised system with four holding companies in a bid to boost profits at Europe's largest carmaker, three VW sources told Reuters in June. \nIn April, Winterkorn clashed with Ferdinand Piech, VW's former chairman who has since resigned from his post amid disagreements over VW's strategy and direction. \nVolkswagen is still looking for a permanent successor to Ferdinand Piech, installing former union boss Berthold Huber as interim chairman while it looks for a more permanent candidate. \n(Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Maria Sheahan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:41:13.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
