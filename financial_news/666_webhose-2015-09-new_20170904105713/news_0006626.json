Rob Portman (Ohio) on Wednesday once again called on the White House to address China’s currency fluctuations during a summit set for later this week. \nPresident Obama and China’s President Xi Jinping are slated to meet on Friday at the White House where the leaders of the world’s two largest economies will discuss a vast number of prickly issues from cyber security to climate change, human rights and economic growth. ADVERTISEMENT \"Just last month, China yet again lowered the value of its currency, another harsh reminder that we cannot afford to sit idly by as China refuses to play by the rules,\" Portman said in a statement.\n\"I urge President Obama to address this issue during President Xi’s visit and will continue my push to ensure foreign competitors are playing by the rules.\" \nOn Tuesday night, Xi told 650 business executives in Seattle that China won't deliberately lower the value of its currency to boost exports and grow its slowing economy, according to news reports. \nHe said that \"given the economic and financial situation at home and abroad\" there is no reason to allow the yuan to depreciate further.

Sherrod Brown (D) led a bipartisan group of senators in urging Lew and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to more aggressively address currency issues in the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. \nPortman teamed up with Brown and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and pushed to get a requirement in trade promotion authority legislation that would require the issue to be discussed in trade talks. \nThere has been some talk around the TPP that leaders may create a forum to discuss concerns about currency manipulation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T21:27:10.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
