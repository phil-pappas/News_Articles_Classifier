A part of the contract is currently being negotiated by economy ministry overseen by Piechocinski.\nOn Monday, Poland's largest opposition party Law and Justice (PiS), tipped to win the October 25 parliamentary elections, said it will block signing the contract if it comes to power.\n\"In my view it's impossible for this contract ... to be prepared within the one month until the election,\" Piechocinski told Reuters, referring to the part of the deal negotiated by his ministry.
