Here's what you need to know: *Fees and pricing, as well as other important terms in a contract, must now be both prominent and transparent. If a charge was hidden away and not brought to your attention, then a company won’t be able to enforce it.It's a huge win for consumers because it means that nasty stings can no longer be buried in the small print. Previously, terms only had to be written in 'plain language' *Retailers are now obliged to give shoppers a full refund on items that turn out to be faulty within 30 days. It's the first time a statutory time frame has been created for when consumers are entitled to get their money back. However, digital content is not a part of the 30 day rule. *Digital content that is paid for, such as DVDs, ebook and music, is now clearly a part of the law. It means that as with other goods, digital content must be of satisfactory quality, for for purpose and as described. *The law also brings in a new 'remedy system', which means that if you have had the items or longer than 30 days and up to six months, you have to give the retailer on attempt to repair or replace a faulty good. If this is unsuccessful, you’re entitled to ask for a refund or price reduction. If you don’t want a refund or price reduction, you have the right to request another repair or replacement at no cost to you.*If you qualify for a refund in the first six months after you‘ve bought something, retailers now have to give you all your money back. The only exception is for cars and other vehicles, where a reasonable reduction may be made for the use you’ve had of the vehicle.*After six months, the onus is on the buyer to prove that their was a problem with goods from the outset. *A retailer is responsible for goods until they are in your possession, which means that they are responsible for delivery firm that brings you goods.
