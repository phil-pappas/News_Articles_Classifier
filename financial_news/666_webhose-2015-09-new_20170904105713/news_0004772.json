Thereafter, but before the expiration date of October 14, holders get US$480.\nAt the same time, the board has approved an offering of common shares that will be sold in Brazil and used in part to finance the tender.\nPrices on the Brazilian mall operator's bonds have tumbled in recent months amid concerns that a weakening Real would make it difficult for the company to meet dollar payments when it was largely generating local currency revenues.\nThis follows the issuer's decision earlier this month to trigger covenants that allowed it to defer payments on US$150m of 12% perpetual bonds.\nIn a statement earlier this month the company said its move to defer payment that is due on September 20 did not constitute a default. It however did not specify why it was taking such a step.\nThe senior 10% perps were being Quote: d at a mid-market price of around 44.5, marking a 45% drop from the 81.00 level seen in mid July, according to Thomson Reuters data.
