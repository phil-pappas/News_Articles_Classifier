HON -0.11 % ’s $3.8 billion Transportation Systems unit.\n“We have seen proven results around clean-diesel technology, and we don’t want what one auto maker has done to tarnish the industry or the technology,” Mr. Hahn said.\nENLARGE Wall Street wasn’t convinced, however. Shares of Honeywell, a major supplier of the turbochargers often used to make diesel-powered cars peppier, fell 10 cents Friday to $93.52, down about 5% from their close on Sept. 18. That was the day the EPA accused VW of installing illegal software that sharply reduces nitrogen-oxide emissions, but only when the cars are undergoing strict emission tests.\nVW later acknowledged its use of the software and issued an apology.\nThe company promised to find a remedy to repair the 482,000 VW diesel cars in the U.S. as soon as possible. On Sunday, it launched the website vwdieselinfo.com to tell VW diesel owners about the company’s plans to fix their vehicles.\nShares of Tenneco, which makes emissions systems and gets 8% of its revenue from VW, sank almost 8% last week, while those of BorgWarner, which generates 17% of its revenue from the auto maker, fell 6%, finishing the week at $40.\nBorgWarner recently opened plants in Portugal and South Korea, partly to produce more components used in starting diesel engines.\nContinental, a German supplier of engine components, also was under pressure. Its stock lost nearly 6% of its market value last week.\nRelated\nVW Scandal Affects Finance Unit Closely held Robert Bosch GmbH, the German giant that supplied the components now at the center of the emissions probe, has said VW was responsible for how the parts were installed.\nOn Friday, the EPA indicated it would step up scrutiny of diesel vehicles by overhauling the way it oversees the industry’s compliance with emissions standards.\nThe regulator sent a letter to auto makers saying that it will conduct tests of 2015 and 2016 vehicles under normal driving conditions, rather than accepting lab results, as it has done in the past.\nIn the U.S., diesel engines are largely confined to heavier trucks, with diesel-powered cars representing just a small part of the passenger-car market. But diesel is dominant in Europe, accounting for more than 50% of the passenger-car market in 2015, according to Barclays.\nBefore the scandal broke, J.D. Power & Associates expected diesel to expand to 7% of the U.S. light-vehicle market by 2017 from 3% this year.\nIn Charts: The Volkswagen Emission Scandal ENLARGE Barclays analyst Brian Johnson suggests those growth expectations need to change, both in the U.S. and Europe. And that will squeeze some parts makers.\n“Whatever the specifics that emerge from a VW investigation, we believe strongly that the VW scandal will heighten the pressure on diesel in Europe,” he said in a research note last week.\n“The end result of the VW issues will be to accelerate a move away from diesel in the European mass market, pressuring suppliers leveraged to diesel,” Mr. Johnson said.\nMike Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. auto retailer, said it would tough to rebuild trust with potential diesel buyers in the U.S. “It is another black eye for diesel engines overall,” he said.\nMr. Johnson of Barclays added that auto makers might need to accelerate development efforts of electric vehicles, hybrid and more-efficient gasoline engines.\nThat could help parts makers, since many of the same companies will have to supply those component. But their investments in diesel-powered cars could be lost if the industry shifts to those alternatives.\nWrite to Jeff Bennett at jeff.bennett@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BT-AE461_DSUPPL_16U_20150927182107.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AF781_201505_8H_20150925114129.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BT-AE461_DSUPPL_9U_20150927182107.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:11:06.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
