It's not that the retired couple is struggling to make ends meet.\nSeparated by about a decade in age, they get along quite well money-wise.\n\nThey net about $72,000 a year. Moreover, they have a combined net worth of more than $1 million.\nBut their wealth is presenting them with a quandary -- only not so much while they're living. The sore spots arise when they discuss what will become of their finances once they're gone.\n\"We recently discussed estate planning, and as this is a second marriage for us both, with children each from a previous marriage, our dilemma is how to structure our assets and wills to ensure fairness to each other and to our children,\" says Phoebe, in her early 60s, who has no work pension.\nPhoebe relies mainly on $330,000 mostly in RRSPs for her retirement income. Chandler is in his early 70s, has a work pension and wants Phoebe to be well taken care of if he dies before her.\n\"I don't want to simply pluck a number now and say upon death, this amount is going to my children and grandchildren regardless of whether or not my wife has the lifestyle she wants,\" says Chandler, who collects about $33,000 annually from his pension.\nPhoebe's concern is similar -- though she's more concerned about the impact of taxes on her estate.\n\"The majority of my assets are in my RRSP, which are fully taxable in the estate, so for tax effectiveness, it'd be best to pass it over to my husband tax-free,\" she says. \"But if I do that, then I only have $71,000 in cash, and I want to leave more than that to my family.\"\nWhile both have wills that set out amounts to be left for their children, they recognize this is less than ideal.\n\"How can we make things more equal?\" Phoebe asks. \"I just don't know how to do it.\"\nLawyer Caroline Kiva, who practises estate and succession law with Pitblado LLP in Winnipeg, says it's common for blended families to face these thorny issues.\n\"It's definitely not an easy process because second marriages -- especially when there are children from previous relationships -- can involve complex planning to ensure everyone is treated fairly.\"\nFor this reason, Phoebe and Chandler should seek legal advice to guarantee their wills are properly set up to carry out the legacies they envision.\nFor the sake of argument, if they were her clients, she would start with a thorough review of their situation, including examining their assets.\n\"To me, it's not important to see what is invested in their RRSPs but to look at what will be flowing through the estate.\"\nFor example, Phoebe may designate her savings go to her children, but if the designated beneficiary on the registered accounts is her husband, or the assets are jointly held with him, the money would pass outside the will to Chandler.\nAnother consideration is whether they have a cohabitation or prenuptial agreement that may limit how assets can be distributed by their wills.\nFurthermore, if their wills were completed prior to their marriage, they may no longer be legally binding.\n\"If they were done before the marriage, without contemplation of the marriage, then the marriage could invalidate the wills,\" she says.\n\"In which case, provincial intestate succession legislation would determine how the estate would be divided between the surviving spouse and the children of a previous relationship.\"\nYet this is likely less of a concern given they're contemplating how to divide their wealth fairly -- a process that will likely involve updating their wills.\nKiva says Phoebe and Chandler have a few options.\nThe most straightforward is purchasing life insurance with the children designated as beneficiaries.\n\"It's rather neat and tidy and does the trick because the death benefit is tax-free and can be an immediate payout on death subject to a little paperwork,\" she says. \"And they don't have to worry about the surviving spouse maintaining a will that leaves an estate divided equally between their children.\"\nTypically, permanent life insurance -- in place until death -- rather than term insurance is used for this purpose.\n\"They certainly would have to do a cost-benefit analysis with their investment adviser,\" she says. \"Based on their age, health and the value of death benefit, they would determine if the premiums are affordable enough to fit within their budget.\"\nIt may well be the premiums are cost-prohibitive, but Phoebe and Chandler still have a couple of other strategies to consider, including setting up a testamentary trust for the surviving spouse.\nThe benefit in this instance is assets held in trust can pay income and, in some cases, capital to the surviving spouse so he or she has enough money to live comfortably.\n\"Upon the death of that spouse, the balance of the assets would go to the children of the first-to-die spouse.\"\nYet, recent changes to federal tax laws regarding trusts may make this option inappropriate for Chandler and Phoebe given their limited assets.\n\"If the reason for setting up a trust is solely to ensure the children of the first to die receive the balance of those assets in the trust eventually, maybe taxation isn't a major concern, but if they're concerned about taxes, it might not be the best strategy for them,\" she says.\nThe remaining option to consider would be drawing up mutual wills bound by an estate-plan contract.\nThis would prevent the surviving spouse from ignoring the wishes of the deceased to leave assets to specific beneficiaries once the surviving spouse dies.\nThis, too, can involve complicated planning.\n\"The couple, for instance, have to anticipate a situation where the surviving spouse lives another 20 years and acquires assets that have nothing to do with those accumulated during the course of the marriage,\" she says.\nRegardless of what option Phoebe and Chandler choose, each requires careful contemplation and planning.\n\"This is a process, and if they would like to see this done to their satisfaction, they are going to have to spend some time with a lawyer carefully weighing their options.\"\n \njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published":
