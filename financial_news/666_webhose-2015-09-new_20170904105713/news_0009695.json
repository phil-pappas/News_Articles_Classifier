The central bank didn’t say which of these two companies it is now negotiating with. A person familiar with the situation said Apollo’s offer was preferred over Fosun’s.\nBanco Espírito Santo collapsed in August 2014 amid a record first-half loss triggered by its exposure to its troubled family-controlled parent company. The country’s central bank broke up the bank into a “good bank,” called Novo Banco SA, and a “bad” one, which kept the toxic exposure to the Espírito Santo empire.\nRELATED\nChinese Insurance Group in Talks Over Novo Banco Sale (Aug. 20) Portugal’s Novo Banco Received Three Binding Offers (June 30) Bank of Portugal Unveils Plan to Rescue Banco Espírito Santo (Aug. 3, 2014) While Novo Banco kept the so-called “good assets” of Banco Espírito Santo, including loans and deposits, its financial situation is less than great. Late Monday, it reported a €251.9 million loss for the first half of this year after setting aside money to cover souring loans. Credit at risk of default rose to 20% of total loans compared with about 17% at December.\nDeposits, however, are growing and the bank is increasingly less dependent on outside funding, including from the European Central Bank, to function. Its loan-to-deposit ratio is now 114%. It also has a share of about 18% of Portugal’s banking market, which makes it a rare prey for investors seeking to enter the European financial system. The bank also has operations in Cape Verde, Venezuela and Mozambique, as well as a 9.9% stake in Angolan lender Banco Economico.\nThe sale price of Novo Banco is particularly important because from the €4.9 billion capital injection it received from a resolution fund, €3.9 billion came from the Portuguese state, while the rest was given by contribution from other domestic financial institutions. Under fund rules, the state must be paid back 100% of that, which means other Portuguese banks will have to cover any shortfall.\nAnalysts say that is already a given, since it is virtually impossible buyers will offer to pay €4.9 billion for a bank that will likely need more capital injection soon.\nAnbang, which last year became known to the world as the buyer of Manhattan’s iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel , has closed smaller deals in Europe so far. Earlier this year, it agreed to buy and recapitalize Vivat, the insurance arm of SNS Reaal, a financial group owned by the Dutch government. In December, Anbang snapped up a small Belgian bank held by Dutch insurance company Delta Lloyd NV.\nWrite to Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:40:48.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
