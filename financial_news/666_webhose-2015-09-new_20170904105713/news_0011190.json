A Senate panel passed such a measure before Congress adjourned for its August recess. House Republicans are expected to take up the issue this fall.\nThe crude oil export ban includes some exceptions and was put into place nearly four decades ago as Congress responded to an oil embargo that sparked high inflation.\nThe report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration includes numerous caveats but found that petroleum product prices in the United States, including gasoline prices, would be either unchanged or slightly reduced by ending the restrictions.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
