Chinese Savers Shaken By Stock Market Chaos By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe dust and the daily bustle of Beijing's old back streets feels a long way, in every sense, from the trading floors of Europe and the United States. \nBut it's a good place to come to start to understand China's stock market, and the wild fluctuations we've seen. \nUnlike other major markets, the main index here - the Shanghai Composite - is dominated by small retail investors - individuals investing their savings. \nSome 80% of urban Chinese households are said to own shares, according to research by Credit Suisse (Other OTC: CDSSF - news ) , and until recently it has felt like a one way bet. \nWe were directed through the hutongs, the capital's traditional narrow alleyways, to Mr Zheng's shop - the man known locally as 'The Stock God'. \nInside, in between serving customers, he was checking the markets on a small laptop beside the till. \nHe made so much last year, he bought himself an Audi A6. \nHis dream is to earn enough to retire, to return to his home town. He admits last week's crash gave him a fright. \nZheng Liangyu said: \"Yes, I was very worried. I got calls asking me if I have sold the stocks, asking me to be careful. \n\"But I have experienced the rise and fall a lot, I'm quite calm about it.\" \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) door but one we met Ma Anxi, who runs a public shower facility, and wants to have enough money to take his son on holiday abroad. \nHe has lost around a quarter of the £20,000-worth he has invested so far. \nMr Ma said: \"Every day I lose money. I'm just an ordinary person, I don't earn that much, then I lose money in the stock market, of course I was scared. \n\"I heard news about people who borrow a lot of money, and then jump off buildings, it's scary. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if I didn't invest a huge amount, it's money I worked hard for.\" \nAcross the city, on his lunch break in the capital's financial district, Mr Feng showed us his portfolio on his phone. \nHe has put almost all his savings into the stock market, so far he's down the equivalent of £20,000. \nHe wants the Chinese government to do more. \n\"I think for individual investors, we are normally a little behind in terms of understanding the rules and information,\" Mr Feng explained. \n\"The government says you must be responsible, but the big guys just reduce or short their stocks as they wish, this is not something we can control. \n\"So I really hope the government can increase the efforts of supervision and punishment, and make the information from companies more transparent.\" \nThe speed and the scale of China's growth has been dizzying, but along with the with skyscrapers, the country has also been accumulating debt. \nFears over the potential consequences of a Chinese slowdown rattled international markets last week, as global commodity share prices crashed alongside the shanghai composite. \nBut Dr Liu Qian, deputy director of the Economist Intelligence Unit's Chinese Service, says the Chinese economy is developing and neither the stock market, nor traditional manufacturing-oriented statistics tell the full story. \nHe said: \"Be it the stock market, electricity usage, industry production, trade data, or last week's purchasing managers index, all of these traditional economic indicators are pointing to a possibly weaker and weaker economy, so I can certainly see why people are worried. \n\"But that said, the reason why I use the word traditional is because the Chinese economy is also evolving. People used to think about China as a cheap labour, manufacturing story, but it's no longer just like that.\" \nInvestors here, and those who depend on this, the world's second largest economy abroad, will hope she's right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:18:32.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
