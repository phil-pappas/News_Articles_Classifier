Itau Unibanco SA and Banco BTG Pactual also were among lenders that faced downgrades.\nS&P reduced the country’s debt rating to BB+ Wednesday and said there’s a greater than one-in-three chance of another downgrade. The ratings company said political challenges are hindering the government’s ability to submit a 2016 budget consistent with fiscal-reform plans to Congress.\n“We rarely rate financial-services companies above the sovereign long-term rating because, during sovereign stress, the sovereign’s regulatory and supervisory powers may restrict a bank’s or financial system’s flexibility, and because banks are affected by many of the same economic factors that cause sovereign stress,” S&P said in the statement.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff, already grappling with what’s predicted to be Brazil’s longest recession since the 1930s, has failed to raise taxes and cut costs to achieve fiscal targets.\nBanco Bradesco, Itau Unibanco and Banco do Brasil all had their global-scale rating reduced one level to BB+. Banco BTG Pactual was cut one step to BB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:01:25.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
