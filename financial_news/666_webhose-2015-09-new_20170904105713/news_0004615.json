Here are some of the highlights of its journey \neBay celebrates its 20th birthday on Wednesday. \nOne of the web's early darlings survived the dotcom crash and has grown relentlessly since its humble beginnings on September 3, 1995, just days after Windows 95 launched . \nHere are 20 things you may not know about eBay: \n= It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was originally called AuctionWeb = \nComputer programmer Pierre Omidyar established eBay in September 1995, but it wasn't called that. The site, started as a hobby by Omidyar, was given the much more straightforward AuctionWeb title. \nIt didn't change its name until 1997. This is what AuctionWeb looked like: \n= The first item sold was a broken laser pointer = \nAnd it cost $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the buyer to ensure he was aware it was unusable. \n\"I'm a collector of broken laser pointers,\" the buyer responded. \n= The name surfaced because EchoBay was taken = \nWhile the \"e\" prefix is associated with lots of internet activity - email, ecommerce and e-gaming - this wasn't the inspiration for eBay. \nOmidyar's consulting group Echo Bay Technology Group tried to register echobay.com, but this was taken by a mining company Echo Bay Mines. \nSo it was shortened to eBay, and stuck. \n= If you'd invested £1,000 in eBay's IPO, you'd have more than £84,000 today = \neBay listed in September 1998 at $18 a share. Despite a blip in the dotcom boom, it has been a corporate monster. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) have been split and investments spun off, but according to Bloomberg data taking this into account, they have risen by 84.5 times since its IPO. \n= Sales on eBay outstrip Cuba's GDP = \nIn 2014, $82.95bn changed hands on eBay, according to its annual report . \nOnly 62 countries have a bigger economy than this. eBay's marketplace sales are bigger than Cuba, Libya and Croatia's economies. \n= The first item sold in the UK was a Scorpions CD = \nebay.co.uk opened in 1999, four years after the website emerged in the US. \nThe first thing sold in the UK was a CD of \"You & I\" from German rock band Scorpions. It sold for £2.89. \n= Britons use eBay more than any other country = \nWhile eBay came to the UK late, it has been embraced enthusiastically by Brits. \nOver 19 million Brits visit eBay every month, and buy more items per capita than anywhere else in the world. \n= The most expensive item sold on eBay was a yacht = \nIn 2006, Russian billionaire and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was reportedly the buyer of a $168m yacht on eBay. \nThe 405-foot yacht, featuring a helipad and movie theatre, easily outstrips the second most-expensive, a $4.9m private jet. \n= Most items on eBay are Buy It Now = \neBay started life as an auction website, and is still known as one, but most items sold on it use the \"Buy It Now\" feature. \nAccording to 2013 research, only 15 per cent of items sold are auction only. \n= New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) species have been discovered on eBay = \nIn 2006, a Montana-based seller put a sea urchin from the Pacific ocean on eBay, but it was of a type nobody had seen before. \nSimon Coppard of the Natural History Museum realised the urchin had been mis-labelled as an already discovered species. He gave it the name Coelopleurus exquisitus. \n= The average user goes on eBay every four days = \nAnd spends over an hour on the site a month, three times more than the average of America's top 100 internet retailers, according to the company. \nIn the US, the average unique user comes to eBay seven times a month and spends 75 minutes per month. \n= 800 million items are on eBay at any one time = \neBay does not actually say how many items are sold on its website every year, but 800 million are on at any one time. \nIt also sold $20.1bn of items in the second quarter of the year. That's $2,556 (£1,670) a second. \n= Prayers, magic potions and souls are banned = \n...as are human body parts, ivory and a person's virginity. \neBay's lengthy list of banned items also includes Nazi memorabilia, lottery tickets and animals \n= eBay is more than just eBay = \nAs well as the online marketplace, the company also owns ticket exchange StubHub, listings site Gumtree, and a 25 per cent stake in Craigslist. \nIt owned Skype before selling it to Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) , and PayPal before spinning it off this year. \n= eBay has helped lonely hearts find love = \nA British man and woman were married in 2007 three months after meeting thanks to eBay. \nDavid Jones bought a pair of ornamental birds on the website but apparently fell in love over the internet with the seller - Cheryl Pipes - before they even met. \n= A surprising number of places have been sold = \nThe California town of Bridgeville, the original Hollywood sign and the Thatch Cay Virgin Island have all been sold on eBay. \nOther attempts have been less successful. An Australian man who tried to sell New Zealand saw his listing closed down when it reached A$3,000, while one listing for Iceland during the financial crisis reached £10m . \n= Nasa once bought things on eBay = \nOne of the best things about eBay is no matter how niche your taste, it's probably on sale there. \nThis even applied to Nasa, which used the site to find out-of-production gear it couldn't source anywhere else . \n= eBay has had physical stores = \nIt seems counter-intuitive but in 2011, eBay opened a pop-up shop in London . \nYou couldn't take anything home though, it was more of a showroom. Visitors would scan a code on their smartphone, which would take them to an item's eBay listing. \n= James Blunt tried to sell his sister on eBay once = \nReally. Well sort of. The singer's sister had to get to Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) for a funeral, and strikes put air travel out of the question. \nBlunt turned to eBay , and a helicopter owner actually came to the rescue. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) better, the winning bidder and Blunt's sister got married shortly after. \n= William Shatner sold a kidney stone on eBay for £16,000 = \nTrekkies are Trekkies. Online casino Goldenpalace.com paid $25,000 (£16,000) for the actor's kidney stone in 2006. \nShatner, who was raising money for charity, said at the time : \"This takes organ donors to a new height, to a new low.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:28:38.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
