Some consult books or read lists of names in lifestyle guides, while some name their children after celebrities, famous fictional or historical characters, their ancestors, or themselves. Some names come and go as fads, and some names that were popular make comebacks decades later. There are also names that are only now becoming popular. The U.S. Social Security Administration has been tracking baby names since before the turn of the 20th century. 24/7 Wall St. identified the 12 names that have been around for more than a century, but have only become popular in the past few years. To identify the oldest names that are only now becoming popular, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 1,000 most popular names for each gender in each year between 1900 and 2014 from the SSA. To make this list, a name needed to have never been in the top 100 names for that gender before 2012. These are the 12 American names popular for the first time.\nGetty Images Actress Annabelle Wallis. Slide 2 of 14 1. Annabelle Many parents name their children after fictional characters, and perhaps this also true for the name Annabelle. It may be parents preferred it as a variant on Annabel, made timeless by the famous Edgar Allan Poe poem, “Annabel Lee.” Whatever the reason, Annabelle was an uncommon name through much of the early 20th century, and fell out of the top 1,000 girls’ names in 1950. It reappeared in the mid-90s, however, and rebounded to 57th by 2014, its most popular year ever.\nGetty Images Aria, as in an opera solo? Slide 3 of 14 2. Aria While some names on this list were uncommon, but still used in decades past, Aria was not even among the top 1,000 girls’ names before the year 2000. The name has several possible roots and is the name of a patron saint. The most likely derivation of the name comes from its musical meaning. In operas, arias are solos accompanied by instrumentation. In Latin, the word means “the song.” One of the protagonists of the wildly popular HBO show Game of Thrones is named Arya, which may have influenced the trend as well.\nGetty Images Piper: musically inspired? Slide 4 of 14 3. Piper Another potentially musical name, Piper cracked the top 1,000 choices for newborn girls in 2000 and has become more popular nearly every year since. The name has many potential meanings. It could be reminiscent of the famous fable of The Pied Piper. Parents may also be thinking of the sandpiper, a small, agile species of bird that can commonly be found on beaches running along the surf looking for food. Piper is also the name of the protagonist from the popular Netflix show “Orange is the New Black.”\nNeilson Barnard/Getty Images for NYLON Singer Skylar Grey. Slide 5 of 14 4. Skylar Skylar is an androgynous name, although it is a much more commonly used name for females. In the mid-1990s, it was uncommon but used for both sexes — roughly evenly distributed between baby boys and baby girls. However, use of the name for males and females soon diverged, and in 2014, it was the 637th most popular name for boys and 48th for girls. On the hit TV show “Breaking Bad,” Skyler was the wife of the main character Walter White.\nGetty Images Actress Mila Kunis. Slide 6 of 14 5. Mila The Slavic name Mila comes from a derivation of the word milu , meaning dear. It may very well be that Ukrainian-born celebrity actress Mila Kunis has been the sole driver for the name’s popularity, as it was more or less unused in the U.S. before Kunis’s breakout role in 2008’s “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” It was the 72nd most popular girls’ name last year, its most popular year.\nShutterstock Paisley Abbey in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland Slide 7 of 14 6. Paisley Few popular girls’ names have had a sharper increase in popularity than Paisley. Less than a decade ago, Paisley was effectively unused. It made its debut within the top 1,000 newborn female names in 2006 at 831. Just a few years later, the name had jumped to 72nd in 2014, when it was more popular than ever. Parents who choose the name may be thinking of the Scottish village, or the floral pattern of the same name with Persian roots.\nGetty Images Penélope Cruz Slide 8 of 14 7. Penelope Unlike some of the names on this list, Penelope is a name that has been used on and off throughout the century. The name’s most popular year before its recent surge was in 1944, when it ranked 265th. It actually fell completely out of the top 1,000 baby girls’ names in 1976 and didn’t reappear among the top 1,000 until 2001. It has become more common every year since. Parents naming their daughter Penelope may be thinking of the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. In Homer’s epic poem, The Odyssey, Penelope is Odysseus’ wife.\nAFP/Getty Images Harvesting pumpkins in Easton, Md. Slide 9 of 14 8. Easton Easton is an old English word meaning “east town.” It is also a city in England as well as the name of several places in the U. S. Since it made its debut among the 1,000 most popular boys names in 1995, it has increased in use every year to date. In 2014, roughly 5,000 newborn boys were named Easton, making it the 83rd most popular choice for males that year.\nGetty Images A replica of Henry Hudson’s ship sails up the Hudson River. Slide 10 of 14 9. Hudson Hudson is the name of numerous towns as well a variety of geographic features throughout North America. These include Hudson Bay in Canada and the Hudson River, which runs from upstate New York to eventually border the Island of Manhattan — both named after the famous explorer English explorer Henry Hudson. Hudson has become one of the most popular boys names in the country. It was rarely used in the early 1900s, and then dropped entirely off the radar for the rest of the 20th century, beginning to surge in popularity in 1996.\nGetty Images Jace Peterson of the Atlanta Braves. Slide 11 of 14 10. Jace Jace, a shortened variant of Jason, has been among the 100 most popular boys’ names in the country in each of the past three years. Unlike some of the other names to make this list, which jumped from total obscurity to being wildly popular within the last decade, Jace has been an increasingly popular choice for a longer time. After a brief period of rare use in the 1950s, it vanished and then returned to the top 1,000 most popular male baby names in 1979, when it was 713th. Since then, use of the name has risen to 68th 2014, its most popular year ever, when more than 6,000 male newborns were named Jace.\nShutterstock London’s Camden Town tube station. Slide 12 of 14 11. Camden A quarter of a century ago, few if any parents named their newborn sons Camden. In the 1990s and the 2000s, the name slowly and steadily turned up on more birth certificates until it cracked the top 100 in both 2013 and 2014. As is the case with some names on this list, it is much more commonly known as an English-derived surname. Some Baltimore Orioles fans may have baseball in mind, specifically the team’s stadium, Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\nShutterstock Slide 13 of 14 12. Lincoln Lincoln is another name more commonly known as a surname. It seems likely that a good number of the parents of the 4,785 baby boys named Lincoln last year had the 16th president of the U.S. in mind. Since at least 1900, the name has never fully dropped into obscurity, but instead fluctuated between the 500th and 800th position among male baby names for the entirety of the 20th century. In the mid-2000s, use of the name started to grow rapidly, and last year it was 87th overall in the country.\nRead more about “12 American names popular for the first time” at 24/7 Wall St.\nMore from 24/7 Wall St.: 9 Old-Fashioned Names Making Huge Comebacks 10 Cities Where Incomes Are Growing the Fastest 10 States With The Most Hate Groups Shutterstock Slide 14 of 14 12.
