More UK sets out plan on working time opt-out \nThe charity said that the average waiting time reported by Twitter complainants was 47 minutes — much longer than the average 10 minute wait claimed by HMRC. \nGillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said long waiting times could not only be leaving tax credit recipients out of pocket if they could not update HMRC about their circumstances, but could also be landing callers with excessive phone bills. \nHMRC helplines, which are 0300 numbers, are charged at local landline rates. Someone holding for 47 minutes would incur costs of £4.66, according to Citizens Advice, which estimated call costs at the BT fixed line rate of 9.58p per minute plus the 16p connection fee. \nHowever, the tax authority has criticised the research, which analysed each of the 34,000 tweets that mentioned @HMRCgovuk (the authority’s official Twitter account) in the 12-month period. \nLawyers attack plans to charge taxpayers for HMRC challenges \nPlans to charge taxpayers for challenging decisions by HM Revenue & Customs have incurred the wrath of lawyers and accountants, who fear access to justice could be denied. The government has proposed introducing fees for individuals appealing decisions to the tax tribunal as part of broader reforms to civil court funding, which also include increasing fees levied on divorce proceedings. \nRead more \n“We are sorry that some customers have struggled to get hold of us, but this unscientific and out of date survey of tweets does not represent the real picture now,” HMRC said. \nEarlier this year, the Revenue conceded that its “standards had not been good enough” as its own figures showed that only 73 per cent of calls were answered in the 2014-15 tax year, well below its official target of 80 per cent. \nThe authority subsequently recruited an extra 3,000 staff to take calls and handle post, and has confirmed that answer rates on phone lines have since improved, and that wait times are falling. \nHMRC is increasingly moving its services online as part of efforts to simplify tax and improve compliance, with plans for each taxpayer to have their own digital tax account by 2020. \n“We have developed quick and easy to use digital products to provide more choice for our customers, such as online renewal for tax credits and web chat for people who need support,” the Revenue said. \nMs Guy said the charity’s research showed, however, that the tax authority was “still failing to provide a timely service” for those who needed support by phone. \n“There is already a clear demand to be able to speak to HMRC. With the rollout of . . . big changes to tax credits just around the corner, this is only going to grow. HMRC needs urgently to address the problems many people are experiencing with phone lines.” Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
