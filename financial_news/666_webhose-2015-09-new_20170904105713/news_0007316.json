Bloomberg by Tom Keene Summer is so over. Do something. Get smarter with smart people.\nFirst, If you are not on Twitter get on Twitter, now. When I hear adults of all ages say, \"Twitter is not for me\", all I can think of is the news flow and wave of quality information that drifts by from my many links. There are many obvious: @elerianm and the ginourmous and deserved following for @NYTimeskrugman and don't forget @thestalwart . Joe Weisenthal, who in the interests of full disclosure is an editor on this piece, single-handedly changed how information is disseminated in my world.\nHere are some quick tips for being on Twitter for those who don't want to be on Twitter or if they must, remain passive:\nA) Learn to block. This is the quickest way to adapt and adjust your Twitter feed. Learn to block, use block relentlessly, and know you have a right to block idiots.\nB) Follow many more institutions and worthies than you think you should. This is a great failing. Follow too few means #FAIL. The quickest way to get up to Twitter escape velocity is to follow lots of smart people you respect. The great fear is that you will miss things. You will. Get over it. That is part of the game. By definition, Twitter is a massive pipeline. Build your custom pipeline around two or three or even four themes and follow at the start, say, 100 people and institutions within each interest.\nC) Smart and increasing smarts is the goal, and that comes not from silly 140-character tweets. Links are everything. Aggregation, or handles that pull in from numerous outside sources, are a must. Stay focused on link value within your Twitter feed. Simply use twitter as a link beast to make you smarter.\nHere are seven very interesting and twisted Twitter feeds to follow. These link-laden worthies will make you smarter:\n1. Adam Posen @AdamPosen : There are a gazillion people to follow in economics. Adam Posen will deliver in spades. He is smart and eclectic. What is unique is that he is active in the Twitterscape, link-laden, and has major academic and public service credibility. Hate economics? Follow Posen. He has the distinct benefit of handing you Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics and non-Peterson Institute knowledge.\n2. Mark Thoma @MarkThoma : How many buggy whip manufacturers made it past the advent of the internal combustion engine? Mark Thoma of Oregon flat-out invented the economic blog. He has not missed a beat in transferring to Twitter. He owns aggregation. Always smart, always on point. Bonus round for conservatives: His link-laden and liberal tilt will put you in front of other opinions that will make you smarter. What a novel idea.\n3. Matt Levine @matt_levine : If you are part of Global Wall Street and you don't follow Matt Levine, your job is at risk. For others, Levine is a conduit to the most interesting and nuanced parts of the Wall Street ballet. His links always inform with and without his Bloomberg View footnotes. He owns wry. (Wry, not rye.)\n4. Jeanne Park @CFR_org : The Council on Foreign Relations has done the impossible, taken a walnut-walled, oriental-carpet past and vaulted it into the modern Internet age. It has best-in-class aggregation and killer in-house talent. CFR \"backgrounders\" are the quiet secret on how the smart get smarter fast. Put Jeanne Park and the team in your feed.\n5. Aaron David Miller @aarondmiller2 : Aaron David Miller has bipartisan cred in international relations. There are many to follow. Miller is a no-brainer follow for the IR set. But that's the point: He should be followed by those who have marginal interest in geopolitics. He will make you smarter and meet the massive 2015 need to get international relations essays in front of your face.\n6. Max Roser @maxcroser : The best thing about Twitter is that you always, always stumble upon the new. My latest win-win is Max Roser of Oxford, England OX1 2JD. Just outstanding, consistently smart links. Roser is chart-centric. Make Twitter a win-win and find your new-new.\n7. Mathew Ingram @mathewi : Mathew Ingram is a lovely loose cannon in all things media. His feed is smart and wildly eclectic. Others cover a Rhode Island of square footage; Ingram thinks Alaska. Like Posen, he is way active and constantly surprises. Part of Twitter is following people outside your realm. If you avoid the media wars, make Ingram part of your feed. Addictive.\nTo stay smart, you need to follow 400+ accounts. (4000+?). Here are seven. How to find the next 70?\nGo to their pages and check out who they follow.\nDiscuss.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mathewi", "https://twitter.com/aarondmiller2", "https://twitter.com/elerianm", "https://twitter.com/NYTimeskrugman", "https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/CFR_org", "https://twitter.com/MarkThoma", "https://twitter.com/TheStalwart", "https://twitter.com/matt_levine", "https://twitter.com/AdamPosen"], "published": "2015-09-09T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:15:36.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
