We will see a normalised figure of, let’s say, in between 4 and 7 percent, that depends on who is calculating it,” he said.\nOn Monday, Jaguar launched its first crossover sports utility vehicle, the latest part of a major expansion of its model range and volumes as it enters an area that has become increasingly popular among women and families.\n 15, 2015 4:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:27:28.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
