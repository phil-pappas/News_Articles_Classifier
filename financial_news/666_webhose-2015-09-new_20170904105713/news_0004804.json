Allstar’s 1.1 million cardholders will benefit from payment security and ease-of-use over more than 7,600 filling stations all across the UK. In Europe, EMV migration is completed for payment cards issued by banks, thus protected against fraud, including in the UK where EMV has proven its efficiency. But there are still a lot of other payment cards, issued by various types of retail players (fuel/fleet, supermarkets, luncheon vouchers, etc.) that are still using magstripe technology. Those issuers thus become at risk and are the potential next targets for fraudsters. This is why Allstar has decided to improve the security and enhance the capability of their cards by choosing to implement EMV in their new generation of fuel cards. OT is assisting for EMV setup and artwork design, and provides the cards and personalization from its WISE offering. This range of OT services will contribute to reinforce the security of Allstar cards against fraud as well as simplifying the deployment and the shopping experience throughout the network. With WISE (White label, Independent, Secure, EMV), OT offers products and solutions dedicated to domestic payment or ATM schemes, retailers, fuel retailers, etc. wishing to migrate from magnetic stripe to chip cards to take advantage of all the benefits of EMV (security and interoperability) to enjoy a simplified, safer shopping experience. “OT is delighted to bring its experience in the smartcard industry to help EMV projects become a reality, as we do in the US market where we are leading EMV migration. We are proud to support the enhancement of fuel card features such as Allstar’s. We are convinced this is a step forward to fight against payment fraud and to enhance customer experience including contactless payment,” said Eric Duforest, Managing Director of OT’s Financial Services Institutions activity. Peter Bridgen, Managing Director Fleetcor UK Fuel Cards. “This is a major change for us, our network and our customers. By partnering with OT we will be able to offer safe and simple payment means across our extensive portfolio of products and services. OT has a great track record in EMV migration and will be able to support us with its complete solution to allow for a smooth transition. ” The migration is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
