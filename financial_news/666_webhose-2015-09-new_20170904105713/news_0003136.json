A ballot measure in the District of Columbia to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour is expected to go before voters next year.\nSome business groups said Cuomo's proposed hike was too aggressive.\n\"A precipitous increase that threatens the most vulnerable businesses and employees would not find a lot of supporters in the business community,\" said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.\nCuomo contended the hike would boost the state's economy.\n\"The families that get that money are going to spend that money,\" he told a labor rally in New York City.\nNew York State Labor Commissioner Mario Musolino on Thursday signed the order making the statewide $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers official following a recommendation by the New York Wage Board in July.\nWashington state currently has the highest statewide minimum wage, at $9.47, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Massachusetts is set to hike its minimum to $11 in 2017.
