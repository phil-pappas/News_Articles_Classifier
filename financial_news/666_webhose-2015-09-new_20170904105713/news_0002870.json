By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News â€“ 1 hour 20 minutes ago View Photo \n\nTrust in motor manufacturers has been battered by the emissions scandal, which hit one of the world's most respected car brands. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is unlikely the full extent of the crisis at Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) is yet known, after new details revealed some diesel vans are also involved. \nFor buyers and sellers, it is an uncertain time. \nCaroline Shield, who sells used cars with her husband from a forecourt in Suffolk, believes trust has gone, especially when it comes to new vehicles. \n\"We are reliant on the manufacturers giving us the correct information, and it is disappointing that the statistics are not necessarily correct,\" she said. \n\"There is definitely more to come and there could be other manufacturers involved... who knows.\" \nIt all began when car testers in the US were tricked into thinking certain diesel models were significantly cleaner than they really are. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the Government here is under pressure to say when it became aware of the problem, as it calls for diesel cars to be re-tested. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) diehard VW fans setting up camp at the Retro Dub Festival in Suffolk voiced concerns about the brand. \n\"I think for the public, it makes them really in a position to be cautious,\" said Laura Turner, a VW Beetle owner. \n\"You don't know how much trust you should put in manufacturers when they are having secrets in cars.\" \nVW van owner Jackie King agrees that trust has been broken, but she added: \"I think it's a good brand and a well-known brand and I think it will affect VW in the short-term. But in the long-term, I don't think it will do much damage.\" \nFor many drivers, the impact of emissions on the planet is not a huge worry. \nWhat's more important is whether motorists may have to pay for road tax if their car is found to be less clean than first thought. \nThere is concern about resale values, too. \nBut the discrepancy in the statistics throws up trust issues that go beyond emissions. \nMost motorists struggle to do as many miles per gallon as the manufacturers advertise - and one mechanic, Paul Barrell, is sceptical that matching a car brand's claims is even possible. \nHe explained: \"You are going to have treat it with utmost care... a very steady throttle, have everything turned off, pootling along, no fast accelerating - just really, really steady. \n\"You may achieve it if you are lucky... but I think you would be very lucky.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T12:13:36.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
