Photo: Pat Scala\nIf there is one word that best sums up the response from investors to the unveiling of Myer's transformation it would be – risk. While It's hard to disagree with that assessment the reality is that there is a greater risk for Myer – tinkering around the edges and avoiding a major overhaul.\nIt is understandable that, faced with another fall in earnings in 2016, a big lick of capital spending and a dilutive capital raising, many investors won't be prepared to stick with a strategy that will test their deodorant.\nBut the option of remaining in that continuous loop of smaller strategy tweaks – which is where Myer has been for at least five years – is even riskier.\nIllustration John Shakespeare\nThe fact is that Myer has been slowing shrinking profits since it relisted in 2009 and that its sales have been going backwards for two decades, presents a pretty clear picture of its future trajectory in the absence of some major intervention.\nAdvertisement Whether investors should get on Myer's new nail-biting ride depends firstly on one's view of whether the high end department store model is a dinosaur at the hands of the rising specialty chains and online shopping invasion or whether it has a future in today's retail environment.\nThere are plenty of offshore department stores that are travelling pretty well – mainly because they have evolved, and refined their offers to be more appealing to their customers.\nThis brings us to the all important question of whether the particular strategy that is being employed by the new management is the right one.\nBased on Myer's commentary this week that it will target the higher spending customer, there are understandable concerns that the department store chain is straying too close to the demographic already well serviced by David Jones.\nBut again, Myer's current positioning between the better end of the discount department store – Target – and David Jones renders it a retail hybrid.\nSitting in this middle ground (albeit far closer to David Jones), Myer has been trying to be too many things to too many people.\nClosures overdue Its plan to close 20 per cent of its stores and revamping those that it retains is a move that is long overdue.\nSimilarly, getting out of categories, such as some electricals, that other specialist retail chains can always do better, is another welcome element to the strategy.\nThe idea to cater to the higher spending customer is a no-brainer – it's the nirvana for all higher end department stores. Indeed it would be hard to find any major consumer-based businesses from banks to telcos that haven't discovered the \"customer centric\" model over the past few years.\nAnd of course the bigger spending customers are Myer's focus. But both Myer and David Jones need to have volume brands that bring foot traffic into the stores and they need allocate the brands sufficient space rather than a frustrating taste of the range.\nMyer and David Jones have both announced over the past few months they will cull some of their thousands of brands and use the liberated space for more popular higher volume ones.\nThe move to introduce the Topshop concessions into a large number of Myer stores is a significant milestone in this regard. Myer had to buy a stake in the Australian chapter of Topshop (for an unspecified price) but it should deliver additional customers, thanks to its reasonably-pitched pricing and fast-fashion model.\nAchieving Myer's goals will come at a price – $600 million over five years – as it ramps up investment in online, stores and brands.\nIt may seem like a large price tag but any less would render the Myer strategy one of evolution when a revolution is what's required.\nExecution key Whether this plan will be Myer's saviour or just a very expensive mistake will be determined by its execution.\nMyer boss Richard Umbers has given himself one year's profit grace – a \"transition\" year in 2016 in which he is forecasting that the earnings will fall to between $64 and $72 million. After that Umbers expects the company will post sustainable profits.\nFrom the analyst community there was a general appreciation of the soundness of the strategy but few willing to vouch for whether it will be successful.\n\"The emphasis on the stores, brands and categories which will deliver the best sales and profit outcomes seems sensible. The strategy is not without risk and the group's inability to grow sales in the past does not instil confidence,\" to Deutsche Bank's Michael Simotas said, while noting that other department stores offshore are performing well by \"focusing on the core fashion and cosmetics categories\".\nA slightly more sceptical Ben Gilbert from UBS reminded investors that: \"[This financial year] will mark Myer's 5th year of strategic reviews/plans, with FY15 having previously been described as a year in which earnings would rise (albeit under previous management). Given previous plans have proved unsuccessful, we do approach the new strategy with caution, particularly given the cost, level to which earnings have been re-based in FY15/16 and heightened competitive backdrop.\"\nIt is fair to say that none were particularly impressed by the quality of the 2015 result. But the real test of how Myer's plan, and its financing, has been received will be revealed on Thursday when the shares begin trading again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:19:02.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
