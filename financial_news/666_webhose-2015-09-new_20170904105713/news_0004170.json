The BoE unsurprisingly voted 8-1 in favour of maintaining interest rates at 0.5% and the asset purchase programme at 3375bn. Policymaker Ian McCafferty remained the only member of the Monetary Policy Committee to vote for an increase in rates, minutes of the policy meeting revealed. \nHowever, the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) highlighted that inflation remains well below the 2% target, with the 12-month consumer price index rising slightly to 0.1% in July. The move also comes amid worries on China's flagging economy. \n\"Given the increasing concerns surrounding China and the strength of the global economy and the impact that this had on financial markets across the world in August, it was perhaps unsurprising that no members were tempted to join McCafferty's side,\" said Cebr economist Sam Alderson. \n\"While growth in the UK economy has remained relatively strong in 2015, momentum is showing some signs of waning amidst the current headwinds. With the outlook for inflation remaining restrained, the MPC should be in no rush to raise rates early next year.\" Elsewhere in the UK, Halifax revealed that house prices rose 2.7% in August to £204,674 month-on-month, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.5% increase and way above the 0.4% decline registered in the previous month. \nSeparately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said house prices in Britain would be 6% higher at the end of the year than they were in January. The average price for a house in the UK will increase by over £16,000 from the £272,000 level it was at in December 2014, RICS said. \nChina CPI, PPI figures China remained in focus as data showed the consumer price index increased 2% in August from a year earlier following a 1.6% rise a month earlier, beating forecasts for a 1.8% gain. The growth was driven by pork prices. \nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda , said the rise was \"not enough to ease the concerns of investors\" as producer prices fell much more than expected, \"increasing the risk of the economy experiencing deflation further down the road\". \nThe producer price index fell 5.9% in August more than the 5.6% decline expected and July's 5.4% drop. \nTrying to soothe concerns, Chinese premier Li Keqiang said China has the capacity to prevent its economy from falling apart and to succeed in its economic goals this year. \nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Beijing on Thursday, Li said China will allow foreign central banks to invest in the onshore currency market. China will establish the yuan's cross-border payment system before year-end, he added. \nUS data US wholesale inventories declined 0.1% month-on-month in July from a downwardly revised 0.7% growth in June, falling short of analysts' expectations for a 0.3% reading, figures from the Commerce Department showed. \nAccording to the Labor Department, US import prices slumped 1.8% month-on-month in August compared with a 0.9% decline in July and with analysts' expectations for a 1.6% drop. \nThe Labor Department said unemployment claims fell by 6,000 to 275,000 in the week to 5 September, down from the two-month of 282,000 recorded the prior week. \n\"At 275,000 to the 279,000 forecast the improvement wasn't vast, but was still notable enough to push the potential September rate hike to the forefront of investors' minds,\" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. \nCompanies Dixons Carphone (Stuttgart: CWB.SG - news ) rallied after the company reported an 8% like-for-like increase in first quarter revenue, driven by market share gains in mobile phones. \nWm Morrison slumped after posting 35% drop in underlying first half pre-tax profit as revenue fell on the back of price cuts. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) jumped after reporting a 7.1% gain in first-half pre-tax profit, with revenue up as the company sold more items at full price than it had expected. \nHome Retail Group declined after saying like-for-like sales at Argos fell 2.8% to £897m in the second quarter due to a decrease in sales of electrical goods driven by TVs , tablets and white goods. \nTullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) dipped after HSBC slashed its price target on the stock to 310p from 514p to reflect the bank's lowered oil price assumptions. \nBarratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) gained a day after reporting a 45% jump in profits to £565.5m, supported by improving mortgage availability and government support through its Help to Buy scheme. \nBHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) , Admiral and Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) were in the red as they went ex-dividend on Thursday. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,088.66 -0.70% FTSE 100 6,155.81 -1.18% FTSE 250 17,020.06 -0.78% FTSE 100 - Risers Barratt Developments (BDEV) 659.00p +3.29% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,018.00p +2.78% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 1,048.00p +2.44% Dixons Carphone (DC.) 427.50p +1.81% Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) (TW.) 202.10p +1.61% Next (EUREX: NXTI.EX - news ) (NXT) 7,775.00p +1.30% Persimmon (PSN) 2,124.00p +1.14% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 364.20p +0.89% Mondi (MNDI) 1,485.00p +0.88% InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) 2,433.00p +0.79% FTSE 100 - Fallers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 132.90p -7.84% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,060.00p -5.95% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,540.00p -4.58% Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) (STAN) 713.60p -4.09% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 717.00p -3.49% Tesco (TSCO) 185.55p -2.96% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 170.90p -2.84% HSBC Holdings (HKSE: 0005.HK - news ) (HSBA) 505.20p -2.64% Standard Life (SL.) 413.80p -2.59% Centrica (Amsterdam: CC8.AS - news ) (CNA) 232.20p -2.56% FTSE 250 - Risers Polymetal International (Other OTC: AUCOY - news ) (POLY) 524.50p +5.60% Telecom Plus (LSE: TEP.L - news ) (TEP) 1,117.00p +3.04% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 511.50p +2.50% BTG (Other OTC: BTGYY - news ) (BTG (LSE: BTG.L - news ) ) 661.00p +2.40% Phoenix Group Holdings (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (PHNX) 858.50p +2.39% Crest Nicholson Holdings (CRST) 591.00p +2.25% Close Brothers Group (CBG) 1,530.00p +1.86% Bellway (Other OTC: BLWYY - news ) (BWY) 2,585.00p +1.69% Redrow (RDW) 496.00p +1.66% Rank Group (RNK) 262.60p +1.63% FTSE 250 - Fallers Lonmin (LMI) 23.22p -8.47% Tullow Oil (TLW) 192.40p -7.37% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 84.70p -6.25% Petrofac Ltd.
