Kids everywhere will trudge their way through school gates, mourning the end of the long and wet summer holidays. Senior leadership teams everywhere will be preparing to unveil new policies aimed at improving student behaviour and attitudes to learning. Somewhere, the debate around whether mobiles should be allowed in classrooms will resurface. Given that more than 90% of today’s teenagers own one, it is an important question for teachers and one that won’t be going away any time soon.\nIn most schools, you will find mobile phones treated like contraband. They are items to be kept strictly out of any adult’s sightline. One glimpse could, after all, land the owner in a world of bother, often culminating in the phone’s confiscation. Because of this, students tend to view their teachers as alien inhabitants from another planet, oblivious to how practically everyone carries a phone 100% of the time. Teachers for our part are merely subscribing to a simple enough maxim, out of sight out of mind.\nRelated: How to survive your first year: a practical guide for new teachers\nYet a number of mainly fee-paying schools are promoting pupils’ use of mobiles within school and lessons. Headteacher Caroline Jordan , of Headington school, said: “Until recently we did not allow them in the classrooms. However, over the last year or so we have begun to harness the technology. We believe there is a place for smartphones or tablets in lessons. We want to be able to take advantage of this enormously powerful resource that most of our girls carry around with them.”\nThe proposal sounds unmanageable. In a class of 30, how do you ensure students are actually Googling the question you’ve posed? Who is to say they’re not quickly checking an update on Facebook, or Twitter or Whatsapp? Isn’t this essentially inviting unnecessary teacher scrutiny and surveillance? Yet, despite all this, I do understand the reasoning: choosing not to exploit the ubiquity of such devices appears technophobic and foolhardy. Indeed, as educators seek to be engaging and student-led, isn’t it best that we meet pupils where they are rather than where we want them to be? It is a persuasive line but one that falls apart on closer scrutiny.\nA recent large-scale study found that banning mobile phones improved exam results by 2%, even when gender and class had been accounted for. At first glance it seems an insignificant rise but the impact is equivalent to one extra week of school a year. The researchers from the London School of Economics centred their work on 91 schools and the exam results from 130,000 pupils since 2001. For those entitled to free school meals or with special educational needs the ban was doubly effective. Investigations such as this throw into question whether mobile phones could, in fact, intensify inequality.\nAllowing mobile phones would almost certainly increase cyberbullying . Then there is the needless work they would create for teachers dealing with pupils who have lost or had stolen a £180 phone they got for Christmas.\nAnd here is a much less-discussed problem, the pressure of keeping up appearances. In 2012 the department store John Lewis surveyed 2,000 parents , and found the average cost of equipping children for school was an eye-watering £550. Even if we dismiss that figure as far from average, John Lewis being the well-heeled person’s Argos and all, the high price of smartphones is hard to ignore. Costing an average of £270, it is shocking to think that by 2017, 96% of teenagers will own one .\nIt is inevitable that those with parents who can’t afford such amounts will desire them more intensely. Twenty years ago if you were wearing Hi-Tec (as I was) or Dunlop trainers, you were sure to be pitied if not blatantly ridiculed. I remember the playground oohs and aahs when someone arrived through the gates on a school day after their birthday/Christmas/Eid. A crowd would form and then there was a flurry of excited questions focusing on price. The excited reply from those who could boast they cost £50 or more is hard to forget. Back then, you existed at the pinnacle of cool if you wore Nike Air Max . Now the pressure will be more keenly felt, you can hear it now: “Is your phone just an iPhone 4?”\nToday, most of us can agree that school uniforms are a great social leveller. Standing out as the one with crap clothes is hard to do when everyone is dressed identically. The argument against mobile phones should be similar. Keep them out of schools. Allow children to learn in peace, free from the worry that the phone is one giant signal of their reduced means.", "external_links": ["http://www.emarketer.com/Article/UK-Teens-Far-Outshine-US-Counterparts-Smartphone-Usage/1009837", "http://schoolsimprovement.net/mobile-phones-are-useful-in-classroom-say-private-heads/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2386795/Average-child-schoolbag-worth-MORE-500-thanks-iPad-iPhones-uniform-books.html"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:59:41.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
