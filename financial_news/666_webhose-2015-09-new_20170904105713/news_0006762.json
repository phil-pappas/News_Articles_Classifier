The caller tells consumers that they are in trouble with the IRS and must call an out-of-state number for more information. \nPeople who respond to the calls are eventually asked for money and instructed to send hundreds of dollars using prepaid cards or money transfers. \nDeWine's office reports that most people have not sent money, though a few reported losing hundreds or thousands of dollars. \nThe attorney general's office says consumers should not respond to the calls, and Ohioans can contact his office for assistance. \nOnline: \nhttp://www.OhioAttorneyGeneral.gov \nThink your friends should see this?
