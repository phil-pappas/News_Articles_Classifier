Bloomberg by Greg Smith ​Investing in Chinese technology stocks may not be for the faint of heart. But investors taking a medium to longer-term view might be interested in Tencent, lesser known than Alibaba and listed on the Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.\nTencent dominates China's social networking space and online video games and is using some of its large cash hoard and robust free cash flows to invest in a range of companies, at home and abroad. It has also become one of the most active venture capitalists in China's technology sector.\nTencent is part of a triumvirate of internet companies collectively referred to as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent). These companies grew up dominating the areas of search, e-commerce/online marketplaces and social media/gaming respectively. Today they have all moved beyond their historical spheres of expertise and are investing aggressively in a range of other market opportunities.\nIn Tencent's case these range from investments in other messaging and video gaming companies to adjacent markets. Many appear to be oriented to help build out the ecosystem for Tencent's digital payments and advertising businesses in the so-called online-to-offline (O2O) market.\nRecently, one of China's biggest meal delivery start-ups, Ele.me.com (loosely translating to \"Are you hungry?\" or \"Hungry now?\"), announced that it had secured $US630 million ($884 million) in series F funding. Tencent and e-commerce company JD.com (of which Tencent owns 20 per cent) are said to have participated.\nTencent has already taken part in a $US350 million funding round in Ele.me in January, and cumulatively the food delivery company has raised more than $US1 billion, making it one of the most funded start-ups in China and globally. Ele.me has strong expansion plans, and already covers 260 Chinese cities, 300,000 restaurants and has 40 million users who spend an average of ¥60 million ($13 million) a day. Virtually all of its orders are sourced from the company's mobile apps.\nEle.me is part of the growing trend of online-to-offline businesses in China. These connect customers with real world services, generally via mobile devices.\nBy building out the O2O offerings on its messaging apps and platforms, Tencent can boost the income from its advertising and digital payment businesses. It is also a defensive move as it will keep users in its ecosystem rather than have them move to competitors such as Alibaba and Baidu.\n Tencent is a handsome cash generator and is well placed to invest in expanding its business interests. Despite more than doubling its capital expenditure year on year in the recent quarter, free cash flows were still over ¥5 billion . Net cash on hand at June 30 was about ¥21 billion.\nAlthough gaming remains the company's bread and butter, the advertising business is also on the up. Revenues last quarter roughly doubled year on year to almost ¥4 billion. Online advertising revenue was 17 per cent of the pie, up from about10 per cent last year.\nTencent shares do trade on more than 30 times 2014-15 earnings estimates, but this falls to 24 times in 2015-16.\nThe Chinese stock market has been volatile although it is worth pointing out that stocks on the Hang Seng (where Tencent is listed) have seen only around half the downside that mainland exchanges have from this year's highs. Mitigating risk factors include the fact the governance standards in Hong Kong have been generally higher, and multiples are lower than those on the Mainland. There is also a larger intuitional investor base in Hong Kong whereas retail investors have had heavier sway in Shanghai.\nThe company's dominant position in gaming in the rapidly growing Chinese market deserves a premium, in our view, and as highlighted above we think there is substantial untapped potential for the company in other areas.\nGreg Smith is head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.\nDisclosure: Interests associated with Fat Prophets declare a holding in Tencent.\nFor a free trial to Fat Prophets' daily market commentary please click here", "external_links": ["http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:55:49.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
