A full 42% said they were \"concerned\" or \"very concerned\" with losing their job.\nMaybe some of it has to do with the need for change after rising up the ladder. Senior managers (63%) were more likely to be contemplating an exit than middle managers (39%) and non-management employees (32%).\nOr maybe it just has to do with age and the fact that younger workers are still exploring life's opportunities. Millennials were the most likely (44%) to say they were seriously considering leaving versus 29% of those between the ages of 50 and 64.\nRelated: 20 jobs with the biggest pay raises\nRelated: Gig economy: A third of U.S. workers say they're free agents\nCNNMoney (New York) September 29, 2015: 1:08 PM ET", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150929120623-employee-leaving-780x439.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:20:19.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
