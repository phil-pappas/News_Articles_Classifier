As expected, there was a pullback rally and major indices in the Indian stock markets rose by more than 1.70%. A strengthening rupee, efforts to restart reforms and expectation of more rain, coupled with positive Asian market cues, propelled the market higher. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday met union ministers, corporate heads and economists to discuss global markets' turmoil sparked off by the Chinese economic slowdown and attendant opportunities for India. \"The general consensus (at the meeting) was that growth of emerging economies is all slowing down, except that we (India) are growing at 7%; so how can we take advantage of this opportunity (of the slowdown elsewhere)?\" Confederation of Indian Industry president Sumit Mazumdar told reporters after the meeting. \"Our economic foundations are strong; that is why we have not been affected by recent Chinese events. However, the prime minister told us that in this situation the industry also should show some risk-taking ability,\" he added. Analysts pointed out that government's consultative efforts to understand the problems of India Inc at the time of global markets turmoil and positive Asian market cues boosted the Indian equity markets. The market's upward trajectory is being supported by the domestic retail and institutional investors, who have been investing in stocks, while the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are shipping-out funds. In addition to the government's efforts, easing investors' anxiety was the Indian rupee gaining strength a day after falling to its lowest levels against the US dollar in over two years. The Indian rupee closed at 66.55 to a dollar, a gain of 27 paise from its previous close of 66.82 to a greenback. The rupee had touched an intra-day weakest point of 66.90. The other factor that boosted investor confidence was the clarification given by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) that it had not lowered its long period average rainfall projections.
