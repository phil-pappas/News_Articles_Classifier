Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan New limits are likely to be imposed on the capacity of unions to extract big pay deals on new projects after six Senate crossbenchers agreed to support elements of the Coalition's long-stalled workplace policy agenda.\nIn an apparent breakthrough for the government, Employment Minister Eric Abetz on Wednesday secured the support of key crossbenchers to split off four elements of the Fair Work Amendment Bill, including changes to the workplace bargaining rules for new projects.\nBut the government failed to get agreement on proposed changes to individual inflexibility arrangements and its long-desired attempt to impose restrictions on the capacity of union representatives to enter workplaces.\nâ€‹The most significant element backed by the crossbenchers related to so-called \"greenfield\" provisions, which the government claims have been used by unions to effectively veto the start of new projects.\nResource employers have long claimed unions have been able to extract \"exorbitant\" wages and conditions by refusing to sign up to greenfield agreements, which are struck between an employer and unions before any employees are engaged on a project.\nThe government had proposed that if negotiations for a greenfield agreement have not been completed within three months, a business would be able to take its proposed agreement to the Fair Work Commission for approval.\nHowever, under a change supported by the government, the crossbenchers proposed the timeframe be increased from three to six months. The amendment was jointly proposed by senators Nick Xenophon, Bob Day, Glenn Lazarus, John Madigan, Ricky Muir and Dio Wang.\nMore time to talk Senator Xenophon told Parliament that extending the timeframe from three to six months would give more opportunity to employers and unions to reach consensus.\nHe said employers had raised legitimate concerns about delays in the commencement of projects when there were prolonged negotiations with unions over wages.\nHe said the situation created a high level of uncertainty around labour costs and exposure to industrial action which could impede the ability of a business to secure finance for a project.\nThe crossbenchers also agreed to address the \"strike-first, talk-later\" loophole in the bargaining laws that potentially allows unions and workers to take industrial action without having had proper or meaningful talks with an employer.\nCrossbenchers also backed the requirement that an employer hear a request by an employee to extend their unpaid parental leave before being able to refuse the request.\nThe other supported change will ensure workers that are underpaid will receive interest on backpay held for them by the Fair Work Ombudsman.\nLabor and the Greens oppose the greenfield changes, as do unions which claim the government was \"rewarding its billionaire mining mates while denying workers the same rights to arbitration\".\nGreens workplace relations spokesman Adam Bandt said on Wednesday that the changes would mean employers would not have to bargain in good faith but stall for six months before getting access to the commission.\nPassage of the changes, which were being debated on Wednesday night, would represent a rare legislative victory for Senator Abetz, a close ally of Tony Abbott. Senator Abetz has been subject to wide speculation that he will lose his cabinet position after Mr Turnbull's elevation to Prime Minister.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:08:05.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
