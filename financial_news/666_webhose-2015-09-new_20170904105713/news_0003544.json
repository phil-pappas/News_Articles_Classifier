PUBLISHED: 12:53, Tue, Sep 8, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:58, Tue, Sep 8, 2015 PA•GETTY•VISMEDIA Costa Coffee is set to hike prices \nFTSE 100 company Whitbread also said it will have to increase productivity in order to pay workers a 70p an hour pay increase from next April. \nThe firm’s boss Andy Harrison was paid £4.55million in the year 2014/15 according to Whitbread's annual reports. His salary is 286 times the average worker of the company, far higher than the average ratio of a FTSE 100 company, according to the High Pay Centre. Chief executives of Britain's largest companies typically earn 183 times more than company employees, the non-party think tank found in recent analysis. Mr Harrison today said: \"We are developing plans to adopt the recently announced National Living Wage. \"We shall mitigate this substantial cost increase over time with a combination of productivity improvements, boosted by investment in systems and training, efficiency savings and some selective price increases.\" Related articles Osborne warned 'Living Wage' could be 'catastrophic' for... \nChancellor George Osborne unveiled the compulsory wage rise to £7.20 from April 2016 in this year's Budget. At the moment the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour, but campaigners say this is not enough top afford housing food and basic needs in today's society. However a number of business have baulked at the increase, which they say is unaffordable. \nManpower said the change had sent \"shockwaves\" through the labour market. FTSE 100 bosses this year banked a bumper average pay rise of 6.8 per cent , including a typical bonus of £1.12million, it was revealed yesterday.In the wider economy, latest official figures show annual pay growth running at 2.4 per cent. The gap between what bosses and the average employee earns has jumped since 2010 when it was 160 times the average worker, according to the High Pay Centre. Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \"Multi-million pound executive pay is over-rewarding those at the top and under-valuing the contribution of everyone else who works at a company. \"All these companies like Whitbread that are now complaining about having to pay a living wage have made huge profits for shareholders over the years and could afford to give the workforce a bit extra. \"It is obscene to continue to pay millions to those at the top while saying you need to raise prices to give the workforce a 70p increase.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:19:25.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
