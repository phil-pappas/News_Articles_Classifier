But truck operators say negative perceptions of the industry are making it difficult to compete for tech-savvy talent.\n“As a society we do not place a value on [this] type of profession,” said John Goralski, manager of fleet maintenance education for FedEx FDX -1.40 % Freight.\nMr. Goralski said the company is having a hard time filling open positions for technicians that despite efforts to recruit at community colleges around the country. Commercial vehicle technicians usually need a minimum of a two-year associate degree in diesel technology, and many companies are looking to hire people who have studied computer technology or engineering.\n“Class 8 tractors are very sophisticated right now,” said Mr. Goralski, who is in Orlando this week for the TMCSupertTech competition, where commercial vehicle technicians are competing for the title of “grand champion” in an event to promote the profession.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

There’s a minimum of eight computer systems right now on a Class 8 tractor,” he said. FedEx and other transportation and logistics companies are also researching robotics, automation and other advanced technologies for use in their trucks.\n“It’s no longer just a matter of being able to turn a wrench and remove and replace a part,” said Dough White, vice president of fleet maintenance for armored car service Dunbar Armored. “It’s the ability to operate computers and do things like efficiency diagnostics.” The company has 80 mechanics who specialize in armored vehicles.\nThe evolution of truck maintenance underscores how companies are looking for more understanding of technology throughout their ranks, from senior management to the maintenance yard. Industry experts say an understanding of technology is increasingly important throughout the supply chain.\nrelated stories\nTrucks Hauled Less Freight in August Companies Shift Needs for Supply Chain Talent The inability to attract young people with broad skill sets, experts say, makes it increasingly difficult to find the right talent. The American Trucking Associations, or ATA, estimates that an exodus of baby boomers from the industry will make it even harder to maintain truck fleets, and that companies will need to recruit 67,000 new technicians and 75,000 new diesel engine specialists by 2022.\n“The problem today is just getting the young people to want to come into the trade,” said Mr. White, of Dunbar. “It’s a shame because I think there’s fantastic opportunities for these young people….it’s not there yet, but in the very near future it would not be unheard of for a service technician to make $100,000 a year if he’s good at his trade.”\nBut the growing emphasis on information technology makes jobs primed for the next generation, industry officials say. “The folks coming behind today’s generation will have the skill set,” said Robert Braswell, technical director for ATA’s Technology and Maintenance Council. “We just have to make sure they know about the opportunities [in trucking] that are out there to excel and thrive.”\nWrite to Loretta Chao at loretta.chao@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:35:28.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
