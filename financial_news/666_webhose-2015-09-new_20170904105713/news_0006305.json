WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.4% in July, mainly because of lower imports such as cell phones and pharmaceutical products.\nExports rose for the first time in three months.\nThe trade deficit declined to a seasonally adjusted $41.9 billion in July from a revised $45.2 billion in the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a deficit of $41.8 billion.\nThe lower July trade deficit might bode well for gross domestic product in the third quarter: GDP is stronger when the deficit is smaller. The U.S. is forecast to grow 2.8% in the three months stretching from July to September, the latest MarketWatch forecast shows.\nExports rose 0.4% in July to $188.5 billion, led by stronger sales of U.S. autos as well as industrial equipment.\nYet despite the increase, exports were still 4.2% lower compared with one year ago. Large American companies such as manufacturers that rely heavily on sales outside the U.S. have been hurt by a stronger dollar and weak global growth. Foreign buyers can’t afford to spend as much on more expensive American-made goods\nThe U.S. trade gap with the European Union, for instance, hit a record in unadjusted terms in July. Europe is selling more products to the U.S. and exporting less compared with a year ago.\nU.S. imports, meanwhile, dropped 1.1% to $230.4 billion. Imports of cell phone and other electronics fell sharply, but it’s a volatile category prone to large shifts depending on when popular new phones are released.\nImports of drugs and other pharmaceutical products also sank.\nThe drop in imports probably stems from a slowdown in inventory building by companies that sell foreign-made goods in the U.S. Consumer spending and retail sales haven’t shown a similar dropoff.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/tradnewsrelease.htm"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:52:14.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
