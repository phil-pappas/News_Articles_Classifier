Imports of heavy Boscan declined by 4.5 percent to 34,600 bpd.\nPDVSA's unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, received 13 crude cargoes for its Corpus Christi and Lake Charles refineries, while U.S. oil firms Valero Energy, Phillips 66, Chevron Corp, and Motiva Enterprises received five to eight cargoes each.\nFor its part, the Chalmette refinery, sold in June by ExxonMobil and PDVSA to PBF Energy Inc, received four cargoes of Venezuelan crudes in August for an average of 73,500 bpd.\nPDVSA has also been storing and blending more crude in the Caribbean in recent months, so a larger number of cargoes of Venezuelan crudes are entering the United States from islands such as Curacao and Bonaire, instead of coming directly from Venezuelan ports.
