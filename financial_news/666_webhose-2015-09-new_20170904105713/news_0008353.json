The defections started after Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that the government’s debts were unsustainable.\nThe creditors had joined to structure and fund a debt package that they thought would help the cash-strapped U.S. territory bridge its budget gap before longer-term reform measures alleviated its deficit. The hedge funds, sometimes referred to as the \"ad hoc group,\" had been negotiating since at least February with Puerto Rico officials over the sale of $2.9 billion of new petroleum-tax bonds, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.\nStephanie Dodge , a spokeswoman for the group at Hamilton Place Strategies, declined to comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.hamiltonplacestrategies.com/people/stephanie-dodge\\"], "published": "2015-09-25T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:10:31.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
