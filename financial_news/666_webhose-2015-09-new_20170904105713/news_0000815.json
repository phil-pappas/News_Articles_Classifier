Ironically, three out of four investment advisors and newsletter-writing colleagues (many of which are market timers) polled by Investors Intelligence (II) were bearish at that time. Now, three out of four advisors and market timers are bearish again. This is remarkable. But does it mean you should follow their lead?\nThe S&P 500 lost 50% over 18 months before bottoming at 666 in March 2009.\nIn 2015, it only took a two-month, 12% drop to stir up the kind of fear and panic (amongst advisors and market timers) seen at the climax of the financial crisis. The chart below illustrates the current sentiment picture as it plots the S&P 500 against the percentage of bullish advisors polled by II.\nAdmittedly, this is only one of many sentiment gauges. Most others did not match the 2009 extremes, but a considerable number of sentiment gauges registered multi-year pessimism extremes.\nIs the meaning today as strongly contrarian (bullish) as it was in 2009?\nApples to oranges\nThe thing is 2009 and 2015 is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The end of a bear market was 2009. According to many analysts, 2015 is the end of a bull market. Obviously, the upside potential after a 220% rally is much smaller than before.\nNevertheless, the contrarian message of extreme bearishness should not be ignored.\nAccording to sentiment-analysis 101, extreme bearishness means that many investors who want to sell, already sold (the weak hands have been washed out). How many sellers are left to drive prices even lower?\nWho knows, but certainly fewer than a few weeks ago. With many sellers out of the way, it's easier for buyers to drive prices higher.\nI went out on a limb on Aug. 24, when I proposed via the Profit Radar Report that: \" Today's low (1,867 for the S&P 500) marks the end of wave 3. Next should be a choppy rebound. This means that today's VIX high (53.29) will likely stand for a while .\"\nBut sentiment is not the only driving force behind stocks. There are many other factors to consider, such as seasonality, supply and demand, and historical patterns.\nHistorically, stocks tend to retest the panic lows of an air-pocket decline (such as the one we saw in August) over the coming weeks. The last time this pattern played out was in 2011. Following a brisk decline in August of that year, stocks stabilized and staged a choppy rebound before another temporary relapse.\nThus far, the S&P of 2015 has performed very similarly to the S&P of 2011 “script” (including January–July trading range, and an August selloff, followed by weeks of sideways trading).\nSo, should we blindly follow market timers' recommendation to sell?\nI'm not. With our without test (or break) of the August panic low, there should be a good buying opportunity coming our way. Here's an S&P 500 comparison of 2011/2015 for those who want to be prepared.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.ispyetf.com/view_article.php?slug=S%26P_500_Analysis_%2013_The_Next_Turn&ID=674#hEOvGsGHHYdmKCPu.97"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:19:01.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
