Going ahead, weakening of rate will add to growth of credit,” Bhattacharya said.\nAndhra Bank was the first bank to cut its rates immediately by 0.25 per cent after RBI announced the monetary policy review.\nHere is Sunil Jain, Managing Editor of The Financial Express’ take on RBI rate cut:\nIn its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for the current fiscal, RBI cut benchmark repurchase (repo) rate by by 0.50 per cent to 6.75 per cent(lowest in four-and-half-years.)\nNaveen Kukreja, managing director, Paisabazaar.com, said, “The 50 basis points cut was much than the market was expecting. This time it is a large cut by the RBI, we believe banks will surely pass the cut to retail borrowers on immediate basis. I expect banks will pass the cut between 30 basis points to 40 basis points to borrowers.”\n“While banks’ base rates are expected to come down by additional 25-50 bps over next one year, on account of earlier rate cuts, the full benefit of current rate cut of 50 bps (in terms of cut in base rate by banks) will be dependent on RBI’s new guidelines on base rate, which are likely to be applicable from April 1, 2016,” Naresh Takkar, MD & group CEO, ICRA said.\n 29, 2015 3:54 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/SFP-bMNlZos"], "published": "2015-09-29T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:28:46.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
