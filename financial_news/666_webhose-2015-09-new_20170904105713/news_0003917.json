But volatility is likely to remain high as markets, like the Fed, will still have to confirm the U.S. economy is withstanding the adverse impact from the global economy,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nAnalysts and traders had been nearly evenly split on whether the Fed would raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade, though markets had priced in only a one-in-four chance of a hike.\nThe Fed’s fresh economic projections showed 13 of 17 policymakers still foresee raising rates at least once in 2015, down from 15 at the last forecast made in June.\nFinancial markets, which have constantly forecast a far slower pace of policy tightening than the Fed’s projections, were less convinced.\nInstruments such as federal fund futures &lt;0#FF:&gt; and overnight indexed swap are pricing in only about one in two chance of a rate hike by the end of year.\nFor the Fed to raise rates, Yellen said she wanted to see more improvement in the U.S. labour market and expressed concern over weak inflation.\nReferring to the global outlook, Yellen explicitly said the central bank was focusing on the slowdown in China and emerging markets, saying one key issue is whether there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown in China.\n“Yellen specifically mentioned China as a key influencer in their decision. This means China and its regulators are now in the driver’s seat and that isn’t a thought that brings down uncertainty – quite the contrary,” said Asia-Pacific managing director at risk management firm Axioma in Singapore.\nThe spectre of lingering uncertainty, some traders say, could be one reason risk asset markets were mixed.\n“Going into the Fed’s meeting, there were three scenarios. A rate hike and dovish outlook, no hike with hawkish comments and a no hike with dovish comments. People seem to think the result was no hike and dovish comments. Despite that, risk assets had a tepid reaction,” said a currency trader at a Japanese bank.\n“Looking at the way markets are reacting, risk assets could come under selling pressure again,” he added.\nAs the prospects of higher interest rates down the road had been a major attraction for the dollar, the U.S. currency was wobbly against many other currencies.\nThe dollar index against a basket of major currencies was little changed at 94.559 on Friday, having fallen to a three-week low of 94.360 on Thursday.\nThe euro jumped to a three-week high of $1.14415 on Thursday before easing to $1.1403 while the British pound also hit a three-week high of $1.5628 before retreating a tad to $1.5575.\nThe yen also edged up 120.12 to the dollar from Thursday’s low at 120.995.\nLonger-dated U.S. debt yields plunged, with the two-year note yield dropping to 0.682 percent, returning to its familiar range only a day after it hit a 4-1/2-year high of 0.819 percent.\nCommodity prices were relatively well-supported with U.S. crude futures last trading at $46.77 per barrel, down slightly from Thursday’s high of $47.71 but still up almost 5 percent on the week.\nGold hit a two-week high of $1,136 per ounce and last stood at $1,128.50.\n 18, 2015 7:04 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:24:32.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
