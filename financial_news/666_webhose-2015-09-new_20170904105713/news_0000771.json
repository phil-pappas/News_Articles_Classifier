Both public- and private-sector organizations face a tsunami of threats with no end in sight while citizens are left to deal with the repercussions of rampant data exposure—to their identities, credit, and reputations—for years. In light of the of the fact that breaches have become the third certainty in life, privacy experts will once again convene for the third annual Privacy XChange Forum to discuss privacy practices, data security, and breach lessons learned.\nHeld October 25-27 in Paradise Valley, Ariz., the conference is themed, “Cyber Security State of Affairs: From Controlled Chaos to Cyber Warfare.” Delegates will participate in conversations about emerging security threats, evolving fraud risks, and the legislative battles that will impact organizations and the people they serve. The conference is hosted by IDT911™ , a leading, B2B provider of identity and data risk management, resolution, and education services.\nKeynote speakers include Richard Clarke, former National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism for the United States, and Michelle Dennedy, vice president and chief privacy officer for Cisco Systems. Clarke is an internationally recognized cyber security and counter-terrorism expert having served the last three presidents as a senior White House Advisor. He has authored several books, including the #1 New York Times bestseller Against All Enemies about the war on terror.\nDennedy is an award-winning security expert with experience as chief privacy officer and chief data governance officer at McAfee/Intel Security and Oracle, respectively. She is also a leading thinker and speaker on new approaches and business justifications for soundly defined, transparent security and privacy policies and systems to protect global businesses. Dennedy founded The iDennedy Project and TheIdentityProject.com to help address privacy needs in sensitive populations. Session speakers span a wide variety of industries and hail from companies and organizations like Travelers Insurance, South Carolina Department of Revenue, Merchant Advisory Group, GigaOm Research, Internal Revenue Service, National Restaurant Association, Citizens Bank, Reuters, Georgia Tech, and several law firms in the United States and Canada.\nNotable speakers include ex-hacker Keren Elazari who will close day one of the Forum. She is a key member of the Israeli cyber security industry, with more than 14 years of experience working with Israeli security groups and government organizations, Big 4 firms and Fortune 500 companies. The Forum will also feature a tax-related identity theft victim and a real-life case story from an executive whose department was affected by a massive breach.\nSessions will be led in an intimate environment designed to encourage thoughtful dialogue, and include:\n Down the Foxhole: Learning from a real-life breach Breach Impact: From the first claim through resolution Swift Reaction: Understanding data breaches and PCI Refund Rejected: Understand the #1 identity theft crime How to Survive Cyberwar: a compass to navigate the stormy waters ahead\nThe conference is invitation-only and begins with a lake tour and golf tournament featuring golf legend Hale Irwin, one of the few golfers to win three U.S. Opens.

The event’s media sponsor is Third Certainty .\nConference Co-Chair, Founder of IDT911 and Credit.com, Author of Swiped, and Former New Jersey Director of Consumer Affairs Adam Levin said, “Cybercriminals are no longer looking to attack a certain, specific segment of business or the overall consumer population. They’re ravaging medical facilities, family offices, dating sites and other businesses for any and every shred of data they can get their hands on. In today’s digital landscape, threats are coming from all angles – even your colleague in the office or cubicle next to you could be a malicious or unwitting insider.\n“A little less conversation, a little more action for privacy is what’s needed,” Mr. Levin continues. “As the Privacy XChange Forum evolves to stay ahead of the curve, the agenda has introduced more tactical and practical sessions that will allow attendees to go back to their companies and demonstrate the value of what they’ve learned at the two day conference.”\nMr. Levin will be hosting a special advance book signing of his upcoming book Swiped at the conference on Monday, October 26 at 10:15 a.m.\nTo learn more about the conference, please visit http://www.privacyxchangeforum.com .\nAbout IDT911™\nIDT911™ is the leading provider of services that help businesses and their customers defend against data breaches and identity theft.
