Financial stocks, which make up more than a third of the TSX's weight, rose 1.7 percent.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 132.54 points, or 0.97 percent, at 13,779.44.\nThe rebound follows Friday's 1 percent loss following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to stand pat on raising U.S. interest rates amid concerns about global economic growth.\nManash Goswami, a portfolio manager at First Asset Investment Management Inc, said the Fed's dovish tone may have encouraged investors to buy into higher-yielding stocks such as Manulife Financial Corp and Enbridge Inc.\nEnbridge was the index's most influential gainer, up 3.5 percent at C$52.89, while Manulife added 3.2 percent to C$21.08.\nEnergy stocks gained 1.7 percent as crude rose following U.S. drilling data showing slower activity.\n\"A lot of what's going to happen in Canada is going to be driven by commodities, sentiment and reality,\" Goswami said.\n\"I'm not bullish,\" he said of the energy sector. \"You have to be very selective.\"\nCanadian banks, which have a significant stake in the country's oil and gas industry, have often seen their fortunes move in tandem with crude prices in recent months.\nToronto-Dominion Bank was among the gainers carrying the most weight, rising 1.8 percent to C$52.60.\nCanadian National Railway climbed 2.7 percent to C$76.71. The overall industrials group, which is edging closer to the materials group in sector weight, climbed 1.6 percent.\nOffsetting the gains was a 1.9 percent loss in the materials sector, home to Canada's non-energy resource companies.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones 175 to 61, for a 2.9-to-1 ratio on the upside.\n\"It's just a bit of a recovery. The market generally still wants to go down for a while,\" said Douglas Davis, chief executive officer at Davis-Rea. \"I think it will be very volatile until mid-October. It's just always seasonally weak through here.\" (Additional reporting by Solarina Ho ; Editing by James Dalgleish and Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:52:35.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
