Pat Scala Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Indigenous leader Warren Mundine, has launched an extraordinary attack on the Labor campaign against the China free trade deal, saying it s \"bigoted\" and makes him \"deeply angry\".\nLabor has sparked a political row by demanding safeguards, such as requiring Chinese companies to test the local job market on big projects, are enshrined in law without changing the actual text of the FTA – something the government is resisting.\nMr Mundine, a former Labor Party president, said Labor is \"losing its way\" in demanding these changes as the deal was \"not this open slather of some sort of Chinese invasion\", and the campaign is not unlike the party's role in the White Australia policy.\n\"Opposition to non-white workers was badged as economic policy but rooted in xenophobia. Australia is different now, but the xenophobia sometimes resurfaces ... [and] we're seeing it again today,\" he said.\nMr Mundine joins a raft of former and sitting Labor leaders – such as Bob Hawke, Bob Carr, Daniel Andrews, Jay Weatherill, Andrew Barr and Luke Foley – who have pushed the party to not put the deal at risk.\n\"As a former president of the Labor Party I am angry about it, and I am not the only one. You've seen former prime ministers of the Labor party, you've seen premiers ... all telling the Labor Party to get on with it,\" he said.\nLabor has argued that the deal waters down laws by effectively waiving labour market testing on projects worth over $150 million, and removing mandatory skills assessments for some trades.\n'Vicious' lies Mr Mundine said Labor and union arguments that the deal cuts down workplace and safety standards are \"vicious\" lies as any company operating in Australia has to comply with the law.\n\"The current labour market testing regime will continue to apply post-ChAFTA ... they still have to meet the migration laws, they still have to meet the 457 regulations.\n\"The provisions Quote: d to 'evidence' union claims are all subject to overriding provisions that employers, workers and visa applications must comply with Australian laws,\" he said, such at those at the state and territory level.\nMr Mundine said if the deal fails \"it will be an act of vandalism\" and it was \"embarrassing watching Labor dance around why they oppose ChAFTA when they didn't oppose similar deals with other countries\".\nBut he conceded that the Coalition had issues getting their message through on the FTA in the face of a powerful CFMEU ad campaign.\nOn Wednesday, Trade Minister Andrew Robb, acknowledged this issue , saying he does not underestimate the power of advertising.\nMr Mundine said the fact that Labor trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, who suffered racism as a child, was leading the party's charge, did not pierce his argument, saying Africans supported Ian Smith's government in the former Rhodesia.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/is-the-china-fta-in-the-national-interest-20150811-giwg8k.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://twitter.com/ColinJBettles/status/641499898328670208"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:51:18.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
