James McCormick by Daniel Butler and Teigen Marriott Under British law, an Australian superannuation fund must satisfy the requirements of a qualified recognised overseas pension scheme (QROPS) to be able to receive a transfer of funds from a British pension scheme. Where the superannuation fund has been recognised by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to comply with such requirements, the superannuation fund is placed on the ROPS list.\nOn April 6, 2015, new British laws were introduced requiring, among other things, that overseas pension schemes – such as Australian superannuation funds – had to comply with the pension age test. Broadly, this test prohibits a payment to a member under 55 years old unless he or she meets the British definition of \"ill health\", which is similar but stricter than the Australian definition of \"permanent incapacity\" in regulation 1.03C of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations (SISR).\nGiven the broad range of cashing events that can be utilised prior to 55 years of age under the SISR, the HMRC decided that Australian superannuation funds could not comply with the British laws. As such, all Australian superannuation funds (including SMSFs) were removed from the ROPS list in early July 2015 apart from a single public sector fund.\nThis decision has frustrated many. DBA Lawyers and many others in the sector have been working on a solution for SMSFs, including lodging a submission with the HMRC to outline how SMSFs can comply with the new QROPS rules.\nThose pushing for change, however, received a huge boost following the addition of an Australian SMSF to the ROPS list on September 1, 2015, as it demonstrated that a newly established SMSF could satisfy the new QROPS rules where the fund's membership was restricted to persons who had already attained 55 years or more.\nThe successful fund had its deed updated with a special restricted deed of variation, where membership is restricted to those who have attained 55 years or more. If your SMSF has members who are younger than 55 years of age, they will need to exit the fund if you wish to be added to the ROPS list. We are continuing to seek HMRC approval regarding the ability for SMSFs with members under the age of 55 to qualify as a QROPS. We have no certainty on when this approval may eventuate.\nWhere an SMSF only has members who have attained 55 years or more, that need to effect a British pension transfer, then provided they have an appropriate SMSF deed and complete the requisite British forms, they should also qualify and be recognised on the ROPS list whether the fund is newly established or a variation of an existing SMSF. This is welcome relief for many who have had their British pension transfers on hold.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:00:33.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
