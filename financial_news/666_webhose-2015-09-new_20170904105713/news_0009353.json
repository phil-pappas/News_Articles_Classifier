Trai will soon ask telecom companies to disclose information related to their services which would be publicised so that customers are aware of capacity of their operator and enable them to choose their service provider.\n“First of all they have to disclose this information to us. Trai has the authority to call for information relating to service, they will provide the information, which we will publish so ultimately public will get the information,” Trai chairman R.S. Sharma said. He said Trai is preparing a status or information paper which gives a detailed analysis of the extent of call drops especially in two cities of Delhi and Mumbai on the basis of data available and the regulator will publish it.\n“So essentially that will bring out not only the extent of call drops, it will also bring out the potential causes of call drops and therefore the operators what the operators should do will come out of that,” Sharma added. The move is part of the department of telecom’s (DoT) efforts to curb the menace of call drops and also let people to make a concerted decision while choosing a operator.\nModi had last week voiced serious concern over the menace of call drops and asked officials concerned to take urgent steps to address it as it affects the common people. The Prime Minister is believed to have told telecom secretary Rakesh Garg personally that people get irritated due to call drops and “curse the government” and this needs to be addressed on war-footing, people familiar with the matter said. Modi is worried that the problem may even affect the data services in the future.\nThe problem of call drops has become rather serious in the last 3-4 months and DoT has asked the telecom operators last week fix it speedily. The operators have sought 30-45 days to address it. DoT has already warned that if the operators fail to address the problem, the government has the option of levying penalty under the licence conditions. According to people familiar with the matter, Prasad, in a recent internal DoT meeting, said that there was lack of investment by operators to enhance their networks which was the main reason for call drops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:55:03.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
