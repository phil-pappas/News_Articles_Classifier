Chris Goodney That's right, frustrations.\nTerrible battery I'm on to only my fourth day of using the iPhone 6s, and already it's driving me nuts. How can a phone that is so utterly brilliant in so many respects have such an utterly mediocre battery life? The phone was dead by 3pm yesterday after a night on the charger, and it was dead by 7pm the day before that.\nAdmittedly, I've been driving it pretty hard because I'm reviewing it, but I review dozens of phones a year the same way and none of them are dead that fast.\nGraphic 3pm! Grrrr! Where is some bubble wrap when you need to pop something?\nI wouldn't care, except for the fact that when it's got a charge the iPhone 6s is the best smartphone I have ever used. Together with the iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6s has got a new feature known as 3D Touch that creates a new type of gesture for touch devices, one in which you get different outcomes depending on how hard you press the screen.\nAnd 3D Touch is brilliant .\n3D Touch excels Press lightly on the bubble in my imaginary bubble game, and it merely squeaks. Press harder and it squashes. Press all the way and it pops. It could even feel like a pop, because Apple has incorporated haptic feedback into 3D Touch, which makes the iPhone vibrate differently depending on the hardness of the press.\n3D Touch is in only a few apps, most written by Apple, but I can tell it's going to change the way we use devices, because after just two days it changed the way I used devices. On Sunday I found myself hard-pressing on my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet, and wondering momentarily why it wasn't working.\nHaving used 3D Touch for only a few days, I fear there is no going back to other phones: something I'm going to rue every 8pm when the phone is out of juice.\nProbably the best example of 3D Touch is in Apple's email app. When you're in your email inbox, a gentle press on an email header causes all the other headers to de-focus, so you know you're pressing on the right one.\nPress a little harder and a preview of the email pops up and stays there until you either take your finger off the screen, which closes the preview, or you press even harder, which fully opens the email. When in preview mode you can even slide your finger for additional functions: a swipe to the right marks it as read, a swipe to the left archives it, and a swipe upwards exposes other options such as Reply, Forward and Move Message.\nBest phone email experience By far, it's the best email experience I've had on a phone. 3D Touch makes it easy to power through dozens of emails quickly, just with your thumb. If only you could mark emails as read just by previewing them, without the need for that extra swipe, it would be perfect. Die, emails, die!\nApple calls that first, preview gesture a \"peek\" and the harder press a \"pop\", which might have been what made me think of bubble wrap. But Apple's pop is nowhere near as satisfying as the pop I have in mind. If emails could make a loud popping sound when you delete them, that would be doubly perfect.\nThe only thing I find more satisfying than popping bubble wrap is deleting emails so I never have to look at them again.\nHowever, 3D Touch, brilliant as it is, has come at a cost.\nTo squeeze in the new \"Taptic Engine\" haptic feedback system used by 3D Touch , Apple has apparently had to shrink the phone's battery slightly. Apple says it has made up for that smaller battery with improved efficiencies elsewhere, meaning you're no worse off with an iPhone 6s than you were with an iPhone 6, but that misses the point.\nThe iPhone 6s has got the best camera of any phone we've ever reviewed (equal best with Samsung's Galaxy S6 and Note 5, I should say), it's got the best user experience on the market, it's one of the fastest phones ever released (you should see our benchmarks), its new fingerprint scanner is the fastest we've ever seen (so fast that turning on and unlocking the iPhone are now, incredibly, one and the same thing), and it's one of the best-looking phones there is, with the best ecosystem of apps and accessories.\nSo why, oh why, can't the iPhone 6s have an industry-leading battery life too? It costs enough.\nThe battery on the iPhone 6s should be bigger, not smaller. The iPhone 6s is slightly heavier than the iPhone 6, again because of the 3D Touch technology, and it's better for it.\nThe extra weight, while only barely noticeable, makes the iPhone 6s feel ever so slightly better in the hand in my opinion. An extra half millimetre of thickness to accommodate a bigger battery wouldn't have hurt, and it might even have improved the feel of the phone, just like the extra weight did.\nGrrr!\nThat's the irony of my iPhone 6s bubble wrap game. When I most need it, it won't be working.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:10:53.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
