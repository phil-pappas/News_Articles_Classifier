At his shop, they “aren’t looking for a bear market, just a deeper correction,” he said in a note late Wednesday.\nIn other words, it’s just a “nervous zone before any policy actions and the release of third-quarter earnings,” as Alan Gayle at Ridgeworth Investments has put it , according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nThe Federal Reserve “didn’t hike interest rates, but they did help elevate uncertainty and volatility,” Stovall said. “Going forward, we see the market trending lower to retest the August 25 closing low and possibly move even lower,” he added. The equity strategist said a “less-likely scenario” is “some backing and filling before moving higher,” but either way, his team at S&P Capital IQ feels “no sense of urgency to buy these near-term dips.”\nFed chief Janet Yellen could help the market get out of its awkward spot with a speech today at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

He points out inflation is still below the Fed’s target, and Yellen’s speech is titled “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy” — “she addresses the key topic!”\nOr Yellen simply might add to the uncertain mood, in which case it may not be until at least Oct. 8, when Alcoa AA, -3.16% kicks off the earnings season , that traders can hope to begin climbing out of that “nervous zone.” MarketWatch has warned that investors shouldn’t expect Yellen to offer clues on rate-hike timing .\nWhile U.S. stocks and the Fed look to be stuck in a rut (the Fed “ needs to get unstuck ,” argues AEI’s Edward Pinto over at RealClearMarkets), the call of the day sees a bullish shift for hard-hit Chinese equities. On the other hand, today’s chart provides an unflattering view of China’s Shanghai Composite, with a touch of dark humor.\nKey market gauges S&P futures ESZ5, -0.81% and Dow futures YMZ5, -0.86% are pointing to a lower open , and European stocks SXXP, -1.46% are also wrapped in red.
