Use the market turmoil to cut your capital gains tax bill. Richard Dyson explains \nThe silver lining in rapidly falling share prices is the chance to wipe out a capital gains tax liability. \nCapital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) gains tax (CGT) is a problem for investors whose shares are held outside Isas, and into that category fall many older savers, especially those inheriting shares from late spouses. \nA widow whose husband bought shares in the Eighties, for instance, would have to pay CGT on the full gain on those shares whenever she sells them. You can see how big the sums might be. \nLabour overhauled capital gains tax when, in 2008, it scrapped taper relief which reduced the taxable gain according to the length you’d owned the asset and, instead, introduced a flat 18pc tax on gains. \nThe previous “tapering” system was helpful in that it rewarded longer-term investors, such as our widow, with a lower tax bill. \nUnfortunately the Tories didn’t undo this retrograde step. In fact, their main change to CGT has been to make it bite harder: from the year 2010-11, the capital gains tax rate payable by higher- and additional-rate taxpayers jumped from 18pc to 28pc. \nThat fact, plus welcome share price growth in recent years, have given many a horrible CGT headache. \n• Capital gains tax on homes - it's only a matter of time \nTo limit your liability there is no shortcut to the hard work of monitoring your portfolio closely and every year crystallising gains up to the maximum CGT-free limit (£11,100 for this tax year). \nWhen, as now, shares suddenly plunge in value you can sell more while remaining within your annual CGT allowance. And it doesn’t mean you can’t continue to own the same investments: you could sell your directly held shares or funds then immediately repurchase them through your Isa at the same or similar price. Or, if you’re married, your spouse could repurchase them in his or her name immediately. You cannot, though, repurchase them directly yourself within 30 calendar days if you want their disposal to count for tax purposes. \nIf you crystallise actual losses these can be carried forward indefinitely to set against any future gains, including those arising on property and other assets. \nBut don’t underestimate the work involved. Complexities arise where you’re not selling your entire holding of one investment, or where you bought the same investment in many separate tranches. \nIf you’re doing this without an accountant’s help, prepare for a long afternoon with your calculator. \n- richard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T12:53:02.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
