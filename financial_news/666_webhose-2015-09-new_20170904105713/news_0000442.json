Despite ongoing consternation among investors - both institutional and private - about the possibility of further falls in the main indexes, the firm believes that the worst of the declines are over. Fox Capital Partners says it is using the lull in IPO activity to focus on developing its underwriting business despite decidedly gloomy sentiment.\"The fact that IPOs are still banned by the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) is largely beside the point. We're forward-looking and China's economy is nowhere near collapse so it's just a matter of time before the authorities lift the ban and we can get back to the business of helping these incredibly innovative companies raise the funds they need to develop the technologies we'll be using tomorrow,\" said Cheng-Gong Tay, technology strategist at Fox Capital Partners.As one of a raft of measures introduced to calm panic selling that saw both the Shenzhen and Shanghai Composite exchanges shed as much as 40% of their value in mid-June, the CSRC banned new IPOs in a bid to increase market liquidity. Prior to the ban, Chinese stocks had appreciated rapidly thanks to an influx of retail investors and a surge in margin trading.Fox Capital Partners says it is not limiting its efforts in the IPO market to technology. \"We are interested in renewable and sustainable energy as well as biotechnology companies and we believe there will be sufficient demand in the market for them especially when the world's central banks begin adding more stimulus to boost their economies,\" said Tay.About Fox Capital PartnersFox Capital Partners is a successful, independent investment management practice established in China and headquartered in Shenzhen.
