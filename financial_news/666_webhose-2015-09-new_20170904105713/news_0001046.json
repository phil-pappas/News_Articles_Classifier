Brendan McAtamney, the current chief operating officer, will be his succesor. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has been my privilege to lead this company for 15 exciting years,” added Mr Fitzgerald. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in UDG Healthcare (LSE: UDG.L - news ) jumped 33p higher, or 8pc, to 526p in early trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:58:33.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
