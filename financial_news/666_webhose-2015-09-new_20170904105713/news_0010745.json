The cliff-edge fall came after the market had already been drifting downwards. \nBut that was nothing compared with the fate of one of my bigger holdings. KWG Property, a Hong Kong company that develops residential property in China, fell with the rest of the Chinese market to bring its total decline since early June to 44pc. \nI have been through a number of sudden drops in shares over the years but my stomach still churned. A sense of doom and fear hovered over me. I was in Canada and jet-lagged at the time, which made the whole thing like a bad dream. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) seemed a bit like the crash of 1987, when a fall in one stock market sparked off a drop by the next one and so on around the globe in a downward spiral. I decided to raise some cash last week, just in case this happened again. I sold up to a quarter of my shares in Barratt, the housebuilder, at 595p and in Enterprise Inns (LSE: ETI.L - news ) , the pub owner, at 116p, not because I have lost faith in either of them but because they are easy to deal in. \nI also sold a few shares in REA Holdings at 265p and Griffin Mining at 31.1p since the prices of the commodities they produce palm oil and zinc respectively are both weak at present. I also sold some shares in Singapore-listed Kingsmen Creative, which fits out exhibitions and shops, after some recent disappointing figures. \nIt sounds like a lot of selling but actually it was quite modest. It brought the cash in my portfolio up from about 1.5pc to 5pc of the total. \n• James Bartholomew: 'Why I won't be buying bonds until 2017' \n• James Bartholomew: 'Why I can't resist eurozone shares any longer' \nNeedless to say, shares rallied strongly soon afterwards. By Thursday last week my dealing looked pretty stupid. Most of the shares I had sold had gone higher, especially Barratt, which seemed to be celebrating my disposal. \nAt least there was one little burst of good news: my medium-size holding in Betfair, an online betting company, jumped by about a fifth when it announced good figures and a merger with Paddy Power (LSE: PAP.L - news ) . \nMeanwhile, I managed to get hold of some recent research on KWG Property (HKSE: 1813-OL.HK - news ) which was surprisingly encouraging. \nThe headlines about the Chinese economy are all about slowing growth and falling consumption of commodities. But it is a complex place with different things going on in different sectors and regions. KWG is apparently still successfully selling apartments in Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities. So I put in an order to buy another chunk of the shares. Unfortunately I was too late. The shares rallied above my limit and Stocktrade, which was acting for me, told me that there had been 12 broker buy notes recommending the stock. \nBut the shares fell back on Monday and I got some at my limit price of HK$4.95, at which level the prospective yield is a whopping 8.3pc. \nThis is probably a good moment to remind people that I do not recommend shares. I only report what I have done. My tactics and risk-taking would be considered too dangerous by most advisers. \nWhat now? Black Monday was a minor earthquake. It is typical for earthquakes to be followed by more of them, or at least by aftershocks, and we have already had some. I expect continued volatility. \nI also think it will take time for the FTSE 100 index to rise past 6600, the approximate level it was at before the drop. That is because every time the index gets close to that level, people will remember what happened last month. \nAt the same time, I remain a long-term bull. If markets decline any further, interest rates are unlikely to rise. Meanwhile, shares are cheap compared with government bonds and the fall in commodity prices is actually good for industrial and service economies such as ours. \nThe priority for me now is to try to make sure that I have shares that are good value. The bull market is becoming mature, and when it eventually turns I don’t want to be left with previously fashionable shares priced at high multiples of their likely earnings. That is one reason why I keep looking for shares around the world, not just in Britain. Although British shares are not expensive, they are not cheap either. \nTo my surprise I find that my portfolio is still well up this year. Thank goodness I sold out of the mining giants Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) earlier this year. Their falls have been just horrible. \n• More investing ideas at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:29:30.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
