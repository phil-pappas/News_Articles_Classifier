Either do something or just kick it into the long grass,\" he told AAP from Perth, where he begins a series of events across the country. \nHowever, the big difference this time around is that the GST is included in the discussion, unlike the Henry tax review that was commissioned by Labor. \n\"It's kind of a step forward,\" Mr Roy-Chowdhury said. \nModelling by Deloitte Access Economics shows $20-$30 billion could be raised by either raising the GST to 15 per cent from 10 per cent or increasing it to 12.5 per cent and broadening the base to include fresh food. \n\"That's big bucks,\" Deloitte economist Chris Richardson told ABC radio. \nBut shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh believes the GST is not as efficient as is usually claimed and is one of the most inequitable taxes that hurt low income households. \nDeloitte argues the GST can be raised without harming low-income earners through increased pensions and benefits and tweaks to personal tax system. \nMr Roy-Chowdhury says a GST increase should be used to make a flatter tax system and then there wouldn't be the need for all of the present system's concessions that adds to its complexity. \nThe Deloitte report also advocated cutting the company tax rate as a way to boost investment, wages and living standards, even if the budget remained in deficit. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann agreed there was \"too heavy a reliance\" on personal and company taxes. \nThe report tries to bust some of the myths and misconceptions surrounding the tax debate. \n\"A key barrier to reform has been the myth tax reform cannot boost jobs and growth without hurting the poor,\" Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry boss Kate Carnell said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:00:24.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
