It was rescheduled for Thursday, 2.30pm. \n\"Until then the status quo remains,\" Sossion said, adding that they would only consider suspending the strike after their points of order are addressed on Thursday. \nThe parties are also scheduled to appear before the Court of Appeal on Tuesday. This is after KNUT applied for an adjournment of the September 22 hearing. \nActing for KNUT, lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi said they needed to re-evaluate if they would continue to participate in the appeal filed by their employer, the Teachers Service Commission, challenging the 50 to 60 percent pay increase awarded to public school teachers by Industrial Court Justice Nduma Nderi. \nWhen applying for the adjournment, Abdullahi said KNUT was concerned that the Executive's, \"can't pay, won't pay,\" rhetoric may have interfered with the independence of the bench.
