Fitch rates all of the commonwealth's debt CC, which is one notch above D, meaning the rating agency thinks that default of some kind appears probable.\nAs restructuring plans become clearer, Fitch anticipates ratings downgrades for different securities to 'C'.\nGarcia Padilla said in June that the island's debt, totaling $72 billion, was unpayable and required restructuring.\nIn addition to local reform measures, like cuts to the University of Puerto Rico, the plan also asks the federal government for help, including an exemption from a shipping law and tax legislation that would promote corporate growth.\n\"In our view, political challenges to action at the federal level and in the commonwealth's legislature are likely and the outcome is uncertain,\" Fitch said.\nMoody's Investors Service said that the commonwealth's plan could further hurt recovery rates, and that the island's debt may face an additional downgrade. Following the release of the plan, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its rating on Puerto Rico's tax-backed debt to CC from CCC-.
