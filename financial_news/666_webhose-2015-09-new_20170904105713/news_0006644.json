The deals come amid a wave of partnerships between digital media upstarts and traditional media giants seeking to attract younger audiences that have migrated online.\n“We have been placing many bets on digital video and are attracted by companies with strong content leadership, large, well-defined audiences and strong potential for profitability and Complex checks all those boxes in a strong way,” said Neeraj Khemlani, co-president of Hearst entertainment and syndication.\nPhoto: Complex For Complex, the partnership offers the possibility of feeding its content into the far more lucrative distribution networks Hearst has a stake in through its part-ownership of cable networks like A&E, Lifetime, the History Channel and ESPN as well as 30 local television stations around the U.S.\n“As we look towards further expansion in digital and linear entertainment, Complex will have access to extensive expertise, scale and partnerships that only a global media company like Hearst could offer,” said Complex Chief Executive Rich Antoniello.\nOfficials with both companies declined to discuss valuation.\nMessrs. Antoniello and Ecko said they planned to use the investment to simply increase Complex’s video output. Overall traffic to Complex’s array of sites – which includes AllHipHop.com, StupidDope.com and BallerMindFrame.com – was 50.2 million in August, up 28% over a year earlier, according to comScore Inc. Of that, 54% is under the age of 34, a demographic sought after by marketers.\nMr. Antoniello said Complex had a 30% increase in gross sales in the past year, but declined to say whether the company is profitable. The company now employs 330 people with offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Chicago and San Francisco.\nComplex is a relative veteran in the online media space, having started as a men’s fashion magazine in 2002 and eventually growing into an array of more than 100 websites focusing on hip-hop, sneaker and skateboarding culture. Since receiving a $25 million investment from Iconix Brand Group in late 2013, the company has focused intensively on video, creating 13 original series and a news channel as well as striking ad deals with McDonald’s Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Adidas AG and the Marine Corps, among others.\nEarlier this year, Complex announced that film director Spike Lee was coming on board to help advise on video projects and branded content advertising campaigns.\nWith Hearst’s investment, the company has taken in $52 million in funding to date.\nLast year, Hearst and Disney, with which it co-owns A+E Networks, invested $250 million in Vice Media, which valued the edgy digital media company at $2.5 billion. In December Hearst bought a 25% stake in AwesomenessTV for $81.25 million, valuing it at $325 million. Hearst’s venture capital arm was also an early investor in BuzzFeed, contributing to several of its fundraising rounds.\nWrite to Lukas I.
