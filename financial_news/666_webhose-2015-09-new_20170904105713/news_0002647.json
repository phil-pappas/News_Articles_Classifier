He's not.\" \nOne notable exclusion from New York's wealthiest is William Erbey, whose mortgage financier, Ocwen Financial , was probed by New York state investigators for allegations including conflicts of interest. \nMr. Erbey, who stepped down as executive chairman, saw his personal fortune plummet after Ocwen's stock fell 76%, according to Forbes .
