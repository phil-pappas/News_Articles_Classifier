Creating convenience and consistency will go a long way, as both are major drivers in the sector\" \nAccording to a combined report by eTrack, eMarketer and Alexa.com released earlier this year, revenue generated through online hotel bookings has grown by more than 73 per cent in the last five years. The report goes on to place the percentage number of online travel reservations at 57 per cent while noting that a remarkable 65 per cent of travelers will make same day hotel reservations via smartphones. \nThe report puts the total annual number of hotel bookings made on the internet at 148.3 million with corresponding increase in other aspects such as online car rentals, travel research and travel review. It is therefore important for suppliers and related operators to adapt, evolve and grow to meet global expectations by an emerging digital-savvy market. This should take major consideration of attributes such as travel and hotel bookings, virtual tours, content and provision of online payments. \nCommenting on the partnership, John Buckley the CEO for Safarilink observed that, \"today's traveller prefers an all-round operator with a keen interest on value added services. Both Jovago and SafariLink will work in sync to ensure a seamless, convenient and cost-saving process for the customer\" \nThis, as Fazal noted in conclusion is the basis of conforming the industry and repositioning for a future guided by eCommerce.
