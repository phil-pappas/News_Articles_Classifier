Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith The fact that new Myer boss Richard Umbers' is investing $600 million in a company with only a market capitalisation of only $700 million highlights the extent of the repair job needed to turn the 115-year-old department store group around.\nA deeply discounted capital raising is the first step in what will be a tough 12 months for the retailer as it embarks on a five-year plan to reverse a 20-year slide in sales and return the company to profit growth.\nUmbers is targeting average sales growth of more than 3 per cent between 2016 and 2020 and wants earnings growth to outstrip sales growth by 2017.\nIt's an ambitious target given the company has left it late to overhaul the strategy following years of underinvestment.\nThe scale of Umbers' plans, however, indicates the board is serious about firing a rocket under the company, something that should have happened a year earlier.\nIt is not going to be cheap getting there.\nUmbers will invest $480 million in capital to improve productivity and service, invest in online, better utilise customer data and improve the product mix over the next five years. He estimates it will cost another $120 million to implement the plan.\nAs expected, he is killing off the dream of his predecessor, Bernie Brookes, of a 100-store network by winding back the store footprint. The strategy includes reallocating 41,000 square metres of total space from underperforming categories.\n There are also opportunities for Umbers to take the knife to the supply chain infrastructure which was established with a lot more stores in mind than the existing 67.\nService has been a controversial issue for Myer but Umbers hopes to improve the customer experience by better utilising rosters, staff training and making the most of the talent he has.\nHe will invest $100 million into the online offering and make better use of the data it collects form its more than 5 million MYER one loyalty card members to work out what shoppers really want.\nThe tie-up with UK fashion brand TopShop is an example of the kind of shake-up in Myer's product mix under the new management team. Myer is taking a 25 per cent stake in the TopShop Australian franchise and rolling out its products in 20 stores. The margins it can make on Topshop are a lot higher than many existing brands and TopShop needs the scale Myer can give it as it has not had a lot of success in Australia so far.\nMyer is also raising $221 million in a rights issue priced at 94Â¢ a share, which is a significant discount to the company's last trading price of $1.21. The market had already factored in a capital raising and the weak sales results in the company's 21.3 per cent fall in annual earnings announced Tuesday.\nUmbers has been quietly working on the plan since assembling his new senior management team. There was never any doubt the former British Army officer was going to have to clear the decks.\nMyer, which was floated by private equity in 2009 at $4.10, is in poor shape. But as South Africa's Woolworths has demonstrated with David Jones, new management can be the impetus for a turnaround.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-01T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:22:38.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
