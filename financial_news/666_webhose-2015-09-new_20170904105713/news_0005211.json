Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Bill Shorten says Tony Abbott's demise means the election will no longer be about the past versus the future but about competing visions of the future.\n\"I want the next election to be a battle of ideas, a referendum on the future,' the Opposition Leader declared on Monday. \"A choice as to who has the best set of policies to advance Australia beyond the mining boom.\"\nMalcolm Turnbull will not only agree with this, he will be determined to ensure the Coalition is now able to lead that choice and win that battle.\nThe problem for Shorten is that the Prime Minister will be equally determined to depict Labor as the party that is actually still stuck in the past.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten met the Ashes winning Australian Women's Cricket team at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday 16 September 2015. Photo: Andrew Meares Andrew Meares That task is made considerably easier by Labor's obvious reliance on militant unions like the CFMEU as well as the many ex-unionists among Labor MPs and senators.\nSuch dependence not only leads to dangerous game-playing by the opposition on crucial economic policies like the China Free Trade Agreement.\nIt also means that without Abbott to act as a lightning rod for voter disapproval, Malcolm Turnbull will be much more adept at selling the image of a Liberal Party embracing the economic future while Labor fears it.\nShorten is trying to avoid being caught in this latest prime-ministerial trap, most noticeably via Labor's commitment to better funding of education. That helps explain his latest announcement of extra money for universities, including a $2500 annual increase in the dollar funding per student and more support for students to complete their courses.\n This will naturally be popular with the higher-education sector and with students. Australia's most prestigious universities, the G8, instantly welcomed Labor's recognition of the need for predictable funding for universities and their importance in equipping Australia for the future.\nBut the new Turnbull ministry and the immediate change of political tone mean the government no longer looks like a stationary target. Labor, increasingly, does. Whether it's the issue of women in politics or dealing with climate change, Turnbull has already defused the most potent of the opposition attacks on matters of both symbolism and substance. That really does make it a choice about competing policies for the future at a time when Labor's agenda remains remarkably light-on, despite Shorten's commitment to a year of ideas and Monday's announcement on universities.\nAttacking the government for spending cuts or silly gaffes or lack of vision won't be nearly as effective from now on. Nor are Labor's promises to spend more money without promises on how to save any money likely to be enough to persuade a sceptical public when Turnbull is offering an appealing-sounding alternative.\nA renewed government focus on improved education will become part of that appeal, along with the expected dumping of Christopher Pyne's ill-considered and thwarted plan to cut university funding by 20 per cent while simultaneously deregulating fees. Simon Birmingham as new education minister has a lot of ground to make up.\nInnovation is the word But Turnbull is also clearly signalling that the government will be considering all its policies to try to stimulate investment and new drivers of economic growth. He has quickly changed the terms of the debate. The adjective \"innovative\" already threatens to become one of the most overused, rather than underused, words in Australian politics.\nTurnbull is also suggesting it's only common sense to be prepared to change tack if a policy is not effective or could be improved.\n'We are in a rapidly changing environment,\" he said, announcing his new ministry. \"We have to be prepared every day, every single day, to ask ourselves: Will we remain competitive if we keep doing things the way we did yesterday? We've got to remain on the balls of our feet. That's absolutely critical.\"\nIt's also why he's so enthusiastic about marketing the economy of the 21st century and insisting there's never been a more exciting time to be an Australian. The carnage on the local sharemarket on Monday gives a whole new meaning to the concept of exciting, of course. But it is also another reason for Turnbull to emphasise the need to accept constant change and this government's ability to deliver it – in contrast to Labor.\nNot that Turnbull or his new Treasurer, Scott Morrison, have figured out how to make the budget figures add up in the economy of today rather than the possibilities of the future. That process is going to be much more exacting than the rhetoric of a new government suggests. The strikes at Australia's international airports are an immediate and distinctly old-fashioned test of new Employment Minister Michaelia Cash and the commitment to strict limits on public service wages, for example.\nBut the prospect of significant tax reform, including changes to the GST, is now back on the table – a topic to be discussed in detail at the AFR tax reform summit this week.\nIt's no surprise Turnbull described tax as being at the centre of the whole productivity agenda when announcing Kelly O'Dwyer as Assistant Treasurer.\n\"The tax system is one of the key levers the government has to promote economic activity,\" he said. \"Depending on how it is used or how it's designed, it can either incentivise productivity or it can work as a disincentive.\"\nAnd Turnbull has been one of the most consistent in arguing over years that Australia's tax system is increasingly uncompetitive. That criticism has only become more valid over time.\nAs he presided over the first meeting of his new cabinet, Turnbull said Australians were looking for strong, confident and (yes) innovative leadership from those around the table.\nClock now ticking.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:03:19.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
