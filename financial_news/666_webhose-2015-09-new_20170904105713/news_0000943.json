Share on twitter by Jamie Freed At first look it sounds like a typical tale of badly mistimed investment in infrastructure: the opening a $35 million expanded terminal at Karratha Airport in Western Australia's Pilbara region two years after passenger traffic peaked during the resources boom and then fell rapidly .\nBut City of Karratha mayor Peter Long, who will be joined by Infrastructure and Regional Development Minister Warren Truss at the official opening on Friday afternoon, said the council's funds had been spent well. The airport previously had a design capacity for 600,000 passengers a year, but when traffic peaked in July 2012, it was handling 56 per cent more traffic than the design capacity.\n\"It was terrible,\" Mr Long said of the crowding at the airport, particularly at the peak of the boom. \"Some days it was standing room only in the departure lounges. People just parked all over the place.\"\nAt that time, there were regular direct flights between Karratha and Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to transport fly-in, fly-out workers from the east coast. They were building projects such as Rio Tinto's port expansions, Chevron's Gorgon project and CITIC Pacific's huge iron ore mine in the area because there was not enough labour left in Perth.\nAs resources traffic levels out, Karratha is hoping to reignite its tourism industry. Supplied Those services are now gone and at July this year regular passenger traffic at the airport had fallen 21 per cent from the July 2012 peak, as Qantas and Virgin Australia have pulled back on flights and redirected capacity into better performing east coast leisure markets. But the overall traffic decline has been far less dramatic, at 9 per cent, due to an increase in charters and the airport has still been operating above the initial design levels. It remains the largest helicopter base in Australia, due to offshore oil and gas work.\nKarratha's fly-in, fly-out population has fallen from about 13,000 at the peak to just a few thousand now, but the regular population of the town has remained steady at about 25,000. There is also hope about the future of the region, perhaps best evidenced by AMP Capital and Infrastructure Capital's recent purchase of the smaller nearby Port Hedland International Airport for $165 million, plus a commitment to spending $40 million on upgrades over the next five years. The purchase price was above the $150 million fair value set by the Port Hedland Council.\nPotential buyers rebuffed Mr Long said his city had received approaches from potential airport buyers as well, but they had been rebuffed. \"People have been interested in leasing it off us long-term, but we want to keep that money [from the airport's profits] and put it back into the community,\" he said. \"We'll always listen to offers. At some time we'll have to sell it. I don't think that will be for a long time.\"\n He said once the new terminal reached its design capacity of 1.2 million passengers a year, another terminal would need to built at a cost of $100 million in today's money, which might require an outside investor. \"But we don't expect that to happen for at least 10 years,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, as resources traffic levels out, Karratha is hoping to reignite its tourism industry, which had been subsumed by the boom when hotels were full and expensive and the boats that once roamed the archipelago with tourists were put to other uses. Mr Long was hopeful a high-end eco resort could be developed on nearby islands, and the road to Karjini National Park could be upgraded.\nThe airport was also looking to attract international flights and Singapore was the most likely option due to the links with the oil and gas industry.\n\"We're developing ourselves as the business centre of the Pilbara,\" Mr Long said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-09-25T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:14:24.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
