It was also when the XJ6 sedan was in its original, purist form.\nThe F-Type coupe body is what a Jag should be: a blend of beauty and dynamism.\nIf the designers aimed to capture the poise of a big cat about to pounce, then mission accomplished. It also presents as a quite different vehicle to the convertible version which came first (and is itself quite a delightful looker).\nThe variant we are testing here is one of the freshened-up 2016 model year cars (Jaguar got in very early). It's the R, with the most powerful version of the company's 5-litre supercharged V8.\nThe output is a somewhat outrageous 404 kW and 680 Nm, and the top speed is 300 km/h.\n Going for the doctor, so to speak, has a dramatic effect on the purchase price.\nExquisite bodywork The base F-Type coupe, with a 280 kW V6 and manual gearbox, has the same exquisite bodywork but a price-tag of around $120,000 plus on-road costs.\nThe R (an auto only proposition) jumps to $226,970 plus on-road costs, and you'll need to allow another $16K if you want the new all-wheel drive system.\nThat means at one end of its range, the F-Type is competing with the Porsche Cayman coupe, at the other it is taking on the Porsche 911.\nThat's if many really cross-shop. In my experience most 911 buyers wouldn't consider any Jaguar, nor would the majority of Jaguar buyers opt for the more austere and Germanic option.\nThe compromise position for F-Type buyers is the S version, using a more highly-tuned version of the standard car's 3-litre V6. It produces a \"mere\" 280 kW but costs $70K less than the R.\nThe F-Type structure is mostly aluminium, containing the weight to 1650 kg in V8 form. That's a few kilos lighter than the equivalent convertible.\nThere are now 12 versions, which is a mighty high number considering the modest sales achieved thus far. To be fair, though, the F-Type is competing in a tiny niche that is as much about adding a halo to the overall range as shifting metal.\nAnd buyers in that niche want a lot of customisation.\nImproved equipment levels for model year 2016 include a rear camera and front-parking sensors on all versions and electric power-assisted steering. This is precise but a little short of feedback.\nThe V6 S and V8 R can now be specified with an optional all-wheel drive system.\nThis torque-on-demand system is mainly geared to improve all-weather grip. It comes to life only when front end traction is lost; the rest of the time the Jag's wonderful rear-drive road manners are maintained.\nThe switchable \"Active Sports Exhaust\" system is standard across the range. In the R the engine roars even in the standard setting. Flick the switch to \"chequered flag\" mode and it will interesting to see if your neighbours are still talking to you …\nEngine audiophiles might find that there is something, even better than the shriek on acceleration. It the fireworks when the accelerator is lifted. It's almost old school Formula One, and an absolute tribute to the ability of Jaguar engineers … to circumvent strict noise regulations.\nThe R rides on elaborate 20 inch wheels and has quad exhausts.\nThis is one very quick car, as you'd expect. It will accelerate from rest to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds and corners hard and flat and securely.\nTorque vectoring system The R's standard torque vectoring system nips the brakes on the inside wheels at just the right moments to increase cornering speeds.\nThe only exterior area that isn't all class is the rear-tail gate. There are a couple of apparent \"shutlines\" under the rear window, as if the plant couldn't press the metal in one piece. These are highlighted even more when the body is finished in white, as per our test car.\nThe interior isn't quite as dramatic as the exterior, nor as well executed as some of the competition.\nA central double ridge in the centre of the dashboard looks like it is straight from an Aston Martin, and is topped with a pair of air vents that rise and fall when the car is turned on and off. The words complex and unnecessary come to mind.\nThe R has a bronze anodised finish on the starter button and the steering wheel-mounted gear paddles. It is meant to look premium, but to these eyes it looks unfinished.\nThe seats are attractively shaped and finished in leather but the bottom squab is a little hard on long runs (not helped by the choppy ride), and the general ambience isn't quite that of a quarter million dollar or so car.\nThere is no parcel shelf behind the two seats, just a small open bin, and the boot is almost comically small, at least as long as it is dominated by the spare wheel. Apparently there is a fix. Take the spare out, leave in the garage and, if you have a flat, call Jaguar's around-the-clock helpline.\nLike most companies, Jaguar uses an outside supplier for its official roadside assist, but it has negotiated a special deal where they are guaranteed to always have a spare F-Type wheel with them.\nAnother secret is to take out the cargo cover that keeps everything visually neat, and stack your luggage up to the height of the back window. You won't be able to see anything through the central rear-view mirror – but you could never see much anyway and you will have a change of clothes on your weekend away.\nAnyway, it could be worse. It could be the F-Type roadster. That has the distinction of having what might be the smallest boot that anyone has had the cheek to call a boot.\nBut, hey, there are plenty of cars with generous cargo arrangements, but so very few that look stunningly beautiful.\nFACT BOX\nJaguar F-Type R coupe\nPrice (excluding on road costs): $226,970\nEngine: 5-litre supercharged V8 (petrol)\nPower/torque: 405kW/680Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 11.1L/100km\nC02: 259g/km", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:04:02.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
