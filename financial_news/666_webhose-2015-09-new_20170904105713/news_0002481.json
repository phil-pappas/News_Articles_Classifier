If you could get (GM) together with Marchionne that would be terrific, a lot of shareholders would like it,\" Cramer said. \"I know Mary (Barra) doesn't want it. She was dismissive of Marchionne. That's just arrogance, I don't have room in my portfolio for that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:17:52.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
