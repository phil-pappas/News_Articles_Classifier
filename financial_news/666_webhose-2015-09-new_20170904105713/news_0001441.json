Besides, the policy allows the private parties to open as many purchase centres as possible in the allotted cluster, subject to a cluster covering a minimum 500 to 1000 hectare.\n“Private parties would be engaged in procurement operations after e-tendering and the parties would be short-listed on the basis of acquisitions cost, including incidentals such as packaging, transportation and storage of grain Quote: d by agencies,” the official said.\nThe official added that the purpose of bringing private players into rice procurement operations was to improve efficiency in procurement, transportation, packaging and temporary storage of grain.\n“On the delivery of CMR to FCI or state-owned corporations, the private players would be reimbursed the MSP) and statutory charges paid by them upon production of proof of payment, besides the incidentals Quote: d in the tender document,” an official said.\nThe policy follows recommendation by the high level committee (HLC) headed by former food minster Shanta Kumar earlier this year. The HLC had suggested that FCI should move on to help those states where farmers suffer from distress sales at prices much below MSP, and which are dominated by small holdings, like eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, etc.\n“This is the belt from where the second green revolution is expected, and where FCI needs to be pro-active, mobilizing state and other agencies to provide benefits of MSP and procurement to a larger number of farmers, especially small and marginal ones,” the panel had stated.\nRecently, the food ministry had set a target to procure 30 million tonne of rice during the next kharif marketing season (2015-16) starting from October 1.\nPunjab, the biggest contributor to the central pool, would procure 8.2 million tonne while Chhattisgarh would purchase 3.6 million tonne from farmers.\nThe key contributors to the central pool include Odisha (2.8 million tonne), Uttar Pradesh (2.7 million tonne), Haryana (2.3 million tonne), Andhra Pradesh (2 million tonne) and Telangana (1.8 million tonne).\nThe government has announced an MSP for common and grade A varieties of paddy at Rs 1,410 and Rs 1,450 per quintal respectively for the 2015-16 season.\nFirst Published on September 08, 2015 12:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:10:34.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
