It however did not specify why it was taking such a step.\n\"They have a right to do this,\" said Klaus Spielkamp, head of fixed-income sales at Bulltick. \"The market was expecting this and it wasn't a surprise to anyone.\"\nThe move follows a sharp dip in the prices of the perps which were Quote: d as low as 20-30 on Tuesday.\nThe prices fell amid concerns that a weakening Real would make it difficult for the company to meet dollar payments when it was largely generating local currency revenues.\nThe non-call five perp is just one of a handful of hybrid securities issued by Latin America corporates in recent years.\nThe deal, which was granted 50% equity treatment by rating agencies when it was issued in 2012, allowed the company to lower its leverage ratios while proceeding with aggressive expansion plans.\nMeanwhile, the company is looking to reduce the amount outstanding dollar denominated debt on its balance sheet, announcing today that it may tender for some US$250m in outstanding senior 10% perps.\nThe tender will depend on the company's ability to raise funding. Management is considering various options, including debt and equity sales in the local market, local currency loans or asset sales, it said.\nThe 10% senior perps were trading in the low to mid 50s on Tuesday. \"At those levels, the market is saying you may not be making payments on the sub debt but the senior debt is a different story,\" said an investor.
