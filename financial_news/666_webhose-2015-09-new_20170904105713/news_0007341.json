Investors are keen to find out who was right, traders or economists. As near as can be gleaned from the Fed funds futures market, the former are placing a probability of just 30% on the central bank raising rates in September. \nEconomists on the other hand continue to be split roughly down the middle, according to the latest poll conducted by Bloomberg . \n\"In short, whilst we expect no change in headline policy we judge that lift-off point is not far off; indeed, had it not been for the recent China-led risk aversion we would have been banking on the first rate rise arriving at the upcoming meeting. \n\"Instead, our expectation is that the Fed is likely to seek to cautiously guide markets that it is on course to tighten policy over the next few months following further recent improvements in the labour market,\" analysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) said. \nFurther Chinese data, including on industrial production, due out over the weekend, may help to set the tone for the coming week. \nThe Shanghai stock market's reaction to the latest credit statistics and speculation surrounding further fiscal stimulus measures in the Asian giant, on Friday, may also play an important role. \nNot to be missed either, on Wednesday Governor Carney is set to testify before the Treasury Select Committee on the Bank's latest Inflation Report. \nA barrage of first-tier economic data is also scheduled for release over the coming week, with the monthly data on retail sales and industrial production from Washington D.C. figuring prominently on the agenda. \nInvestors will also be monitoring the news-flow ahead of the upcoming national elections in Greece on 20 September and regional ones in the Spanish region of Catalonia on 27 September.
