We foresee this growing to more than 200 in five years,\" Taste said.\nTaste, which also operates Domino's Pizza outlets in South Africa, said it would start with at least 12 outlets in the next year before expanding further.\nGlobal restaurant brands are increasingly investing in Africa to join established international players such as McDonald's Corp in tapping a growing middle class.\nStarbucks' entry into South Africa will pit it against established brands such as unlisted Cape Town-based Vida e Caff√®, a local firm with more than 60 outlets.
