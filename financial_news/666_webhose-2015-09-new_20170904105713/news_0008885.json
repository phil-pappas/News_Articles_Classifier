Hagen Hopkins Share on twitter by Misa Han What could the federal government spend taxpayers' money on instead of holding a standalone compulsory plebiscite on same sex marriage?\nThe Abbott government will have a plebiscite on same-sex marriage but has not decided when to hold the vote.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission modelling showed a standalone plebiscite on same sex marriage would cost taxpayers $158.4 million.\nIf a plebiscite were held alongside the next general federal election, it would cost $44 million to cover the additional temporary staff, ballot paper and education and promotion materials.\nThis chart shows the cost of holding a standalone plebiscite on taxpayers in comparison to the federal government expenditure on other categories. Fairfax Media In comparison, the 2013 general federal election cost taxpayers $139.6 million, excluding public funding.\nThese costing proposals excludes any public funding that may be spent on the Yes or No campaigns.\nThe cost of holding a plebiscite is enough to fund regulators like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for an entire year.\nIt can also cover the cost of funding specialist domestic violence programs in NSW over the next four years.\nRelated The $159 million is not quite enough to cover the $20,000 tax break for small businesses ($250 million) or rural assistance ($205 million) for this financial year.\nBut it is more than enough to cover the federal government's dairy industry subsidy ($56 million) and natural disaster relief ($33 million) for this financial year.\nThe voter support for same sex marriage is standing at a record high of 69 per cent , while nearly 700 businesses have publicly declared support for marriage equality .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.accc.gov.au/", "http://www.apra.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx"], "published": "2015-09-08T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:32:18.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
