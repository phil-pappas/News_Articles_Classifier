Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket's benchmark index closed below 5000 for the first time since July 2013, led by selling in the miners as global investors continue to fret about the health of the Chinese economy.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 plunged 2.1 per cent, or 105.4 points, to 4998.1, while the broader All Ordinaries fell 98.3 points to close at 5032.4, shaving about $30 billion off the market's value.\nThe 5000-mark had proved a key resistance point over the past month, rallying when the market threatened to close below that level for the previous three occasions.\nIG market analyst Angus Nicholson said the close was a negative signal for the market.\nThe ASX closed below 5000 on Wednesday. \"It just goes to show how sensitive markets are [to bad news], especially after the Fed decision,\" he said.\nHeavy selling in two mining blue chip stocks, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto on the London exchange overnight spilled into the local bourse and sent the market plunging at the open. A preliminary Chinese manufacturing gauge reading of 47, the lowest level since the depths of the global financial crisis, added fuel to the fire during the local session.\nBHP Billiton fell 4.4 per cent, ending at $22.80. Rio Tinto shares lost 2.4 per cent to $47.99 and Fortescue Metals Group fell 5.48 per cent to $1.81.\nOf the top ten worst hit stocks, eight were resources and energy stocks. Liquefied Natural Gas was the worst performer, down 8.1 per cent.\n \"Energy and materials have been both hit by negativity in the commodities market, spurred on by the risk-off movement into US treasuries and buying in the Yen and US dollar,\" Mr Nicholson said.\nThe banks were also punished, with Westpac Banking Group down 3.7 per cent to $29.97. Commonwealth Bank fell 3 per cent to $71.60, while National Australia Bank lost 2.3 per cent to $29.80 and ANZ Banking Group shed 2.3 per cent to $26.99.\nMeanwhile, Woolworths fell 1.7 per cent to $24.38 and Wesfarmers down 2.2 per cent to $38.18. Telstra shares lost 0.9 per cent to $5.62.\nThere were some islands in the storm, with Nufarm the best performing stock after the crop chemicals company's full-year results showed a15 per cent rise in net profit to $43.2 million.\nAcross the sectors, all finished lower with materials the worst, down 3 per cent, followed by financials down 2.5 per cent. Defensive industrials was the best, down 0.6 per cent.\nFidelity Australia Opportunities Fund portfolio manager Kate Howitt said the investor focus from here would be on news from policy makers and their messages â€” real or imagined.\nThe Fed's decision to keep rates on hold may have been the right decision from its point of view but it was a decision markets were anxious to cross, and the delay has left the overhanging doubt, she said.\n\"There's a real sense from the equities point of view of 'are we there yet'?\" Ms Howitt said.\nThe miners were caught in a torrent from the Fed, too fearful of the global economy to raise rates, resulting in markets fearing global growth, and selling down commodities, she said.\nThe fall below 5000 was not a deal breaker, Saxo Capital Markets sales trader James Kim said, noting the weekly 200-day average line of 5044 was a more crucial support level.\n\"We have already breached that. A weekly close below 5044 would set us up for losses ahead,\" he said.\nMr Nicholson said while the fall below 5000 would be a negative signal to investors, there was the possibility of stronger US data due this week, including PMI, new home sales and jobless claims could spark a positive tone from Wall Street.\n\"The selling has perhaps been overdone, if we were to have some good news that could really turn the markets around,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-23T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:10:22.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
