The report further revealed that within the ‘refined products’ category, gasoline stocks fell, while distillate supplies were up from the week-ago level. \nOverall though, the bearish news of a huge increase in domestic commercial crude inventories was overshadowed by another set of federal data that showed a slowdown in oil production during the month of June. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.9% to settle at $46.25 per barrel Wednesday. \nAnalysis of the Data \nCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 4.67 million barrels for the week ending Aug 28, 2015, following a tumble of 5.45 million barrels in the previous week. \nThe analysts surveyed by Platts – the energy information arm of McGraw-Hill Financial Inc. – had expected crude stocks to go down some 800,000 barrels. A sharp uptick in the level of imports and drop in refinery utilization rates led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. \nHowever, crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – were down 388,000 barrels from the previous week’s level to 57.31 million barrels. \nFollowing the second inventory rise in 3 weeks, at 455.43 million barrels, current crude supplies are up 27% from the year-ago period and are near the highest level during this time of the year in 80 years at least. The crude supply cover was up from 26.7 days in the previous week to 27.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 21.9 days. \nGasoline: Supplies of gasoline declined for the third time in 4 weeks, as demand strength more than offset the rise in imports. The modest 271,000 barrels fall – compared to analysts’ projections for a 2 million barrels decrease in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 214.16 million barrels. Despite last week’s draw, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 2% higher than the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range. \nDistillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 115,000 barrels last week, significantly lower than analysts’ expectations for a 700,000 barrels rise in inventory level. The increase in distillate fuel stocks – fifteenth in as many weeks – could be attributed to strength in production. At 149.95 million barrels, distillate supplies are 22% above the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year. \nRefinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down 1.7% from the prior week to 92.8%. \nAbout the Weekly Petroleum Status Report \nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. \nThe report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. \nThe data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Chevron Corp. CVX and ConocoPhillips COP, and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. VLO, Phillips 66 PSX and HollyFrontier Corp. HFC. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .
