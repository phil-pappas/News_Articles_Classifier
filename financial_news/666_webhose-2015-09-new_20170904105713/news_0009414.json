It is now likely to appoint cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador, a high cost affair, to expand reach especially after the company failed to obtain a payment bank licence from the Reserve Bank of India a month ago, two people familiar with the matter told ET.\nIt is now gearing up for second round of differential licences, which may be issued by the central bank in due course. Speculations are rife that the company was trying rope in a big film star or sporting personality.\n\"We are talking to different personalities to endorse our brands as this will help expand our reach in rural India,\" said Pramod Saxena, chairman and managing director of Oxigen Services. He declined to name them.\n\"We will be better prepared to apply for a payment bank or differentiated banking licence in the next round,\" he said.\nThe digital wallet company Oxigen has planned to spend US$ 15 million or about Rs 99 crore for campaigning as official sponsor of the South African T20 cricket team during their tour to India in October.\nAppointing a brand ambassador is nothing unusual especially large corporates. But, this is perhaps for the first time for a company in the payment space, will rope in such a big personality, which shows growing importance of payment solution companies especially after RBI issued 10 payment bank licences.\nOxigen, which had too applied for a licence, is now working in partnership with RBL Bank to take care of their payment solutions. It is providing more retail access points for the bank customers.\n\"We remain steadfast on digitizing India with our pan India retail footprint and technology solutions, and will continue to deliver secure financial transactions through our existing PPI license to the last mile in the villages which still do not have banking access,\" Saxena said earlier.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:19:10.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
