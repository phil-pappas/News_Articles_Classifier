Photo: Chris Pearce\nThe corporate regulator has called on Canberra to adopt the financial system inquiry's recommendation that its powers against banks be ramped up to protect consumers from dodgy products, a move the industry is vigorously opposing.\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission chairman Greg Medcraft also used a speech on Friday to encourage the federal government to ramp up penalties for violating commercial law, another recommendation of last year's inquiry by David Murray.\nASIC should get additional powers based on the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, Mr Murray said, to allow it to enter banks and influence the design of bank products. In addition, banks should be subject to a \"product design and distribution obligation\" to improve the behaviour of market participants.\n\"The introduction of a product intervention power, design and distribution obligation and appropriate penalties will assist ASIC in providing the right nudge [to]â€¦ change their behaviour,\" Mr Medcraft told the Banking and Financial Services Law Association conference in Brisbane.\nAdvertisement The government this week adopted the FSI's recommendation for the up-front deposit insurance levy to be abolished . Last month, it said it would introduce an industry funding scheme for ASIC, another recommendation of Mr Murray .\nBut it is yet to say whether product intervention and design powers and obligations will be introduced or whether corporate law penalties will be bolstered. It is, however, conducting a \"capability review\" of ASIC, which the FSI also suggested, to maintain regulatory accountability.\nThe banking industry is opposed to the additional powers for ASIC and the extra obligations on distribution, and through the Australian Bankers' Association has been lobbying against the recommendations.\nBut Mr Medcraft said a product intervention power \"would give ASIC a greater capacity to apply regulatory interventions in a timely and responsive way\" and it would be \"very rare\" that products would be banned.\nA product design and distribution obligation would \"enhance real behaviour of market participants\", he said, and reflect that ASIC cannot be expected to prevent all consumer losses. \"It is important that gatekeepers take responsibility for their actions,\" Mr Medcraft said.\n\"In my view, the FSI's recommendation aligns very closely with the theme of culture. Product manufacturers should design and distribute products with the best interests of the investor or financial consumer in mind. This is part of having a customer-focused culture.\"\nOn penalties, he said it was critical to boost them to \"give market participants the right incentive to comply with the law. They should aim to deter contraventions and promote greater compliance, resulting in a more resilient financial system.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/politics/coalition-abandons-competition-crackdown-and-bank-deposit-levy-20150901-gjc88i", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/big-business-will-have-to-pay-for-asic-20150827-gj8xvf"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:23:05.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
