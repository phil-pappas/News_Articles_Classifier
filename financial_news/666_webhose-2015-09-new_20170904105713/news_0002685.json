ADVERTISEMENT Capital spending, revenue growth and hiring expectations are all near survey lows at 4.3 percent, 4.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, while earnings growth expectations matched last quarter’s survey-low at 6.5 percent.\n“While CFOs are generally an optimistic group, they are understandably taking a more cautious view of the global economy and their own companies than in previous quarters,” said Sanford Cockrell III, national managing partner of the U.S. CFO Program, at Deloitte. \n“With so many sources of volatility and uncertainty, highlighted by challenges in China, it is difficult for most companies to aggressively pursue growth — and this is reflected in the conservative investment and hiring expectations expressed by CFOs this quarter,\" he said. \nWoes around the Chinese economy abound among CFOs, with only 4 percent describing it as good, a sharp decline from 23 percent in the April-June quarter. \nWhile this survey posted an 11th straight quarter of positive net optimism at 14.2 percent, it is at the lowest level in almost three years. \nNearly 60 percent of respondents remain optimistic about the North American economy while only 5 percent say the European economy is in good shape, which is unchanged from the second quarter. \nThe survey also identified top internal and external risks, including finding and retaining talented employees, growing cyber security concerns and other risks such as more federal regulations, falling oil prices and a slowdown of the U.S. economy. \nResponses from CFOs were collected over the two-week period before U.S. equity markets declined sharply on Aug. 24.
