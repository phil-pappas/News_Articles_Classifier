Rowe Price European Stock Fund The T. Rowe Price European Stock Fund (PRESX) is offered by T. Rowe Price. The fund notes that it seeks to grow capital “through investment primarily in common stocks of both large and small European companies. Current income is a secondary objective.” The fund intends to diversify its investments into at least five countries.\nThe fund management uses the bottom-up approach while constructing the portfolio. Industry sector and country outlooks do not contribute directly in construction of the portfolio. Fund literature states that “Country allocation is driven largely by stock selection, though we may limit investments in markets or industries that appear to have poor overall prospects.” It further states that it does not have a growth or value bias while picking stocks.\n\nFast facts The fund has been in operation since February 1990, and as of July 2015, the fund was managing assets worth $1.7 billion. Geographically, 29.6% of the T. Rowe Price European Stock Fund’s assets were invested into companies in the United Kingdom at the end of July 2015. Companies from Switzerland, Spain, France, and Italy round off the top five invested geographies.\nThe share class’s net expense ratio is 0.96%. The management fee is 0.79% and it is a no-load fund, hence it does not levy a sales charge. It also does not charge any distribution and service (12b-1) fees. However, it does charge a redemption fee of 2% if the investment is redeemed within 90 days. The minimum amount required to invest in the fund is $2,500, with a minimum additional investment of $100.\nIn terms of the number of holdings, it had 70 stocks in its portfolio as of August 2015. Its top ten holdings comprised 22.5% of August’s portfolio and included stocks like Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (IITSF), Nestlé S.A. (NSRGY), Novartis AG (NVS), and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD). The fund house did not provide individual weights of these securities for August 2015.\nFund manager Dean Tenerelli, the chairman of the investment advisory committee at T. Rowe Price, is the manager of the PRESX. He had joined the company in July 2000 and has been managing the fund since October 2005.\nWe’ll look at the fund’s performance for August 2015 in the next article.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - The Fidelity Advisor Europe Fund: Class A (FHJUX) Part 2 - Financials, Healthcare Hurt Fidelity Advisor Europe Fund in August Part 3 - Must Know: The Ivy European Opportunities Fund: Class A (IEOAX) Mutual Funds T.
