Now known as the Westin Bayshore, the hotel was put on the block early this year by owner Starwood Capital Group and is nearing a sale for roughly C$270 million ($205 million) to C$290 million, dwarfing initial estimates, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe property report\nNow Arriving: New Condos at Vancouver Train Stations Developer Shrugs off Vancouver Office-Space Glut Mitsubishi Estate Plans Japan’s Tallest Building The big questions: who’s going to buy it and why would anyone pay that much for the 511-room waterfront parcel? The expected price tag will be one of the highest ever paid for a Canadian hotel, on a price per room basis.\nStill, there has been no shortage of prospective buyers. Six approached the city to explore redevelopment options, according to Brian Jackson, Vancouver’s director of planning. A couple of dozen parties expressed interest to listing agent Cushman & Wakefield Inc., with a large overseas contingent, mostly from China. The deal with Starwood is expected to close this calendar year, according to people familiar with the matter\nOne high-profile bidder: Concord Pacific Developments Inc., which reshaped Vancouver’s downtown skyline in the early 1990s, redeveloping Expo 86, the old World’s Fair site, into a 2.5-mile long, multi-tower condo community that houses thousands of new arrivals from China and Hong Kong.\nConcord Pacific confirmed it bid on the Bayshore, but declined other comment.\nMany expect the buyer will try to develop condominiums on the site, reflecting the intense demand for homes in the area and the dizzying pace of price increases.\nBut obstacles abound. For starters, it will be tough for a developer to shoehorn more luxury towers into densely packed Coal Harbour, a high-rise condo district and one of Canada’s most coveted addresses.\n“We’ve had a number of inquiries from people who wanted to tear down the hotel and replace it with more height, more density, more residential,” said Mr. Jackson. “To all of that, we said, ‘No.’”\nThe risks over the pending deal are similar to those being played out in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston and other North American cities with hot condo markets. Developers are paying up for prime sites with visions of enormous condo projects, but they’re making a bet they’ll be able to overcome local opposition that inevitably materializes.\nIn Vancouver, condo prices have been soaring thanks to strong demand mostly from Chinese buyers and younger Canadians.\nHigh-end luxury condos, mostly on or near the waterfront, peaked prerecession in the C$1,800 to C$2,000 range before falling back to earth post-downturn to around C$1,500 to C$1,600, said Michael Ferreira, a principal at Urban Analytics, which researches mixed-use projects.\nPrices started skyrocketing again by 2014, and if the Bayshore were rezoned, the average sale price could easily hit C$2,500 a square foot and possibly rise to C$3,000 or even more, Mr. Ferreira said.\nThe property includes the original 11-story Bayshore Inn, built in 1961; the 18-story 1970 hotel, and a newer 60,000 square-foot conference center. Mr. Hughes holed up in the hotel penthouse, and the mystery of why he came, what he did and why he left remains a puzzle to a generation of Vancouverites.\nStarwood bought the hotel with partners in 2005, paying $96.5 million, according to real estate tracker Real Capital Analytics. By 2013, the value was pegged at $146.2 million\nThe biggest hurdle facing buyers interested in redeveloping the property is the zoning of the 6-acre site since 1991. City officials say it is “shrink-wrapped and bubble-wrapped” to preserve the existing hotel precinct and curb the scale of redevelopment.\nOpposition also is likely from the hotel’s unionized workforce and affluent Coal Harbour residents whose water views could be jeopardized. And the 1961 mid-rise tower is a candidate for heritage status, a landmark designation, complicating any bid to scrap it.\n“If we lose the Bayshore and Howard Hughes’ suite, it would be death by a thousand cuts,” said Aaron Chapman, a local historian who has conducted hotel tours.\nSome developers took a pass on the bidding including high-end property developer Grosvenor Americas, which is building Grosvenor Ambleside in West Vancouver and has priced penthouse units at close to C$4,000 a foot.\n“Operating a hotel for a number of years is not what we do,” said Michael Ward, general manager for Grosvenor in Vancouver.\nA full-blown rezoning could take two to five years and be fraught with delays and opposition. “You’d have to achieve among the highest level condo prices Vancouver has ever seen to make the numbers work,” Mr. Ward said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:10:05.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
