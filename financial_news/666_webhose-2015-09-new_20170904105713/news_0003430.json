Thus, more companies are taking advantage of this strategic financial planning tool given that it increases its market value and boosts the company's bottom line. The qualified research expenses can include wages for in-house employees who conduct R&D activity. It can also include up to 65% of a company's contractors and any supplies used for research activity. Very important to note is that all the qualifying research activity and expenses must be completed in the US.Companies also have the opportunity to amend past tax returns, for any open tax years, to claim the credit. The credit's ultimate goal is to offset any prior, current, or future tax liability. Unknown to many, this credit can be carried forward 20 years. This is especially important for startup companies that claim the credit yet have little to no tax liability but see the value in banking these valuable credits for future use.This credit can be obtained on the federal and state level.
