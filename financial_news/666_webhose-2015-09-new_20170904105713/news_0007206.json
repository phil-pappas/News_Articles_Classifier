The fee is non-refundable.\nHere are three important clauses IndiGo has put on ‘6E Plus’ offer:\nUnder this Service, Passengers can modify their booking multiple number of times or cancel the booking, without paying any additional Change or Cancellation fees, as may be applicable and defined in InterGlobe Aviation Limited’s (“IndiGo”) then current Conditions of Carriage. In case of cancellation of a booking, after deducting the Fee, the residual amount, if any, will be refunded in accordance with the then current Conditions of Carriage. If there is any excess amount to be paid on account of difference in fare or any applicable charges, the same will be borne by the Passenger. In case of modification, after deducting the Fee and making the payment for the changed booking, if any residual amount is to be refunded, the same shall be done in accordance with the then current Conditions of Carriage. Further, if there is any excess amount to be paid on account of difference in fare or any applicable charges, the same will be borne by the Passenger. Earlier in July, rivalry budget airline Spicejet also introduced a similar offer that allowed customers to change or cancel their booking anytime by paying a flat fee (Rs 899 for domestic travel and Rs 1,099 international travel) during the time of booking.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 1:22 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:25:26.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
