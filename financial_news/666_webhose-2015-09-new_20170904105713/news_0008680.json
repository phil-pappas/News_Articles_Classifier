Its industry group , Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts, has been holding firm in the top quartile of IBD's 197 industry group rankings for several weeks now.\nAuto parts retailers like AutoZone, O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY ) and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP ) have stable businesses that typically don't suffer from uneven demand. Business has been particularly good lately, as people have put money in older cars to keep them on the road longer. For many, that's a better alternative than buying a new car, especially in a sluggish economy where wage growth has generally been stagnant.\nAutoZone, which operates just over 5,600 stores in 49 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil, has made a slow yet steady advance since clearing a base in early 2010. It's currently working on a base-on-base pattern with a 755 buy point .\nO'Reilly Automotive is the top-rated stock in the group, with a Composite Rating of 98. It's a tad smaller than AutoZone, operating about 4,500 stores in 43 states. O'Reilly gets top billing in the group, partly due to two straight quarters of double-digit earnings and sales growth as well as top-notch annual return on equity (39.1%) and pretax margin (16.9%) in 2014.\nO'Reilly is working on a flat base with a 258.25 buy point.\nMeanwhile, Advance Auto Parts is hugging its 10-week moving average as it holds above a recent 161.65 cup-with-handle buy point.\nBig revenue growth in 2014 was fueled by Advance's acquisition of General Parts International for around $2 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T01:30:49.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
