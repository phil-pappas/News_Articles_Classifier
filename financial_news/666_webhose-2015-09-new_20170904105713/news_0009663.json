Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Victoria and Western Australia experienced the biggest drop in their respective unemployment rates in August, but South Australia and Queensland have been unable to budge their stubbornly higher than average jobless figures.\nWhile NSW (6 per cent) and Queensland (6.5 per cent) did not have any movement in their unemployment rate last month, both states lead the nation with an absolute increase in seasonally adjusted employment.\nQueensland – plagued by a high unemployment rate since the end of the coal boom – boosted its total employment figures by 11,200 people in August, according to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nThis will be welcome relief for the Palaszczuk Labor government, which has been criticised for not doing enough to kickstart the state's economy amid fears of a major construction slowdown following the end of the construction of the $60 billion liquefied natural gas industry in Gladstone.\nBoth the Queensland and federal governments are trying to fast-track big coal projects in the Galilee Basin, including Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine, in a bid to create thousands of new jobs.\nNSW was not far behind on an increase of 9200 people, followed by the other big mining state of Western Australia (up 7000 people).\nVictoria's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell from 6.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent, while WA also experienced a similar-sized fall from 6.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent.\nTasmania, whose smaller economy had been in the doldrums in recent years, also managed to peg back its unemployment rate from 6.6 per cent to 6.4 per cent.\n South Australia, which has been the focus of the Abbott government over the future of Australia's ship-building industry, continued to claim the unwanted mantle of having the highest unemployment rate in the nation, with 7.9 per cent – well above the national average of 6.2 per cent.\nThe only decrease in the seasonally adjusted participation rate was in Victoria (down 0.5 per centage points), while the largest increase was in Tasmania (up 0.5 percentage points).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-10T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:53:43.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
