If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere, that’s what they say.\nThat’s a little spin on Alicia Keys’ “Empire State of Mind (Part II)” and its nod to Frank Sinatra. For job seekers in the Big Apple, those words will really hit home now because, as of last Thursday, some of them have a better chance to make it there. Employers, except in limited situations, are no longer allowed to check credit histories.\n“Every New Yorker applying for a job deserves a fair shot — and we are committed to protecting the rights of our workers and making sure that every New Yorker has the opportunity to succeed,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said after signing the legislation into law.\nThe policy is being heralded nationwide as an example to follow. Federal law allows employment credit checks under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The law requires employers to get an applicant’s or employee’s permission before pulling his or her history. But really, if you want the job, how likely are you to refuse such a request?\nStill, you have to wonder: How does the fact that you once couldn’t pay your credit card bill correlate to your job performance? Or let’s say someone is a poor money manager. Does that mean that person is more likely to commit fraud?\nWe don’t really know the answers to those questions, yet many employers are allowed to screen folks on the assumption that their character is related to their credit history. As I’ve seen in my own work with people, a bad credit record can be the result of a host of problems not linked to irresponsible financial behavior. The think tank Demos and other advocates have found that many people have seen their credit brought down by periods of unemployment or medical debt. Some were the victims of predatory lending practices.\nConsumer advocacy groups have long complained that there is no link between bad credit and job performance. They further argue that such checks disproportionately screen minorities out of jobs, leading to discriminatory hiring.\nSo what did New York do that’s so special? The city’s ban on considering an applicant’s credit history is one of the toughest laws enacted on this issue, says Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst for Demos. States and local governments can make their own laws that can further restrict employers except in cases where a credit check is required under federal law, she said.\nThere are efforts in Congress to prohibit employers from requiring potential employees to disclose their credit history as part of the job application process. Currently, 11 states now limit employers’ access to or use of applicants’ credit information — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, according to National Conference of State Legislatures. And there are 28 bills pending in statehouses across the nation.\n“New York’s law is the strongest in the country because it doesn’t include most of the unjustified exemptions found in so many other state laws,” Traub said.\nIllinois’ law permits credit checks in hiring for positions where job duties include having unsupervised access to $2,500 in cash or assets. That “would include virtually any position in retail, maintenance, tech support and, likely, food service,” Traub said. “California’s law allows credit checks for any position described as ‘managerial,’ putting a ceiling on how far anyone with flawed credit might be able to advance in their career.”\nEven the exceptions in the New York law such as with law enforcement aren’t warranted, Traub argues. The implication that a police officer would be more likely to become crooked if he or she paid bills late is unfounded, she said.\nI hope what’s happened in New York will create a precedent. Maybe it will inspire Congress to act so that there’s one standard.\nEven with its exceptions, the Empire City deserves a shout-out for removing an unnecessary barrier to employment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:49:43.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
