With the release of the 2014 CRA data in RiskExec®, RMS again becomes the first firm in the nation to enable their clients a full review of lending and competitive performance in small business, small farm and community development lending. The Community Reinvestment Act, in part, requires lenders to reach out and service borrowers in low-and-moderate income neighborhoods. The current focus and scrutiny of the CFPB (www.cfpb.gov) against lenders for potential neglect of underserved markets adds weight to the use of these rankings and data.\n\"The current tough regulatory environment makes it imperative for all lenders to be proactive in their compliance programs. We at RMS believe in quickly providing public/government data to our RiskExec® clients. This year again we have provided CRA Peer data and reports as soon as they have been made available by the government,\" stated Dr. Anurag Agarwal, President and CEO, RMS. \"We will post the 2014 HMDA Peer Databases at a similar pace once that information is released by the government.\"\nThe RiskExec® software suite currently includes geocoding, mapping, and all manners of data visualization -- from interactive maps to peer rankings to tables & charts -- as well as executive and regulatory reporting for all facets of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and Fair Lending including indirect auto, residential and commercial lending.\nAbout RiskExec®\nRiskExec® is a suite of software tools developed specifically for financial services firms and their management teams.
