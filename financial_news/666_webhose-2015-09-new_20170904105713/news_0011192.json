The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slid to 49.7 in August, denoting contraction, after recording 50.0 in July. \n\"Sentiment is very fragile. We are seeing a confirmation of the slowdown in China,\" Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management, said. \n\"European stocks could get even cheaper in this period of volatility but longer term, they look like good value and dividend yields are attractive. We are advising our clients to remain invested in high quality European stocks.\" \nMiner and commodity trader Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) was down nearly 10 percent, the biggest faller in the FTSEurofirst 300 index, while diversified miners BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) fell 5.0 to 7.6 percent. \nInvestor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) fears over Chinese growth contributed to a drop in European shares in August, with the FTSEurofirst 300 recording its biggest monthly loss in four years on Monday. \n\"The PMI (Other OTC: PMIR - news ) was below 50, which is a psychologically important level and puts into real focus the fact that China is contracting,\" ETX Capital senior sales trader, Joe Rundle, said. \n\"With the weak data coming out, we're going to see the negative sentiment from the last few weeks continuing.\" \nGermany's DAX, which has substantial exposure to China, fell 2.4 percent despite data showing factory activity at a 16-month high and the jobless rate at a record low. In aggregate, euro zone manufacturing growth eased last month, with Italian and French factory PMIs falling. \nAmong individual fallers, shares in British hedge fund manager Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) fell 6.8 percent after a report that the head of its China unit had been detained as part of an inquiry into recent Chinese market volatility. \nBucking the trend, Sweden's Elekta (Stockholm: EKTA-B.ST - news ) jumped 7.9 percent after reporting first quarter earnings, making it the biggest riser on the STOXX Europe 600. Traders cited an upbeat sales forecast as supporting the health care firm. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Alison Williams)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:47:23.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
