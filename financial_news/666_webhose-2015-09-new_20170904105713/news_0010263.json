Jane Dyson Share on twitter by Adele Ferguson September 18 marked a watershed for Metcash. It was the day the grocery wholesaler was unceremoniously dumped from the ASX 100, triggering a change in its investor base and making it a sitting duck for private equity.\nNot surprisingly, it has kept the hedge fund industry busy. According to the latest Australian Securities and Investments Commission short position reports table, it is the most shorted stock on the ASX, with a massive 22 per cent of the company's shares shorted.\nWith the market on the cusp of the next private equity boom and the Australian dollar at its cheapest level in years, the company's chronic share price underperformance makes it a serious break-up proposition.\nThe reason is simple: the company is worth more dead than alive. To put it into perspective, its liquor and hardware businesses are worth more than the group's overall market capitalisation. In simple terms, the market is assigning a zero valuation to its grocery wholesale business, which generates more than 70 per cent of the group's total earnings.\nIt is this business where the challenges lie. Its wholesale grocery business, which supplies to independent retailers including IGA, has been described as a fundamentally flawed model that will struggle to survive in its current form.\nIndeed, fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, painted a picture of doom for the company earlier this month when he said Metcash could \"disappear\" within 10 years .\nA recent joint survey by UBS and the Australian Food and Grocery Council of 66 suppliers representing up to 40 per cent of the grocery market revenue expect IGA market share to fall 500 basis points over the next five years. Such a fall would drive a further 11 per cent downgrade to UBS's 2020 revenue forecasts, and an even greater cut to earnings before interest and tax.\nIt is why this week's investor day will focus on the group's grocery wholesaling division, with a view to convincing investors – or private equity – that Metcash has been oversold.\n On Tuesday the company is expected to outline to investors that its turnaround strategy is starting to work and that it has a plan to grow market share, revenue and profit.\nTo this end it will showcase its recently appointed recruits, including the new chairman Rob Murray, who joined in April after a stellar career at beer giant Lion, Stephen Cain, who joined in July as the head of supermarkets and Mark Hewlett, who joined in July as head of new channels of business.\nAll three men have good credentials and come with strong reputations, which will add weight to their pitch to investors that there is life in Metcash yet.\nSignificant renewal The appointments come against a backdrop of significant board renewal over the past 12 months.\nIt is understood that Cain, a former senior executive at Coles Supermarkets, will map out a plan to expand into the fresh food, private label and health and beauty products segments that it supplies to independent retailers.\nAll are killer categories, with most of the independents sourcing the bulk of fresh food and health and beauty products elsewhere.\nMetcash is also expected to lift its presence in the supply of convenience food to reflect the changing demographics, a category that is going gangbusters in Britain.\nThere is no question the market will be interested in how the company plans to stem its falling market share, particularly at a time when the supermarket industry has never been more competitive .\nThe country's $90 billion supermarket sector is going through unprecedented changes with the resurgence of Coles, the fightback of Woolworths and the rampant growth of discount competitors including Aldi . It has left Metcash vulnerable.\nAnd as Woolworths and Coles slug it out for market share through a price war, IGA stores have got caught in the crossfire.\nMetcash is helping some independent retailers with store reburbishments but with margins being squeezed it will need to ensure that these independent retailers are doing the right thing, else it will blow back on the Metcash brand.\nSince the 7-Eleven scandal broke last month, a few emails have been sent from staff and former staff at independent IGA stores alleging underpayment of wages. One victim said he was working at an IGA store north of Sydney. One store is believed to be paying $10 an hour. Others work at IGA stores in Brisbane and say the pay varies between $11 an hour and $14 an hour.\nWhere the story of Metcash begins and ends is why the hedge funds have been heavily shorting the stock.\nEqually investors will want to know whether the $600 million-plus it is spending on its turnaround strategy is having a big enough impact to warrant the expense.\nThey will want a detailed explanation of how Metcash plans to defend the market share of retailers in South Australia and Western Australia with the impending onslaught of Aldi.\nMetcash is the country's biggest wholesale supplier to independent retailers. Its main business, IGA Distribution, makes up the bulk of group earnings. It supplies to IGA, Foodworks, Foodland, Lucky 7 stores and the 7-Eleven convenience store giant.\nStock upgrade JPMorgan released a report on Friday with a dramatic change to its recommendation. \"Following a period in which we have been pessimistically disposed toward Metcash,\" it said, \"with an underweight since March 2014 and recommendation shifting from underweight to neutral since November 2007, we have reviewed our investment thesis and upgrade the stock from underweight to overweight.\"\nIt said changes to the balance sheet after the sale of its automotive business to reduce debt, share price underperformance and recent management changes prompted the changed recommendation.\nMetcash's alcohol and hardware divisions are travelling well but management needs to make sure they are given attention and financial support at a time when the focus is on fixing the core wholesale grocery business.\nSpeculation has been rife that if Woolworths decides to exit its struggling hardware business, Metcash would swoop in, particularly to buy the Danks business and create a big independent hardware chain.\nIndeed, such a move by Woolworths could be a catalyst for private equity to buy Metcash, which could then break up Metcash and merge the Mitre 10 hardware business with Danks.\nIndependent hardware chain Ace Hardware Corporation, based in the United States, has shown there is room in the market for independent hardware chains to survive quite comfortably and coexist with giants such as Lowes and Home Depot.\nFor now, Metcash has a lot on its plate. The board and senior management have taken a gamble that there is inherent value in the stock. But the clock is ticking. If investors don't buy the turnaround narrative at investor day and the share price continues to fall, Hamish Douglass' portent that the company will disappear in the next decade might need to be revised to sooner. Whatever the case, the board and management team are ready to give it a red hot go.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@adele_ferguson"], "published": "2015-09-27T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:07:32.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
