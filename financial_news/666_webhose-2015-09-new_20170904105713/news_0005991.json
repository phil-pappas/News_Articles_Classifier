Here Are 9 Fuel-Efficient Diesels Not Named Volkswagen Written by: Laurie Kulikowski 09/30/15 - 10:11 AM EDT Tickers in this article: FCAU \nThis story has been updated from Sept. 26, 2015 with additional information from Volkswagen. NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Do you like the idea of driving a diesel-fueled car, but Volkswagen's cheating on emissions tests has got you scared to buy one? Well, we have some options for you. \nVolkswagen admitted to using software to cheat on emission tests on its diesel cars in the U.S., which regulators estimate to have affected about 482,000 cars sold in the U.S. (Volkswagen said that the tally is closer to five million cars worldwide in a statement on Tuesday, while announcing a plan of action .) Those cars include models Jetta, Beetle, Golf, Passat and Audi sold over multiple years, according to U.S. regulators. Essentially the software made it look like the cars involved were more fuel efficient than they actually were. \nSo what's the big deal about diesel fuel anyway? \"Much of the appeal of diesels comes from their fuel economy , which is typically better than that of their gasoline-powered equivalents,\" despite higher price tags for the vehicles, according to Edmunds.com.
