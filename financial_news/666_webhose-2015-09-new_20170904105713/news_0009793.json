Statutory inspections and maintenance is performed, and modifications, that will ensure that international safety standards continue to be met or that improve the plant performance, are implemented. \nKoeberg unit 2 has been on stream without any interruption since its last refuelling outage which was completed in May 2014. Additionally, Koeberg unit 1 is currently operating optimally and is contributing 930 MW to the national grid. \n\"Medupi unit 6, which became fully operational last week, together with other units from Eskom's fleet of 27 power stations, will continue to be used to meet the country's electricity needs,\" said Eskom. \nIt called on all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly in order to reduce the risk of load shedding. \n\"Businesses and households can make a difference by implementing saving measures in their processes and daily lives. Eskom implements load shedding as a last resort to protect the grid, shedding only what is required to balance demand and supply,\" said Eskom. \n\"We are implementing our maintenance plan to increase the reliability of our plant, which will in turn increase our operating reserves and stabilise the grid.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:55:51.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
