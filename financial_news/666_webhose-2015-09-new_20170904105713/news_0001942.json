But now this ancient relationship is breaking down in the face of a higher power: the Federal Reserve.\nGold typically rises and falls with people’s expectations about inflation: up when it accelerates, down when it slows. While the metal traditionally would’ve been expected to fall in an era of low inflation, the threat of rising interest rates that would send investors to competing assets has proven to be a bigger driver. That’s helping break a 2,000-year-old dynamic for bullion, which was first used as a store of value in coin currency in 550 B.C.\nThere have been “ultra-low rates for a very long time, so all the historical norms and everything we’ve modeled in terms of how to price gold and how gold has behaved needs to be reexamined,” Oliver Pursche, the chief executive officer of Bruderman Brothers in New York, said in a telephone interview.\nWhen Fed policy makers left U.S. interest rates unchanged near zero percent on Thursday they cited stubbornly low inflation, and bullion rose to a two-week high. Low inflation meant prices fell in 2013 and 2014. Now that same lack of inflation is allowing the central bank to wait longer before tightening monetary policy.\nThe evidence of a new relationship can be seen in the link between bullion and inflation expectations, measured by the 10-year Treasury break-even rate. The 120-day correlation has turned negative, signaling the assets are starting to move in opposite directions.\n120-Day Correlation for Gold, 10-Year Break-Even\nPreviously, the U.S. central bank has fanned inflation fears, which boosted gold prices 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011, as the Fed bought debt and held borrowing costs near zero percent in a bid to shore up growth.\nSpot gold reached $1,133.93 an ounce on Thursday, the highest since Sept. 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:14:52.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
