But Seth Terkper believes that measures being taken by government will ensure that the effect on the economy is managed. \nOn decision by the US Federal Reserve to keep its rate unchanged at 0 percent, Mr. Seth Terkper believed that even a rate hike could have affected the economy and upcoming Eurobond. \nThe Finance Minister was of the view that the most investors would rather peg their hopes on the country’s economic prospects, which might convince them to bring the capital into the country. \nMr. Tekper noted that the Ghanaian economy has very bright medium term prospects, supported by an expanded services sector; the discovery of more oil and gas fields (TEN and Sankofa) and the coming on stream of the country’s own gas processing plant. \n“Government recognizes that it is critical to address its short-term challenges immediately to safeguard these bright prospects and it has, therefore, taken the necessary steps and remains committed to stabilizing the economy and achieving its medium term macroeconomic objectives”. \nMinister acknowledged that seasonal factors and rising inflation continue to be a challenge in controlling cedi’s depreciation. He said both government and the Central Bank are implementing short, medium and long term structural and policy measures to stabilize the situation. \nOn his part, Dean of the University of Ghana Business School, Professor Joshua Yindenaba Abor said the public lecture was part of the School’s plan to bridge the gap between the academia and policy makers. \nThis, he said, would specifically afford academia the opportunity to be updated on current developments in policymaking as well as offer policymakers the opportunity to receive inputs from academia that could shape policy. \n“Our vision is to become a world-class research intensive University by the next decade. Therefore we are focused on carrying out policy relevant research and also engaging policy makers on critical policy issues” he added. \nHe noted that the program, will also offer students and lectures a good opportunity to interrogate some of the issues that affect economic policy and also proffer some useful recommendations based on some of their research findings and observations.
