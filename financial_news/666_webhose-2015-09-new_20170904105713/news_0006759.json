Mind The Gap Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Sydney has seen the lowest spring clearance rates in three years rates and more agents are saying the peak of the property boom has probably passed .\nSydney, which recorded a 73 per cent preliminary clearance rate at the weekend according to RP Data, may even move below 70 per cent as early as next week Domain Group senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said.\n\"Sydney is plunging,\" Dr Wilson said.\n\"September has seen the lowest spring clearance rate in three years and it's no spike, it's consistent. We may be looking at a clearance rate below 70 per cent before year's end. That could even happen at next weekend's Super Saturday.\"\nStarryland Australia had it's second launch of its Promenade project in Parramatta, selling more than 100 units. Supplied. One large two-bedroom apartment at 127 Albion Street in the inner Sydney suburb of Surry Hills sold through Bresic Whitney for $1.1 million - ahead of the suggested price of over $1.05 million - but not without some intense negotiation between the vendor, the agents, and the highest bidder.\nBidding had stalled so the auctioneer raised the stakes with a vendor bid of $1.1 million. After some negotiation, the vendor bid was withdrawn and replaced with a genuine $1.1 million offer from the highest bidder. Further negotiation followed before the apartment, number 8, went on the market at $1.1 million and was sold without a further offer.\nThere were more than 2000 auctions scheduled across capital cities for the seventh straight week according to RP Data preliminary figures.\nFrustration from buyers is starting to show at auctions said Damien Cooley of Cooley Auctions. The firm had a clearance rate of 74 per cent, with 64 homes selling out of 86 auctions.\n \"Like any boom people wonder when you're at the top and we have probably passed the peak,\" Mr Cooley said.\n\"There is a real sense of urgency among buyers about selling before the end of the year. But money is cheap and prices will still rise and there will continue to be good sales results.\"\nIn some areas homes are still fetching as much as $200,000 above reserve, such as a four-bedroom home in Balmain on Saturday. The 60 Clayton Street property sold for $2.4 million through Belle Property.\nIn Parramatta on Saturday buyers queued up from 6.30am for Chinese-backed developer Starryland's second release of its Promenade project. First home buyers, Douglas Tran and Catherin Nguyen bought a top floor 2 bedder for $750k through CBRE.\n\"We looked around Top Ryde and Strathfield and couldn't get that price for a 2 bedder,\" Mr Tran said.\nMelbourne's preliminary auction clearance rate was 73 per cent, which is higher than a year ago. But there is a softening demand for units in the inner-city Wakelin Property Advisory director Richard Wakelin said.\n\"I attended two 2-bedroom unit auctions in South Yarra on Saturday and there is a noticeable shift from a year ago. Attendance has thinned out considerably and bidding is lukewarm,\" Mr Wakelin.\nBut a six-bedroom trophy home in Camberwell attracted a crowd of nearly 300 people and five bidders. The property at 27-29 Kintore Street sold for $7.7 million. The price guide had been for $7.5 million-plus.\n\"There's still considerable depth in the high end sector and trophy homes like this brought out discretionary buyers,\" Mr Wakelin said, who advised the vendors.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-09-20T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:06:10.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
