Some analysts estimate that this facility could eventually drain more than $1 trillion from the system on a daily basis as the Fed lifts rates.\nU.S. money market mutual funds placing that much money at the Fed each day will free up an equivalent amount of short-term dollar-denominated instruments, such as U.S. Treasury bills, for others to invest in—including foreign reserve managers at central banks around the world.\nPozsar, who has been studying the plumbing of the modern financial system for years in positions at the New York Fed and U.S. Treasury, has just suggested in a report that there are already signs of increased interest from foreign reserve managers in dollar assets, especially given that their euros now yield negative rates.\nHe points to a lesser-known reverse repo facility at the New York Fed—one it operates for foreign accounts.\nAs of Wednesday, Aug. 26, foreign reserve managers held $163 billion in reverse repos at the New York Fed, up 44 percent from $113 billion at the end of 2014.\nThe rise is an indication of \"reserve managers’ strong demand for safe, short-term, U.S. dollar instruments,\" Pozsar writes. \"But the foreign repo pool is not full allotment. Its size is determined by the New York Fed.\"\nThe overnight reverse repo facility the Fed will use to lift rates here at home, on the other hand, will probably be full allotment—meaning the Fed will do as many overnight reverse repos with money funds as the market demands—once the Fed begins raising rates, according to Pozsar.\n\"A full allotment facility could lead to money funds trading out of U.S. Treasury bills, leaving more for FX reserve managers to invest in,\" he wrote. \"This in turn could unlock flows that are constrained by quantities at present.\"\nThe dollar&apos;s rise has been a source of apprehension for Fed officials as they try to figure out when to raise rates for the first time in nearly 10 years. The minutes of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee&apos;s July 28-29 meeting revealed that some participants \"discussed the risk that a possible divergence in interest rates in the United States and abroad might lead to further appreciation of the dollar, extending the downward pressure on commodity prices and the weakness in net exports,\" which have to an extent hindered U.S. inflation and economic growth.\nNevertheless, \"most participants still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would prove to be temporary.\"\nThe risk is that big flows from foreign central banks rotating out of euros and into dollars over the coming quarters drags out this \"temporary\" dynamic for a while longer.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ifkCuyXA5MzI/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150819a.htm\\"], "published": "2015-09-01T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:27:45.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
