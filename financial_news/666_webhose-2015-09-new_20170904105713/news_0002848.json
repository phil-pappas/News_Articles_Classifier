PUBLISHED: 17:25, Fri, Sep 18, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:34, Fri, Sep 18, 2015 GETTY The pound has jumped agaisnt the euro and US dollar in recent days \nAfter plunging against the euro in August, the pound bounced up by as much as 1.2 per cent to reach €1.3759 this week off the back of stronger than expected British wage growth. Sterling is still a long way off it its mid-July high of €1.44 however, if economy data continues to provide a stronger case for the Bank of England to hike rates, the pound could push higher in the weeks ahead. Darren Kilner, currency expert at FAIRFX said: “After a few weeks of a weaker pound there’s been some cheer this week. \"The news that average UK salaries have risen by 2.9 per cent - the highest we’ve seen in the UK since 2009 - gave the pound a boost meaning it strengthen against the euro.\"The pound was also helped by the release of data which showed unemployment is at a 7-year low, falling to 5.5 per cent.\"The rebound in the pound is good for those who are planning a trip in September or are planning a getaway in the face of promises of bad weather to come.\"If you are heading off soon, then make sure you capitalise on the strength of the pound.”The pound has also jumped up against the US dollar after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last night held American interest rates and signalled that a rise may not happen before next year. Sterling now stands at $1.56, recovering from five month lows notched up last week. Chris Towner, director of FX advisory services at HiFX, said: “The FOMC announced it had decided to sit on its hands and leave rates on hold into the much anticipated interest rate announcement. \"It blamed recent global financial developments, while at the same time citing softer exports and low inflation. This has put the US dollar under pressure and GBP/USD has since jumped up higher to trade back above 1.5600. \"It now looks as though it could still hike rates this year in December, but this still remains data dependent and could be stalled further into 2016.“This activity has put downward pressure on the US dollar and the outlook over the weeks to come is for the US dollar to continue to trade on the back foot. What we are seeing currently is GBP/USD taking the scenic route higher towards 1.60. \"Having traded at 1.5800 in the last week of August, sterling then weakened to levels below 1.5200 in the first week of September before bouncing back to current levels in the 1.56’s. That previous 1.5800 high from August is now in GBP/USD sights and over time we can expect a challenge on 1.60.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T17:10:22.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
