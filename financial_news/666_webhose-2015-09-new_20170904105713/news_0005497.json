After delays and much hand-wringing, the first Tesla Motors Inc. all-electric Model X vehicles will roll out of the company’s Fremont, Calif., factory door on Tuesday.\nTesla TSLA, -2.36% will mark the occasion with an event scheduled to start at 7 p.m. Pacific. The press invitation was quite simple (a shadowed Model X with its falcon wings up); the event is unlikely to be so subdued.\nTesla has wanted to make an SUV for some time, and even expressed that wish before the first Model S sedans were on the road.\nWhen Tesla executives were making the rounds ahead of the company’s 2010 initial public offering, their slide show presented four body possibilities based on the same car platform: a sedan as well as an SUV, a cabriolet, and a van.\nWhile the cabriolet and van never materialized, the SUV concept was spot on. SUVs, including compact SUVs, have been gaining ground over other car body types in the last few years.\nSee also: Tesla’s secret weapon in the battle for luxury car market may be women\nThe Model X is more than a year behind schedule, but investors don’t appear to mind. Tesla shares are up 18% so far this year, and have gained 6.2% in the past 12 months. They have lost some ground in the past three months (down 2.5%), but that performance compares with losses of 5.5% for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05% so far this year, losses of 1.1% in the last 12 months, and a crushing retreat of 7.5% for the index in the past three months.\nHere’s what you should know about the Model X:\nPatience is a virtue Buyers reserving their Model X now can expect to get the car in early 2016, according to Tesla’s website. They also have to shell out $5,000 to reserve the car, which is double the amount for buyers looking to reserve a Tesla Model S (such buyers are looking at a November delivery date for their sedans.)\nThe wait was even longer for the early adopters, who made the first reservations in 2012. Think the $5,000 reservation deposit is pricey? Those who wanted the fully loaded “Signature” version had to put down $40,000 to reserve their car.\nIt’s a pretty price Which takes us to price. Tesla has not disclosed base prices for the X. When the owners of those first “Signature” models received their invitations to configure their cars, however, it became known that those one-of-a-kind founders’ cars would cost at least $132,000 ($144,000 with add-ons such as the “ludicrous” speed mode and other accessories.
