Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jens Meyer The Australian dollar has sailed through levels considered fair value relative to economic fundamentals and has begun to provide a stimulatory tailwind to the non-mining economy, ANZ Research says.\nANZ currency strategist Daniel Been looked at past periods of currency swings, noting that if history is any guide an overshoot is likely to persist for some time.\n\"The currency tends to spend more time on either side of fair value than it does actually trading at fair value,\" Been wrote in a note on Monday, adding that ANZ currently estimates fair value at US72¢.\nThe bank puts the currency's trough at US67¢, but sees a downside risk to its prediction that could take the Aussie below US60¢.\nThe overshoot begins. ANZ, Bloomberg \"The overshoot is still justified by global circumstances and by the softer, more volatile growth outlook in particular,\" Been said.\nThe Australian dollar briefly jumped above US71¢ for the first time in two weeks on Monday morning, before dropping back to US70.84¢ in early afternoon trade, following a plunge in Chinese sharemarkets.\nAccording to the data ANZ has looked at, the dollar actually spends more than 60 per cent of its time above fair value.\nBut when the Aussie is on the cheap side of fair value it has a much longer and flatter tail than the opposite, Been said.\n \"In particular we can see that if the Australian dollar is trading more than half a standard deviation away from fair value, then it is more likely to overshoot by more than one standard deviation.\"\nThe recent move below US70¢ mean it has fallen into this territory, ANZ says, adding that makes more falls likely.\n\"A move below one standard deviation will open up downside for a move below US60¢.\"\nSo when's the dollar likely to turn higher? Been reckons we'd need to see an improvement in both the local and the regional economy.\n\"In those instances when we have seen a turn at this point it was at a time when the fundamental backdrop was becoming unambiguously favourable and where fair value was starting to trend higher,\" he said.\n\"The turning points have also come at a point where Australian assets were trading at a discount to global assets - but they are currently still at a premium.\"\nANZ's view on the local currency overshooting on the downside was echoed by St George, which on Monday said markets had taken an overly pessimistic view on the outlook for China, the domestic economy and interest rates.\nSt George economist Janu Chan said the bank's expectations of the broader outlook for the Australian economy were not materially different from a few months ago, adding it expected the RBA to leave rates on hold until late 2016.\n\"We therefore see a risk that the Australian dollar will partly rebound. We are maintaining our end of year forecast at US73¢, but we recognise that downside risks exist for our forecast while sentiment remains fragile. Volatility has escalated and there remains more uncertainty than usual surrounding our forecast.\"\nBut Chan expects the dollar to come under pressure during 2016, as the tightening cycle of the Federal Reserve takes hold and predicts the Aussie to track close to US70¢.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@jemeyx"], "published": "2015-09-14T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:04:32.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
