Two industry sources said some options were cutting spending on well servicing and shutting down old wells. \nRussia has taken the opposite approach in response to slumping oil prices. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was quoted as saying by Interfax on Wednesday that Russia might increase oil output by 1 percent this year from 10.6 million barrels per day in 2014. \nMexico, which like Russia and Kazakhstan is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), will also not consider cutting oil output at the moment, Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters on Tuesday. \nKASHAGAN HOPES \nOil production in Kazakhstan is falling anyway as the bulk its fields are depleting. Output dropped 1.2 percent last year to 80.8 million tonnes and is expected to fall again in 2015. \nThe Chevron-led venture, Tengizchevroil, is Kazakhstan's largest oil producer. Last year, its output fell 1.5 percent to 26.7 million tonnes and is expected to remain unchanged in 2015. \nKazakhstan was hoping to boost oil output, a major source of budget revenues, through the Caspian offshore Kashagan oil field, which was finally launched in September 2013 after huge delays and cost overruns. \nBut Kashagan halted production a few weeks later when gas leaks were detected and it is not expected to be up and running before 2017, a date confirmed by Karabalin on Wednesday. \nKazakhstan officials had expected the country to be producing between 90 million tonnes and 100 million already in 2015, thanks to Kashagan. \nOn Wednesday, Karabalin said the lower forecasts were not due to Kashagan's delays: \"This is not about Kashagan, but because the oil price is different now and costs are different.\" (Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Moscow and Ana Isabel Martinez in Mexico City; writing by Katya Golubkova; editing by David Clarke)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:48:33.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
