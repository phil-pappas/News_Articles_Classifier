Read Full Bio→ Twitter \nMost people would like to save money, but some simply feel they can't because they're living paycheck-to-paycheck. \nOthers might have a little extra money some months but not others. Some simply lack the focus and discipline to put money away every month. An app called Digit may provide them with an answer. Analyzes your checking account \nThe company that makes this free app says it's pretty simple. Once you set up an account, Digit automatically analyzes your checking account each week, taking note of your income and spending. It then isolates small amounts of money and transfers it to your Digit account. \nThe automatic savings sweep typically ranges between $5 and $50, depending on how your expenses are lining up. When you have an unexpected expense, for example, Digit transfers less money from your checking account into savings, or none at all. \n“We never transfer more than you can afford, so you don't have to worry about over-drafting your account,” the company says. “In fact, we have a no-overdraft guarantee.” \nUnder that guarantee, the company says if your account goes into overdraft status because of money the app has transferred to savings, the company pays the overdraft fee. The company says it also uses 128-bit bank-level security and does not store users' bank login information. Exercises discipline \nThe app exercises the savings discipline so you don't have to. The money transferred to the Digit account is just as accessible as any money put into a savings account. If you need it, you simply text Digit and the app transfers the amount you specify back to your checking account. \nThe money in your Digit account is actually kept in a bank, so it is FDIC insured up to $250,000. \nDigit users don't earn interest on their savings, but frankly most people with savings accounts in banks earn very little these days anyway. However, the company says there is a way for Digit users to earn rewards. Digit Plus \nDigit Plus rewards users who keep their money in savings for three months by paying five cents for every $100. Translated into APR, that amounts to only a fraction of a point in interest – but that's a good bit more than banks pay on a passbook savings account. In fact, some banks actually charge you a fee to maintain a savings account. \nWhen you earn rewards, Digit sends you a text with the amount. You then have the option of adding it to your savings or receiving it in the form of a gift card. \nIf you have a checking and savings account at a bank or credit union, it probably has a way for you to automatically sweep a set amount of money each month from checking into savings, but it will be the same amount each month. \nRegardless of how you save, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling urges consumers to have a plan that is consistent. Digit offers the flexibility of adjusting the amount, based on cash flow. For consumers who have had trouble getting started on a savings plan, it might be a good first step.
