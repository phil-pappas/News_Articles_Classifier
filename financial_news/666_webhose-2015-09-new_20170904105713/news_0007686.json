Analysts said the imports data could lead to further policy easing from the Chinese government in coming months.\nThose hopes boosted U.S. shares, while data showing Germany saw imports and exports hit record highs in value terms in July underpinned gains in European stocks. Germany's benchmark DAX share index ended up 1.6 percent.\nA late bounce in Chinese stocks, which pushed the Shanghai Composite Index up 2.9 percent after earlier declines, also supported European shares.\n\"With volatility having receded somewhat during the past few days it appears that investors have been reassessing the potential negative fallout from the slowdown in China,\" said Markus Huber, a senior analyst at Peregrine & Black.\nBrent crude prices rose as strength in stock markets helped the global oil benchmark recoup the bulk of its loss in the previous session.\nBrent crude settled up $1.89, or 3.97 percent, at $49.52 a barrel. U.S. crude, meanwhile, settled down 11 cents, or 0.24 percent, at $45.94 per barrel.\nMSCI's all-country world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last up 6.26 points or 1.63 percent, to 390.91.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was last up 363.55 points, or 2.26 percent, at 16,465.93. The S&P 500 was up 42.69 points, or 2.22 percent, at 1,963.91. The Nasdaq Composite was up 111.52 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,795.44.\nEurope's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1.16 percent at 1,415.58.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose as investors prepared for the possibility of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates next week for the first time in almost a decade, and as the Treasury sells $58 billion in new supply this week. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 17/32 in price to yield 2.19 percent, from a yield of 2.13 percent late Friday.\nThe renewed risk appetite led the dollar to gain against the safe-haven yen, but the greenback still inched lower against the euro. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.24 percent .\n\"The market is trading more risk-on across the board,\" said BNP Paribas FX strategist Sam Lynton-Brown in London.\nSpot gold prices were last up $2.43 or 0.22 percent, to $1,121.53 an ounce.
