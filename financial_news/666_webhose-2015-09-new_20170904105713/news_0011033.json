Pat Scala Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Myer shareholders have backed the retailer's $600 million turnaround plan by snapping up shares in a $221 million equity raising , but analysts have described the five-year strategy as \"evolutionary rather than revolutionary\" and are sceptical it will deliver much-needed sales growth.\nMyer shares are expected to resume trading on Thursday just above the rights offer price of 94¢ a share, but well below the theoretical ex-rights price of $1.13 and Monday's close of $1.21, reflecting uncertainty over the department store chain's prospects.\nMarket sources said there was a $20 million shortfall in the $104 million institutional offer but it was oversubscribed \"many times over\" in a bookbuild by underwriter Goldman Sachs. A $117 million retail offer, which kicks off next week, has been fully sub-underwritten.\nFund managers said the timing of the $221 million entitlement offer was less than ideal, coming amid another rout on equity markets and immediately after Myer reported a 21 per cent fall in underlying net profit for 2015 and forecast a 15 per cent fall in profits this year.\n\"It's a precarious capital raising because the stock will no doubt trade below the theoretical ex-rights price because the profit result was poor and there are some tough times ahead,\" Arnhem Asset Management fund manager Martin Duncan said.\n\"If they achieve the objective of engaging new customers and keeping existing ones, perhaps they can survive in what is an increasingly competitive retail market,\" Mr Duncan said.\n\"But you have to question whether this allows them to move forward or whether the investment they're making is just stay-in-business investment – does it allow them to mark time or genuinely deliver growth?\"\nPerpetual takes up all rights Myer's largest shareholder, Perpetual Investments, is understood to have taken up all its rights.\n\"The capital raising gives the company flexibility in executing the new plan,\" Perpetual's head of equities, Paul Skamvougeras said.\nMyer plans to spend $600 million over the next five years closing as many as 13 underperforming stores, reducing space for slow-growing categories and house brands, introducing new brands and categories and improving visual merchandising, fitting rooms, service and online retailing in a bid to reverse a 20-year decline in sales.\nNew chief executive Richard Umbers is aiming to restore sales growth to more than 3 per cent a year, grow earnings at a faster rate than sales and boost return on funds employed from 10.7 per cent to more than 15 per cent by 2020 by being more relevant to \"high-value customers\".\nAnalysts agree with key elements of the strategy but said its success will depend on how well it is executed. Most analysts slashed profit forecasts to take into account Myer's 2016 guidance and earnings per share dilution from the capital raising.\n\"We like the focus on sales and gross profit productivity, but many of the changes are evolutionary, not revolutionary,\" said Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford, who raised his rating from sell to neutral with a target price of $1.10.\nMyer's objective to grow sales by more than 3 per cent a year – reaching a record $3.7 billion by 2020 – was \"noble\" but \"ambitious\", based on Myer's past form, he said. The retailer has not achieved 3 per cent sales growth since 2006.\nMore detail needed \"We feel the company needs to provide more detail about the sales drivers in order to build some investor confidence,\" Mr Woolford said. The strategy is heavily dependent on boosting sales of concessions, which currently account for 16 per cent of sales but 50 per cent of group earnings.\n﻿ Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Simotas, who maintained his sell rating, said the capital raising provided Myer with some breathing room and the renewed emphasis on store productivity and brands and categories that would deliver the best sales and profit outcomes seemed sensible.\n\"The strategy is not without risk and the group's inability to grow sales in the past does not instil confidence,\" Mr Simotas said, \"but other department stores offshore are performing well by focusing on the core fashion and cosmetics categories\".\nUBS analyst Ben Gilbert said Myer's plan to target so-called \"high-value\" customers and attract fashion-forward consumers was \"high risk\", particularly against a heightened competitive backdrop, but management's strategy and the level of capex allocated to it seemed sensible.\nAnalysts also applauded Myer's decision to close as many as 13 of its 66 stores and allocate as much as 86 per cent of capex on the top 23 stores, but worried remaining stores that missed out on refurbishment could become run down.\n\"This truly gives customers the potential to \"find wonderful\" [but] we worry they will also \"find woeful\" in the tail of the stores,\" said CLSA analyst David Thomas.\n\"While we recommend investors take up their rights, we are not of the opinion they should be held for too long,\" Mr Thomas said. \"Getting to 3 per cent sales growth is likely beyond the group, and we cut our price target to 90¢ from 99¢.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-09-02T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:05:44.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
