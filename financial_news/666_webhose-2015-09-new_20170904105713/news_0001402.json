Fowler, EA, leading expert in tax resolution issues and CEO of Taxation Solutions, attempts to ease the mind of taxpayers dealing with IRS tax issues by highlighting some of the groups that are going after the IRS.\nHouston, TX – September 9, 2015 – Barry G. Fowler, CEO of Taxation Solutions, posted a new article entitled “The IRS Goes After Taxpayers. Who Goes After the IRS?” Surprising as it may seem, according to Mr. Fowler there are plenty of people and groups suing the IRS.\nFowler writes, “From professional sports teams to politicians to professional tax analysts, the IRS is pretty much always being sued for a multitude of diverse reasons. So, take heart, the IRS is under scrutiny and pressure from every direction.” However, he adds, “The big difference though is that, unlike you and me and every other taxpaying citizen who comes under pressure from the IRS, the giant government agency appears to be pretty bulletproof no matter who goes after them.”\nAnd, as Fowler notes, “These events certainly don’t alleviate the pressure regular taxpayers experience when the IRS comes calling. However, it might just make you realize that your issues are pretty minor in the larger scheme of things and you just might not lose as much sleep!”\nThe entire article can be read at http://www.taxationsolutions.net/the-irs-goes-after-taxpayers-who-goes-after-the-irs/\nAbout Barry G.
