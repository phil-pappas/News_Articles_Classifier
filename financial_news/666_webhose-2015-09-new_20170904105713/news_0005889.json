(NYSE:FCEA and FCEB) announced today that its subsidiary, Nets Sports & Entertainment (NS&E), made a $26.8 million payment for capital calls and fees related to its ownership interest in the Brooklyn Nets. The payment covers NS&E's share of team losses plus fees for the period of July 13, 2013, through September 8, 2015. The company had previously announced that a forbearance agreement related to the payment had been extended through September 8. View photo . \nCommenting on the payment, Forest City President and CEO David J. LaRue noted, \"We have chosen to make this payment to preserve NS&E's 20 percent ownership interest in the team, rather than suffer dilution which would reduce that interest to approximately 8 percent.\" \nThe funding of the forbearance payment does not impact the company's previously disclosed intention to seek a sale of its interest in the Nets, and it remains in active discussions with interested parties for a potential sale. There can be no assurance that the company will close on the sale of a portion or all of its ownership interest on terms favorable to it or at all. \nNS&E is the consolidated subsidiary through which Forest City holds its ownership interests in the Nets and the Barclays Center arena. NS&E owns 20 percent of the Nets and 55 percent of Barclays Center. Forest City, in turn, owns approximately 62 percent of NS&E with the balance owned by minority partners. \nAbout Forest City Forest City Enterprises, Inc. is an NYSE-listed national real estate company with $10.3 billion in consolidated assets. The company is principally engaged in the ownership, development, management and acquisition of commercial and residential real estate throughout the United States.
