TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\"We rate KKR & CO LP (KKR) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, attractive valuation levels, increase in net income, expanding profit margins and growth in earnings per share. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\"\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 6.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 48.7%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Capital Markets industry. The net income increased by 111.2% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $178.22 million to $376.31 million. The gross profit margin for KKR & CO LP is currently very high, coming in at 86.52%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 9.33% trails the industry average. KKR & CO LP reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, KKR & CO LP reported lower earnings of $1.28 versus $2.29 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.76 versus $1.28).
