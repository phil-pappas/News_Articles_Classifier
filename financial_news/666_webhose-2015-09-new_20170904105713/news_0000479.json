Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger The national auction clearance rate rose above 70 per cent on one of the biggest weekends of the year and Sydney's east was the standout market, where nine of out ten properties sold under the hammer.\nHowever, clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne remained below 75 per cent according to both CoreLogic RP Data and Fairfax-owned Domain Group, well down from the 85 per cent and higher clearance rates achieved earlier in the year.\nAnd Domain senior economist Andrew Wilson said the Sydney market was evolving into a buyer's market with \"Sydney's great auction boom clearly ended\".\nIn Melbourne, buyer's agent Richard Wakelin said there was a rebalancing of the market underway. \"I think clearance rates will continue to fall to between 65 and 70 per cent.\n\"In terms of price growth, there will be little or no price growth for the rest of the year, particularly in the second-hand unit sector,\" he said.\nA total of 2,820 auctions were held over the week, up from 2,565 over the previous week. CoreLogic RP Data recorded a 71.3 per cent preliminary national clearance rate, up from 69.9 per cent last week while Domain recorded 70.8 per cent.\nIn Sydney, where 1,193 homes were taken to auction, a preliminary clearance rate of 74.2 per cent was recorded across 974 results. The same week last year, the clearance rate was 76.9 per cent from 933 auctions.\nHighlights included a five-bedroom home in the exclusive eastern suburbs harbourside enclave of Darling point, which sold for $7.75 million - $2.75 million above its reserve price of $5 million - and likely to be knocked down.\n On Sydney's Lower North Shore,Belle Property Mosman Principal, Tim Foote said based on market sentiment and inquiry levels, he believed the sub-$2 million market had peaked.\nBut he said that in the upper price brackets, the declining dollar has boosted prestige prices this year, as it is encouraging more ex-pats and Chinese buyers into the market.\n\"I think the change of Prime Minister will provide a boost to business confidence and this is very important for the prestige real estate sector. When business is doing well and investing for future growth, there is a flow through effect to prestige property prices,\" Mr Foote said.\nIn the Sydney off-the-plan apartment, One A Erskineville by Linear Group and ASX-listed Abacus Property launched featuring 172 mainly one and two bedroom apartments starting from $625,000 launching with a modest 80 selling on Saturday.\nMelbourne's preliminary auction clearance rate was 73.3 per cent almost unchanged from the previous week's final result of 73.7 per cent despite a higher number of auctions - 1,197 compared with 1,127 held last week.\nHowever, it was still the fourth lowest clearance rate for the year. Last year, there were only 112 Melbourne auctions over the same weekend due to the AFL Grand Final, which was a week earlier.\nIn Melbourne, the strength was in the outer eastern suburbs, where an 81.8 per cent clearance rate was achieved followed by the inner south region where the preliminary clearance rate was 80 per cent.\nMelbourne buyer's agent Frank Valentic described the unit market as \"patchy\" with lower demand.\nBrisbane's preliminary clearance rate was 58.9 per cent this week, compared to 50 per cent last week and 48.9 per cent at the same time last year with 199 auctions held, up from 143 last week, according to CoreLogic RP Data\nAcross the Gold Coast, 54.3 per cent of the reported auctions have sold.\nAdelaide hosted 127 auctions this week and across the 80 reported results, CoreLogic RP Data's preliminary auction clearance rate is 68.8 per cent.\nPerth's clearance rate was 36 per cent from 25 auctions.
