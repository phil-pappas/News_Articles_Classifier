The Turkish development Agency- TIKA, sponsored 14 midwives from across Ghana to Turkey to be trained in maternal health and also trained some Ghanaian diplomats. The agency also assisted in the renovation of the science resource centre at the Achimota School in Accra. \nTIKA has also indicated its readiness to support Ghana in areas of tourism, industry, agriculture, forestry, fishing and transport. \nDr. Asiedu noted that, the Turkish EXIM Bank was also financing water improvement projects in Akim Oda, Akwatia and Winneba in Ghana, while the Turkish government also sponsored through scholarships, about 50 Ghanaian students annually to Turkey for studies in Turkish Universities at all levels. \nDr Asiedu called for effective follow-up on potential buyers identified during the fair in order to confirm orders for the products exhibited. \nHe explained that because such fairs did not afford the exhibitors enough time to have in-depth discussions with the potential buyers and investors who visit the stands during the fair, it was very important to do follow-up meetings. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:24:51.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
