The IRS decision to remain mum about the deal for now raised worry by investors that a big tax bill may be in store. \nUnder the spinoff plan, which was announced early this year, all outstanding shares of Aabaco will be distributed to Yahoo stock holders. \nYahoo will also transfer to Aabaco services for small businesses that it hosts in its Internet cloud. \nYahoo bought a 40 percent stake in the Chinese company in 2005 for $1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:22:34.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
