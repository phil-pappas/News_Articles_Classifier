Photo: Supplied\nMeet the cauliflower kings.\nThe Talbot family got their start supplying vegetables to miners on the Victorian goldfields. Remarkably, 159 years later the business still reigns supreme from its new Epping base.\nThat achievement was celebrated recently when the business, RJ and KA Talbot, took out the generational award in the 2015 Melbourne Lord Mayor's Commendations.\nThe award is not easy to come by. To qualify, the business must have been operated by the same family within the city of Melbourne for three or more generations. Plus, the current proprietor must have been in the role for at least 10 years.\nAdvertisement So what does it take to keep thriving in the vegetable growing and wholesaling business? Loyal customers, for starters.\nIt supplies many of the inner-city's independent greengrocers with its locally grown cauliflower, cabbage and lettuce. Some of them are the grandchildren of the customers originally supplied by their grandfather.\n\"Most of our customer base is from the old Italians that came out here in the 50s,\" says Wayne Talbot, who became co-proprietor in 1997, and works alongside his father, Robert, and brother Travis in the business.\n\"A lot of the Australians back then were pretty hard on the New Australians but my grandfather gave them a go and it's paid off in the long run because we've still got their respect.\"\nThey also aim to price in a way that is sustainable for everyone.\n\"There's been enough meat on the bone for everybody,\" he says.\nHowever, their bottom line has been fairly static for about the past 15 years as overheads have risen tenfold.\nNot surprisingly, the family has seen plenty of changes.\n\"Every strip shop in Melbourne used to have a greengrocer,\" Talbot says. \"Now, there's the major shopping centres and you've got one greengrocer in the big shopping centres.\"\nWhile that has meant fewer customers, the ones that remain are larger.\n\"When I used to come and help my dad when I was a kid in the '80s, we used to sell a lot of cauliflower – 50 at a time – that was an average order. Now, they buy 200 at a time, so the size of the shops are four times larger than they used to be.\"\nIs the rise of the NutriBullet and the raw food phenomenon helping to propel growth?\n\"We have grown cauliflowers forever but in the last two years, they've had a little bit of a comeback with all the paleo diets and all the publicity like MasterChef and healthy eating,\" Talbot says.\nStill, chasing the latest food fad is not really the family's style.\n\"We grew kale two years ago, just to give it a go,\" he says. \"It wasn't for us. It was very, very labour-intensive.\n\"We like the quick, bulky lines that are harvested in the paddock and loaded on the truck and gone. We try and limit our staff content by harvesting and packaging all in the one process, whereas other farmers harvest, refrigerate, unpack, repack, package and then send to market. Once something goes through the packing shed, you need to double its value.\"\nSo if kale isn't the answer, then what? When demand for their biggest earner – new potatoes – dropped, they turned to iceberg lettuce.\n\"We went back to growing iceberg lettuce. Everyone said iceberg lettuce is dead, but we sell truckloads of the stuff,\" Talbot says.\nTheir secret lies in the way they supply the lettuce.\n\"We supply our lettuce in our own wooden crates – some of them are 20 years old – and they hold 120 lettuces in a crate, so there's no damage. When they put them into cardboard waxed boxes, they get damaged, crushed at the bottom. Some shifty people hide small ones on the bottom.\"\nThe family's way of doing things means it's not that keen on fostering relationships with the major supermarkets or Melbourne's restaurant trade.\n\"We stopped supplying the big supermarkets when they started with their double standards,\" Talbot says. \"They wanted us to have all these quality assurance programs in place to cover their behind when they weren't even adhering to their own quality assurance standards.\"\nHe's equally sceptical of restaurateurs.\n\"They don't buy enough and the provedores – the guys that supply those restaurants – you're always chasing your money with those guys because the restaurants will play one supplier against another and a lot of them are fly-by-nighters. They close up today and open up in the wife's name tomorrow.\n\"Whereas the greengrocers that we've been dealing with for generations, you can walk out of the market and trust that you're going to get paid.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:31:28.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
