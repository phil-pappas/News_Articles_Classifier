Wells Fargo (Hanover: NWT.HA - news ) added 2.0 percent, JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news ) 1.8 percent, and Bank of America (Swiss: BAC.SW - news ) 2.1 percent. \nHelping build confidence was the Fed's periodic Beige Book survey, which depicted the economy still growing at a modest to moderate pace across most of the central bank's 12 districts, with survey respondents optimistic about the coming months. \n\"Respondents in most sectors across districts expected growth to continue at its recent pace,\" it said. \nAt the same time, it gave no evidence of inflationary pressures, nor of any strong tightening of the job market, that could force the Fed to start raising interest rates at its next meeting in two weeks. \nAnalysts cautioned that the volatility in stocks was not over. \n\"We're still in a pattern of a day down and a day up, or two days down and two days up,\" said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management. \n\"The market may just be adjusting at these lower levels until we get some new news.\" \nBond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to 2.19 percent from 2.17 percent Tuesday while the 30-year pushed to 2.97 percent from 2.93 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:31:07.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
