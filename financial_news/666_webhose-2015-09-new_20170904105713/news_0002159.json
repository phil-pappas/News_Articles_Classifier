Important note make sure you follow the SEC Rule regulation D for limited offerings as well as the Blue Sky Securities laws in Rhode Island and any State you plan on making such an offering. You should seek legal advice before venturing into a Securities offering. Securities offerings which raise money for coin grading fees essentially you are raising equity capital from investors which self liquidates when the coins are sold. \nSome large coin auction companies or coin dealers may negotiate with coin collectors for the subsequent sale by auction or private treaty and provide upfront funds to certify and encapsulate your raw ungraded coins .
