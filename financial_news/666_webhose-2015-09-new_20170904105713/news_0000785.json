At the top of the capital structure sits the equity and at the bottom is the debt. The equity enjoys voting rights over how the company is run and they receive a share of the profits each year. The value of the shares is closely linked to the fortunes of the company, when times are good they receive a greater share of the profits and their value increases. \nThe holders of the debt, by comparison, have no voting rights on day to day management and receive a fixed return. However, all that is reversed when a company gets into trouble. If a company enters administration then something called the pecking order comes into play. Under this the debt has first claim on profits, cash and any assets, while equity holders sit at the back of the queue behind employees, the taxman and any other creditors. This is what is happening at Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) . The fall in commodity prices is hitting the company’s share price and the creditors are in the driving seat as the focus shifts from the capital structure to the pecking order. \n= Sticky debt = \nGlencore floated back in 2011 at 530p giving it a market capitalisation of £38bn at the time. The company used the cash raised from investors in addition to debt to complete the purchase of mining giant Xstrata a year later. However, during the past five years commodity prices have collapsed and profits have fallen. But the debt remains. \nGlencore’s most recent results to the end of June show a debt pile of $47.3bn (£30.9bn), or $29.6bn excluding debt used to fund trading, against shareholder’s equity of $45bn. Glencore has always argued that it can rapidly sell its inventories of metals to reduce debts in the trading business. \nThe company is taking steps to reduce its debts further and raised $2.5bn through an equity placing earlier this month. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also cut dividend payments to keep more cash in the company. The plan is to reduce net debt to about $20bn by the end of 2016. \n= Vicious cycle = \nHowever, the company is now facing a particularly nasty situation: pre-tax profits are falling sharply on the back of commodity prices and it must cut debts to prevent a credit downgrade that would fatally wounded its trading operations. But by reducing borrowings the trading operations will be hamstrung and will see its profits fall further. \nIf investors have learnt one thing since the global credit crisis it is that there is no quick fix to a debt problem. Questor advised selling in January at 244p , we said sell at 159p in August and warned not to catch the falling knife at 132p last month. The advice remains, Sell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:06:16.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
