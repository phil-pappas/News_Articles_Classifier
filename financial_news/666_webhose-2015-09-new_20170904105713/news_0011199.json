Mining stocks became the biggest casualties as fears resurfaced that demand from the world’s largest metals consumer could be hit. \nIvan Szpakowski, of Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , said “commodity prices have been buffeted by volatile swings in Chinese equity and FX markets, and by concerns regarding underlying growth and policy response”. \n“We expect China to continue to exert downward pressure on commodity prices in the coming months, representing one of the three key drivers for commodity prices, along with US rate hike timing and the degree of supply-side response to low prices,” Mr Szpakowski warned. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) fell the furthest, down 14.8p, or 10pc, to 133.5p, as China’s disappointing Purchasing Managers’ Index data sapped investor confidence. The international miner suffered another blow, as Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) slashed its target price by 40p to 220p. \nHowever, in an unexpected move the broker lifted its rating from “hold” to “speculative buy”, as the company’s “debt concerns are not justified”, and it believes the company can also sustain its full-year dividend. \nCanaccord Genuity also targeted BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , lowering its target price to £12.60 from £13.80. Despite continued cuts to capital expenditure budgets, and concerns the ability to generate further costs savings is becoming increasingly difficult, analysts believe a reduced dividend is not on the cards. \n“The dividend was not cut in the recession, and we do not expect it to be cut now”, Nick Hatch, of Canaccord Genuity, said. The stock plummeted 76p, or 6.7pc, to £10.56. Rival Anglo American slumped 7.6pc to 684.4p, Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) plunged 5.7pc to 574.5p, and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) tumbled 4.9pc to £22.71. \nMeanwhile, China-led carnage resurfaced as a brief resurgence in global equities came to an abrupt halt on Tuesday. European bourses were bludgeoned as panic-stricken investors piled out of stocks. The CAC in Paris slumped 2.4pc and the DAX in Germany fell 2.4pc. * Wall Street falls sharply on weak China data Chris Beauchamp, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said “having seemingly recovered from their China-induced panic, investors have lapsed back into old habits, taking Purchasing Managers’ Index figures from China and other places as a reason to abandon equities once again”. In London, £48bn was wiped off the Britain’s leading companies, as the FTSE 100 fell 189.40 points, or 3pc, to 6,058.54 its worst one-day fall in over a week. \n* IMF poised to cut growth forecasts as emerging markets face triple threat Amid a sea of red, just one stock emerged as the FTSE 100 favourite. Engineer Meggitt edged 11.3p, or 2.4pc, higher to 488.7p as traders in the City noted strong auto sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles posted a 2pc rise in sales in August, beating expectations. \nDespite a raised target price, investors tuned out of ITV , sending the stock 11.2p, or 4.5pc, lower to 239p. Nomura revised its target price higher, from 285p to 300p, with analysts attributing the move to “a 5.4pc full-year dividend yield, Liberty stake building and a potential for further full-year earnings-per-share upgrades”. \nWilliam Mairs, of Nomura, said “ITV1’s audience share has remained remarkably stable at 60pc since 2002, implying it has not lost share and is a viewing monopoly”. \nDixons Carphone (Other OTC: DSITF - news ) also tumbled 13.9p to 417.5p after Nomura began covering the stock, with a rating of “neutral” and a target price of 450p. Analysts reckon management’s plans to double the company’s share price in the three to four years following its merger are “unrealistic”. “Our full-year pre-tax profit is 10pc below consensus, driven by our view of forex headwinds in the Nordics and lower-than-consensus expectations for services”, Sunita Entwisle, of Nomura, said. \nOld Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) and Mondi , which are both exposed to the South African Rand, slipped 6.4pc and 4.1pc, respectively. A weaker equity market and renewed concerns over China, South Africa’s largest importer, put pressure on emerging markets once again. \nLuxury goods maker Burberry fell 70p, or 5pc, to £13.41, amid concerns demand is slowing following the devaluation of the yuan. Meanwhile, Man (Swiss: MAN.SW - news ) Group was among the biggest fallers on the mid-cap index, after reports surfaced the boss of its Chinese division had been taken into custody as part of the probe into the country’s recent market volatility . Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) plunged 10.9p, or 6.8pc, to 150.2p. \nThe world’s third biggest platinum producer Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) was also hit, falling 4.8pc to 33.4p, as it faces relegation from the mid-cap index . This year 81pc has been wiped off the company’s share price, as it struggles to deal with financing problems and a platinum prices crisis. A final decision will be made on Wednesday. \nElsewhere, a bullish note from Numis helped OneSavings Bank (Stuttgart: 2OS.SG - news ) secure the FTSE 250 top spot. James Hamilton, of Numis, pointed to a “very strong operating environment”. “We believe the market is underestimating how long the current exceptional returns can be sustained,” Mr Hamilton added. Shares climbed 10.5p, or 3pc, to 358.5p. \nFinally, Rentokil hit a six-week high after it acquired US pest control business Steritech . The deal, which is valued at $425m, pushed up shares 3.4p, or 2.3pc, higher to 151.7p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T22:50:44.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
