Closes New $400 Million Term Loan Facility Proceeds From New Facility and Recent $600 Million Investment Grade Senior Notes Offering Applied to Acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions CBRE Group, Inc. 13 hours ago  Done \nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nCBRE Group, Inc. ( CBG ) today announced that it has closed on a new $400 million term-loan facility. The new facility includes a $270 million term loan that matures in five years and has an initial interest rate of LIBOR+115 basis points, or approximately 1.35% currently, and a $130 million term loan that matures in seven years and has an initial interest rate of LIBOR+160 basis points, or approximately 1.80% currently. The $270 million term loan is pre-payable at any time without penalty, and the $130 million term loan is pre-payable at any time without penalty after September 3, 2017. \nThe new term loan facility follows the completion of a $600 million investment grade senior notes offering in August. The senior notes mature in 2026 and have an interest rate of 4.875%. \n“We have now concluded our financing activities for the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, which we closed on Tuesday,” said Jim Groch, CBRE’s chief financial officer. “We were able to up-size both the notes offering and bank term loans at attractive pricing due to strong demand. These financings equate to approximately two-thirds of the purchase price, and we continue to operate with modest leverage, very substantial liquidity and a high degree of flexibility to execute our strategy.” \nMoody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services rate CBRE’s corporate debt at Investment Grade (Baa3/BBB), with a stable outlook. \nAbout CBRE Group, Inc. \nCBRE Group, Inc.
