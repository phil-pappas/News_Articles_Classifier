The fund will bet on falling and gaining stocks while being independent of market movements.\n“Our objective is to provide equity-like returns with reduced volatility and minimal market exposure,” said Managing Director Edward Moon, who runs the fund together with Indaka Nanayakkara.\nVolatility has surged as global equity markets have been shaken by the prospect of rising interest rates in the U.S. and uncertainties over the outlook for China’s economy and how it has handled a stock-market plunge that has erased gains this year. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index on Aug. 24 climbed to the highest in more than three years.\nOther investment firms in the region are starting hedge funds using computer models. Thirdrock Capital Pte in May said it plans to launch a quantitative fund investing across all asset classes including stocks, bonds and currencies. Golden Equator Capital Pte, also based in Singapore, said it intends to begin a long-short equity fund.\nPast Careers Moon, chief executive officer of Ataraxia Quant Strategies, a division of Lighthouse Canton, previously was chief investment officer at Woori Absolute Partners Pte in Singapore and head of Korean equity capital markets at Citigroup Inc. Nanayakkara, the chief investment officer of the division, was co-founder of Singapore-based hedge-fund manager Piquant Capital Pte which he left in March 2014.\nLighthouse Canton currently has $300 million in assets under management, of which $200 million are in managed accounts and $100 million in its current two funds, the SageOne India Growth Fund and the Orion Global Multi-Strategy Fund, Chowdhary said.\nThe India fund gained 14 percent in U.S. dollar terms this year to the end of July, and the Orion Global fund was up about 2 percent in the same period, Chowdhary said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T07:18:06.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
