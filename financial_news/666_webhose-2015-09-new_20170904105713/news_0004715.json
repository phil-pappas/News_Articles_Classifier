Or, if you prefer, stay in town and enjoy fine dining or world-class shopping. London, yes? Technically, sure. But add in tax-free dollars and a working week of Sunday to Thursday and the answer narrows somewhat: Dubai.\nDespite the Middle East's perennial bad press, the lure of career opportunities in the region (and yes, those tax-free dollars) means it remains a popular choice for Australians. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are an estimated 16,000 of us living and working in the United Arab Emirates alone, and a further 10,000 to 11,000 in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.\nMany who make the leap will plan to come for two to three years, but stay for four or five.\nAlmost 70 per cent are business people. It's no wonder: according to Australian-born Jack Khabbaz, who works in recruiting firm Morgan McKinley's Dubai office, the local market has picked up in the last 18 months after taking a significant hit during the global financial crisis.\nKhabbaz says those in demand include lawyers (both private practice and in house), human resource specialists, recruiters, corporate communicators, qualified accountants and engineers with a background in metals or experience in firms like BHP or Rio Tinto.\nAdvertisement While some Aussies end up in Dubai through internal transfer or by being headhunted, many take the path Khabbaz did and visit first to make local contacts.\n\"Come with people who are willing to talk to you, or interviews lined up, including with recruitment agencies like us,\" he says.\nTo get to that stage, Khabbaz says it's worth remembering that LinkedIn is relied on more heavily than in Australia, so ramp up your profile to leverage potential connections. And while jobs exist for those without regional experience, many Dubai hirers prefer expats who are already on the ground.\n\"Be prepared to spend a couple of months here if you don't have an opportunity [lined up before arriving].\"\n Some expats reportedly find the temptations that come with their high disposable income make saving difficult, and most agree the four-month summer is a sweat fest, but many love it.\nLouise Adams is one of them. Having spent seven years in the UAE, most of them as the country manager for global engineering and project management company Aurecon, the civil engineer says that career-wise, Dubai can be eye-opening.\n\"The size and complexities of the projects and the aspirations of the UAE is something I've never [previously] come across.\"\nWhile golf, netball and an easy home life on a development are favourites of her family (Adams is there with her husband and toddler), she says there are some challenges for women working in senior roles.\n\"One of the realities when you have male clients is that it's hard[er] to form those one-on-one relationships, because there are cultural restrictions as to what you can do and the time you can spend with each other. You have to be able to adjust.\"\nStill, Adams encourages others to go for it, particularly if they are young, single and looking for a new career opportunity.\nAccording to Khabbaz, many who make the leap will plan to come for two to three years, but stay for four or five. \"The first couple of years you are getting used to the market, then you reap the rewards of those efforts. [People] get promoted, or headhunted for other opportunities, and it becomes a harder place to leave,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:36:10.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
