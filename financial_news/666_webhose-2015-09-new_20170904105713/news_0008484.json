That could mean the estimated 160,000 people in the state who drive for the company could, if they win, be eligible for expense reimbursement, workers' compensation insurance, overtime, and tips that were allegedly withheld. Uber is likely to appeal the decision .You can understand why when you consider that Uber currently claims that all the drivers are contractors. That means enormous amounts saved in payroll taxes, gas and vehicle maintenance, potential health insurance mandates, and so on. From the outside, at least, Uber seems to believe that the workers really are independent business owners because they can choose when they will work and how many hours they'll put in. At least, that's the official story.[caption id=\"attachment_d0ea555132694035bb965f1e10d98a4c\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] People walk past the front door of the Uber's office in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Aug. 12, 2015. Hong Kong police searched Uber's office in the Asian financial center on Tuesday, in the latest legal headache for the fast-growing company that's meeting resistance from regulators and traditional taxi businesses worldwide.

Cars must be less than ten years old in most cities and inspected by an Uber-approved shop. Requirements go up, depending on the type of Uber service the driver wants to participate in. Some drivers complain about renting a phone from the company without being explicitly told about the ability to use their own phones.In short, this is hardly clear-cut, and the Department of Labor seems to be leaning toward employee status .The question of whether employees misclassified as contractors is an old one. It's been a problem for many decades as companies try to reduce their expenses and increase profits by shifting business costs over to employees. What is different in high tech among the dozens and dozens of \"sharing economy\" businesses is a level of hubris and arrogance that assumes others should be in service to them.The attitude is part of the unreality of Silicon Valley , the Twilight Zone's ground zero. Nick Bilton, a New York Times reporter writing for Vanity Fair (in a piece that is worth reading in its entirety), described how so many there are sure there isn't a financial bubble, even with close to 100 unicorns -- start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, although they may not have made a dime -- already operating as the number continues to grow. Money is thrown about as if it were easily minted by anyone who needs it. Or, more accurately, by any of the insider circle that need it. Because regular people don't get access to the perks and the outrageously large salaries for people to further the goal of the region , as one person put it on Twitter: \"SF tech culture is focused on solving one problem: What is my mother no longer doing for me?\"The unreality is deep, which helps explain why those who have in abundance have absolutely no clue how the other 99 percent live. For example, an Airbnb executive -- someone who works at a company that makes it easier for people to temporarily rent out a room or apartment -- aspires to seeing the business win a Nobel Peace Prize . Why? Because he says that when people stay in the homes of others, \"we create a world where there are a lot fewer people who seem alien to us.\"Kumbaya, man. Someone could have made the same argument for a little old lady who ran a boarding house in a melting pot city.For someone to even think through such a train of thought is to suggest that, somewhere, common sense has become derailed. Until a connection to reality can be reestablished, changing the disastrous run toward a brick wall that the world has embarked upon will be incredibly difficult.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ubers-future-could-hinge-on-one-key-issue/", "http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-pay-2014-11", "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble", "https://twitter.com/azizshamim/status/595285234880491521", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/d0ea555132694035bb965f1e10d98a4c/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9107383/judge-ruling-california-uber-drivers-class-action", "http://www.ridesharingdriver.com/uber-vehicle-requirements-can-you-drive-for-uber-with-your-car/", "http://fortune.com/2014/11/20/meet-airbnb-hospitality-guru/"], "published": "2015-09-02T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:36:28.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
