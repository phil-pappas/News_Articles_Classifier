The investigations are ongoing and the company continues to cooperate with the government,\" UAL said in a statement.\nUnited Continental also said its executive vice president of communications and government affairs, and its senior vice president of corporate and government affairs were leaving.\nUAL's general counsel, Brett Hart, declined during a conference call Tuesday to elaborate on the reasons for the departures or the status of a federal investigation into UAL's relationship with a former chairman of the Port Authority.\nIn February, the carrier had opened an internal investigation into its relationship with the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, following a government probe.\nThe investigations are ongoing and it's internal probe and the related circumstances do not raise any accounting or financial reporting concerns, United Continental said on Tuesday.\n\"We don't expect it to impact our operations,\" Hart said.\nUnited under Smisek was under pressure from investors to improve its day to day operations and financial performance. About 75 percent of United's flights arrived on time during the first half of this year, according to federal data, the worst record among the four largest U.S. airlines. UAL executives told Reuters last month they planned a series of changes to schedules to improve on-time performance.\n\"We need to reach our customers with a better service product,\" Munoz said during the conference call with analysts.\nSmisek will receive a separation payment of $4.9 million, payable as a lump sum in cash, the company said in a regulatory filing.
