Mark Bristow, Randgold Chief Executive Officer, said 'Obuasi is a world-class resource. We now have to see if we can convert it into a world-class mine. \nWe have a long history of cooperation with AngloGold Ashanti and we look forward to working with it again on charting a new course towards a viable future for Obuasi.' \nHe observed that the two companies had had similar successful agreements at the Morila Mine in Mali and the Kibali Mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nDr Bristow said a successful transformation of the Obuasi Mine, through the joint venture, would increase gold production and benefit all stakeholders. \nHe said the formation of the joint venture was conditional on the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which include the approval by the boards of Randgold and AngloGold Ashanti by January 31, 2016. \nMr Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer, AngloGold Ashanti said 'AngloGold Ashanti had since 2012 effected a range of improvement to modernise Obuasi and - in line with its strategy - had progressed a feasibility study as the critical next step toward breathing a new life into this important mine'. \n'Our partnership with Randgold has proved successful for well over a decade in bringing value from sustainable gold mining to all stakeholders and we believe that pooling the extensive expertise and the capital of these two companies will improve our ability to bring Obuasi's world-class high-grade gold deposit to account,' he added. \nAccording to the 2014 Annual Report of AngloGold Ashanti, the Obuasi Mine is a large, high-grade deposit with proven and probable ore reserves of 24.53Mt at 6.70g/t for 5.29Moz, part of a substantial mineral resource base. \nIn 2012, AngloGold Ashanti initiated a programme to modernise the mine, principally by starting to develop a ramp access that will ultimately run from surface to high-grade blocks of ore underground. \nThe ramp will supplement current vertical hoisting infrastructure and help debottleneck the underground operation, by allowing for greater ease in transporting people and materials underground, and transporting ore to surface. \nThis is a necessary step ahead of the envisaged transformation of the mine into a modern, mechanised operation. \nAt the end of 2014, AngloGold Ashanti converted Obuasi to limited operations, stopped underground production, retrenched the workforce, but continued to process tailings and started a feasibility study on the redevelopment of the mine, while development of the decline ramp continued over the period. \nIn addition, formation of the joint venture is conditional on the receipt of the approvals necessary for the implementation of the development plan and formation of the joint venture from the Government of Ghana on terms acceptable to the parties. \nIt also includes agreement of a revised stability agreement and a development agreement reflecting the agreed development plan and their ratification by the Parliament and the issue of all necessary environmental licences and permits for the project, which are planned to be satisfied by March 31, 2016. \nSubject to the transaction completion, Randgold and AngloGold Ashanti will each fund their share of the agreed costs incurred in implementing the development plan from the Approval Date and other agreed costs from the date of the Agreement. \nRandgold will also assume responsibility for its proportionate share of certain liabilities arising under guarantees given by AngloGold Ashanti in relation to the liabilities of its Ghanaian subsidiaries. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:00:48.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
