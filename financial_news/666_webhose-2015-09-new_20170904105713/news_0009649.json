Prosecutors say the virus infected more than one million computers around the world, including ones belonging to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the U.S.\nOn Friday, Calovskis pleaded guilty to one charge--conspiracy to commit computer intrusion--which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. Under the agreement reached with the government, Calovskis wonâ€™t appeal any sentence that is two years or below.\nCalovskis had been facing five criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The maximum penalty under the original charges would have been 67 years in prison, prosecutors said.\nThe alleged mastermind behind the virus, Russian national Nikita Kuzmin, pleaded guilty to fraud and computer intrusion charges in 2011 and cooperated with government officials after his arrest in 2010. Prosecutors publicly unsealed the charges against Kuzmin, Calovskis and another co-defendant in 2012.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/latvian-hacker-pleads-guilty-in-manhattan-court-1441392936?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:34:42.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
