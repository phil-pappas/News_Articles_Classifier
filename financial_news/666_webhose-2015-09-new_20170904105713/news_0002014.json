It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) should make for higher economic vitality, higher control, greater influence and SOEs will be more risk-resistant.\" \nChina has more than 100 SOEs - many of them utilities, infrastructure and mining firms - with 25,000 more at a local government level, employing millions. \nCompanies such as China Mobile (HKSE: 0941-OL.HK - news ) and the massive ICBC bank have remained in state hands because they are seen as crucial to national security. \nThe support from Beijing has meant SOEs have enjoyed preferential rates on loans but many are now suffering as the availability of credit dries up across the country - a core reason behind China's economic woes. \nIt is hoped that new investors can bring greater experience though many might be put off by the threat of state interference and the country's recent stock market crash . \nThere would also be huge pressure to maintain employment, as a big worry for the Chinese authorities is the prospect of social unrest arising from the economic slowdown. \nCredit conditions may be about to get worse. \nStocks across Asia, including China, fell on Monday as investors continued to fret on whether the US Federal Reserve would start raising interest rates this week from their 2008 low. \nRising borrowing costs would exacerbate the loss of super-cheap money from quantitative easing - hitting not just China but wider emerging markets . \nThe latest factory output data from Beijing disappointed, growing by 6.1% in August, adding to worries about China's industrial activity after exports fell 5.5%. \nThe worse-than expected data - coupled with the prospect of rising US rates hitting credit availability and exchange rates - has left China at risk of missing its GDP growth forecast of 7% for this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T11:10:45.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
