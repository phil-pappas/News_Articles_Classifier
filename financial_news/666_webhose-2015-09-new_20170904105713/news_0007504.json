Before Ms Yellen's speech began at 7am it was fetching as high as US70.41¢.\nOvernight it hit a low of US69.42¢ as global markets swung in a night of market turmoil.\nIn her speech Ms Yellen said despite opting to keep interest rates at near zero at the Fed's September meeting it was appropriate for the Fed to raise this year.\nThe Australian dollar swung upwards as the US dollar softened on weak US data Bloomberg \"I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further and inflation moves back to our 2 per cent objective,\" Ms Yellen said in a speech in Massachussetts on Friday morning Australian time.\nThat triggered a swift rise in the US dollar, sending the Australian dollar back below the key support level of US70¢.\nEarlier gains in the Aussie came from weakness in the US dollar on soft economic data, Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior currency strategist Elias Haddad said.\n\"The USD eased during the overnight session following unimpressive US August durable goods orders and weaker US regional manufacturing surveys,\" he said.\n The added to the recovery in the Australian and New Zealand dollars, Mr Haddad said.\nThe weaker data would limit the upside in the US dollar, particularly against the yen and euro as expectations for a rate rise diminish.\n\"However, it also adds to global growth concerns which should further weigh on commodity sensitive (AUD, NZD, CAD) and emerging market currencies,\" Mr Haddad said.\nThe news of a fall in US business equipment for last month added weight to concerns that China's slowdown was having a bigger effect on the world's biggest economy.\nThe best overnight currency performer was the New Zealand dollar, National Australia Bank senior economist David de Garis said.\n\"Pre-Yellen, the best performer overnight was the NZD, up 1.22 per cent in the wake of yesterday's announcement from Fonterra increasing its payout, a hint to more confidence in the outlook for milk prices,\" he said.\n\"At the other end of the currency spectrum, the Norges Bank cut rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent (the consensus expected no change), unseating the NOK [Norwegian krone],\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-25T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:05:40.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
