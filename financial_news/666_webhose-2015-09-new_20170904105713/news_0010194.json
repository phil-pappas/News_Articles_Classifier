It's just something that will take a long time to be familiar with,\" Fresenbet said. \nHowever, she also does not know why she uses her bank book at the bank when there is an automatic teller machine (ATM) machine at the door that would give her money as soon as she inserts her debit card in the slot. \n\"I really don't know why. Maybe... I take it as being too fashionable? Or that I'm a bit showy,\" she says. \nFor many years now in Ethiopia, going a bit further than families who go shopping with their wallets and purses in their armpits, merchants and traders carry sacks full of currency notes while shopping. Many countrymen, some who hide their money in their underwear, or put it into an inner pocket knitted to their vests, have experienced theft from tricky children and adults who have sharp pickpocketing skills in places that include the largest open market--Mercato. Still, so many families stroll in the market and step into banks, fill their pockets with thousands of birr notes and are seen counting their bundle of currency almost everywhere. To the contrary, one can easily catch a glimpse of a number of people grappling with ATM machines standing at the gates of hotels and malls, and at squares maybe in a mood closer to fear and anxiety. This is nowadays a typical scene observed in Addis Ababa, where millions of its residents seem to be haggling for their financial needs. \nWhen the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) launched the use of ATM service more than a decade ago, many appeared to be surprised that they were no longer in need of bearing their bank books to withdraw a certain amount of cash. \n\"I thought it was a swift move towards the status of the developed world so that it would expand even to the countryside by now,\" Zemedkun Taye, a private employee said. \nHowever, it has not been an easy task for the banks that do not have the option of a telecom service without the state-owned Ethio-telecom. Moreover, the ATM service inception has had some difficulties related to internal system failure and inappropriate use by customers. According to Ephrem Mekuria, communication head at CBE, the bank has not been failing in its mission that would see the country at a shorter distance from the developed world in banking industry. Currently, the bank is mostly seen as a bellwether, has registered a million plus citizens holding an ATM card. \nIronically, these ATM cards seem to be using their card only to withdraw money from the machines disregarding other uses of their debit cards. \n\"I've never thought of offering my debit card to make a payment at a restaurant or when shopping,\" Meseret Taye, a self-employed young man says. According to him, the awareness that the majority of the public has about the debit card is low. \"Even I had a day when I looked for a ATM machine to withdraw some money before going to a mall to buy toys for my little daughter.\" \nMeseret, who suggests that banks should be able to fulfill their responsibility in creating awareness along with the service they deliver, also hopes for better infrastructure that can resolve network failure. \nIn the middle of the week, The Reporter paid a surprise visit to some of the hotels, supermarkets and malls in the vicinity of Bole Medhanialem and almost all local customers were seen paying in cash even when having a debit card in their pocket. \n\"I can't remember my debit card can be used here. I always look for cash in my pocket,\" Elsabeth Seyoum, a customer at Friendship City Center, said. \nAccording to Melaku Getachew, supervisor at Friendship City Center's hypermarket, the local customers have the traditional shopping culture of hand-in-hand sale. \n\"I think they are sometimes suspicious of us in case they give us their debit card and we charge them more than they plan to pay for,\" he said. \nAccording to him, in one of the few busiest supermarkets the city that is open 16 hours a day, the number of local customers who use their cards is not more than 10. But, what about the foreigners? \n\"Oh, almost all of them use their cards, including Master and Visa Cards,\" he replies. \nMelaku's practical observation is well supported by Manaye Tesfaye, marketing manager at Ambassador Hotel. He hardly sees a local customer paying his bills by debit card. \n\"In fact, most of the people staying with us are foreigners who consistently use their Master and Visa Cards, while some of them come with their American Express Card,\" he says. \n\"It is very difficult to figure it out ,\" he replied when asked for a rough estimate of local customers who might have used their debit cards for the services they enjoyed at the hotel. Manaye, who also stated the trade mark: \"Ambassador has been accepting all cards in other business entities for years,\" said that even it's prime shops such as Ambassador Garment rarely see customers pay with anything other than cash. He believes that paying by card is a habit of what he refers to as \"well-to-do persons\" or those who have a \"diaspora background.\" \nFor Fitsum Demissie, computer engineer by training, who wrote a book on card banking, banks and card issuers have to take a leading role in transforming the society. \n\"I understood it while I was a child and I would be sent to pay a monthly social contribution,\" he says. \"It is a longstanding custom of a society that has had no other means of keeping or transferring money except for keeping it in pockets or hidden in underwear. In Sweden, where I currently reside, the ATM will no longer be used as a sophisticated means of money transfer or banking in the next five years.\" \nWith his last point, he explains why Ethiopia should make strides to transform the society in the area of banking. According to him, there is not much that has been told or written over the past decade where the banking industry sees advanced systems such as card banking, internet banking and mobile banking. Because of this, he argues. That the main issue is about filling the gap existing between the bank service and customers. \nFitsum, who lands the banks for introducing advanced banking systems in the country, also calls upon them to make all of them dependable, friendly and accessible. \n\"Banks should go for public gatherings and festivities with their ATM and Point of Sales (POS) machines so that the public can adapt to it easily,\" he says, explaining the way that banks can promote their advanced services amongst the larger public. \nMoreover, he advises banks and financial analysts to engage themselves in different teaching platforms in which the society can get the necessary information on why and how to use advanced banking services. \n\"People should be taught that they can have different types of cards to use in banking, and they have to be well-aware of the cards they use. What if they lose it, how should they keep it, and what value should they give it? All these concerns have to be made clear if a bank is promoting card banking,\" he concludes.
