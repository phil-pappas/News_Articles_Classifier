But he said while Bunnings would create 180 jobs once opened, the other retail would also generate more employment.\nThe chain always wanted a presence in Gungahlin\n\"Our network is still being put in place in the Canberra area and I think our nearest stores are in Fyshwick and Belconnen so with the amount of growth that's happening in the north of the city, it made sense for us to be there,\" he said.\n\"It will affect our existing stores a little bit but it will save people driving a long way to shop us.\"\nMr Marks said Bunnings would also be lodging a development application \"in the near future\" to expand its Tuggeranong store by an extra 30 per cent or 4000 square metres at a cost of $8 million to $10 millon. The expansion, if approved, would see the store extended across existing car parking, with any lost parking replaced underneath the new extension.\nThe company was also keen to expand or replace its Fyshwick Bunnings with a possible outcome, pending approvals and land sales, shifting the store a little further to the east and south to land yet to be released near the Canberra Outlet Centre.\n\"There are also a couple of holes left on the western side of town where we're less represented and they're hard to get in over there but in time we'll plan to do something in that market,\" Mr Marks said.\nThe Gungahlin Bunnings was due to open later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T05:18:32.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
