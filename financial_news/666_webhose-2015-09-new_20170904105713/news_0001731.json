Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Anne Hyland Australian culture is at a crossroads. In the past, religious institutions and top political players were meaningful contributors to our national cultural identity. But today they are less and less relevant. Why? Because they’ve failed to show the one thing Australia really needs: strong leadership and a clearly articulated view of who we are.\nFilling the gap are the individuals, institutions and ideas that are helping us navigate a series of complex and troubling questions. Are we a racist nation? Are we a fearful nation? Are we a progressive nation? Are our politicians mapping out a future direction for the country or simply engaging in banal and inane debate?\nIt’s a period of truth-seeking. Australia is a nation in flux, which is reflected in the compilation by our power panel of the cultural list for 2015.\nIn the top spot is the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, chaired by Justice Peter McClellan. Its influence over the past year has been to bring into the mainstream debate a topic that was once taboo. More than 4000 victims of child sexual abuse have come forward to tell their stories in private sessions at the commission. The public hearings have examined the systemic failure of institutions such as private schools, religious groups and state-run childcare facilities to protect children.\nSome of those institutions perpetrated and covered up abhorrent child sexual abuse. The commission is now holding them to account and they are voluntarily or forcibly changing. The incredible scale of the commission’s hearings nationwide, together with the horrific content, has made it part of the national conversation. Abuse stories fill nightly radio and news bulletins.\n“I don’t think it was widely understood how extreme the abuse has been and how it’s been covered up for decades,” says Greg Combet, a former federal Labor minister and leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. “You cannot overstate the commission’s importance for people who have been victims as children of sexual abuse. For that rea son alone, given the scope of this problem over so many decades and affecting so many people, it’s extremely important.\n“Beyond that, it’s a cathartic experience for Australian society generally. It’s very important for Australia to confront its past.”\nAmanda Vanstone, former federal Liberal senator and minister for immigration, says it is the role of a royal commission to shine a light in dark places. “If they do that effectively, they do change the cultural landscape. We see things we wouldn’t otherwise see and we react to them. That’s a good thing.”\n Union corruption, family violence in the spotlight There are two other royal commissions under way in Australia with the power to effect cultural change. One is the federal commission focused on trade union governance and corruption, which became engulfed in turmoil after the impartiality of its commissioner, Justice Dyson Heydon, was called into question. Even so, former Labor minister Martin Ferguson says this commission remains very important for reforming the trade union movement and the Labor Party.\nThe other is Victoria’s Royal Commission into Family Violence. It wouldn’t have occurred if not for the powerful voice of Rosie Batty. Sixth on last year’s cultural list, Batty moves into second place this year due to her relentless campaigning against family violence.\nBatty’s advocacy was born of personal tragedy. In 2014,her 11-year-old son Luke was murdered by his father, beaten with a cricket bat and stabbed repeatedly during cricket practice. From the day after Luke was killed, Batty was articulate and forceful in asking Australians to talk about the entrenched issue of family violence.\nAustralians are asked to be concerned about many causes, from climate change to motor neurone disease – remember the ice bucket challenge? This makes Batty’s achievement in highlighting her cause all the more significant and points to her communication skills.\n“It’s a real communication game and she has been successful,” says qualitative researcher Tony Mitchelmore, managing director of Visibility Consulting. “She’s a commanding influence with other people of influence. She’s making a difference and changing attitudes.”\nBatty’s efforts earned her the 2015 Australian of the Year award. Martin Parkinson, former federal Treasury secretary, says it’s not often that a groundswell of support emerges around an individual or issue, as it did around Batty. “It says something about her and the obvious sense here is a person you can admire and respect, and who is brave.”\nIn changing attitudes and policies, Batty and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse are redefining who we are as a nation.\nThe long shadow cast by ISIS The themes of violence and abuse are echoed in the threat of terrorism and ISIS, which our panel judged the third most powerful cultural phenomenon of the past year. Our collective anxiety grew last year when we saw images of a young Australian boy holding a decapitated head in Syria. The boy is the son of an Australian man who fled to join ISIS. They were stoked further during the Lindt Café siege in Sydney’s CBD last December, in which 17 people were taken hostage and three died, including Man Haron Monis, who perpetrated the terror.\nMitchelmore says while it’s wrong to portray Monis as an ISIS person, this is initially what Australians and the world thought he was. “That’s the fear the siege evoked. That was the terrifying part about it.”\nThose two key events lifted the level of anxiety in Australian society. Adding to it has been the political messaging around the threat of terrorism. While last decade John Howard advised Australians to be alert but not alarmed, our recently deposed prime minister Tony Abbott called ISIS a death cult and told citizens that it was “coming after us”. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has described it as a bigger threat to the world order than Cold War communism. Its ideology, she says, is the worst the world has seen since the Nazis. No wonder we’re alarmed and alert.\n“We have to be vigilant and the threat of terrorism will only increase,” says corporate adviser and Luminis Partners founder Simon Mordant. But, he adds, a society that’s fearful is not a good one. “Politically it has been beaten up far more than it should have been. It’s created a society of fear and it’s unfortunate because people can be anxious when they see Muslim people. In a multicultural society that’s deeply regretful.”\nThe terrorism threat led the Abbott government to ask for wider powers for the nation’s security agencies, including the ability to access our metadata, the footprint of where we’ve been online. This drew a sharp public rebuke even though many of us are indifferent to the use of such information by big private companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. The security of our online data, and the power it gives to those who can access it, was recently illustrated with the hacking of cheating spouse website Ashley Madison.\nThe collection and use of online data is an ongoing debate in an age when many have abandoned privacy. As we try to work out the boundaries and security of that information, the panel argued its importance warrants a place on the cultural list, under the all-encompassing title Big Data.\nTerrorism also became an issue for the ABC this year, but not in its reporting. Rather, it got into hot water over an audience question asked during its Q&A show by Zaky Mallah​, who had been charged under Australia’s anti-terrorism laws but was later found not guilty. Mallah’s presence on the show outraged then-prime minister Abbott, who banned his ministerial frontbench from appearing on the program for a period.\nThe Mallah controversy was just one of many conflicts between the ABC and the government in the past 12 months. Some ministers, including Abbott, repeatedly questioned the ABC’s independence in its coverage of political events. During this period, the government also cut the ABC’s budget, breaking an election promise not to do so.\n“In a way, the level of the attacks on the ABC demonstrate its cultural power and significance and I think it has been right up there in the eye of the storm,” says Ben Oquist, executive director of the Australia Institute and a former Greens chief of staff.\nThe far-reaching effect of the threat of terrorism on Australian societal behaviour is not always immediately obvious. Consider how three former chiefs of the Australian Defence Force are now in prominent civilian roles. Sir Angus Houston became the Special Envoy to the Ukraine to recover and repatriate Australians killed when the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down. He also heads the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre into finding the missing Malaysia Airlines jet and is a special envoy for South Australia.\nAnother former chief of defence, Sir Peter Cosgrove, is Australia’s Governor-General, while David Hurley, who had served in that role, is now the Governor of NSW. “You’ve also got David Morrison, who gets a rock star response when he goes to address the UN on gender issues,” says Parkinson in reference to Australia’s former army chief, who continues to push hard for gender equality in the armed forces.\nHe says the phenomenon of the Australian military taking leadership positions in mainstream society has not been seen since World War II. “They’re a group of people who are seen to have leadership qualities and they are being embraced in those sorts of roles. Politicians are putting them into the roles but it’s the public that is authorising them in the roles. It’s saying something about the absence of leadership in the community.”\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram\nThe AFR Magazine Power issue is out Friday September 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/newsandimages", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/afrmag", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/power_list_2015_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/113603699450999731037", "https://instagram.com/afrmag/"], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:09:09.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
