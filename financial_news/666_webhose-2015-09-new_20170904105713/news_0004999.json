The pizza chain has roughly 1,700 employees and hopes to double that number in the next year. \n\"Yes, It [the minimum wage hike] will squeeze us. We're up for the challenge. We think that it's a very good challenge to take on,\" he said. \"I think there are a lot of other concepts and brands out there that are not as well positioned to take on that challenge. So while companies like us will have to end up taking a larger percentage of their sales going to labor, there will probably be fewer competitors long term because there will be a natural winnowing out of operators who are not well positioned to take this on.\" \nSvenson said the pizza chain pays its workers above minimum wage in the markets where it operates. He said he is \"building a business that is unapologetically for profit and one that is all about building a fantastic food experience...and our focus is making an impact in the lives of the people that work for us.\" More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:41:06.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
