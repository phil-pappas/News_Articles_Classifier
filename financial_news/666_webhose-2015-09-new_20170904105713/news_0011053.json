At this point, officials closed the boarding gate door and the passengers were compelled to wait for the Sars officials.\n“When questioned by Sars officials on whether they were in possession of any currency, one of the passengers speaking on behalf of the group stated that he had R100 000 and that the other individuals also had currency. The five individuals were escorted back to immigration at international arrivals, booked back into South Africa and escorted to Customs,” the statement read.\nThe travellers said they were unaware that they had to declare their currency in cases where the bank notes (cash) in their possession exceeded R25 000.\nLebelo says the case has been referred to the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb). If its investigation reveals that illicit trade did take place it will be referred to the South African Police Service (SAPS).\nThe money has been confiscated.\nThe seizure of large sums of cash has made headlines before.\nIn April 2009 Shoprite chairperson Christo Wiese was intercepted by UK Customs with £675 000 in UK bank notes at Heathrow Airport. After much controversy Wiese got his money back.\nSars confiscated undeclared currency to the value of roughly R78 million at OR Tambo on Friday.
