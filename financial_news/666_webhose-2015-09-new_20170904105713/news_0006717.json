Modi ji is the biggest leader of the nation. People love him a lot and that can be seen in his rallies,” BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya told ANI.\n“It does not matter what he says. People have shown its consequences from time to time to the Congress Party,” he added.\nGandhi had earlier today said that farmers across the country were abusing Prime Minister Modi for not fulfilling the promises made during the 2014 general elections.\n“Prime Minister Modi had promised to raise the MSP (Minimum Support Price) to the farmers. He also told the farmers not to worry saying ‘Acche Din’ will come. And now, the farmers in every state are committing suicide. I want to tell you that when I am visiting the farmers, they are not criticising, but abusing Narendra Modi,” Gandhi said while addressing a ‘Chintan Shivir’ in Mathura.\n 22, 2015 12:40 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:51:53.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
