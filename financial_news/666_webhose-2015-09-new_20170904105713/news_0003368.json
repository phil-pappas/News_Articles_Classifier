And with the conditions in place for sustained rapid growth, it is set to remain the eurozone?s fastest-growing economy,\" said Jack Allen, European economist at research firm Capital Economics. \nFinance Minister Michael Noonan said Dublin's objective now was to build upon the gains made in recent years and \"secure the recovery\". \nHe added: \"The increase in economic activity is broadly-based ? unlike in the past when activity was excessively concentrated in the construction sector. We are now seeing both domestic-facing and exporting sectors performing strongly.\" \nNoonan also said exports were strong in the second quarter, growing by 13.6 percent. \nAmid positive Irish economic data and better-than-expected tax receipts this year, Dublin is under increasing pressure to loosen its purse strings in next month's budget -- the final one before the next general election. \nThe coalition government made up of the larger centre-right Fine Gael party and the centre-left Labour party is committed to tax breaks and spending increases worth up to 1.5 billion euros. ($1.67 billion) \n\"We must act with a steady hand to carefully measure what we do and there's going to be no daft spending spree just because it's an election year,\" Noonan told reporters at Government Buildings. \n\"The extra resources which will come through from the growing economy will be used to reduce the debt and to reduce the deficit.\" \nPrior to Thursday's data Dublin forecast growth of 4.0 percent for 2015, although this will be revised as analysts say that even if growth is flat in the second half of the year annual growth is now forecast at 5.7 percent. \nThe European Commission has forecast growth for the EU at 1.8 percent and 1.5 percent in the euro area overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:01:16.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
