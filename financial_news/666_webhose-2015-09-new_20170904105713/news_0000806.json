There's a catch By Kyle Caldwell | Telegraph – 1 hour 54 minutes ago Print \nNew era of low-cost saving but not for all we explain who will miss out \nThe investment landscape is changing. Commissions quietly deducted year after year from your Isas, pensions and other investments supposedly to pay for financial advice will finally be banned from next year. \nMany savers have already seen the benefits of the change in the form of lower costs. Others will have to wait until April 2016, which is when the new rules fully apply. \nBut not everyone is set to gain. The scope of the change leaves some investors in the same situation as before, with charges continuing to eat into their returns. \nThe following explains how the rules will help and where they won’t. \n= When and why commissions have been banned = \nFrom next April investment middlemen, including financial advisers and do-it-yourself investment brokers, will no longer be able to accept commission payments from fund companies. \nThe changes coming into force are the final phase of a series of new rules that started to apply at the start of 2013, which stopped advisers receiving ongoing, or “trail”, commission on new investments. \nThis rule has applied to brokers since April 2014. Since this date brokers have not been able to receive ongoing trail commission on new businesses, due to the legislative changes. \nBut until April 2016 commissions could still be deducted from earlier investments. And it is that backlog of investment which, for many, will soon become cheaper. \nFrom April, instead of taking commissions, all middlemen will have to charge an explicit fee, expressed either as an hourly rate or as a percentage of savers’ investment pot. \nThe new rules were ushered in to remove any potential bias. But and this is the catch these old-style payments will not cease for some investors, such as those who went direct to the fund provider, or invested through a bank. \n= I am a DIY investor using a broker for my fund holdings what is changing? = \nWhen commissions stop next April, DIY investors will in most cases be put into so-called “clean” funds, which strip out commission which was previously automatically paid. \nThis is a technical switch: you will still be investing in the same underlying stocks and shares. But the “share class” of your fund, often signified by a prefix such as “C” or “I”,will change. \nAlternatively some brokers may decide to keep savers in the old style share classes as long as they return the commission in full, through a rebate. \nThe old style share class, typically costs 1.5pc, which was split half and half with the fund manager and broker. Some of the broker fee was returned to investors in the form of rebate or loyalty bonus. \nBut now the middlemen will charge investors separately for their services. \nSavers will typically pay 0.75pc to the fund manager for their stock-picking expertise; and then 0.25pc-0.5pc separately to the broker for its services, depending on the firm. No DIY investors should be paying much more than that in total on their investments whenever they first put the money away. \nBut, against the spirit of the new rules, some fund management groups have increased their charges. Whether you are better or worse off will depend on the funds that you hold. \n= I use a financial adviser what is changing? = \nFor savers with a financial adviser, who in turn oversees your investments via a broker, the changes are similar. \nUnder the old rules the 1.5pc would have been split three ways: between the fund manager, the broker and the financial adviser. The investor wouldn’t have known who got what. \nThis will cease from April, with both the broker and financial adviser charging explicit fees. \nSo from next April you will pay three charges and you should know precisely what each is. \n= I used a financial adviser in the past but have had no contact for years = \nYou may receive a call out of the blue in the coming months from an adviser you have not seen for years, due to the rule change coming into effect. \nHe has probably been enjoying commission payments made by you and possibly unbeknownst to you all the while. \nThe adviser will need to negotiate a new fee with you, given that they will no longer be allowed to pocket commission. Weigh up your options: you could continue the relationship with the adviser, change financial adviser or go it alone. \nThe situation here will differ depending on whether your former adviser used a broker to hold your funds. \nIf so, those savers who are not contacted by the adviser will receive a letter from the broker concerned. It will explain the changes and will probably offer a range of new services. \nWhere your former adviser took your money and placed it directly with the fund companies, the position is different. \nMike Barrett, who works for Lang Cat, a consultancy, said savers in this position will typically be paying 0.5pc to 1pc in commission payments, despite not receiving any ongoing advice. \nThis is the same scenario applying to those who invested on their own directly with the fund management company. Ironically, although there are no middlemen in this equation, the cost they pay is greater. \nAndy Papadopoulos, of broker Chase de Vere, called this an “oversight”. \n“Savers are paying and will continue to pay 'full fat’ prices on investments that are held directly. There is no regulatory obligation for fund managers to move savers over to the cheaper fund versions,” Mr Papadopoulos said. \n= Will your savings not see the benefit of the price-cut? Here’s what to do = \nIf you yourself or a former financial adviser on your behalf holds investments directly with fund companies, the most obvious way to cut costs is to sell your holdings and repurchase them via a DIY broker. This will inevitably be cheaper. \nIf your holdings are in the form of Isas or pensions, you should be able to do this without losing the associated tax perks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T12:58:52.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
