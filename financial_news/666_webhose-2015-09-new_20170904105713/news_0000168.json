However, the steel demand may go up in India with the government’s thrust on infrastructure sector,’’ said Narendra Kothari, CMD, on the sidelines of NMDC’s annual general meeting held in Hyderabad.\n“The recent government proposals to bring about certain restrictions on import of steel items has had a positive impact on domestic companies and the demand is likely to pick up during the latter part of the year,’’ he said. In the process, NMDC has also begun discussions with some buyers in Japan to enter into long-term export contracts. The existing arrangement for supply of iron ore expired in March 2015, where about 10% of the produce was exported.\nExpecting a surge in the demand, NMDC plans to invest R40,000 crore in the next eight years to reach a target of 100 million tonnes per annum of iron ore production from the current levels of a little over 30 MTPA. It has planned a capex of Rs 3,600 crore this year and R4,000 crore next fiscal, as part of its long-term plans for expansion and diversification by 2022.\n“The total investment will be Rs 40,000 crore in the next eight years. Our vision is to achieve 100 MTPA by 2025. The investment will go into developing new mines, steel plant, legacy iron ore company in Australia and slurry pipeline from Kirandul to Vizag, among others,” Kothari said.\nMeanwhile, the company is in the process of setting up a small gold refinery in Tanzania, Kothari said. However, he did not divulge the investment size. “Tanzania exploration is going to be complete. We will start mining of gold ore and setting up a small refinery next year. The investment will be very small. We will make a JV there. The final stages of negotiations are still going on,” he added.\n 30, 2015 12:08 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:41:18.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
