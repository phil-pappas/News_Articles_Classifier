Over the coming months the bank said it will study the UK market further and decide which type of loans to offer. Fidor launched in Germany in 2009 and has offices in Berlin and Munich, as well as five staff in London. So far 300,000 people have used its services, including the online community, and the bank has 100,000 customers. In 2014 it made a profit of €2.5m (£1.8m). Its entry into Britain follows the growth of promininent European banks including Handelsbanken from Sweden and Spain's Santander and Sabadell groups. In its home market, Fidor offers 25 different products, including brokerage services, precious metals trading facilities, crowdfinancing offers and even peer-to-peer loans , where customers can post on the online community that they want to borrow money, which other customers can offer to lend to them. “Our account is more like a marketplace than a closed box current account, it is a social community with a banking licence, it is a peer-to-peer economy,” said chief executive Matthias Kroner. He expects its customer-base will initially be made up of more financially savvy customers, such as those who want to engage in trading on the financial markets. Over time, however, he hopes that Fidor will appeal to a much wider range of customers, including those who are dissatisfied with their current bank and want a different alternative, as well as those who want to use this wider community of customers to learn more about financial management. As more customers give their feedback, more products will be introduced. “In Germany we have an overdraft facility, we have an emergency loan where you press the button and get a payout of €100 or €200 the very next second, even on a weekend,” Mr Kroner said. “The technology to do this exists. In the UK we are starting with a minimum product because we want to listen to the demands and pain-points of the community before we roll out more services.” He hopes that the bank could gain as many as 50,000 customers in the next three years, and said he chose Britain as the bank’s first foreign market because Britons tend to be more open to new technologies than those in other parts of Europe. Fidor has a German banking licence that can be used to offer the same services across the EU, although the details of local banking rules vary between countries. The launch was delayed earlier this year when the bank had difficulty convincing any big British lenders to offer it access to the payments infrastructure. The established banks own much of the payments system in the UK and new or small banks must request access to the industry from their bigger rivals, a situation that regulators and other small banks fear operates as a barrier to entry to the industry , and which in part led to the creation of the new Payment Systems Regulator.
