The wolf is attempting to don sheep's clothing. \nHe still seems to believe that there is a £100bn plus pot of unpaid taxes out there ready for the plucking , which the Treasury has somehow hitherto missed, and he still thinks there is a lot to be said for “People’s QE” central bank money printing to finance infrastructure spending. \nBut he no longer proposes to strip the Bank of England of its independence you’d be amazed how many Corbynistas think the Bank ought to be nationalised, apparently unaware that it already is and instead plans merely to write a letter urging the Bank to pursue this policy tool, together with a review of the Bank's remit and its forecasting record. Good luck with that one. \nIn any case, he wants to “consult” as widely as possible in his quest for the new Jerusalem. \nHe’s also appointed a panel of worthy advisers to lend a veneer of respectability to the Labour leadership’s still somewhat whacky ideas for magicking up money from nowhere. \nMost of these advisers are on record as backing the idea of People’s QE, or at least some semblance of it. Indeed, they seem to have been deliberately selected to tell the new shadow Chancellor what he wants to hear. \nRichard Murphy, a former tax adviser who claims to be the architect of Corbynomics, has meanwhile told the Telegraph that he turned down the chance to serve on the Panel, adding somewhat grandly: “I'd rather be back in my garden shed thinking big thoughts about the big issues facing the economy.\" \nAnd that, we must hope, is where they will remain. \nMeanwhile the economy continues to motor along quite nicely, which only leads to further questions about the relevance of Labour’s alternative economic agenda. \nRevisions to the GDP data this week are expected not only to confirm that there was no double dip, but that the economy was growing right through the extended period of “flat-lining” complained of by Labour. \nIndeed, the profile of the UK recovery is beginning to look not that dissimilar to that of the US, which is supposed to have spurned “austerity” and therefore done so much better than the UK. This script is beginning to look a bogus one. Corbynomics have missed the boat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:33:28.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
