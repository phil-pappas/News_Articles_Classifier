That puts them in the troubled category of being “severely cost-burdened renters,” a group that has been growing in numbers over the last 15 years and is likely to continue to grow over the next decade. That’s the “depressing” news from Projecting Trends in Severely Cost-Burdened Renters: 2015-2025 , just released by the Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University and Enterprise Community Partners.There’s especially sobering news for older Americans. Looking at baseline numbers, assuming incomes and rent levels grow at 2% along with inflation, the number of severely cost-burdened households aged 65 to 74 and 75+ are projected to rise by 42% and 39% respectively.[caption id=\"attachment_12839\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Renter households of all types are feeling squeezed, and it looks like it's just going to get worse.

What’s going on? Rents rose “consistently and considerably” in the early 2000s, took a breather in the late 2000s, then ticked up this decade coming out of the recession. There wasn’t a lot of supply coming on the market, and homeowners who faced foreclosure shifted back to renting. Basically, there was a big increase in the number or renters and not an equal increase in supply of apartments so rents increased. Income stagnated so the number of burdened renters rose accordingly.Single individuals and Millennials make up the largest shares of severely cost-burdened renters today, but older Americans (65+) and Hispanic households will be increasing shares, in part because of demographics. Today 30% of elderly renters are paying more than half their incomes on housing. As of 2013, the median rent of a newly constructed apartment was $1,290—about half the median renter’s monthly household income.The worst case scenario on rents going forward may be close to the most likely scenario, says Chris Herbert, managing director of the Center. If real rent growth outpaced income gains by 1 percentage point per year over the next decade, then there would be an increase to 14.8 million severely-cost-burdened renters by 2025. “It would be a really substantial increase in the renter crisis,” he says, adding, “The rosy days of 1990s’ incomes outpacing rents” appear to be behind us.In this scenario, the elderly population sees the greatest increases in severely cost-burdened renters compared to other age groups. When rent growth exceeds income growth by 0.25%, there is a 47 % rise in burdened households ages 65-74 and a 43% rise for ages 75+. The percentages rise as rent growth goes up.Under the most optimistic scenario, assuming household income increases outpace rent increases by 1 percentage point annually over the next decade, we basically tread water, with a modest decrease of 169,000 severely-cost-burdened renter households overall. “No better off than where we are today,” Herbert says.The authors say their data is proof that there’s an urgent need to expand affordable housing. In the meantime, homeowners who are thinking of becoming renters need to think carefully about how much rents might increase in relation to their income going forward.
