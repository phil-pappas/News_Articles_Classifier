Our ultimate goal is supporting their efforts to expand the volunteer community and their reach to more students in the Greater Boston Area – alleviating the worry of where their next meal will come from.\"\nFounded in 2013, the Cambridge Weekend Backpack Program aims to assist low-income families by providing children with nutritious meals during weekends and school breaks. A joint effort between volunteers and school administrators, participating children are sent home with fresh, healthy meals each Friday during the school year. The Program was created by Cambridge resident and public school parent Alanna Mallon after she heard about similar initiatives in other communities around the country. Concerned that there were students in her own children's school who were experiencing this type of food insecurity, she became determined to create a similar program for local students in Cambridge.\n\"I am so grateful to have the support of FleishmanHillard going into the 2015-2016 school year,\" said Founder and Director Mallon. \"FleishmanHillard Boston has already shown tremendous enthusiasm for the program and I am excited at the possibility of what we can accomplish together.\"\nDuring the 2014-15 school, the Cambridge Weekend Backpack Program served nearly 250 students throughout 10 different schools and sent home over 10,000 bags of food, up from 7,000 the previous year.
