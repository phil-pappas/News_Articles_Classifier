Michele Mossop by Amanda Saunders and James Thomson BHP Billiton will ask Australian shareholders to effectively sacrifice some of the company's franking credits to allow it to meet its dividend requirements to its UK shareholders.\nThe global miner will ask shareholders in both its ASX-listed and UK-listed companies to vote on a change to the way dividends are funded under its dual listed company structure.\nBHP commits to paying both groups of shareholders exactly the same dividend. However, following the spin-off of South32 earlier this year, there are no longer enough assets held in the UK company to generate the income needed to pay British shareholders share, which is 40 per cent, of BHP's $US6.5 billion progressive dividend.\nUnder the BHP proposal the Australian company would effectively make a payment to the British company to allow it to pay the UK dividend. However, the payment will be made in after tax dollars, and as such, franking credits will attach to the payment from the Australian company to the UK company.\nBut franking credits cannot be used outside Australia, meaning some Australian investors may feel the credits are going to waste.\nBHP insists it will be able to continue to pay a fully franked dividend for the forseeable future, pointing to $US25.4 billion in franking credits currently stored on its balance sheet.\nUnder the current DLC structure, Australian shareholders own 60 per cent of BHP and UK shareholders hold 40 per cent but only the dividend paid to Australian shareholder has a franking credit attached.\nThe new scheme has been planned so that debt is not paid to fund the dividend to UK shareholders.\n In order for the UK company to pay a dividend, under UK law it needs not only cash, it also needs \"distributable reserves\", which is profits.\nThe spin-off of South32 in May this year, which took many assets housed under the UK company, has accelerated the delicne of the PLC's distributable reserves balance. In the past few years the Australian company - cashed up thanks largely to the iron ore business - has been lending to the UK company in order to match cash dividends.\nWhen the DLC structure was created in 2001 - when BHP merged with Billiton - one of the fundamental requirements was that cash dividends would be equal for both the UK and Australian companies - the matching dividend policy.\nThe new proposal, called the DLC Dividend Share, is designed to support the matching dividend policy and BHP would argue it could have introduced the instrument at any time since the DLC's 2001 inception.\nBHP would also argue that Australian shareholders should support the proposal because they cannot get paid a dividend unless UK shareholders are paid the same amount, and it the new scheme is the cheapest way to secure it. This new scheme is needed if Australian shareholders want to continue getting their share of the $US6.5 billion annual dividend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:14:34.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
