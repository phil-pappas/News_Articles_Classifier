The central bank has been releasing sectoral credit data since 2007.\nLoans to industry grew 4.8% to an outstanding of Rs 26.22 lakh crore and the growth was driven mainly by disbursals to micro and small industries. Disbursals to large companies grew 6.1% to an outstanding of Rs 21.31 lakh crore. Given this deceleration in credit growth to manufacturing companies, the overall non-food credit growth was at 8.4% in July. Within industry, a secular deceleration was seen across sectors. Loan disbursals to the troubled infrastructure sector, which includes power, roads, telecommunication and others, slowed to 8.3% from 11.1% a year ago.\nDisbursals to the iron and steel industry, the bugbear in banks’ asset quality, grew at a faster clip of 10.5% compared with 6.4% last year. The growth in disbursals has largely been due to refinance by banks (some under the RBI ’s 5/25 scheme) rather than fresh demand.\nThe growth in loans to services also decelerated to 6.4% from 11.8% a year ago, the data showed. Within services, loan disbursals to trade companies grew the fastest, followed by software makers, largely owing to small base. Loans to trade companies stood at an outstanding of Rs 3.7 lakh crore while those to computer software makers was Rs 19,417 crore. Disbursal to non-banking finance companies saw the biggest fall to 1% in July from 12.1% a year ago.\nThe driver of non-food credit continued to be the retail segment. Retail loans grew fastest at 16.8% to Rs 12.18 lakh crore. Within retail, growth in home loans remained consistent at 17% while credit card outstanding rose at a faster pace of 21.3%. Most banks are relying on the retail segment to shore up their credit growth for 2015-16 with pick up in corporate loan growth still muted. A separate data release from the RBI on Wednesday showed that non-food credit grew by 9.77% as of August 21.\n 03, 2015 12:15 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:57:59.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
