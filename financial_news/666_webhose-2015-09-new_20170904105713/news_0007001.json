People began sharing personal information with friends and acquaintances on everything from home life, work, stress and even personal finances.\nCanadians are big users of social media, particularly the younger Millennial generation (those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s).\nA recent study by Forum Research, for instance, found that Facebook is the top social media network in Canada followed by LinkedIn, Twittter and Instagram.\nCanadians visit Facebook about nine times each week. The network is popular among youth and 75 per cent of the people using it earn between $80,000 and $100,000.\nLinkedIn is used by Canadians about twice a week on average. It's most popular with the middle-aged (45-54 years of age) and 46 per cent who use it are high income earners making between $100,000 and $250,000.\nTwitter is used about five times a week with 31 per cent of users earning $80,000 or more and Canadians visit Instagram about six times each week. Eighteen per cent of those using it earn less than $20,000 and 18 per cent earn between $80,000 and $100,000.\n\"\"There is no question that social communication has made Canadians comfortable sharing personal details with their social networks and personal finances are no exception,\" says Rob Serra, Regional Director with Investors Group. \"While there can be benefits to learning and seeking the advice of others, there can be downsides to the openness of these forums that can lead Canadians into making bad decisions or down a path that could lead to debt.\"\nSome of the dangers of social media are that people can fall prey to the desire to \"keep up with the Jones'\" and become the recipients of poor investment advice.\n\"Talking openly with friends about money can have its benefits,\" says Serra. \"A friend who has specific personal finance goals may set a good example and encourage you to identify your own goals and take the right steps towards achieving them. On the flip side of the coin conversations can have its negatives like jealousy, trying to keep up and over spending.\"\nFriends, for example, can make suggestions that don't necessarily fit with your personal situation. They might tell you about their new BMW or about some investment winners that they recently made. This could make you want what they have and purchase something you can't afford or make an investment without knowing about it or how much they paid for it.\nA survey in the United States has found that money can strain a friendship. One in five Americans admitted that they have experienced financial pressure to keep up with their friends.\n\"Friends can make suggestions that don't quite fit with your personal financial situation,\" Serra says. \"Situations are unique to the individual and therefore require a professional financial plan tailored to their individual needs and circumstances.\"\nSerra offers some suggestions about having conversations and getting information on financial matters through social media.\nThe first is to remember who is reading what you post. In addition to close friends it could include colleagues, family and acquaintances and posted information is difficult to retract.\nYour friends are not experts. While they may provide some insight, a financial adviser has the knowledge and expertise to help you develop a plan that includes competing priorities and can identify ways you can best manage your assets.\nYour spending and savings should reflect your financial position. \"Set up a personal financial plan and corresponding budget that is directly related to your income, obligations and goals,\" Serra advises. \"If you feel you a paling in comparison to your friends' ability to spend and save, talk with a financial adviser about where changes can be made.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:13:17.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
