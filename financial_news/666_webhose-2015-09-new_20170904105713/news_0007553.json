Both divisions are reportedly operating profitably.\nIn March, former Melbourne Football Club captain Greg Healy was appointed president of Quiksilver and tasked with leading a revival of the ailing brand in the US.\nThe deal with Oaktree is believed to include a $US175 million lifeline, which will see the private equity giant take control of the struggling company.\nOaktree played a major role in rescuing rival brand Billabong in 2013 after the group’s fortunes plunged on the back of weak sales and prolonged takeover tussles.\nOaktree’s managing director Matthew Wilson, yesterday stepped down from the Billabong board citing an unnamed conflict of interest.\nCalifornia-based Quiksilver has struggled for several years as competition in the surf sector, changing fashion tastes and weak consumer sentiment hit sales.\nLast year the chain suffered a 13 per cent drop in sales, and chalked up a net loss of $US309.4 million ($440 million).\njane.harper@news.com.au\n Quiksilver sinks into bankruptcy", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/surf-brand-quiksilver-sinks-into-bankruptcy-in-us-ahead-of-oaktree-capital-bailout-deal/story-fni0dcne-1227519314404"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T07:25:36.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
