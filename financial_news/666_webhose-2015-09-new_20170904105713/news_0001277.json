Butler Posted: 09/20/2015 12:01:00 AM PDT Updated: 09/20/2015 06:40:19 AM PDT The investment challenge for retirees is that of shifting gears from saving to spending. Many of us don't know where to start. As retirement rolls around, we may have what might be considered enough money, but our favorite investments just keep growing. We're loath to part with any of them -- especially those that have done so well over the past six years. \nSo what are the parameters that define an optimal portfolio for providing retirement income? In general terms, I have recommended combinations of high-yield bond funds coupled with stock funds loaded up with high dividend-paying stocks. We can live on the interest and the dividends and occasionally dip into the principal slightly to bring annual income to about 5 percent of assets. Use inexpensive index or ETF funds to accomplish this and avoid paying commissions or any other advisory fees. The latter just reduces what would have been the 5 percent. None of this is all that scientific. It's just practical advice, and the numbers are based on years of investment history. \nI've been upstaged academically, however, by an authoritative article written by Hal Ratner in the June/July issue of Morningstar magazine. The title and subtitle say it all: \"An Efficient Portfolio for the Income Investor -- Knowing an Investor prefers income over total return changes the portfolio construction dynamics.\" Full of incomprehensible statistical notation that would give any non-math major a headache, the article points out that although there is a long-established efficient frontier for the mix of investments that grow a portfolio, the same type of efficient allocation can be identified for maximizing income from a retirement portfolio. Advertisement \nSince 1952, the term \"efficient frontier\" has referred to the Harry Markowitz concept of modern portfolio theory whereby a given mix of investments, for the amount of risk they bring, will create the greatest possible gain for that level of risk. By comparison, there exist plenty of portfolios (mix of mutual funds or stocks) that, based on past history, would have the same expected return but with a lot more volatility risk. The idea is to use the efficient frontier to define the mix of investments that create the desired level of return with the least amount of risk for that level. \nHere's an example: A total stock market fund can be expected to earn total returns of around 10 percent over long periods of time, but two-thirds of the years the returns can range anywhere between 27 percent and a minus-7 percent. A mix of one-third bonds and two-thirds stocks can be expected to generate returns of about 9 percent over long periods of time but the range can be between 21 percent and minus-3 percent. Dropping to a 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds reduces the expected return to 7.5 percent without reducing the risk much further, so the two-thirds/one-third mix of a balanced fund is considered to be the \"sweet spot\" from an efficient markets standpoint. \nApplying \"efficient markets\" to a portfolio designed to generate income as its primary objective, the optimal portfolio in the Morningstar article includes the following: long-term investment grade corporate bonds 20 percent; high-yield corporate bonds 40 percent; emerging markets bonds 40 percent. An investor electing this allocation clearly has income as their highest priority. If they are staying this course, they are saying that they can live with what would be substantial fluctuations or volatility of the underlying bond funds. \nBond fund volatility is only a problem for people who plan to do something else with the money. If all they care about is generating as much income as possible to perpetuity, they should be able to live with bond fund risk that becomes a wash over time. In essence, this is what the Morningstar article is illustrating, but I have spared you the hieroglyphics of the statistical notation.
