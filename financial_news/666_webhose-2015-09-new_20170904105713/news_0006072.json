According to Bloomberg data the fall in reserves were $ 1.54 billion compared with China's $ 93.91 billion, Indonesia's $ 2.21 billion and Malaysia's $ 2 billion. \nIn August, China decided to devalue the yuan as a result the impact of it was felt by even other emerging market currencies which had weakened against the dollar. In the month of August the rupee had depreciated by 3.65 per cent against the dollar. \n\"RBI's interventions has really helped the rupee else it would have weakened further in August. Even after this fall in foreign exchange reserves, it is adequate to face the US Fed's actions,\" said Sandeep Gonsalves, forex consultant and dealer, Mecklai & Mecklai. \nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its two-day meeting later this week may announce a rate hike which the currency market has been factoring in. The guidance of the policy will hold the key for the market. \n\"The depletion in India's foreign exchange reserves were due to intervention by RBI and the depreciation of other currencies against the dollar which are a part of our foreign exchange reserves. I do no think the US Fed's hike is an immediate issue. But if dollar continues to appreciate again emerging market currencies, then China may be forced to devalue yuan more. That will have an impact on rupee too,\" said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst, Kotak Securities. \nMonday the rupee ended strong at 66.33 compared with previous close of 66.54 per dollar. However, Banerjee believes that there is more weakness in store for the rupee. \"The rupee may depreciate by another 3 per cent by end- December,\" he said. Since the start of this month the rupee has strengthened by 0.22 per cent against the dollar. \nAmong emerging markets the lowest depreciated in foreign exchange reserves was witnessed by Philippines. For few countries like South Africa, Singapore and Taiwan, the foreign exchange reserves have in fact risen in August.
