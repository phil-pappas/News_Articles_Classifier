With this state-of-the-art lab, Prof. Gerhard Hindricks MD, PhD and his team of physicians at the Heart Center in Leipzig will be able to perform cardiac ablations under real-time MRI guidance using Imricor’s unique MR compatible catheters and EP devices. The lab in Leipzig is the latest in a growing number of interventional MRI suites being built worldwide to use Imricor’s tools to potentially improve ablation outcomes for complex arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Imricor has developed the world’s first and only MR compatible catheter ablation devices to be approved for use in human clinical studies. Currently, Imricor’s Advantage-MR EP Recorder/Stimulator System™ and Vision-MR Ablation Catheter™ are available for use exclusively in clinical investigations.\n“We’re thrilled about the opening of the new dedicated interventional MRI lab at the Heart Center in Leipzig,” said Steve Wedan, CEO of Imricor.“Prof. Hindricks and his team continue to be at the forefront of innovation in electrophysiology, and as they now make this concerted move into MRI guided ablations, Imricor is excited to provide the needed MR compatible tools.”\nAbout Imricor Medical Systems\nImricor Medical Systems is a privately held company that specializes in developing devices and systems that are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
