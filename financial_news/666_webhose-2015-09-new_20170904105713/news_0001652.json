The Renegade series of bikes will be manufactured at Lohia Auto’s production facility at Kashipur in Uttarakhand.\nLohia Auto is part of Rs 600-crore diversified Lohia group and contributes about 20% for the overall turnover. The JV company is investing Rs 100 crore in the next two to three years as part of its manufacturing plans.\nThe company would look at a new manufacturing facility once its current plant reached optimum capacity in the next 2-3 years, he said. “At present, the capacity utilisation is only 15%,” Lohia said.\nUM-Lohia, currently, makes all of its vehicles at Kashipur plant, which has a capacity to produce 1,00,000 units. The company is planning to open 200 dealers by the end of fiscal with 50 dealerships in south and has set a target to sell 10,000 electric two and three-wheelers and diesel three-wheelers by the end of this financial year.\n 25, 2015 7:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T08:48:22.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
