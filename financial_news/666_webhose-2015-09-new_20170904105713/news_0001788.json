The pace of gains in London is worst.\nAverage rents for new rentals in the U.K. capital are up 8.2% over last year, according to the latest HomeLet Rental Index . Average monthly rents topped 1,500 pounds ($2,265) for the first time this summer. Yes, Brooklyn rents are higher, at $2,650, but they’ve risen an average of “just” 3.3% in the past year . (San Francisco rents are rising at an even faster pace, according to Zillow .)\nAnd this map, created by Thrillist , shows just now high they now are — for a one-bedroom apartment within 1 kilometer (0.6 miles, or about a 12-minute walk) of a London Underground station. Not surprisingly, the highest rents are in traditionally expensive neighborhoods like Hyde Park Corner ($4,409) and Knightsbridge ($2,832).\nBut areas that have become increasingly trendy, such as some areas just south of the Thames or those close to the financial districts, are more expensive than Hampstead, traditionally a well-healed area that attracts expatriates. West Hampstead has also caught up with its posher neighbor. The gritty Elephant and Castle area, now the target of a large regeneration project , has almost caught up with Hampstead, too.\nIn keeping with the way U.K. rents are advertised — by the week, not month — the “monthly” numbers on this map are the median rate for just four weeks, not a calendar month, so they’re not directly comparable with U.S. rents. The data come from Find Properly, whose cool interactive graphic also shows rents for larger apartments, based on currently available properties.\nThere’s no breakdown of rents by the amenities included.\nOne takeaway, according to this U.S. Realtor:\nConsider this map a taste of things to come in all US #cities . Costliest residences downtown; cheapest in suburbs. http://t.co/uufWXCxqkH\n— Kevin H.
