RIIA’s conference focuses on mapping the new realities of retirement and will include such renowned retirement leaders including François Gadenne, Executive Director of RIIA; Nicolas Lance, RMA®, Retirement Income Strategies, OneAmerica; Professor Moshe Milevsky, York University; and Professor Wade Pfau, The American College.\nWhy is retirement planning different for women? “Women are completely comfortable talking about “M-word” topics like marriage, motherhood, martinis, mammograms and menopause,” says Mantell. “But bring up money and the conversations screech to a halt.”\nMantell, in a mission to turn up that money conversation and promote financial independence among women, shares her thought-provoking, fun approach to planning for retirement. “Ask how prepared a woman is for retirement and she’ll tell you the date she wants to retire, but not how much money she’ll need for a 30-year retirement.” That’s a problem.\nWhat’s the Deal® with Retirement Planning for Women? provides:\nRealistic perspectives on retirement in the new era,\nA treasure trove of resources to get started,\nPractical examples of how other women are redesigning and reinventing retirement.\nThe book offers a critical overview of Social Security which is often the foundation of income for nearly every woman in retirement. Mantell will offer a free Kindle edition of her new book from September 16 – 20, 2015. Those interested in the free book should go to Amazon and order online.\nMeet Marcia Mantell\nFor nearly 25 years, Marcia Mantell has helped the country’s foremost financial services firms, advisors and consumers increase their knowledge of complex retirement concepts and regulations through innovative retirement income planning workshops and programs.
