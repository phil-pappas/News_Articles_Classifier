Fairfax Media by Edmund Tadros Tim Dodd Attending an elite Group of Eight university does not necessarily lead to the best job or a superior higher education, according to newly released data.\nGraduates of Victoria's tiny University of Divinity had the best job outcomes of any institution with 87 per cent of graduates employed full-time four months after completely their course. This high percentage may be due, in part, to the higher proportion of students already working and studying part-time at the university. Bond University students gave their institution the highest score for overall university experience - a rating of 90.2 per cent.\nGroup of Eight member, The University of Western Australia, was the only elite institution to top one of the categories measured with its students earning the highest median salary of $63,000.\nThe information, which has never been released to the public before, is based on the 2012-13 survey Department of Education's Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching survey program.\nNotes: Employment status is based on the percentage of graduates available for work who were employed full-time four months after completing their course, the median salary is based on graduates in full-time employment and student course rating is based on the percentage of undergraduate students who were satisfied with their overall educational experience.\nGraphic ", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/iframeresizer/iframeResizer.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-16T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:07:58.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
