But, on a one-year and two-year time period, Thomas Cook's betas are -0.14 and -0.18, respectively. This dramatic shift in its beta means Thomas Cook has shifted from being a very cyclical stock to one that is slightly counter cyclical. \nThere are many reasons for these recent shifts, and the main explanation is the recapitalisation and restructuring of the company back in 2012. Because of this, Thomas Cook has transformed itself from being an unprofitable and highly indebted business into one that is both profitable and financially sound. And as these changes seem to have structurally changed the nature of the business, the reduction in its beta will likely be long lasting. \nAlthough the travel business is very cyclical, the determinants of travel spending is much more dependent on the local economic conditions of where the tourist originates, rather than global economic factors. In Thomas Cook's case, its largest customer base is in the UK, Germany and the rest of Northern Europe, where economic conditions have been relatively benign. The weakening outlook for emerging market actually benefits Thomas Cook, as the associated falls in the value of their currencies have decreased the relative cost of foreign holidays in many so-called \"sunny\" locations. \nInternational Personal Finance (LSE: IPF) has seen similar downward shifts in its betas. In this case, the reduction IPF's betas is likely due to changing way investors look at the company. The focus of uncertainty for the short term loan lender has shifted away from the economy to legal and regulatory issues. And as the outlook of IPF's earnings is increasingly determined by non-cyclical factors, IPF has become a less cyclical stock. \nKaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ) and Vedanta Resources (LSE: VED) have also seen unusual downward shifts in their beta (although Kaz Minerals did see an increase in its beta in the two-year period). This is all the more surprising, given that many mining groups, most notably Glencore , have seen their betas increase. \nThe shift in the beta of these two mining companies is likely due to the earlier falls in their share prices in 2014, as both companies have long been dealing with relatively high production costs and slow production growth. This should mean these shifts in their betas will only persist in the short term. \nGlobal investment manager Henderson Group (LSE: HGG) has seen more limited shifts in its betas, reflecting the minimal structural change that has affected the company in recent years. The relative stability in Henderson's beta should mean the stock would continue to perform in a reliably highly cyclical manner. Thus, this makes Henderson's stock one of the best high-beta stocks to buy in anticipation of a market recovery. \nMore than just picking winners? \nBuilding a successful investment portfolio does not only involve picking winners .
