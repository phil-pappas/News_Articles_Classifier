Hong Kong was third, followed by Singapore and Tokyo. Zurich was ranked seventh, the only other European city to make the top 10. \n\"London and New York are often as much complementary as competitive,\" according to a report published Wednesday. \"It is noticeable that assessments for London have been higher since the general election in May 2015.\" \nMr. Cameron’s Conservative Party won an unexpected majority in the May 7 elections. The victory was welcomed by markets with stocks and the pound rallying as the results defied forecasts for a hung parliament. \n“London really does stand above the rest,\" Chris Cummings, chief executive officer of TheCityUK financial industry group, said in a separate statement. \"This doesn’t mean we can afford to take our eye off the ball. The future of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union is arguably the most pressing issue.\" \nThe research group studies 98 financial centers and provides profiles, ratings and rankings for each using factors such as human capital, infrastructure and reputation as well as responses to an online survey from financial-services executives. The index, created in 2005, is updated in September and March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:34:23.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
