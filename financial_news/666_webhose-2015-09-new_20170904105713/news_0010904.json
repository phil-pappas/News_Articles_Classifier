June’s value had been restated from 143.3 to 146.4. On a year-over-year basis, the SBLI is up 13% compared to July 2014. The July release marks the 28th monthly increase in lending activity and investing by small businesses and is the second highest point since inception in 2005.“At times of shifting foreign economies and softness for big companies, this latest data release shows small business a key driver for the U.S. economy,” states William Phelan, president of PayNet. Borrowings and investments increased in all of the 10 largest states on a year-over-year basis. Among the largest states, the biggest increases show up in FL (+10%), CA (+8%) and PA (+9). At the other end of the spectrum, the smallest, yet still positive increases, show up in OH (+3%), NC (+2%) and IL (+0.2%). The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Delinquency Index (SBDI) 31-90 days past due decreased 2 basis points from 1.23% in June 2015 to 1.21% in July 2015. This is the first month since April 2014 that delinquency has declined on a year-over-year basis. Compared to one year ago, delinquency decreased 3 basis points.“All of this means positives for the economy, more capex spending, more job openings and above average credit quality for loans in the remainder of 2015,” Phelan noted. \nPayNet Inc . is the leading provider of credit ratings on small businesses enabling lenders to achieve optimal risk management, growth and operational efficiencies.
