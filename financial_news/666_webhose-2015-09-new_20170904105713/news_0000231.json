Ltd. The Taipei-based engineering firm, which employs 37 people and has annual revenue of $10 million, develops recycled plastic materials for use in building construction, interior design and consumer products.\nMr. Huang, who has a master’s degree in architecture from Harvard University, started Miniwiz in 2005. He began with $20,000 in capital, initially creating such products as solar and wind electricity generators to power mobile phones.\nMr. Huang talked to The Wall Street Journal about the challenges of starting a materials business in Taiwan, where recycling rates are among the highest in the world. Below are edited excerpts from the interview:\nWhat is Miniwiz?\nWe believe it is wise to minimize. We have to minimize the carbon footprint by using recycled resources. We want to change the linear economy to a circular one, so that all the energy we put into a new product can be reused again.\nIn reality, nobody likes old stuff because our economy is based on increasing demand, so we can try to create new demand for recycled material. I think eventually, we can reduce the carbon footprint, lower the environmental footprint and maintain economic growth at the same time. Our general idea is to use the most sustainable and least toxic material to create new material for new products in the future.\nENLARGE Arthur Huang in a Miniwiz-designed airplane. Photo: Diana Jou How did you start Miniwiz?\nFor a lot of us who started this company together, it was anger management therapy. We think there are a lot of things in the world that are not very fair--how people are treated, how materials are being distributed and how wealth is being distributed. I started manufacturing with my friends, researching materials and trying to get recycled paper on solar panels in 2005. We had initial success in 2007 and 2008, when we actually generated close to $2.8 million in revenue.\nThen, of course, the financial crisis hit. Sales dropped to zero. I’m very thankful that throughout the years, every time we had a leap in sales, something major happened. It forces you to innovate and create new ideas. So we took what he had learned--mostly related to wind power, solar power and transportation devices like bicycles--and we moved into architectural materials in 2008. We invested all the money we got from the first two or three products into building materials.\nWhy did you begin developing materials for building construction and architecture?\nI think this was a very lucky and very, very fortunate move because one of our biggest problems is that there is not enough scale to actually use recycled materials. The scale you need to create your own materials is actually quite large. We are looking at a minimum of 500 kilograms for a test order, or 50 tons for a production run. So how many iPhones or other products do you have to sell to make 50 tons of material using your own non-toxic technique of manufacturing recycled materials?\nArchitecture was a lucky break for us. For a 10-meter long wall, you’d easily use up 10 tons of material. The fact that it uses such a large volume means the business has enough margin for you to create your own material. That gave me the comparative advantage to continue doing more research and development, and at the same time, survive and create income for our office.\nWhat kinds of products does Miniwiz make?\nWe have supplier contracts for products like shelves, chairs, very simple things. Maybe you are buying a trash can, a carton of vitamins, a moon-cake box, or using an alarm clock. Some of these products may already use our materials, but you just don’t know it. We have crazy projects like building boats and airplanes.\nWhat are the major challenges in the recycling business?\nThere are two major hurdles. You need very talented people. You have to retain engineers who are strong communicators because you have to educate the clients, and you have to educate the suppliers.\nThe second challenge is financing. If we bring a technology to a supplier or investor, they may not want to partner with you because they are optimized for using new materials. They don’t want to do it because they will have to make a lot of investment on their front.\nENLARGE Why did you build your company in Taiwan?\nTaiwan has accumulated 40 years of global manufacturing experience. The supply chain is very complete. It went from crude oil refineries to high-tech semiconductors, LCD screens, LED lighting, and then all the way to the iPhone and Apple Watch. Taiwan develops everything from raw material all the way to very precise consumer electronics. We can test, and we gain a lot of knowledge from suppliers’ manufacturing experience. That certainly helps us to progress at a much quicker speed compared to when we were in New York and Shenzhen.\nHow important is recycling in Taiwan?\nWe have this grand vision of low carbon and no toxicity in all materials and products. Taiwan has almost the highest recycling rate in the world. We are blessed with an infrastructure and the culture of a society that is already recycling. Every day around 10 a.m., you can hear recycled trash cars driving across all of the communities playing Mozart and Beethoven, and everyone comes out with their sorted trash. Everyone has to pay for their trash bags too, so trash reduction by itself becomes a natural thing. The fact that Taiwan is an island and not many resources are coming in means that every resource has to be reused and redeveloped, because every time you import a new resource, it costs a lot.\nWhat are some of the challenges you faced when starting Miniwiz?\nWe have these projects I call mission-impossible projects. These mission-impossible projects move people’s ideas a step forward. Let’s imagine a compression element using 100% recycled materials and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which is waterproof and fireproof. Can you do that for a center with 7 million visitors? A permanent museum? That’s what we call mission-impossible.\nIn Milan, we built a portable Nike basketball stadium that fits 1,000 people into a 40-foot container, all made from recycled material, without digging a single foundation. People all of a sudden said, “Wow, that is really cool. A system that’s so innovative, and all of that is made from trash.”\nWhat advice would you give to young entrepreneurs today?\nI think this generation of entrepreneurs is blessed with the Internet. There is no longer an academic hierarchy, so that someone who goes to school will learn more than you. You can find any information today for free, but this generation also has it very difficult, precisely because all information is free. How do you accumulate a comparative advantage over others? If you are going to start a company, you better think hard about that. What kind of value do you need to be competitive today? I would say the most valuable asset entrepreneurs should have is energy and passion.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO074_arthur_M_20150930014734.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO074_arthur_TOP_20150930014734.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI064_INNOVA_TOP_20150916003611.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KI064_INNOVA_M_20150916003611.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:20:35.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
