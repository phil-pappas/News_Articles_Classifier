That has raised questions over how long that government could survive.\n\"I have spent my entire political career fighting against Mr. Harper's narrow and meaner vision of what Canada can be and what the government should do,\" Justin Trudeau told reporters during a campaign stop.\n\"There are no circumstances in which I would support Stephen Harper to continue being prime minister of this country.\"\nTrudeau showed himself more open to the idea of allowing a minority New Democratic Party government to take power. The two parties are to the left of Harper's Conservatives, who is running for a rare fourth consecutive term in office.\nAsked whether there was a circumstance in which his party would help install an NDP government, Trudeau said, \"The Liberal party has always been open in minority situations to working with other members of the house to pass legislation that serves Canadians.\" (Writing by Leah Schnurr ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:43:35.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
