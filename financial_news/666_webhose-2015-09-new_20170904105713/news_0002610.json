However, it warned that future earnings would be hit by the new Living Wage, which is due to be phased in from April next year. \nThe high street retailer, which shows no signs of losing its crown as \"the undisputed king of trainers\", generated pre-tax profits of £44.7m, a rise of 88pc on last's year's £23.7m. \nRevenues rose to £810m, up from £670m the same time last year. \nAs anticipated, the company has experienced strong like-for-like sales growth of more than 10pc as the British economy continued to recover. However, the retailer added that being forced to implement a higher minimum wage for workers would hit growth and employment. \nSpeaking to the BBC this morning, executive chairman Peter Cowgill said that the increased spending power of customers was unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm. \n\"[The Living Wage] is at the cost of expansion, development and perhaps therefore the repercussion in the wider sense is the ongoing cost in terms of increasing employment,\" he said. \nDuring the last six months, JD Sports has opened a new flagship store on London's Oxford Street and expanded into mainland Europe, opening 84 stores. \nMr Cowgill said that he was confident the group could become an international powerhouse. \n\"We believe that we can achieve the same market leading reputation with customers and brands in Mainland Europe where we remain confident in our prospects, despite some significant headwinds on margin from recent weakness in the euro,\" he said. \nJD Sports has benefitted from the collapse of rival brand JJB, which went into administration in 2012. \nIts major competitor on the high street, Sports Direct, focuses on replica kits and discount sportswear, while JD Sports targets more fashion-conscious customers with higher-end goods. \nThe retailer runs 850 stores in the UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:15:19.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
