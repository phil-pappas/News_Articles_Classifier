Camp Equipment offered for sale. \nFormer Fayetteville businessman Andrew C. Judkins was sentenced Thursday to 12 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $438,500 in restitution for two counts of bank fraud. \nIn March, a federal court jury convicted Judkins , now 43 and living in Bixby, Oklahoma, of defrauding First Security Bank of Searcy in a scheme that abused a revolving line of credit called floor-plan financing for his Fayetteville business, A. Camp Equipment LLC. \nEvidence presented at trial showed that Judkins submitted a fake invoice to First Security in 2008 that indicated that his business bought two dump trucks for $500,000 when he had actually paid $60,000 for the trucks in 2007. \nThen in 2009, he showed bank representatives a fake rental agreement indicated that one of the dump trucks — on which First Security had a $250,000 security interest — had been rented when he had actually sold it for $74,000 without repaying the bank. \nU.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks of Fayetteville also sentenced Judkins to two years of supervised release following his prison sentence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:40:55.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
