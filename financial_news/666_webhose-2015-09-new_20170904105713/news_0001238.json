Kenya has made significant progress on the open data front, but more needs to be done to ensure the data are current and regularly updated,\" Gaye said. \nThe Kenya Statistics Program-for-Results is funded by World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). \nThe bank developed the Program-for-Results (PforR) financing instrument.

Mistiaen, Economist and the Program's Team Leader. \n\"Moreover, current estimates of poverty and inequality are based on data that are a decade old. This operation will support a program of economic and household surveys - including the ongoing 2015-16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey - to update these statistics and henceforth produce these data on a regular basis,\" Mistiaen said. \nThe activities supported by the new operation are aligned to the government's Vision 2030 and the second Medium Term Plan, which underscore that data and statistics are essential for evidence-based policy making and also for monitoring the development impact. \nThis will create new jobs, reduce extreme poverty and contribute to shared prosperity in line with the bank's country partnership strategy for Kenya.
