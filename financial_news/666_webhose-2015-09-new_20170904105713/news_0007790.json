Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey At least nine supporters of Malcolm Turnbull will be promoted in the reshuffle of the frontbench this weekend while a number of those who backed Tony Abbott will be asked to stay.\nSources said there will be at least three vacancies in the cabinet, created by the ousting of Mr Abbott, and the expected dumping of Employment Minister Eric Abetz and Defence Minister Kevin Andrews.\nThis would enable Mr Turnbull to promote three new faces into cabinet, three into the outer ministry and to appoint three new parliamentary secretaries.\nAbbott supporter and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton had been tipped to go after it emerged he had offered his resignation on Monday night after the leadership spill.\nIt emerged Mr Dutton offered his resignation as the honourable course of action but he received no response from Mr Turnbull and he is now eager to stay if asked.\nMr Turnbull confirmed a significant number of women would be promoted to address the gender imbalance created by Mr Abbott.\n\"There is no greater enthusiast than me for seeing more women in positions of power and influence in Parliament, in ministries right across the country. I can assure you that,\" he said.\nAbbott supporters Mathias Cormann, Josh Frydenberg, Greg Hunt and Andrew Robb are expected to stay where they are while those in line for promotion include Arthur Sinodinos, who has been linked to Employment and Workplace Relations. Junior minister Simon Birmingham is tipped to enter cabinet and replace Mr Turnbull as Communications Minister.\n Treasurer Joe Hockey, who will be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, has discussed with Mr Turnbull staying in the cabinet but taking another portfolio.\n\"I have had discussions with the Prime Minster, we'll leave it at that,\" he said.\n\"I want to make a difference for Australia.\"\nWith elements of the right still seething at the dumping of Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey urged everybody to unify behind Mr Turnbull, warning disunity would see Labor win government.\nSA senator Cory Bernardi is threatening leaving the Liberals to form his own party.\nSenator Cormann, the Finance Minister, pledged his unequivocal support for Mr Turnbull.\n\"I am a team player, I always have been, always will be. Malcolm Turnbull will have by complete, absolute, unequivocal and loyal support and I will support his effort in whatever capacity he sees fit,\" Senator Cormann said.\nSimilarly, Mr Frydenberg said: \"My responsibility is to get behind Malcolm.\"\nThere has been scuttlebutt that Senator Sinodinos could be given Finance but others argue that both Senator Cormann and Mr Frydenberg have performed well and should stay, especially if the Treasurer were to be replaced.\nAs he announced that Australian hornets bombed an Islamic State personnel carrier two days ago, revealed by US CENTCOM, Mr Andrews suggested it would be disruptive if he was shifted out of his ministry.\n\"I think continuity at the moment is quite important in this instance, we are operating in this mission in Iraq, we still have forces in Afghanistan, we are virtually weeks away from the publication of the Defence white paper,\" he said.\nEducation Minister Christopher Pyne has been tipped to shift to Defence but Assistant Defence Minister Stuart Robert would also be a candidate.\nThe government is hoping an anticipated boost in the polls will quell the rancour among the hard right.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:06:51.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
