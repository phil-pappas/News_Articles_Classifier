It was an ad that paid us,\" said Buffett, 85, who over the past five decades has built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world's most valuable companies. \nBuffett - the world's third richest person, according to Forbes, with a fortune of $72.7 billion - is avidly followed by investors, and his opinions on companies and assets move markets globally. \nHe spoke to Reuters in an interview while in New York for the Glide Foundation's 16th annual event charity lunch. Glide is a nonprofit in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that provides food, healthcare, rehabilitation and other services to the poor and homeless. \nBuffett also praised Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is vying for her party's nomination for the presidency, saying she would \"work like the dickens\" should she win the November 2016 election. \nClinton has faced increased pressure on the left from Vermont's Bernie Sanders. While Buffett praised Sanders' campaigning skills, he has said previously that he is unlikely to vote for the progressive senator. \nWhile market economies do produce some inequality, Buffett said, he lamented that so many Americans now find themselves struggling in the world's biggest economy. \nTo help combat poverty, Buffett called for a \"significantly\" larger earned income tax credit for lower income Americans. \nAnd while Clinton has proposed increased profit-sharing between companies and employees, Buffett said that he thought markets were best placed to make those kinds of decisions. \n(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:05:17.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
