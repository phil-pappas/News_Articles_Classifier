An underutilized housing asset is transformed into a source of revenue, and through Airbnb or its competitors, it is effortlessly -- as far as the host goes -- marketed to an international audience. But understand: there is a downside -- a big, largely undiscussed downside. First, however, devour the upside: people are turning spare bedrooms, vacant apartments and little-used second homes into cash cows. Airbnb -- whose inventory includes everything from livingroom couches to mansions -- has noted that in New York “the typical host earns $7,530 per year.” Other cities have different results, but everywhere hosts are pulling in thousands of dollars annually. Not too shabby. Except: there also is a downside to being a sharing economy host, and the negatives go beyond the obvious. As for the obvious, there are four big ones: many cities are looking at blocking Airbnb (some already have); many homeowner and condominium associations flatly ban short-term rentals; most standard apartment leases forbid subletting); and most standard homeowner's insurance policies do not - without additional riders - fully cover use of the property as a short-term rental. Fines, evictions and insurance cancellation can, sometimes, result. Know the risks. Even knowing the big four risks, millions of us nonetheless are plowing ahead with putting our underutilized real estate into the sharing economy. But also know: there are still more downsides that rarely are discussed. Such as? Time lost . Andrew McConnell, the CEO of VacationFutures, a wholesale marketplace for vacation rentals, said that on average a host will spend eight hours a week prepping and managing a property. That’s fact: rooms and houses have to be prepared for incoming guests (sheets and towels washed, windows cleaned, etc.), and even when that work is subcontracted out, it has to be supervised. And paying for the prep and cleanup directly slices into the profits. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T19:15:29.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
