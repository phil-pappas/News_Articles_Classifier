The price and timing are subject to change depending on stock-market volatility and how investors react to a pending roadshow, the people said. First Data filed in July to sell stock, without specifying a fundraising target or timing. \nMore from Bloomberg.com: China Just Killed the World's Biggest Stock-Index Futures Market \nFirst Data is KKR’s biggest equity bet ever: Eight years ago the buyout firm took the payment company private for $29.8 billion, including debt and fees. The planned stock sale would leap past other U.S. IPOs this year, such as Tallgrass Energy GP LP’s $1.38 billion offering and Fitbit Inc.’s $841 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nSpokesmen for First Data and KKR declined to comment. \nFirst Data runs a debit-card network, processes bank-card transactions and provides data analytics and other services to merchants. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt. \nThe company selected Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. to manage the offering, according to a regulatory filing last month. KKR will help underwrite the deal. Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG also are among the 15 underwriters managing the offering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:10:13.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
