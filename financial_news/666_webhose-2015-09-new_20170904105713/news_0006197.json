It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) became engineering conglomerate Vickers-Armstrongs in 1927, and simply Vickers 50 years later . \nThe factory was officially reopened last week by Alan Shearer, the former Newcastle United footballer, after lying dormant for three years. In 2012, BAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) , the former owner of the site, announced the closure of the factory with the loss of 330 jobs . \nMr Reece, who died in 2012 , is succeeded by his son John, 54. He is now the same age that his father was when he started the company. \n“This was one of the earliest examples of a university spin-out; my father was an academic for most of his life,” he says. “I can’t imagine what he might have achieved if he’d started a business at 24.” \nReece Group has a diversified business model, making medical instruments, drilling machinery for the oil and gas industry and, most notably, products for the defence industry. \nThe company manufactures mine rollers, which allow tanks to survive improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and have been used by almost every Western army, as well as other equipment deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. “We’ve saved a lot of soldiers’ lives,” says Reece. \nThe company, which has a turnover of £70m, has consolidated its pothole repair firm Velocity, defence specialist Pearson Engineering and machining and fabrication business Responsive Engineering into the new site, moving 500 people. \nIt aims to grow its defence arm significantly over the next two years. “We’ve just won a contract to refurbish 60 Challenger (Hamburg: 4SE.HM - news ) 2 tanks ,” says Reece. “They were originally built in this factory, so it’s like they’re coming home.” Britain’s Warrior armoured tanks are also due an overhaul. \nReece claims that the company will take on 100 new people in the next 18 months and turnover will rise to £100m. \nInnovation is crucial to the company’s survival all the defence products are designed by Reece Group’s team of engineers and scientists. The business has now established its own Innovation Centre to generate a steady pipeline of new inventions. \n“We employ 12 people in the centre but we’re also supporting other start-ups,” says Reece. “We have one medical equipment business in there at the moment.” \nMuch of the Innovation Centre’s current work centres on condition monitoring and data collection for big ultility companies, an area that Reece believes could prove lucrative in future. “It’s early days as we’ve only been going for a year,” he says. “But as a family business, it’s important that our assets are as diversified as possible.” \nReece Group once provided a significant amount of drilling machinery to oil and gas companies but that industry went into freefall when the price of oil fell. “Many of the markets we work in are extremely volatile,” says Reece. “Everyone wants the highest quality at the lowest price, so we’re always under pressure.” \nAnother challenge for the company is finding talented people. It runs its own apprenticeship programme , taking in unskilled workers and training them up over four years. \nThis is extremely expensive Reece claims that only 10pc to 15pc of their working hours are actually productive during this time but is often the only way to get the right kind of technical abilities into the business. “We’re one of the bigger employers of apprentices in Newcastle. One-in-10 of our staff came through as an apprentice.” \nThe family also runs a charitable trust, the Reece Foundation, which works to find and train up the next wave of British engineers. As for the future management of the company, according to Reece, there are seven members of the family in the next generation that could come into the business . “They are all either in education or getting experience in other companies,” he says. “I’m hoping that some of them will come back.” \nReece Group is one of several companies investing heavily in the North East. Its Armstrong Works redevelopment follows the £82m Hitachi (Other OTC: HTHIF - news ) train plant in County Durham and the latest £100m investment by Nissan into its Sunderland plant. \n“At the moment, more jobs are being created in the North East at a faster rate than anywhere else in the UK and wages are going up faster,” George Osborne, the Chancellor, said last week. \nReece is hopeful that his new factory will reach capacity within two to three years, contributing to the North East boom. “As a Geordie, I’m committed to Newcastle and the North East,” he says “Our £20m investment is a measure of that commitment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:22:05.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
