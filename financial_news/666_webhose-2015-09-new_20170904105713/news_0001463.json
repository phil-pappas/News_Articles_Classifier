(NasdaqGS and TASE:PHMD) announces two very successful live television home shopping sales events, one in the U.S. at the end of May and the other in the UK at mid-June. Consumers purchased approximately 17,400 units of no!no!™ Hair and retail sales of nearly $3.5 million in a 24-hour period in the U.S. The company’s unit sales exceeded its pre-event expectations, and also exceeded a similar event on home shopping in May 2014 by approximately 4,000 units. In the UK, an event was held on a separate home shopping network exceeding the targeted expectations by completely selling out inventory purchased for the event. \n“Our strategy to focus on the unique benefits of no!no! compared with other home hair removal treatments proved to be a success in both markets when we exceeded our internal stretch goals for both live television events. The no!no! model marketed to consumers during both events was the 8800, which was launched on home shopping in November of 2009. We are very pleased that six years and hundreds of thousands of units later, this model is still generating strong sales on live television home shopping,” said Dr. Dolev Rafaeli, chief executive officer of PhotoMedex. \nAbout PhotoMedex \nPhotoMedex is a global skin health company providing aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians and consumers.
