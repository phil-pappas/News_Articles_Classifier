Much of Chicago's financial distress stems from escalating pension payments, which consume roughly one out of every three city dollars.\nThe garbage assessment, if approved by Chicago's City Council, would leave New York City and Boston as the only major American cities that do not impose any fees on their residents for garbage pickup.\nThe rate Emanuel has settled on also is below garbage-collection fees assessed on residents of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle and several of Chicago's suburbs, according to a briefing document on the proposal circulated to Chicago aldermen and seen on Thursday by Reuters.\n\"I don't see any city, at least among the ones they listed, anywhere close to what the city is charging,\" said Alderman Joe Moore, an Emanuel ally who represents a lakefront ward on Chicago's north side. \"From that point of view, it'll be cheap.\"\nThe mayor's plan will carry teeth for those who are late or do not pay the trash assessment. Their water will be shut off by city crews, who will continue to remove trash because of public health concerns.\nEmanuel's garbage proposal is expected to accompany a $500 million property-tax increase the mayor will unveil in his 2016 city budget proposal on Tuesday. That tax hike represents a 62-percent increase over the existing city property-tax levy.\nThe garbage fee will apply to those who live in single-family homes, two-, three- and four-unit residences. Under current city law, those living in multifamily apartment or condominium dwellings with more than four units must contract for private waste-hauling.\n(Reporting by Dave McKinney; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:28:14.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
