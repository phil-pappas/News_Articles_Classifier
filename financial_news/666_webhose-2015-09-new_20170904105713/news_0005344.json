Rand Paul of Kentucky, who’s seeking the GOP presidential nomination, will headline a rally with several pro-life groups outside the Capitol on Thursday, calling on Congress to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood in the spending bill that must be passed by Oct. 1 to avert a shutdown. \n\"Conservative outside group Heritage Action for America says at least 28 House Republicans have signed or plan to sign a letter demanding that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his leadership team block Planned Parenthood funding. The group is urging leaders to hold a special conference meeting to discuss 'atrocities' carried out by the nonprofit healthcare group. \n\"If that many House Republicans stick to those demands, Boehner would have no wiggle room to pass a stopgap government spending bill. House Democrats would be expected to vote against legislation blocking funding for the group, which is under fire after the release of a series of undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the donation of tissue from aborted fetuses.\" http://bit.ly/1FwEc1m \nHOUSE DEMS ARE WARNING THE GOP: Mike Lillis for The Hill: \"A sharply divided Republican Party intensifies the risk of another government shutdown next month, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) warned Tuesday. \n\"If we shut down government it will be because you have willful Republicans who are prepared to take the government hostage to attain their ends,\" Hoyer told reporters in the Capitol. \"It will not be a stumble, it will be a considered objective,\" he added, \"and a number of them have said so publicly.\" http://bit.ly/1UF6RII \nNOT THE ONION - - > ELIZABETH WARREN AND DONALD TRUMP AGREE ON POLICY.
