Photo: Simon Schluter\nI have just visited my sister who has become a self-managed retiree on the Isle of Wight. Last article we wrote about what she is doing right .\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nThis week, let's handle what she is bound to do wrong, falling victim to the inability to sell.\nThe often subconscious suggestion that you should never sell comes from years of indoctrination that the market only ever goes up, that doing anything short-term is rash and that because intelligent investors such as Warren Buffett ignore the short term, we should too.\nAdvertisement On top of that, selling a stock we bought is an admission that when we bought it we didn't really know what we were doing, that we were wrong, that we changed our minds, that we invested in luck rather than knowledge and that despite our image of ourselves as sophisticated investors worthy of respect, we are, in fact, nothing like Warren Buffett.\nSo when the market falls as it has recently, most part-time investors persist with the pretence that they know what they are doing and fall back on yet another improper Buffettism – the one that says you shouldn't buy anything unless you're happy to shut the sharemarket for 10 years.\nIt's the intergalactic excuse for not admitting that there is some element of chance in this game, and that you can't make a judgment on the incomplete study of the incomplete information available today and have your judgment persist for the rest of your natural life.\nSo instead we grit our teeth and say \"No no no – it'll be OK\" in the hope that we will be bailed out by a market that one day goes up again, which it surely will, in the end, won't it, even if it does take seven years – which is how long it's taken so far to recover the peak in 2007, and we still aren't back there.\nAll this is called denial and pride, and that's how everyone got destroyed in the financial crisis. By gritting their teeth, by pretending they knew better, with their folly fed by our industry's perpetually optimistic media puppets – sorry, strategists – peddling the products of their principals by never ever saying anything negative about the markets and by hedging their reputations with phrases like \"assuming nothing comes out of left field'', an event which seems to happen a lot these days and is immediately dismissed as \"something no one could predict\", was a correction we \"had to have\" but was something nobody managed to predict.\nThe root of the \"can't sell' problem is that despite regular shocks, many investors still think someone should know the future and tell them before it happens, but they are deluded.\nMaking money is not about predicting the future, and it is not about setting stocks in stone on the back of faultless long-term analysis. It is about entering stocks with a high probability of them going up over your chosen time scale. That's the best you can do.\nIt doesn't involve predicting the future. It doesn't require your judgment to persist beyond the moment of purchase. It involves playing the odds, and it is done on the understanding that things change.\nThere are no mistakes in buying a stock, there is just your best effort to choose the best ones, protected by your extreme vigilance, iced with a readiness to change your mind when it goes against you, topped by a willingness to sell freely if the time comes without your pride, conditioning or subconscious getting in the way.\nThe sooner we all learn that, that it is about odds not certainty, the sooner selling will become no big deal and the sooner we'll all stop losing money when the market changes trend – an essential ingredient for making it.\nI love selling; I am well known for selling before I go on holiday, for instance, and my holidays have proved a particularly reliable counter-indicator of the markets. Selling is very cleansing and when you do, it it is remarkable how your state of mind changes.\nYou go from worrying about something falling to hoping it does. You are instantly out of danger, in control and with all options open. You should try it some time.\nMarcus Padley is a stockbroker and the author of the daily stockmarket newsletter Marcus Today.
