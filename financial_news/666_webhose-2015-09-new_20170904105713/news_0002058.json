They bought at the right time and they're selling at the right time,\" he said.\nThe purchase is not AMP's first association with the classic 10-level building â€“ it originally developed the imposing structure on the corner of Collins and Market streets in 1931 as its Melbourne office.\nThe building's tenant list includes the Halim Group's head office, Australian Stock Report, Carepark and retailers Men+Co, Ms Collins and Terra Firma on ground level.\nCBRE's Kiran Pillai, Mark Wizel and Josh Rutman handled the sale.\nMr Rutman said the high ceilings and historic features attracted strong interest from hoteliers looking to convert the Bates, Smart and McCutcheon designed space into prime Collins Street accommodation.\n\"It's almost too good as an office, though. A developer would have to wait at least five years to get the tenants out,\" Mr Rutman said.\nAMP's Wholesale Australian Property Fund paid a passing yield of 5.07 per cent for the classic property.\nThe fund has been an active player recently settling on the Stud Park Shopping centre in Rowville for $154 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T22:39:52.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
