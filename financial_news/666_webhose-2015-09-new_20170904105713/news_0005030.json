A spokeswoman at Total said the company had fully cooperated with FERC. \nThe increase in market manipulation cases in the United States is a derivative of Congress giving regulators \"powerful penalty authority to police against crime in their respective markets,\" said Susan Court, principal at SJC Energy Consultants LLC and a former director of the FERC Office of Enforcement. \nThe staff alleged the scheme at Total involved making \"largely uneconomic trades for physical natural gas during bidweek designed to move indexed market prices in a way that benefited the company's related positions,\" according to the notice. \nIn addition to Total, FERC also named traders and supervisors on the Total Gas & Power North America West Desk, saying that Therese Nguyen and Aaron Hall devised and executed the scheme. Hall declined to comment and Nguyen could not immediately be reached. \nOver the past decade, FERC and other U.S. and world regulatory agencies have increased the policing of manipulation of the energy and financial markets, including an investigation of Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). \nFERC has issued almost $1.2 billion in fines since the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 significantly increased the penalties it can impose, boosting them to $1 million per day per violation from a prior cap of $10,000 per day. \nFERC did not include a potential penalty against Total in its notice of alleged violations, which was dated Sept. 21 but released on Sept. 22. \nThe staff at the FERC Office of Enforcement issues a notice of alleged violations after it has largely finished its investigation and the subject has had a chance to respond and has not agreed to settle. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is often the first step in the process where the subject of an investigation is publicly identified. The usual next step is for the enforcement staff to make a recommendation to the commission to issue a show cause order, which would require the subject being investigated to show why FERC should not issue a penalty. \nFERC said the West Desk implemented the scheme on at least 38 occasions during the period in interest. FERC also said Nguyen and Hall each implemented the scheme and directed other traders in implementing the scheme. \n(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Andrew Hay and Jessica Resnick-Ault and Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:54:04.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
