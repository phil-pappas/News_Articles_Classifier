Nyusi stressed that his first act on American soil was to meet with American businesses. \nHe was not exaggerating. Only a few minutes after his arrival in New York, Nyusi granted an audience to the vice president of the Texas-based oil and gas company Anadarko, James Kleckner. Anadarko is the operator of offshore area one of the Rovuma Basin, off the coast of the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, where vast reserves of natural gas have been found. \n“We are politicians, and our job is to create well-being for the population”, said Nyusi. “But we can only do this with a very strong business sector”. \nNyusi took the opportunity offered by the dinner to display the economic potential of Mozambique, not merely in mineral resources, but also in such areas as tourism, agriculture and the production of energy. \nAs in previous meetings of this nature, Nyusi paid special attention to agricultural development, stressed that “nobody eats gas”. \nThis was an appeal for the diversification of the Mozambican economy, to avoid excessive dependence on natural gas. \nNyusi also stressed the socio-political stability of Mozambique, assuring his audience that all the institutions of the Mozambican state are working normally. \nFor his part, the co-chairperson of the Africa Business Initiative of the US Chamber of Commerce, Don Gips, praised the work undertaken by Nyusi, stressing “this is an exciting moment for our participation in the growth of Mozambique”.
