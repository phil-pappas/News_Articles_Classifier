At the acceptance closing date of tranche two on 28 August 1630 civil servants had accepted the conditional offer. \nThe Minister added: \"The first two tranches of the NICS Voluntary Exit Scheme in themselves will generate paybill savings of approximately £20 million this year and approximately £48 million per annum thereafter. Now that funding is confirmed the NICS Scheme will progress as planned, with the first tranche of 864 staff leaving at the end of September. Tranche two staff will leave at the end of November. \n“I want to end any further uncertainly around the release of staff under the NICS Voluntary Exit Scheme and confirm that, in addition to those staff leaving in September and November, further selections will be made over the coming months to allow more exits at the end of January and March 2016. \n“The Northern Ireland Executive's budget 2015/16 only works if the funding plans in the Stormont House Agreement go ahead. The pay bill savings from the NICS Voluntary Exit Scheme in 2015/16 will equate to approximately £26 million this year and around £100 million per year thereafter.” Notes to Editors: Funding for the public sector Voluntary Exit Schemes is over four years with £200m in 2015-16, £200m in 2016-17, £200m in 2017-18 and £100m in 2018-19. Not all of the Fund may be required as drawdown and will be dependent upon demand by public sector organisations. It is estimated that the total annual savings from all schemes funded by the £200m available this financial year will be in the region of £67m in the year 2015-16 with full year effect of around £150m in subsequent years.
