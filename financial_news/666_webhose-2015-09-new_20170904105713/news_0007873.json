The $700 million part-payment will be split in line of the proportion owed by each.\nLast month Reuters reported that Indian refiners were asked to be prepared to pay $1.4 billion dollars to Iran in two equal installments.\nIndia is Iran's biggest oil client behind China, though New Delhi has reduced purchases under pressure from sanctions.\nIndian refiners together owe Iran more than half of the bill for crude bought since February 2013, when a route to pay for Iranian oil through Turkey's Halkbank was stopped.\nUnder an interim nuclear deal in November 2013, some of Iran's blocked funds were released by Asian buyers, including India.\nIndian companies have deposited 45 percent of their oil payments in a rupee-denominated account at United Commercial Bank, which Iran is allowed to use to buy goods not covered by sanctions, such as food and medicine.
