Manfred Gottschalk Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Economists said the Turnbull government's options are hamstrung by a worsening global outlook, falling commodity prices and pressure from ratings agencies to fix the budget.\nWhile business leaders enthusiastically welcomed the ascension of Malcolm Turnbull , economists pointed out that many of the drivers of economic success remain outside his control.\n\"A change in government or prime minister alone does not deliver the structural reforms necessary to end a low growth, low productivity mix,\" said Adam Boyton, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"That will instead be the result of considered policy analysis and deliberation, the articulation of a case for reform, legislative success and good policy execution. Among other things.\"\nJPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters cautioned: \"For all the likely improvements in sentiment, a Turnbull-led Coalition government will face the same impediments as did its predecessor.\"\n\"There is the same obstructionist opposition party, and the same uncooperative cross-bench MPs in the Senate, who blocked many of the previous government's legislative changes,\" he said.\n\"Also the economy continues to struggle to rotate towards more domestic sources of growth, and the terms of trade still is falling, so the resulting income compression will remain a drag on the budget.\"\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia warned on Tuesday that the darkening global outlook - and in China in particular - has increased risks to Australia's economy, while it is still too soon to know whether Chinese efforts to spur growth will be effective.\n Australia's business community is similar to those in other developed parts of the world, where a focus on cost cutting and overly-cautious investment rules are effectively starving growth opportunities.\nMorgan Stanley economist Daniel Blake urged the new prime minister to address this challenge by rebooting the national infrastructure push, tackling productivity-enhancing reform and making the tax system more efficient.\n\"We would hope that policy areas previously 'ruled-out' of potential change, including negative gearing and superannuation/retirement incomes, are allowed back into a genuine debate.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-16T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:05:13.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
