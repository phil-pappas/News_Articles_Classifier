Mortgage approvals have risen in five of the last seven months and the pace of price rises has picked up. \nNet mortgage lending, which lags approvals, surged by 2.709 billion pounds in July, the biggest increase since July 2008. \nThe BoE said consumer credit grew by 1.173 billion pounds in July, down slightly from a 1.23 billion pound rise in June. But it was up 7.5 percent on an annual basis -- the biggest such increase since April 2006. \nDespite only weak rises in wages for much of the past five years, Britain's economic recovery is still heavily reliant on spending by households. \nThe BoE said lending to non-financial businesses rose 734 million pounds, after a 5.48 billion pound dip in June. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce and Ana Nicolaci Da Costa)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T08:29:34.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
