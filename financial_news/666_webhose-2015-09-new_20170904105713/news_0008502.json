Andrew Meares Will he successfully build the public support necessary for serious workplace relations reform and have the courage to face the relentless campaign that helped bring down the Howard government?\nAnd can he successfully pick up on Abbott's tax reform, and successfully see through the required negotiations with the Liberal and Labor states?\nAbbott's strategy has been to force the states to take political responsibility for more of the money they spend and then offer them a relatively easy alternative to putting up their own taxes: a federally legislated increase in the GST.\nThis is a giant game of bluff that will be played out in an election year. If the Labor states refuse and services are threatened with closure, no-one can be certain who the voters will blame.\n The risk of failure in getting reform through the political process has grown. Once, the Howard government could negotiate its reforms through a hostile senate by appealing to the Australian Democrats to recognise its mandate.\nTwo leaders of the Democrats suffered politically as a result.\nA new generation of populist senate cross-benchers appear to have learned from the Democrats \"mistake\", as Abbott and his Treasurer, Joe Hockey, have had the misfortune to discover.\nThat more than anything has been Abbott's undoing: had the 2014 budget gone through parliament unscathed, Abbott almost certainly would not have faced death by repeated leadership crises in 2015.\nPolitical skill is even more at a premium now.\nAs Paul Keating famously told the parliament, even the Treasury stenographers can tell us what the economy needs, but the essential skill is getting those changes through the political process.\nTurnbull has not done anything like the life-long political apprenticeship that gave prime ministers like John Howard their political sixth sense.\nThat's my main reservation about Turnbull and anyone else who seeks to enter politics at the leadership level on the strength of a successful career elsewhere.\nI have this vision of Turnbull losing control of the politics early and dumping principles and policies in a vane struggle to regain control.\nIf that is what comes to pass, Turnbull's prime ministership may be seen as just a necessary intermediate step between Abbott and his real successor, perhaps Scott Morrison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:13:36.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
