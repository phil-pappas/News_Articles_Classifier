Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Malcolm Turnbull has called a snap summit of business, community and union leaders in Canberra for Thursday to seek consensus for economic reform, which now includes a preparedness to scale back generous tax concessions on superannuation.\nInspired by last month's National Reform Summit co-sponsored by The Australian Financial Review , Mr Turnbull phoned eight key representatives on Monday to invite them to a two-hour closed session.\nLate last week, ACTU Secretary Dave Oliver, Business Council of Australia chief executive officer Jennifer Westacott, and Australian Council for Social Services chief executive Cassandra Goldie sent Mr Turnbull a co-signed letter seeking a get-together and urging the new prime minister to be bold while promising him third-party backing.\n\"We believe an election fought on a narrow and divisive set of assertions about the things we are not going to do is a disastrous direction for our country,\" the letter says.\nOn Monday, Treasurer Scott Morrison confirmed super taxes were on the table as he strove to design a tax system that drove growth and productivity as the ultimate goal. Joe Armao \"Leadership is a collective dynamic. We accept our leadership responsibilities and we stand ready to work alongside governments of all persuasions for the benefit of our country.\nAll reforms on table In their letter, they urge Mr Turnbull to put all reform options on the table. While there is no specific mention of an increased GST, which is opposed by the ACTU and ACOSS, it keeps open the prospect of compensation for any such increase by urging that any \"reform should be designed to ensure that the majority of households, particularly low-income households, are no worse off\".\nThe trio supports lower company tax, replacing inefficient state taxes like stamp duties with a land tax, and calls for superannuation taxes to be put back into the mix when looking at the retirement income system.\nOn Monday night, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann used a speech to the Sydney Institute to keep the pressure on Labor over budget repair. Alex Ellinghausen Former prime minister Tony Abbott ruled out looking at super this term and beyond, despite concerns the concessions were being used for wealth creation rather than just saving for an adequate retirement.\n\"The retirement incomes system should be more clearly focused on the goal of ensuring adequate and secure incomes for people throughout retirement,\" the letter says.\n\"A holistic approach to reform is needed, rather than the piecemeal changes that have marked the retirement incomes debate to date. Reform should ensure pensions and tax concessions are adequate, fair and sustainable.\"\nSelect group to meet Mr Oliver, Ms Westacott and Dr Goldie will be at Thursday's meeting. They will be joined by Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell, BCA chairman Catherine Livingstone, Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates, and Australian Youth Affairs Coalition national director, Leo Fieldgrass.\nMr Turnbull said change was needed if Australia wanted to continue enjoying \"high wages, a very high standard of living and generous social welfare safety net\".\n\"To secure our future prosperity we must embrace the future and be prepared to undertake social and economic reform,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Treasurer Scott Morrison confirmed super taxes were on the table as he strove to design a tax system that drove growth and productivity as the ultimate goal.\n\"I think it is important to keep stability and certainty in that area but there have been many issues raised in the area of retirement incomes,\" he said.\n\"I dealt with them quite extensively in my former portfolio in the area of pensions which you and I discussed and there is an interface between these two. You have got to get all of the systems lining up. Your welfare system, tax system, your industrial relations – workplace relations system – they have all got to be lining up to achieve growth.\"\nIn April, Labor announced a policy to trim excessive superannuation tax breaks. Once retirees had earned over $75,000 from their super, each dollar over $75,000 would be taxed at 15 per cent. This would mean someone who earned $100,000 from their super in a year would pay $3750 in tax.\nLabor has also promised to increase from 15 per cent to 30 per cent to superannuation contributions tax rate for people earning over $250,000.\nOnce Labor announced its policy, the government ceased all work on its on proposals and announced it would never touch super taxes, this term or the next.\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen welcomed Mr Morrison's concession.\n\"The Government under previous management had refused to deal with high-income superannuation, the fastest-growing tax concession in the federal budget, unfair and unsustainable. We'll see whether Mr Morrison is just all words or whether he is actually prepared to accept good policy,\" he said.\nPressure on On Monday night, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann used a speech to the Sydney Institute to keep the pressure on Labor over budget repair.\n\"All up, including the 2013-14 and the 2014-15 (mid-year budget updates) and our two Budgets, there are 56 measures to reduce spending, and 14 measures to increase revenue, which remain to be implemented,\" he said.\n\"Implementing these measures would yield an additional $24 billion improvement to the budget bottom line, with about 80 per cent of that gain coming from efficiencies on the spending side.\"\nHe concurred with Mr Morrison's claim that Australia had a spending problem, not a revenue problem, and that tax reforms should be about stimulating growth which would generate revenue, rather than just increasing the net tax take.\n\"When it comes to tax, the conversation should be about how we can raise the necessary revenue for government in a better way, indeed in the best possible, least distorting way in the economy, not about how much more we can raise and spend with a plethora of new taxes, increasing the overall tax burden in the economy by ever more,\" he said..", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:04:57.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
