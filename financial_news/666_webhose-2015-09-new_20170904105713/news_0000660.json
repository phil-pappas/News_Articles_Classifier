(Submitted rendering: Arctic Cat) Arctic Cat plans to move HQ to North Loop By: Karlee Weinmann September 8, 2015 1:41 pm 0 The former Western Container building at 500 N. Third St. in the Minneapolis North Loop was once considered for a North Loop condo conversion project. (File photo: Bill Klotz) \nArctic Cat is moving its corporate headquarters from Plymouth to a six-story building once floated as a site for condominiums in downtown Minneapolis’ North Loop neighborhood. \nThe 55,000-square-foot site, in the Western Container building north of downtown at 500 N. Third St., dramatically increases the recreational vehicle maker’s footprint. Arctic Cat’s 11,000-square-foot Plymouth office is at capacity and unable to support further growth, the company said Tuesday. \n“Our headquarters relocation will enable us to bring our leadership team and critical functions together in one space, to achieve strategic growth and innovation plans,” Arctic Cat President and CEO Christopher Metz said in a statement. \nBetween 150 and 200 employees will work from the new facility, which will be fully leased by Arctic Cat, according to the company. Arctic Cat’s manufacturing facilities in St. Cloud and Thief River Falls will not be affected, except for a few workers who will move to the North Loop after the company sets up its Minneapolis office next summer. \nThe property, built in 1908, is currently owned by Minneapolis-based Bloomington Investments, which has the same address as developer Ned Abdul and Swervo Development. \nIn addition to expanding its space available for operations, a new headquarters in one of Minneapolis’ most vibrant and fast-growing neighborhoods will boost Arctic Cat’s appeal. Proximity to public transit, including the Green and Blue light rail transit lines, and other amenities will be valuable employee-recruitment tools down the line, the manufacturer said. \nA wide-reaching redevelopment push over the past decade has transformed the North Loop from a stagnant industrial zone into one of the city’s trendiest areas. Warehouses converted into office space and apartments and condos as well as an influx of new apartments boosted the residential population and the area’s cachet. \nMore than two years ago, the Downtown Resource Group, a Minneapolis-focused real estate firm, pitched a project that would have converted the Western Container building into a condo building with around 25 units. \nThe boutique concept ultimately flamed out – good news, now, for Arctic Cat as it prepares to shift its operations and spruce up its reputation in the marketplace. \n“We are excited to enter a new era for Arctic Cat,” Metz said. \nArctic Cat moved its headquarters from Thief River Falls to Plymouth’s 505 Waterford Park office building, along Highway 169, in early 2008. \nThe company is best known for its line of all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles. It also manufactures parts and accessories, plus garments and other branded accessories. \nLike this article? Gain access to all of our great content with a month-to-month subscription.
