Bloomberg Share on twitter by Patrick Commins As much as it pains me to write this, and as you assuredly already know, the US Fed failed to announce a \"lift-off\" from its zero interest rate policy that has dragged on for close to seven years. Instead, with the tune of The NeverEnding Story ringing in our ears, chair Janet Yellen now looks even less likely to lift rates at all in 2015. If you, like me, are dreading the thought of ploughing through thousands of words examining what this momentous non-event means for you and your investments, here are the three, and only, things you need to know:\n1. The sharemarket didn't like it much. Neither did the Australian dollar, for that matter. A decision to not raise rates, accompanied with a more \"dovish\" tone to the accompanying statement, should be a straightforward \"win\" for both of those assets.\nLower rates make shares look better value against alternatives such as bonds and cash, and it also reassures investors that the central bank is committed to supporting the economy through loose monetary policy and easy credit conditions.\nThat playbook failed to play out Friday morning on Wall St. After initially spiking on the 4am AEST announcement, the S&P 500 index then reversed all those gains to close the down for the day.\nThe differential between rates here and abroad is a key determinant of our currency's strength, so news that the US hadn't tightened policy, and indeed was looking less likely to do so in the short term, should have added to the allure of our dollar. And, yes, the Aussie jumped by more than 1 US cent to approach 72.8 US cents, but then it gave up all those gains in rapid order to be pretty much where it was 24 hours earlier.\nWhy, you ask? Well that brings us on to number two, which is …\nThe Fed has discovered the world. And it doesn't like what it sees. The US central bank lowered its collective inflation forecast for next year, but only by a little, and it also reduced its unemployment rate expectations. So what was more notable was the fact the central bank revealed in its statement that it was \"monitoring developments abroad\".\nAt the press conference, chair Janet Yellen referred to \"heightened concern about growth in China and other emerging market economies\" and said those have \"led to volatility in financial markets\". Just stating the obvious, you might think, but one respected economist pointed out that the last time the Fed focused so heavily on foreign developments was in September 1998. Depressingly, back then it didn't hike for another 10 months.\nSo it's likely comments in this vein are what spooked investors. Does the Fed know something about China that we don't? Not the kind of question that makes overseas types want to snap up Aussie dollars, or shares for that matter.\nThe Fed's line is that global growth concerns and emerging market volatility tend to strengthen the greenback and weaken the oil price, both of which have flowed through to lower US inflation and stayed the central bank's hand.\nThat argument starts becoming circular, however, as NAB currency strategist Emma Lawson has pointed out. It goes something like this: the Fed doesn't hike because emerging markets (EM) are under pressure. But EM is under pressure because the Fed is going to hike, so when the Fed doesn't hike, EM rallies, and the Fed turns hawkish again. But hold on, that leads EM to come off the boil again, and we're back where we started.\nTo escape this negative feedback loop we need a circuit breaker, reckons Lawson, and \"hopefully one to the upside, not the downside of the risk spectrum\". The number one contender for this, as confirmed by the Fed on Friday morning, is China and how it manages its economic transition.\nAnd that, neatly, brings us to number three, which is …\n3. It's time to forget the Fed. \"Gasp!\" That's right, I said it. The US Fed has done all it can for us. It has pumped more than $US4 trillion ($5.6 trillion) into global financial markets via its now defunct bond purchasing programs. It has sparked one of the longest bull runs in US sharemarket history and kept the world's largest economy on a reasonably steady path of recovery. That's helped us all. When it raises rates – tomorrow or in six months' time – it will be the first, small step on a long and gradual path towards more normal monetary settings. All that stimulus isn't about to be sucked back out of the market overnight.\nImagine that Yellen had called you ahead of this morning's announcement and told you whether rates would be higher or on hold. After you got over the inevitable \"How did she get my number?\" and, \"Really, at this hour?\" – ask yourself this: what would you have changed about your portfolio?\nThat's not an idle question. The local head State Street Global Advisor's investment solutions group, Mark Wills, asked himself that same question.\n\"How would that change our behaviour? We have no idea,\" he said Thursday afternoon amid the frenzied US Fed conjecture. \"We're happy with our current positioning, and we can't see anything out of a decision that would dramatically move markets either way.\"\nWell, he was right. Worry about Greece and Middle-East conflict, if you must. Read all you can about China. Try to find pockets of growth and stay defensive. But, for now, forget the Fed.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:51:48.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
