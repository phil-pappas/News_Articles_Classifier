The company could not be reached for comment.\nSierra Leone had hoped the project will help kickstart the West African country's economic recovery as it seeks to emerge from a devastating Ebola epidemic.\nGrowth is expected to contract 21.5 percent this year due to both Ebola and falling iron ore prices.
