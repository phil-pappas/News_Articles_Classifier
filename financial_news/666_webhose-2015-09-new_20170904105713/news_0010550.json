It will never inflict its past suffering on any other nation.”\nHe also announced that China’s People’s Liberation Army would be cut by 300,000 troops —the largest reduction in more than a decade of armed forces estimated to number around 2.3 million. A Defense Ministry statement later said the reductions would be done by the end of 2017 and would target units with outmoded equipment and noncombat personnel.\nStill, many Western officials and analysts said it was the display of weaponry—including aircraft-carrier-based fighter jets and missiles they believe are designed to prevent the U.S. from intervening in a conflict in Asia—that defined the event, rather than the announcement of troop cuts.\n“Displaying cutting-edge military hardware and announcing personnel cuts is not really a contradiction,” said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.\n“In fact, it’s consistent—human waves of infantry are not going to win the next war in Asia,” he said. “Thinning the ranks of low-skilled soldiers will free up resources for high-tech capabilities like cyber and hypersonic missiles, and of course naval modernization.”\nChina's leader, Xi Jinping, presided over a military parade involving 12,000 troops, 500 pieces of military hardware and 200 aircraft.

Among the high-tech armaments being displayed for the first time was the DF-21D antiship ballistic missile, which many experts call a “carrier-killer” because it is designed specifically to target approaching U.S. aircraft carriers.\nThe parade also showed for the first time the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, China’s first one capable of striking a U.S. naval base in Guam with a conventional warhead from a launcher on the mainland.\nThe U.S., which was represented at the parade by its ambassador in Beijing, had repeatedly urged China to hold a forward-looking event that promoted reconciliation. The U.S. Embassy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCongressman Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican who heads a House committee on sea power, said in a statement after the parade: “It seems significant that while the United States marked the end of the war with a solemn ceremony, China chose to showcase its growing military might and the new weapons it has built to menace its neighbors. It seems increasingly clear that China intends to undermine the post-1945 order that has brought peace and prosperity to Asia.”\nJapan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, didn’t attend. His top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said Thursday: “We have conveyed to China our position that we would like it to adopt a future-oriented stance instead of placing a spotlight on the past.”\nChina Celebrates Japan’s Defeat in World War II Military has transformed itself over the last 25 years fullscreen Soldiers prepare for commemoration activities to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in World War II in Beijing on Thursday.

Other nations contributing soldiers included Mexico, Fiji, Mongolia and Vanuatu.\nChina tried to compensate for the poor Western showing by inviting retired leaders and heads of international organizations, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Both men attended.\nThe Chinese leadership’s primary concern, however, was the domestic audience , analysts and diplomats said.\n“The parade helps bolster Xi Jinping’s prestige as the commander in chief and a global statesman, as well as boost national pride,” said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.\n“It reinforces the notion that a rising China has become a major player on the global arena.” he said. “It also serves to shore up morale and confidence in China’s armed forces.”\nMr. Xi has established his control on the military in part by targeting senior officers in an anticorruption campaign, analysts and diplomats said.\nENLARGE Former Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, from left to right, at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on Thursday.

Later, they chanted, “Follow the party’s orders! Be able to win wars! Be excellent in work style!”\nMr. Xi also sought to project an image of unity with other top party figures , including Premier Li Keqiang , who declared the opening and closing of the parade, and former President Jiang Zemin , who was among those watching.\nSome party insiders have accused Mr. Xi of taking too much decision-making power away from Mr. Li, the party No. 2. And a recent state media commentary accused unnamed retired leaders of meddling in decision-making.\nMr. Xi “needed to show that his leadership is strong and stable,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University. “But he also wanted to show that they are unified—not like people have been saying.”\nWrite to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com and Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD283_0903CP_H_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD277_0903CP_H_20150903004039.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD269_0903CP_H_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD275_0903CP_H_20150903004037.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD269_0903CP_M_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD279_0903CP_H_20150903004052.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD274_0903CP_H_20150903004036.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD272_0903CP_H_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD279_0903CP_M_20150903004052.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD276_0903CP_H_20150903004039.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD280_0903CP_H_20150903004052.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD282_0903CP_H_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD274_0903CP_M_20150903004036.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD273_0903CP_M_20150903004036.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD277_0903CP_M_20150903004039.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD268_0903CP_M_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD268_0903CP_H_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD283_0903CP_M_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD267_0903CP_M_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD281_0903CP_M_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD304_0903CT_M_20150903031644.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD271_0903CP_H_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD275_0903CP_M_20150903004037.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD304_0903CT_TOP_20150903031644.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD276_0903CP_M_20150903004039.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD281_0903CP_H_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD282_0903CP_M_20150903004053.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD272_0903CP_M_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD271_0903CP_M_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD273_0903CP_H_20150903004036.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD267_0903CP_H_20150903004021.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KD280_0903CP_M_20150903004052.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:28:02.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
