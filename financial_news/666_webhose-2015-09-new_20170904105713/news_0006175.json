Andrew Meares by Laura Tingle, Ben Potter and Joanna Mather The Abbott government has been accused of making a stealthy bid to replace the board of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, opening a row with Labor and disappointing disability groups.\nAn advertisement in Friday's The Australian Financial Review called for non-executive directors with experience on big corporate or business boards.\nBut it did not mention anything about needing personal experience with disability, a criterion that most of the eight current directors meet. AFR Weekend understands that they only learned of the ad by happenstance on Thursday evening.\nLabor said the disruption associated with replacing the entire board was a \"direct threat to the future\" of the NDIS â€“ a claim Disabilities Minister Mitch Fifield rejected.\n\"Let's be clear, the board is not being spilled,\" he told reporters in Melbourne on Friday. Mr Fifield said the terms of current directors expired next August and it was appropriate that a process of renewal begin.\n\"What we're seeking to do is to have a board that is a mix of current members and also new members,\" he said.\nThe advertisement said candidates would be expected to have \"substantial board experience either in a large listed company or a significant government business enterprise\".\nThere are concerns that the existing directors, including the chair Bruce Bonyhady, might not be eligible for reappointment.\n Mr Bonyhady is considered by many as the father of the NDIS scheme, having pushed for it with government since 2008, as well as for the Productivity Commission inquiry which endorsed its economic and budgetary efficacy.\nHe is a former senior executive in the funds management industry and a former Treasury official, but would not meet the criteria in the ad.\nThe Australian Federation of Disability Organisations said the requirement that directors have personal experience with disability should be maintained. Two members of the current board are disabled and a further four members have family members who have a disability.\n\"If the government is now seeking to make substantial changes to the board by primarily seeking non-executive directors with big company experience, there is a significant risk to the future success of the NDIS,\" the federation's chief executive, Matthew Wright, said.\nThe government has been trying for some time to persuade some NDIS board members to leave early , arguing that this will allow a gradual transition of board members, rather than a complete changeover.\nOpposition disability spokeswoman Jenny Macklin said the current board had been responsible for the successful launch of the NDIS, which in full flight is expected to cost $22 billion a year.\n\"The latest quarterly report showed how successful the trials have been, and this just shows the Abbott government has zero commitment to people with disabilities,\" she said.\nMr Fifield accused Labor of spreading \"baseless lies\" by suggesting there was something odd or untoward occurring in relation to the board while questioning the government's commitment to the full rollout of the NDIS. He also praised existing directors and invited them to reapply.\n\"The chairman has done a sensational job,\" he said.\n\"It would be fair to say that the NDIS probably would not have come to fruition if not for the work of Bruce Bonyhady as chair and also John Walsh, who was a board member who's been one of the intellectual drivers behind the initial concept of the NDIS.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:50:52.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
