Earlier this month, investors believed they could rise as soon as June. \nHowever, Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, said in a speech last week that events in China were \"unlikely to change the process of rate increases\" and that the decision to raise interest rates would come into \"sharper relief\" around \"the turn of this year\". \nMichael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citi, said even a sharp slowdown in China would only exert a \"modest\" drag on UK growth and inflation, while stronger pay growth meant increases in real income were on course to reach 3.5pc this year, a level that has not been seen over the past decade. \nAnalysis by Citi using a range of economic models showed the UK's relatively low exposure to CHina meant a negative growth shock in China would push UK growth down by less than 0.2 percentage points per year over the next two years compared with its baseline forecast. \n\"The UK suffered several mini-slowdowns during the long pre-crisis expansion from 1993-2007. But, when one looks back at the period as a whole, what stands out is the economy's resilience and the expansion's ability to shrug off minor setbacks. Unless global conditions or UK credit availability worsen markedly, we suspect the same will apply in coming years,\" he said. \nIan McCafferty, an external policymaker, is expected to continue to vote for a 0.25 percentage point rate rise. \nGertjan Vlieghe, a former economist at hedge fund Brevan Howard who joined the Bank this month, is likely to vote to keep rates on hold along with the rest of the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) . \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) expect inflation to remain below the Bank's 2pc target well into 2017. \n\"We see inflation as a tug of war between externally generated disinflation, and reflation driven by a tightening labour market feeding through to higher pay and domestically generated inflation. This roughly translates into a tug-of-war between goods and services inflation,\" they said in a note. \n\"We expect the timing of the first hike to be driven by the evolution of pay and inflation data, and the resulting balance of MPC opinion. \n\"In short, it will be a ‘data-dependent’ debate, between those who are more concerned about the upside risks from the tightening labour market, and those more worried about the downside risks from external disinflation, and the risk that a protracted undershoot may infect inflation expectations.\" \nWhile underlying domestic inflation, which has been a key gauge of price pressures for the Bank of England, remains weak, Morgan Stanley expects this measure to rise in the coming months as the labour market continues to tighten. \nRecent employment data have suggested the labour market is tightening . Analysis published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) this week suggested UK businesses were finding it increasingly difficult to hire staff with the right skills . \nThe ONS said evidence suggested businesses were starting to headhunt staff from other companies in order to fill vacancies, which it said could put upward pressure on pay. \n\"The trends evident in the data point to a substantial degree of normalisation and tightening in the labour market in recent periods,\" it said. \"Should this trend be sustained there are potential implications for wage pressures, as firms increasingly seek new employees from the stock of those already in employment.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T01:15:35.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
