While we understand the situation and solutions are complex, we want to do our part and plan, where we can, to recruit qualified candidates from the refugee populations in Europe into Oliver Wyman,” said Oliver Wyman Group President and CEO Scott McDonald. \nOliver Wyman also plans to tap into its network of non-profit partners in the education, micro-finance, youth- and adult-literacy, and job-readiness spheres to explore solutions for enhancing entrepreneurial activities and instilling job-related skills in the refugee populations. \n“We are only at the early stages of what will require long-term solutions and interventions to address the core issues, but as we wait for these solutions, we and our colleagues around the world want to act now,” McDonald added. “We have offices in many of the European countries most affected by the arrivals of refugees. We also plan to raise the issue of providing employment with our clients in Europe as well as those outside who have operations in Europe.” \nOliver Wyman has identified a few organizations to which any employer can reach out in case they have an interest in investigating employment of or providing jobs skills to the refugees. These organizations help steer refugees who have necessary clearances towards companies interested in hiring them. In addition, they work with those refugees waiting for permissions on enhancing their job readiness through providing training, coaching, and other employment-related services like resume writing and interview skills. These organizations focus on explicitly helping refugee populations. \nThe list of these organizations, which will be updated with new information as it becomes available, is available via the below link. Oliver Wyman is not associated with nor does it endorse any of these organizations. \nwww.oliverwyman.com/refugee-response.html \nAbout Oliver Wyman \nOliver Wyman is a global leader in management consulting.
