A similar trend is visible among other producers.\n\"There are two reasons why companies have hedging programmes: one is to cover major capital projects that they have committed to and the second thing is to act as a buffer to allow them to reset the business in case of a change in oil prices,\" Aidan Heavey, chief executive of Tullow Oil, Africa's largest independent producer, told Reuters.\nTullow, Ithaca and Premier Oil have so far this year reaped the benefits of forward sales, with the latter selling some of its production in the first half at a hedged price of $106 a barrel, compared with an average Brent market price of around $59.\nHowever, the recent accelerated slump in crude prices has meant companies are a little more reluctant to top up their hedging positions in fear of locking in production at the bottom of the market.\n\"We're not actively selling any more at this point but I would still expect us to move that (hedging) percentage up over the course of the year,\" Premier Oil Chief Executive Tony Durrant told Reuters.\nAs at June 30, Premier Oil had hedged 25 percent of its 2016 production at $69 a barrel. He said the percentage could rise to as high as 60 percent.\nMany small and medium-sized oil producers sign reserves-based lending deals with banks, meaning the institution lends money to finance a specific project which is then repaid using proceeds from production.\nIthaca, which renegotiated its debt financing with lenders including Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale earlier this year, has hedged its production out to June 2017 at $69 a barrel.\nMajor Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, facilitate oil producers' hedging positions, giving an idea about the banks' outlook for the oil market.\nTullow Oil has hedged some of its 2016 production at an average floor price of $79.29 a barrel, falling to $76.68 in 2017 and $68.04 in 2018. EnQuest has hedged at $68 a barrel for 2016.\nWINNING STRATEGIES?\nIf prices remain low for the next two years, those hedges would go down in history as some of the biggest winning strategies.\nHowever, if non-OPEC production starts falling steeply, as predicted by some executives including former BP boss Tony Hayward, and prices rise on the back of a supply shortfall, the companies are set to lose a lot of money.\nThe recent drop in Brent prices to below $50 a barrel has created concerns among lenders about loan repayments, prompting them to encourage strong hedging positions. Premier Oil's Durrant said his company's creditors had asked for a further increase in forward sales.\n\"We insisted that we weren't going to do that,\" Durrant said.\nThe oil producer agreed in August to increase the level of debt repayments covered by earnings, giving the company more headroom to deal with weak oil prices. In return, it is paying higher interest rates and an up-front fee.\nEnQuest and Ithaca said they themselves determined their hedging strategies, not the banks.\n\"The banks have been very appreciative of the way we've run the hedging programme,\" said EnQuest Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Swinney.\nIn July, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's lowered its rating for Ithaca to negative but said the company's hedging strategy was one of the positive elements for liquidity.
