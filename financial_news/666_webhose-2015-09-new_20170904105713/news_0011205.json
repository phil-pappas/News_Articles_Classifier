A reading below the 50-point mark indicates contraction. \nThe data sent Wall Street sharply lower in mid-day trade with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index down nearly two percent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq giving up 1.46 percent. \nChristine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, also added to the gloom Tuesday when she warned that global growth this year would be \"likely weaker\" than previously anticipated, less than two months after the IMF cut its global forecast for 2015 to 3.3 percent. \n- Starting September in red - \n\"Equity markets (are) starting the new month in the red after yet more disappointing China manufacturing data increases concerns about (the) slowing of the world's number two economy,\" said analyst Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets. \nFrankfurt, London and Paris were also pulled downward by declining domestic manufacturing figures. \n\"Another set of disappointing Chinese manufacturing data has prompted (losses) for UK and European stocks on Tuesday with a slowdown in Europe?s own manufacturing sector exacerbating the declines,\" added CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. \nGlobal equities -- hammered last week on worries that the flagging Chinese economy would spark a new global recession -- also fell on Monday over the uncertain outlook for US interest rates before a closely watched jobs report due on Friday. \nA US Federal Reserve rate hike could further jolt global confidence, which has already been buffeted by China's slowdown. \n\"Investors are concerned about the strength of the global economy, which is why you're seeing a sell-off in various stock markets,\" said strategist Ayako Sera at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. \nThe Shanghai stock market ended down 1.23 percent on Tuesday, having tumbled by more than four percent at one point. \nTokyo slumped 3.84 percent, with a stronger yen hitting exporters, while Sydney fell 2.12 percent and Hong Kong finished 2.24 percent lower. \nLondon's benchmark FTSE 100 index plunged 3.03 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 2.40 percent and Frankfurt's DAX 30 fell 2.38 percent. \n\"The (Chinese) manufacturing index still shows that the economy is in the process of seeking a bottom,\" said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at JK Life Insurance. \nSome analysts were not so pessimistic. \n- No cause for alarm - \n\"We don?t think the readings are cause for alarm. For a start, China?s economy is increasingly driven by service sector activity, which still appears healthy. As such, signs of weakness in manufacturing are less of a concern than they used to be,\" said Chang Liu at research firm Capital Economics. \nMeanwhile volatility in China and other emerging markets has pushed up the price of investments considered safe, including the yen and gold bullion. \nOn Tuesday the dollar fell to 120 yen from 121.24 yen in New York trade late on Monday. \nThe European single currency advanced to $1.1256, up from $1.1213. \nOil prices meanwhile fell after recording gains of more than 25 percent over the previous three sessions. \nThe commodity had surged Monday after the US Department of Energy said domestic output in June was much lower than first stated, while monthly estimates for January-May were revised lower. \nAlso, a statement from OPEC -- to the effect that the continuing downward pressure on prices \"remains a cause for concern\" -- fanned hopes that the oil cartel could cut output levels (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:54:37.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
