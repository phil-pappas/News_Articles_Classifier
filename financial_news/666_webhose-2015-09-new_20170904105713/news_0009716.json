Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket began September on a sour note, recording its worst week in three months after disappointing data from at home and abroad sparked fresh concerns over China's effect on the domestic economy.\nAn early rally on Friday led by resources stocks on the back of stronger commodity prices and a weaker Australian dollar was quickly quashed by renewed selling in the banks as investors mulled whether Australia was headed towards a recession.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index eventually closed slightly higher for the day , up 0.25 per cent or 12.8 points to 5040.6, but finished 4.2 per cent lower for the week. The All Ordinaries closed 4 per cent lower for the week to 5060.8.\nThe ASX briefly slipped below the 5000 level again on Friday, touching as low as 4995.6 before returning above what has emerged as a key support level.\n\"One of the fascinating features of trading this week has been the reversal of overnight leads each day,\" CMC chief markets strategist Michael McCarthy said.\nOn Friday the bourse took its lead from a strong night in Europe after the European Central Bank meeting left the door open for further monetary easing , while an early rally from Wall Street faded into a flat finish.\n\"Without any leads from China and benign positive leads from the US, Australian shares were smashed again; part of that component is an Australian issue,\" he said.\nIn the absence of China, which closed its markets for two days to mark end of World War II commemorations, Australia has turned its focus on to the state of its own economy.\n Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the nation's GDP had slowed to 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, down from 0.9 per cent in the previous quarter. On Thursday retail sales figures came in much worse than expected, showing a contraction of 0.1 per cent.\nIt also sparked talk that the Reserve Bank of Australia may be forced to cut interest rates again, quite possibly as early as November.\n\"It is important to remember a downturn in one sector sows the seeds of an upturn in another,\" Suncorp senior economist Darryl Conroy said.\n\"We are witnessing exactly this for our local manufacturing sector with increasing import costs leading many to assess the opportunities to produce or manufacture at home.\"\nThe local data while backwards looking, added to the mix of concerns about global economic growth. Those fears were stoked by China early in the week with official factory output data indicating a contraction, and investors reacted by wiping $32 billion off the ASX on Tuesday.\n\"What we saw this week was an interplay of a lot of disagreeing themes on the market,\" Mr McCarthy said.\nThe grapple between the bulls and the bears around the 5000 level on the ASX 200 sparked intraday movements of up to 4 per cent during the week, and inspired calls from some fund managers that the ASX was headed towards a bear market, or a 20 per cent fall from its most recent high.\nThe financials finished the week down 5 per cent, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares down 5.5 per cent to $72.15, Westpac Banking Corporation down 5.2 per cent to $29.94, National Australia Bank down 5.6 per cent to $29.80 and ANZ Banking Group down 5.8 per cent to $26.86.\nThe hardest hit sector was the energy index, down 7.3 per cent for the week despite US oil prices rallying as much as 27 per cent in three days. Santos shares fell to their lowest point in 15 years, down 17 per cent for the week to $4.38.\nConsumer discretionary and consumer staples also fell heavily, helped down by the retail sales data, falling 5.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively.\nWoolworths shares fell almost 7 per cent to $25.94, while Wesfarmers shed 4.9 per cent to $39.43.\nTelstra continued its disappointing trajectory, down 3.6 per cent for the week, despite rising 0.9 per cent to $5.61 on Friday.\nAll the sectors closed in the red for the week, but materials fared better than most, BHP Billiton lost 3.1 per cent to $24.69 overall, while Rio Tinto fell 2.6 per cent to $49.76.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-ecb-to-the-rescue-20150903-gjevbt.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/will-banks-cut-dividends-as-economy-weakens-20150904-gjf496.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-04T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:03:08.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
