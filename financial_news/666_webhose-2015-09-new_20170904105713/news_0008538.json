On net interest margins, Lloyds does not do too badly, but OneSavings Bank is still more profitable on this metric. With one of the largest branch networks and the most retail customers, Lloyds has been able to reduce the interest it offers to depositors and offer loans on attractive terms. Conclusion \nIt's interesting to see that Virgin Money, a mid-sized challenger bank, is not doing as well as Lloyds Banking Group. Unlike the other 'big four' banks, Lloyds has refrained from international expansion and this has enabled it to gain more of the cost savings from local economies of scale. So, although it is not nearly as profitable as the smaller challenger banks, it is probably the most profitable of the larger banks. \nOneSavings Bank comes out top with all three financial metrics, and it also seems to offer the strongest growth prospects. As OneSavings Bank grows, its cost efficiency could benefit further from economies of scale and its return on equity would likely improve with increasing leverage. \nThere are near-term headwinds affecting OneSavings though. The proposed introduction of an 8% Bank Corporation Tax Surcharge would eat into the earnings of smaller banks, reducing the amount of capital available to support further growth. Furthermore, competition has been intensifying in the mortgage lending sector, particularly in the SME and buy-to-let mortgage market that OneSavings Bank focuses on. \nMore than just picking winners? \nBuilding a successful investment portfolio does not only involve picking winners .
