Photo: Reiters\nHaving pushed the Australian dollar beyond parity during the heady peaks of the resources boom, mining and energy companies will receive much-needed help from the currency's return to historically lower levels.\nAlumina Limited is often named as one of the local companies that benefits most from a sliding Australian dollar, because of a business model that sees it receive dividends from Alcoa in US dollars while paying salaries and other costs in Australian dollars.\nThe same principal exists across most of the Australian resources sector, and is also making winners of yield-focused shareholders in BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, who receive dividends twice a year in US currency.\nThe full-year dividend BHP paid out in the 2015 financial year was only 2 per cent higher than the previous year, but for Australian shareholders it was 28 per cent higher once currency gyrations were taken into account.\nAdvertisement Despite all that, few mining companies would be more excited about the prospect of the Australian dollar falling below $70¢ than Fortescue Metals Group.\nThe pure-play iron ore miner has $US7.2 billion ($10.2 billion) of net debt to pay down over the next seven years, and with iron ore prices collapsing over the past 18 months, FMG has a nervous few years to see if it can meet its obligations.\nMany investors now expect Fortescue to sell assets for cash to lighten the debt load.\nAlthough that may occur, based on current iron ore prices and foreign exchange levels, Fortescue can meet its debt hurdles without selling any assets.\nThe miner had about $US1.7 billion of spare cashflow at the end of the 2015 financial year after paying interest and capital spending.\nIf it were to generate that much cashflow in each of the four years between now and 2019 when its $US5.8 billion debt hurdle matures, Fortescue would be able to meet its obligations.\nThe catch is that iron ore prices are expected to fall over the next couple of years as Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill, Rio Tinto, BHP and Brazilian miner Vale bring more iron ore into an already well-supplied market.\nBut with the Australian dollar also expected to fall, the impact of lower iron ore prices could be offset, and may save Fortescue's bacon.\nFortescue recently told investors that it has a notional \"break-even\" price of $US39 per tonne, well above the $US56.50 per tonne that iron ore was fetching on Friday.\nBut that break-even estimate was calculated with an Australian dollar assumption at US77¢.\nWith the Australian dollar already well below US77¢​, and tipped to continue falling, Fortescue's break even price continues to slide, giving it more headroom below its debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:56:38.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
