And it is likely to be defeated because MPs will predictably argue that their salaries are committed to mortgages, loans and other expenses. \nNevertheless, MPs should not be quick to reject Ababu's proposal, and should at least debate it soberly. \nParliament, the judiciary, some offices in the executive and the many constitutional commissions gobble up a huge chunk of salaries paid by the state. \nAny group of public servants agitating for a pay rise finds it difficult to accept the oft-used excuse that there is no money, when they know how much these top public servants earn. \nThe many commissions that handle issues of citizens' rights should be merged to save money, including the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, the Gender Commission and the Commission on the Administration of Justice. \nOthers like the Transition Authority, whose usefulness has passed with the implementation of the constitution, should be dissolved. \nThe public wage bill, taking up 52 per cent of all money collected by Kenya Revenue Authority, is indeed unsustainable and initiatives like voluntary early retirement for public servants should also be explored. \nQuote of the day: \"Why, sir, there is every possibility that you will soon be able to tax it!\" - English scientist Michael Faraday explaining the usefulness of electricity to PM William Gladstone.
