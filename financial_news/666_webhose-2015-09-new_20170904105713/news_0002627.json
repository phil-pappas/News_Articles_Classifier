(Map: goo.gl/xNrqbl )\nIt was not immediately clear whether the road names on Google Maps had been changed recently.\nNeither Google nor Venezuelan authorities immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe Essequibo region has long been denoted on Venezuelan maps as a \"reclamation zone.\"\nThe dispute was revived in May after an offshore oil discovery by Exxon Mobil Corp in a potential boon for poor Guyana, whose economy relies heavily on rice, gold, diamonds and bauxite.\nMaduro has described newly elected Guyanese President David Granger as a \"hostage of Exxon Mobil.\"\nThe Venezuelan leader's critics counter he is using the border dispute - as well as a more recent one with Colombia - to distract voters from high inflation, a severe recession and rampant crime.\nMany in Guyana, a tiny nation of 800,000 people sandwiched between Venezuela, Brazil and Suriname on the shoulder of South America, feel their larger neighbor is seeking to lay hands on its newfound oil wealth.\n\"I can't say whether Columbus or some Spanish sailor stopped over for a peep, but that road was certainly not made and named by the Spanish,\" Alfred Bhulai, a Guyanese man who lives in the nearby region of Demerara, wrote in a letter to Guyanese newspaper Stabroek News.
