So it should not even be a thought in your mind and the five reasons are simple: 1. Your perceived notion that you will avoid problems you are facing now if you do this, is a fallacy because it doesn’t matter where you go, nothing will change as you are the problem. You have not come to terms with the significance and importance of taking responsibility and ownership for your actions. 2. When you don’t reciprocate as you are expected to and as you are not committed with integrity, life dictates you pay your dues, not in your time but in its own time. Historically the time this happens is when you least expect, when you can ill-afford to lose what you have rebuilt, as it is the way life works. 3. The perceived greener grass on the other side is not a true reflection of your next life’s phase, because you cannot start on a clean slate if you have not done the right thing, i.e. paid your dues. 4. When you are offered an opportunity of credit, it is your moral duty and responsibility to repay it no matter how much you suffer, or whatever losses you incur because you should return what does not belong to you, with respect. 5. It’s better to take ownership and responsibility to repay your debt right now, lift the burdens off your shoulder and learn how to repay and rebuild, so the next time you are well prepared and experienced and you don’t have to run away from anything or anyone. I can only imagine the elation debtors must feel once they’ve succeeded in absconding or skipping. However, they fail to realise that they have lost invaluable time in their lives that can never be recouped and the stories I hear is they live in fear for the rest of their lives. Sincerely who would like to live in mental and emotional torture? I know there are people without a conscience who can justify their actions at every turn of the corner, but I am not interested with them right now. I am speaking to those who know and understand what is expected of them and that they sincerely do not have any options but to repay their debt. Is facing another human being and presenting your problems and trying to reach an amicable agreement to repay your debt so difficult? Is gathering your family, short-circuiting your children’s schooling and education, locking your doors, abandoning your car you’ve enjoyed and taking the next plane out, justifiable? Logic tells me that there is no justification. It is a clear indication of a lack of principle, integrity and respect for your creditor who afforded you the credit facilities you so enjoyed. In life, you don’t take money from anyone if you are not committed to repaying it. \nNothing can replace this form of action no matter how much debtors habitually point fingers at the creditors once they find themselves facing a debt crisis. My articles are based on first-hand experience where I also have borrowed money, took ages to repay it but I did the right thing and where I could not repay it I kept in contact with my creditors or friends, however, bad it made me feel. You don’t run away when someone has been good and generous to you, it’s just not right. If you have genuine complaints about incorrect penalties levied to your account then go and meet with your creditor, present your complaint and resolve the problem. Just stop pointing fingers because it suits you or makes you look and feel good! This is not a justifiable ego trip! Don’t do what many do and simply blame creditors for incurring unnecessary charges when you are a debtor who regularly does not meet payments on time, overspends and lives beyond their means. This is my justification for your reasoning. When you were afforded the facility you should have taken the time to study the charges levied and not just be a ‘happy chappy’ and go on a spending spree with money you never worked for. In life it’s really simple to always resort to the easy way out, not take responsibility and ownership for situations you create in your life. \nYou must learn to be disciplined and act with respect and also have self-respect because if you don’t have this, you have nothing. It will take a very long time to feel good about yourself again, unless you can overcome this the moment the plane takes off and if that is the case, then for sure it will come back to you. One very important factor is the world is huge but also small and you don’t know when you will come face to face with the problem you left behind because you can run, but you can never hide no matter where you go. You certainly do not wish to rebuild your life in the next 10 years only to have someone knock on your door to ‘pay up’. \nBy this time you may have only five years left to work, so how would you afford giving it all up at this stage? Let me share with you that these come-backs only return at this time, when you can least afford it. Nothing we do in life comes without a ‘price-tag’ and I could have shot myself in the foot here with many debtors, however it doesn’t matter as honour is a big word in my life and I try to transpose that principle to others. When you live your life the right way, the right things flow into your life. So in the future when things don’t go right or the way you expected, never ask ‘why me?’, instead think about the wrongs that were not rectified in your life in the past and you will discover the answer.
