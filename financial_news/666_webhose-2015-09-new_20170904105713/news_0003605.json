But the best lesson we can teach our kids is to avoid the problems from happening in the first place. Knowledge is power, so here is some important insight to share with your college age kids.\nStopping the scholarship search Each year, college students graduate with an increasing amount of student-loan debt. The class of 2015 will reach around $35,000 in average student debt, according to Edvisors.com. With numbers like that, college students shouldn’t stop the scholarship search just because they graduated high school.\nWhile many scholarships are limited to incoming freshman, there are still plenty of others that current students can go for. Visit the college’s financial aid office and ask about available scholarship opportunities. Check out a scholarship search engine like College Board or Fastweb.\nCheck with professional organizations in your desired field to see if they offer scholarships. Many do to nurture growth in their industry. For example the Public Relations Student Society of America has several scholarships available to juniors and seniors.\nChoose your schedule wisely Even first semester college freshman should already have a roadmap to graduation plotted out. A dropped class, a light class load, missing your registration window could all be costly mistakes in the long run. Know the fine print and deadlines for dropping classes and getting a refund. Be sure you can get into another class that will help you reach your degree.\nAs students progress in their major, make sure they will be able to get into all the required classes. For example, some may only be offered during fall. Miss the chance to register for it and you could be stuck with another semester to go. Use priority registration opportunities wisely. You may want to save one for the last semester to ensure you get the classes needed to graduate.\nNot taking advantage of the free Most colleges offer some great perks that students aren’t taking advantage of. Maximize the college experience (and the money spent on it) by attending free lectures, workshops and events in the student union. Utilize the library resources like free printing or tech support. Skip the gym membership and attend free classes at the college athletic center or sign up for an intramural team. Get advice from academic advisors and career services. Know the resources at the on campus health center including mental health.\nGiving in to the overdraft Since 2009 when credit card regulations changed for college students, more kids are relying on their debit cards to pay for things. But when all the money in that checking account dries up, it means an overdraft. And having overdraft protection is not always a smart option. It can lead to hefty fees. Opt out of overdraft protection. Yes, it’s embarrassing when a card gets declined but it’s a good lesson to stick to a budget and monitor your account.\nOverdrafts aren’t the only fees. While many banks waive fees when you keep a minimum in your account, not many college students can meet those minimums. Look for a fee-free checking account with easy to access ATMs near the college. Don’t let ATM fees negate your fee-free checking. Though some college checking accounts have perks that appeal to college students like waived non-bank ATM fees.\nOver-sharing financial information College kids love to share the details of their personal life but financial information should never be part of that. Don’t leave credit cards lying around, hand out pin numbers or leave bank statements lying around in plain sight. It can be easy to trust all the new, friendly faces on your dorm floor but it’s better to err on the side of caution and do everything you can to reasonably guard your financial information.\nStudents should also get in the habit of checking their credit report annually. Even if they don’t think they have a credit history, checking it increases their chances of catching identity theft early and correcting any errors or fraud. That way when the time comes that they need to rely on that credit like when they go to apply for a credit card or a car loan. You can get three free credit reports a year from www.annualcreditreport.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:16:22.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
