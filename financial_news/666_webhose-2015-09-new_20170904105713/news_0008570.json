It has lost around 15 percent in the past year, with devaluations in November and February before Nigeria pegged the national currency.\nCompanies across the board have started feeling the dollar shortage due to restrictions imposed by the central bank to halt the naira's fall and preserve its foreign currency reserves.\nThe foreign currency rationing is hurting. \"This is an enormous problem for the organizations ... which have issued Eurobonds but also some of the more local corporates who are in the manufacturing business, trying to access dollars to get the interest payments made on time,\" said Angus Downie, head of economic research at regional lender Ecobank.\n\"If the oil price does not rise soon for some companies that have borrowed in dollars, they will struggle to make payments and the end result would be that they would have to default.\"\nWhen the U.S. Federal Reserve finally raises its Fed funds rate - effectively the base rate underpinning borrowing costs around the world - the burden will increase yet further for Nigerian borrowers.\nThe Fed may start ending the era of ultra low interest rates as soon as Thursday, hurting all the emerging market companies that loaded up with cheap debt during the past seven years.\nBUHARI'S VACUUM\nForeign bond and equity investors are also fretting over a policy vacuum as President Muhammadu Buhari has yet to appoint a cabinet or economic team more than three months after he took office. They are ever more reluctant to put money into Nigeria.\nIn another sign of investor frustration, JP Morgan said last week it would remove Nigeria from its influential Emerging Markets Bond Index (GBI-EM) due to a lack of liquidity and the currency restrictions - a move that might prompt more capital outflows and increase costs to borrow abroad.\nYet Aliko Dangote, Nigeria's most prominent businessman and Africa's richest man, who produces anything from spaghetti to cement, disagrees. He told Reuters that those \"looking for dollars to pay interest will get it from the central bank\".\n\"I have not seen anybody who has defaulted on the paying of interest. It won't happen,\" said Dangote, giving his backing to central bank restrictions that have been unpopular with those who have struggled to secure dollars needed to import goods.\nRISING YIELDS\nYields for corporate dollar-denominated issues reflect the rising premium investors demand to hold Nigerian debt.\nAccess Bank's 7-year Eurobond issued in June 2014 yielded 14.8 percent on Wednesday, hovering just below a 5-month-spike hit earlier in September. Fidelity's 4-year Eurobond changed hands with a yield of 14.879, just off a record high hit on Tuesday.\nThe only international debt issue this year was made in April by Lagos-based development financier Africa Finance Corp.\nThe squeeze on the financial sector is also worrying policymakers. Minutes from the last meeting of the central bank's monetary policy committee shows that one member, Adedoyin Salami, voiced concerns about a \"disconcerting rise\" in the number of non-performing loans in the banking sector.\n\"So far the central bank has in principle enough ammunition to deal with this risk,\" said Samir Gadio, Standard Chartered's Head of Africa Strategy, adding that the difficulties were probably more with loans and dividend payments abroad than with Eurobonds.\nReserves have fallen by 9 percent since the start of the year: link.reuters.com/huf76v\nThe latest data on Wednesday showed they have dropped almost three percent in the past month, leaving them down more than 22 percent in the past 12 months.\nMost investors are expecting the naira to be devalued another 10-15 percent. However, Buhari spoke out against this on Wednesday.\nBuhari aims to appoint his cabinet this month and has promised to diversify the economy from oil, but has not announced any firm plans or commented publicly on the dollar shortages.\nThe policy vacuum was felt in the interbank market this week. Traders said banks refused to make bids until authorities clarified how a new system would work under which all government revenues should go into a single central bank account, part of Buhari's drive to fight corruption.\nBismarck Rewane, chief executive of Lagos-based consultancy Financial Derivatives, said Nigerian banks and firms were still able to keep up with interest payments and he expected the central bank would probably relax the rules at some point.\nBut the dollar shortage will hit businesses as they need to take on more loans at local banks in order to spend more on imports.\n\"Some companies are going to die,\" Rewane said. \"Typically, there will be around five or 10 percent of companies that will be in jeopardy.\" (Additional reporting by Julia Payne ; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Ulf Laessing and David Stamp )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:48:36.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
