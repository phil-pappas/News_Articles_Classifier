Kirk Gilmour Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Millionaire realtor and TV personality, John McGrath has anointed the following suburbs as \"must-have addresses\" in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane.\nSYDNEY\nThe Rocks\nThe massive sale by NSW Property of property stocks in the historic city suburb has inspired some private owners to move to the area dominated by hotels, pubs and water views.\n\"As a shift in the housing stock moves from Government owned to private dwelling there is bound to be a massive upgrade to these beautiful harbourside Georgian and Victorian homes. Plus a significant change in local amenity that usually follows such upgrades. With the recently opened Barangaroo Point park, a 5 minute walk to the CBD & Barangaroo commercial precinct, this is fast becoming one of the most fashionable addresses in Sydney,\" McGrath says.\nKensington\nOnce the less attractive sister of beachside Coogee, popular Randwick and student-swarmed Kingsford, Kensington is in the shadows no more.\n\"The upcoming light rail, which will whisk residents in and out of the City and to the mighty sporting facilities of Moore Park and Royal Randwick, [means] your investment is looking safe in this university suburb.\"\n Curl Curl\nCurl Curl is known more as the home of surfers and wild coastlines and has emerged as an affordable alternative to neighbour Manly.\n\"Not only will you live longer with a Curl Curl address but you'll outperform the Sydney market by many percentage points in the next decade.\"\nParramatta\nWith Parramatta City Council pouring in money for infrastructure and property development, including its flagship central thoroughfare, 1 Parramatta Square, and the NSW government's support in transport including the WestConnex and the Parramatta Light rail, Sydney's second CBD is ready for a makeover.\n\"There are two key reasons Parramatta is a must-have in this year's report. First, the commercial and infrastructure activities in and around Parramatta are leaving much of Sydney in their wake with many smart companies choosing to re-locate closer to their employees in what is now the heart of Sydney. The second reason is the activation of the river which has for many years been a forgotten waterway.\"\nEngadine\nLike the space and can't pay central Sydney prices? Engadine in Sydney's southwest rates on John McGrath's list to build a home.\n\"As the surf-side suburbs shoot north in price and young homeowners look to secure a piece of God's country, areas like Engadine offer great land size at an affordable entry point. So if a 600 square metre block is still on your 'must have' list and your budget is under $750,000, pop Engadine into your search engine and find sensible value you couldn't spot elsewhere.\"\nBRISBANE\nMurarrie\nIndustrial to residential is the new cool thing. Murarrie in Brisbane is coming of age as \"as young singles, couples and families priced out of nearby Bulimba, Morningside and Cannon Hill venture in looking to renovate\".\nEverton Park\nLike Murarrie, Everton Park, is value for money - one of the best places with \"plenty of value\", McGrath reckons.\nPaddington\nOf the blue chip suburbs, Paddington, is the one to watch. But unlike the Sydney suburb with the same name, Brisbane's Paddington is \"good value\".\n\"Over the past two years, Paddington buyers have been venturing into Bulimba, Ascot, New Farm and Hawthorne looking for better value. Now they are returning following a rejuvenation of Paddington's caf√© scene.\"\nParadise Point\nA piece of Gold Coast between Hope Island and \"Clive Palmer country\", Broadwater, there is a piece of affordable lifestyle where four bedroom houses 200 metres from the water are still priced around $700,000.\nBirtinya, Sunshine Coast\nIs Sunshine Coast making a comeback? It appears to be, with McGrath saying Birtinya has \"room for growth\" as the suburb continues to benefit from the ongoing development of the Kawana health precinct.\nACT\nCrace\nNew ACT suburb Crace has suddenly become the place to be due to its modern housing, parks and sporting facilities.\nLyons\nAnother newcomer for great living is Lyons, the \"gentrifying sleeper suburb\" next to Curtin.\n\"Lyons used to have a poor reputation but this has changed and we are now seeing Curtin buyers expanding their search into Lyons.\"\nDowner\nLying just north of Dickson, which is undergoing masterplan development, is a suburb with value, Downer.\nForde\nCan't afford Crace? Go to Forde.\n\"The more affordable alternative to Crace, with similar facilities but a $50,000 discount on homes.\"\nMELBOURNE\nMurrumbeena/Hughesdale/McKinnon\nClose to Chadstone shopping centre, you cannot go wrong with these three suburbs. Schools and public transport convenience are the drawcard.\nBalwyn\nLong-time popular suburb, Balwyn, coveted for its proximity to Melbourne's best schools, continues to rate highly on McGrath's list.\nGlen Waverley\nIf it is not schools you are after but universities, Glen Waverley is where to look for a home.\n\"Million dollar homes are in high demand from a burgeoning Chinese community.\"\nBrunswick\nIf there was ever trendy in suburbia, then Brunswick is it.\nThe multi-cultural suburb with a rich history and a strong rental market is rich with new townhouses and apartments for young professionals, McGrath says.\nWilliamstown\nThe bayside lifestyle over the West Gate Bridge is best in Williamstown.\n\"With its historical architecture, beaches and parklands, Williamstown has the charm of a maritime village. It's accessible by train and ferry, and has experienced widespread gentrification in recent years through increased interest from younger buyers.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-09-28T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:07:28.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
