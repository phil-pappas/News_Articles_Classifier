All times local:\n___\n3:10 p.m.\nDutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders says the only way to halt the flow of migrants pouring into Europe is to end the war in Syria.\nKoenders, who visited a refugee camp in Lebanon, said \"It is not only a question of border controls and quotas. If the war in Syria does not end, people will keep coming.\"\nKoenders says the European Union, whose leaders are meeting Wednesday in Brussels to try to hammer out a united front in tackling the migrant crisis, should talk to the Lebanese authorities, \"because that country knows not only the problems but also the region.\"\nHe says the EU should discuss possible solutions to the Syrian conflict with Lebanon and other countries from the Middle East.\nThe Dutch government has pledged 25 million euros ($28 million) to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon.\n___\n3 p.m.\nThe chairman of the European Union's emergency migration talks is optimistic that a deal will be sealed later in the day to share 120,000 refugees in Greece, Italy and perhaps Hungary among other EU countries.\nLuxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told reporters that a compromise drawn up by his team \"should get a consensus. I think it's very balanced.\"\nThe Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary oppose the plan outright while Poland and Latvia are also skeptical. They refuse to have migrant quotas dictated to them from EU headquarters in Brussels.\nThe EU's top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, appealed for unity, saying that now \"is the moment for everybody to show that we really mean it when we talk about responsibility and solidarity.\"\n___\n2:45 p.m.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe can only get a long-term grip on the refugee crisis by tackling what is causing people to flee other nations - not by building fences.\nMerkel said the European Union needs to send \"signals of order\" in the crisis, for example by working with Turkey to secure its external border, but it's also necessary to address broader issues such as the aid shortfall that is prompting Syrians to leave surrounding countries.\nMerkel said after meeting her Finnish counterpart: \"We are learning in this refugee situation that we are all connected to each other and our lives are affected if terrible things happen elsewhere.\"\nShe added: \"We will not be able to change that by building fences ... only by fighting the causes.\"\n___\n2:40 p.m.\nGreek authorities say two people are missing after a boat carrying people fleeing their homelands sank in the eastern Aegean Sea.\nThe coast guard says eight survivors were picked up by a patrol boat off the island of Lesbos on Tuesday. Their nationalities were not immediately known.\nIn another 13 operations, it says over 300 people were rescued in the eastern Aegean in the last 24 hours.\nMore than 260,000 asylum-seekers have arrived in Greece so far this year, most reaching the country's eastern islands on flimsy rafts or boats from the nearby Turkish coast. After being screened, they take ferries to the mainland and then travel north overland to the more prosperous European Union countries.\n___\n2:30 p.m.\nCroatia's prime minister has urged Serbia to \"send refugees in other directions too,\" as police reported that 34,900 migrants have entered the country in less than a week.\nPrime Minister Zoran Milanovic said Tuesday that Belgrade should send some of the refugees to Hungary or Romania. He also says the refugee problem should be solved \"at its source,\" in Greece or Turkey, which most Syrian or Iraqi refugees pass through to get to Europe.\nOverwhelmed by the influx, Croatia has been transporting migrants to its borders with Slovenia or Hungary - more than 6,000 migrants left that way Monday and Tuesday.\nThe crisis has strained diplomatic relations in the region, which has become a transit route for migrants bound for Western Europe.\n___\n2:20 p.m.\nThe sudden onset of fall weather in Greece, with thunderstorms and torrential rain over the past two days, has sent hundreds of migrants who had been camping out in a downtown Athens square scrambling for shelter.\nAbout 100 men, women and children found dry spaces in the Victoria Square metro station Tuesday, while another roughly 400 people, mostly Afghans, remained in the square, huddling in tents or using rubbish bin liners and plastic bags to keep off the worst of the rain. Others took shelter in public telephone booths and under building awnings.\nAuthorities had bussed many of those sleeping in the square to a sports stadium in a southern Athens suburb during a severe thunderstorm Monday evening, where they can stay for a few days while the bad weather lasts. But many are returning to the square during the day.\n___\n2:05 p.m.\nHungary's foreign minister says political relations with fellow European Union neighbor Croatia are at a \"freezing point\" and may improve only after parliamentary elections there expected by the end of the year.\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto says Tuesday it was easier for Croatia to quickly transport migrants to the border with Hungary instead of caring for them themselves. He said bilateral affairs could improve \"if there are elections in Croatia and the new government thinks it wants to improve this relationship.\"\nSzijjarto says while Hungary had done everything possible to register 230,000 migrants this year, it had failed in some cases because of the aggressive behavior of some migrants and EU rules making it hard to enforce registration.\n___\n1:45 p.m.\nNorway's Justice Minister has asked the country's police to \"intensify\" border controls to \"prevent illegal immigration and combat organized crime.\"\nAnders Anundsen says such controls give \"a better overview and control of who is in the country.\" Anundsen said the move was \"not about reintroducing systematic\" border controls nor \"to cut the right to seek asylum in Norway for displaced people.\"\nHe added it was up to the national police to find out how to increase surveillance.\nIn recent weeks, some 2,000 people have sought asylum in Norway which is not an European Union member, but is part of the Schengen agreement allowing travel without internal border checks in Europe.\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nDenmark's intelligence agency doesn't believe Islamic radicals are trying to use the migration flow and Europe's passport-free Schengen travel zone to smuggle \"terrorists\" into the West.\nFinn Borch Andersen, acting head of Denmark's Security and Intelligence Service, says \"it is associated with high risks\" for individuals to be spotted during a journey across the European continent.\nBut Borch Andersen acknowledged that there could be \"people who sympathize with militant Islamism\" among the refugees.\nDanish Justice Minister Soeren Pind said that at least 12,400 people had crossed into Denmark via Germany in the past few weeks, adding that about 1,500 people had sought asylum in Denmark. Andersen and Pind were speaking during a joint news conference.\n___\n12:45 p.m.\nSerbia's prime minister has given the European Union a deadline to persuade Croatia to resume all cargo traffic that was halted after a surge of migrants over their mutual border or he says that Belgrade will respond with unspecified retaliatory measures.\nAleksandar Vucic said Tuesday that Croatia's closure of the main border crossing for cargo trucks early Monday is \"a scandal of international proportions.\" Vucic gave the European Commission a 2 p.m. (1300 GMT, 9 a.m. EDT) deadline to reopen the traffic, before an emergency government session he is to chair.\nLandlocked Serbia says it is losing millions of dollars a day because of the blockade. Croatia has hinted it may close the last remaining border crossing with Serbia for all traffic, including people, if Serbia retaliates.\nCroatia, which has last week closed all but one border crossing with Serbia, wants to pressure Serbia to stop sending the migrants toward Croatian borders and rather channel them further north to Hungary.\nMore than 30,000 migrants have crossed from Serbia to Croatia since Hungary closed its borders a week ago.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nCzech leaders say they are determined to reject the European Union's plan for compulsory quotas to distribute refugees.\nInterior ministers from the 28-member EU will try to resolve the dispute on the emergency relocation of 120,000 asylum-seekers at a meeting Tuesday in Brussels. On Wednesday, EU leaders will meet again on the migrant crisis that is overwhelming the continent.\nCzech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec, who has disputed the legality of the quota system, said at a Prague airport before leaving for Brussels that \"it's an empty political gesture.\"\nStanding by his side, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka echoed that: \"We're certain that the system won't be working.\"\nSobotka previously said the country is ready to take in thousands but on a voluntary basis.\n___\n12:10 p.m.\nHungarian lawmakers say the European Union's \"irresponsible policies\" have led to the deaths of migrants whose \"unbearable flow\" is a burden on the country's economic development.\nA resolution approved by legislators from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party and its Christian Democrat allies, says Hungary \"cannot allow illegal migrants to endanger the workplaces and social security of the Hungarian people.\"\nThe lawmakers said it was irresponsible for European politicians to encourage migrants to risk death for a better life in Europe and called on EU leaders to \"return to the road of common sense\" and protect Europe and it citizens.\nHungary is building fences on border sections with Serbia, Croatia and Romania to stop the free flow of migrants mostly headed to Germany and other richer EU countries.\n___\n11:35 a.m.\nNorway's foreign minister warns that the refugee crisis will continue and could get worse if no political solution is found to end Syria's civil war.\nBorge Brende told reporters after meeting his Lebanese counterpart Gibran Bassil in Beirut that Norway has an agreement with the U.N. refugee agency to receive \"a substantial amount of refugees in the three coming years - in fact 7 percent of all the refugees that the UNHCR has asked for.\"\nEurope is struggling to deal with the tens of thousands of refugees making the perilous trek to the continent to seek sanctuary there.\nBorge warned that the situation will continue as long as there is war in Syria \"so the only real solution to this is to find a political solution for Syria.\"\n___\n11:20 a.m.\nA leading economic agency is urging rich countries to invest in integrating and training immigrants to ensure that they contribute to economies instead of draining them.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in a report that record numbers of migrant arrivals in Europe are an \"emergency situation\" and there is \"little hope\" that it will ease soon.\nThe OECD called on its 34 member countries, which include the U.S. and most of Europe, to \"constantly\" adjust immigration policies to take into account shifts such as war in Syria and political collapse in Libya, which have driven many people to seek refuge in Europe.\nThe group recommends language and other training, and access to health care for migrants to improve their economic contribution.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is calling on the European Union to agree this week to take in another 120,000 migrants \"for any relocation program to be credible.\"\nThe UNHCR says in a statement that 477,906 people have arrived in Europe by sea this year. As EU officials meet in Brussels to discuss the crisis, the agency said a relocation program alone for now \"will not be enough to stabilize the situation.\"\nIt urged the EU to quickly set up facilities in Greece, which has taken in tens of thousands of people - mainly refugees from Syria arriving through Turkey.\nUNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said this may be \"the last opportunity for a coherent European response.\"\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nSeveral hundred asylum-seekers are camping out at the Turkish border with Greece, hoping that a meeting in Brussels will produce an agreement to let them into the European Union.\nIn the Turkish border city of Edirne, migrants remain at a wrestling arena about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the Greek border.\nHundreds of migrants have made the trek to Edirne in the hope of being allowed to cross into neighboring Greece or Bulgaria and avoid the often-risky journey across the Aegean Sea. Many arrived last week but have been blocked from approaching the border by law enforcement. Hundreds more were stranded in Istanbul after bus companies refused to issue them tickets.\nAlthough many have pledged to remain until the borders are opened, many have given up on a crossing and have been bused back to other cities in Turkey.\n___\nBy Mehmet Guzel\n___\n9:35 a.m.\nScuffles have broken out between Croatian police and asylum-seekers after they were barred from entering a newly opened reception center meant to register those seeking sanctuary in Europe.\nTroubles started at the camp, when more migrants came to the gates than authorities could handle. Police in the Croatian village of Opatovac pushed people back from the front gate, asked them to sit down and to wait their turn.\nCroatia set up a migrant reception operation to try to bring order to the unrelenting chaos that has gripped the country since Sept. 15, when Hungary closed its border with Serbia. That decision diverted waves of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia to Croatia.\n___\n9:20 a.m.\nAustrian police say about 1,000 new arrivals are expected soon at the main border crossing point with Hungary, after nearly 10,000 migrants trekked into the country.\nPolice spokesman Helmut Marban said Tuesday that most of Monday's arrivals at the Nickelsdorf crossing east of Vienna had already been brought to emergency shelters elsewhere in the country.\nHe said Hungary is bringing the 1,000 people expected Tuesday to its side of the border by train.\nFrom there, the migrants usually walk into Austria.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
