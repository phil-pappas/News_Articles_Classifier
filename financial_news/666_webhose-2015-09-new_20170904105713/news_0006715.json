I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,\" Winterkorn said. \n\"We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused. This matter has first priority for me, personally, and for our entire board of management,\" Winterkorn said. \nA non-governmental group, the International Council on Clean Transportation, said it uncovered the deception through \"dogged\" perseverance and then alerted researchers at the University of West Virginia. \nAfter independent tests, the researchers uncovered anomalies between real-life emissions and those reported during formal testing. \n- Image damaged - \nThe EPA ordered VW to recall the vehicles concerned -- four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars built since 2008 -- and fix the cars' emission systems. \nUnder the US Clean Air Act, fines of up to $37,500 may be imposed on each car, meaning VW could be fined more than $18 billion. \nStefan Bratzel, director at the Center for Automotive Management, a research group, said the damage to VW's image would be as great as the financial fines. \nAnother leading German auto expert, Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, agreed. \n\"It will be tough for VW to regain its credibility in the United States after this incident,\" he said. \nGerman Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that VW would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly. \nAnd he insisted the reputation of cars and productions \"'Made in Germany' would not be tarnished\". \nAnalysts said the affair could cost Winterkorn his job. \nWinterkorn, 68, has been chief executive since 2007, but was earlier this year involved in an ugly leadership battle with then supervisory board chief and VW patriarch Ferdinand Piech. \nChristian Stadler of Warwick Business School said there was \"no question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to CEO Winterkorn losing his job after all\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:07:33.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
