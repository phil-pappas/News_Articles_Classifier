Mr Hunt said they both supported the renewables sector. Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Environment Minister Greg Hunt says the renewables industry should feel \"very supported\" under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, after they complained of investment instability fuelled by Tony Abbott's hostility towards the sector.\nMr Hunt has also said he would seek ways for Australia to \"do more\" on climate change with Mr Turnbull after the United Nations conference in Paris, and said the appointment of five new members of the Climate Change Authority board was delayed by the leadership spill.\nThe former prime minister was frequently scathing of wind turbines and the renewable energy target, saying they were \"ugly\", \"noisy\", \"visually awful\" and encouraged unproven concerns they had health impacts.\nIn a change of tack, Mr Hunt told The Australian Financial Review, \"I think [the renewables industry] should feel that with myself, Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, they will be in a very, very supportive environment.\"\nThis follows Mr Frydenberg's comments on Monday when he said the Turnbull government was committed to boosting renewable energy .\nIn retaining control of the portfolio under Mr Turnbull, Mr Hunt confirmed he had taken control of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which funded renewables, a sign they may not be axed.\nLobby encouraged The move cheered the renewables lobby.\n \"The decision â€¦ has helped to provide a sense of optimism across the renewable energy sector,\" Clean Energy Council chief executive, Kane Thornton, said.\nHe said dropping the government's policy to abolish ARENA and the CEFC would be \"a return to common sense\" and would \"help to defuse much of the political risk that has continued to cloud investment under the former prime minister\".\nAfter the dramatic resignation of its chairman, Bernie Fraser, in early September , Mr Hunt also revealed he was about to appoint five new members to the Climate Change Authority board before last week's leadership change delayed the decision.\n\"We were almost in the position to appoint five new members to the board that I suspect will be all high quality in any event. We were very close then there were some changes,\" he said.\nHe said after a portfolio direction meeting expected in the next week or so, he was likely to move ahead with the appointments.\nMr Turnbull has said he would stick with the Coalition's direct action policy, part of a deal to win the leadership ballot, and told the Nationals he would avoid a price on carbon .\nBut Mr Hunt said the government was considering further action on climate change, saying while they would take the target of 26 per cent to 28 per cent to Paris, \"from there, we'll see how Paris evolves\".\n\"Malcolm is passionate about the global climate challenge, and I am passionate about it.\" He said they were two people who had overall responsibility and who passionately believed the targets were ambitious. But they were always looking for how Australia could do more.\nMr Hunt said \"the door was open\" for international permits to be considered as part of a 2017-18 review of the emissions reduction fund and safeguards.\nOf all climate policies, polling has shown that incentives to the renewable sector are popular .\nIn terms of the Climate Change Authority board Mr Hunt said, \"I haven't run the names past Malcolm. I suspect I will be able to make high-quality appointments in short order\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.essentialvision.com.au/action-on-climate-change-4"], "published": "2015-09-22T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:58:12.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
