Alex is a fluent Mandarin speaker and has given his father plenty of insights into Chinese government and business. supplied They also indicate he will steer Australia's most independent foreign policy arguably since Paul Keating was in power.\nAbbott shared a close rapport with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, declaring soon after he came to power that Japan was Australia's best friend in Asia. But he attracted criticism for praising the skill of Japanese soldiers in an ill-thought-out speech to parliament last July.\nLess than three months later, Turnbull opted to single out China's role in the war during comments he made at an Australia-China Business Week function in Sydney.\n\"We should never forget that China's war against Japan was not just their war, but our war too and without China we may not have won it at all,\" he said.\n Alex Turnbull (left) and his partner Yvonne Wang on the right. Alex is a fluent Mandarin speaker and has given his father plenty of insights into Chinese government and business. supplied These comments were widely circulated among Beijing academics and government officials at the time and have been remembered. Asked how Turnbull's appointment would affect the bilateral relationship, an official from a leading foreign ministry think tank said on Tuesday his comments about the war last year were a positive sign there would be an improvement.\nEven as shadow communications minister, Turnbull had a strong view on China. In a 2011 speech to the London School of Economics, he argued that it made \"no sense for America, or its allies, to base long-term strategic policy on the contentious proposition that we are on an inevitable collision course with a militarily aggressive China.\"\n\"Our strategic response should be to hedge against adverse and unlikely future contingencies as opposed to seeking to contain (futilely in all likelihood) a rising power.\"\n\"China has more to lose than most from any conflict that disrupts global economic flows,\" he said.\nState Environmental Minister Zhou Shengxian of the State Council Peoples Republic of China with then Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull signing a bilateral environmental partnership in 2007. Andrew Sheargold Turnbull is not expected to be an apologist for China. He has called on Beijing to be more transparent about its aims in the region and he is unlikely to roll over on human rights issues and the rule of law, both important small 'l' liberal values.\nHowever, he does bring a contemporary understanding of China to the top levels of Australian government. He has pointed out many times the services sector in China now makes up more than half the economy and he understands that it has produced dynamic companies like Alibaba and Tencent, which are changing the way the world operates online.\nHe has also experienced first-hand the difficulties and complexities of doing business in China.\nHe's not frightened by those challenges. In his own words, he finds them \"exhilarating\".\nTurnbull's view contrasts with the wariness that has been expressed by a handful of senior government officials in recent months including Michael Thawley, secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who said China was \"not willing or able to play a serious global leadership role\". Peter Varghese, head of the department of foreign affairs and trade, warned last month that Australia should not underestimate the challenges posed by China's economic transition and that \"abrupt shifts\" in Beijing's strategic policies would be \"highly destabilising\".\nTurnbull's first test will be getting the China-Australia free trade agreement over the line by the end of the year. It was the one policy issue he addressed specifically on announcing his leadership challenge on Monday, which suggests it will be high on his agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:10:23.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
