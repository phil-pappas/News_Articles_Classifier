It said he is accused of embezzlement, adultery and taking bribes. \nChina Resources has 450,000 employees and owns China's biggest beer brewer and supermarket operator as well as businesses in electric power, finance and real estate. The company reported profit of $6.7 billion last year and $145 billion in assets. \nSong was fired last year in the midst of an anti-corruption campaign that has snared a former member of the ruling party's inner circle, Zhou Yongkang, and executives at oil and other state-owned companies. \nThe crackdown was launched by President Xi Jinping after he came to power in mid-2013. He has promised to pursue senior officials as well as lower-level violators. \nAn aide to former President Jiang Zemin, former generals and the head of the national volleyball program also have been detained. \nInvestigators believe Song took bribes in exchange for promotions and business decisions, spent company money on playing golf and committed other \"serious violations of political discipline,\" the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said. It said the proceeds of illegal acts would be seized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:34:33.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
