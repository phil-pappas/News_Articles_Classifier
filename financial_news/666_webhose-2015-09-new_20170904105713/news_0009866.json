Stefan Posties Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Prime Minister Tony Abbott has appeared to shut the door on small business hopes for an effects test to curb the misuse of market power by big business, telling his party room the proposed change would not cure all small businesses' problems.\nCoalition backbenchers attempted to put pressure on Mr Abbott to adopt Small Business Minister Bruce Billson's effects test to give more protection to small business against the misuse of market power by big businesses.\nNine MPs and senators, including Bert Van Manen, Matt Canavan, Matt Williams, Andrew Southcott, and Ian Macdonald argued for the Cabinet to approve the proposed change to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act, while Liberal MP Craig Kelly argued the Harper review of competition laws had \"got it wrong\".\nCabinet last week deferred a decision on the matter indefinitely , with some senior ministers including Treasurer Joe Hockey and Attorney General George Brandis, arguing the Harper recommendations would create a lawyers' picnic.\nMr Abbott told the joint party room the government was taking the Harper review recommendations very seriously but the debate had become too \"theological\" with one group of lawyers arguing against another, a partyroom spokesman said.\nMany Liberals and most Nationals want an effects test to ameliorate the perceived aggressive behaviour by supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths.\nMr Billson said on Tuesday his proposal had not been \"rolled\" in Cabinet but rather it was \"part heard\" and he was intent on still making the case to change section 46 of the competition law because it did not work.\n\"Frankly, it is a dud. It does not work,\" he told Radio 2GB.\nRelated \"It is like a hunting dog that won't leave the porch.\"\nHe said Cabinet was still making its way through all 56 of the recommendations that Professor Harper and his panel put to government.\nMr Billson said Australia's competition laws on misuse of market power was \"possibly the weakest of its kind anywhere in the developed world\".\n\"No other economy in the world has such a weak provision dealing with dominant businesses able to use their economic muscle – not to win the contest to delight customers, not to support economic growth, competitiveness in the economy and outcomes for consumers – but to take out businesses or to fortify their positions so that new entrants don't get a chance to take on established players.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-09-08T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:28:34.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
