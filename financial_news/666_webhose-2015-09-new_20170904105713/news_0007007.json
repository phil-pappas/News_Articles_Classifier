Photo: Arsineh Houspian\nSuperannuation funds are pressuring fund managers to halve their fees over the next five years as they try to preserve members' returns in the face of a weakening investment outlook.\nIn recent months, prominent retirement industry executives such as AustralianSuper chief Ian Silk and David Atkin, chief executive of Cbus, have complained that fund managers have benefited from the enormous growth in the size of the super industry, at the expense of members.\nAt the same time, leading institutions, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, have argued that super fund fees are too high. The financial system inquiry led by former Commonwealth Bank of Australia boss David Murray found that fees charged by fund managers were too high.\n\"The funds management industry operates on margins of around 40 to 60 per cent and it should watch out, because its super fund customers want more of that to go back to members. Those fees probably need to halve over the next five years,\" said Ken Marshman, who chairs $30 billion retail industry fund REST Industry Super.\nAdvertisement Not-for-profit super funds are under pressure to lower the fees they charge members in the face of increased scrutiny from regulators and more competition from bank-owned super funds. In turn, they are asking their external investment managers for discounts or bringing more of the work in-house.\nBigger funds such as REST have the scale and clout to do this and have been making steady progress over the past seven years. But for the roughly 80 industry funds with less than $5 billion in assets, the task is confronting.\n\"Not-for-profit funds have been put on notice that we need to further justify our privileged position in default super. We need to ensure that increased competition doesn't come at the cost of lower returns, or less of the returns pie going to members,\" said Angela Emslie, who chairs the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and $32 billion health industry fund HESTA.\nLower fees a high priority The problem arises because fund managers charge percentage-based fees, so as markets rise or more money flows in through member contributions, their fees automatically increase. At the same time, fund managers have high fixed costs, so their expenses are little changed.\nA poll of attendees at the AIST annual investment conference on the Gold Coast on Thursday showed that lowering fees was already a high priority for funds.\nSome 67 per cent of respondents said their fund had a formal target to reduce fees, 66 per cent said they had dumped an investment manager on the grounds their fees were too high, and 74 per cent said they were changing their investment strategy in response to fee pressure.\nFees charged by fund managers vary greatly depending on their level of expertise. Australian share managers can charge super funds as little as 0.3 per cent for a passive strategy, while 0.65 per cent is more typical for an active manager. Private equity commands some of the highest fees, with a 2 per cent flat fee plus a 20 per cent bonus for performance above an agreed level fairly standard.\nThe challenge for super funds in bringing down fees is made more difficult as tough market conditions are pushing super funds to allocate more of their capital to pricier \"alternative\" asset classes such as infrastructure, private equity and hedge funds . Sluggish global growth, ultra-low interest rates and inflated asset prices mean the investment outlook for the next decade is subdued.\nInvestment fees are the biggest component of the running costs that super funds pass on to their members. The average investment fees charged by MySuper funds, the no-frills default super products for people who don't exercise choice, is 0.75 per cent.\nFrontier Advisors director of consulting, Fiona Trafford-Walker, said this should come down to between 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent.\nFees are an important component of net returns that super trustees have more control over than what happens in financial markets, she said.\n\"Funds need to start actively showing they have a plan to capture benefits of scale to get fees down before change is forced upon them by the regulator, which is a real risk.\"\nPush for consolidation Australian Prudential Regulation Authority member Helen Rowell said in April that super funds were under increased pressure to merge or show another strategy to meet the \"scale test\" .\nActuaries have argued that APRA should act more aggressively to exercise its power to force small funds to merge into a bigger fund that could deliver better value to their members.\n\"Consolidation of sub-scale funds could probably cut fees in the industry by 15 per cent,\" Rice Warner chief executive Michael Rice said.\nResearch house Chant West argues APRA should move to shut down up to 80 smaller super funds, with less than $5 billion in assets, that charge unjustifiably high fees .\nThe risk is that the pressure to reduce fees will harm returns.\n\"There is an increasing number of products in the market that describe themselves as 'low-fee' options, but if that means holding 50 per cent of assets in cash, then it is not in the best interests of their members to be scrimping on investment fees,\" Mr Rice said.\nIn the coming weeks, the government is expected to formally respond to last year's wide-ranging financial system inquiry, which highlighted the failure of the industry to reduce fees despite a sharp rise in assets.\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has flagged that he sees increasing competition in the default super market as the best way to bring down fees.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/fair-work-commission-set-to-lose-control-of-default-super-20150807-gitsen", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/low-growth-pushing-super-funds-into-more-opaque-alternative-assets-20150902-gjdi03"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:14:24.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
