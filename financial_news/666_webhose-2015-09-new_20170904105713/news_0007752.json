CEO Martin Winterkorn apologized for the deception under his leadership and pledged a fast and thorough investigation, but gave no indication that he might resign.\n“Millions of people across the world trust our brands, our cars and our technologies,” Winterkorn said Tuesday in a video message. “I am endlessly sorry that we have disappointed this trust. I apologize in every way to our customers, to authorities and the whole public for the wrongdoing.” “We are asking, I am asking for your trust on our way forward,” he said.\n“We will clear this up.” VW has yet to explain who installed the software, under what direction, and why.\n“I do not have the answers to all the questions at this point myself, but we are in the process of clearing up the background relentlessly,” Winterkorn said.\n 23, 2015 8:47 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:17:33.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
