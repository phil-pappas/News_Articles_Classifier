Sharon was complaining that Lee had been throwing cash away playing fantasy sports and was worried that his bad spending habit would get worse with the start of football season.\n“She called it gambling,” Lee said, and he was hoping I’d make it clear that the daily fantasy sports leagues are skill games — no different than playing video games, in his mind — and not some form of wagering, which is why they have taken off to where leading players like DraftKings and FanDuel are now businesses with billion-dollar valuations.\nRead: Let’s just call fantasy football ‘gambling’\nLegally, Lee is right, but he misses a key point when it comes to his home life, specifically that it’s gambling “if she says it is.”\nThat’s not to be flip about who wears the pants in the relationship; it’s that she’s calling it as she sees it, and she’s not going to be shaken off that position just because laws say it’s a skill contest. Moreover, plenty of people have found themselves facing addiction problems and ruined finances over day-trading of options and commodities, penny stocks and other perfectly legal investments, all of which share several common traits with the fantasy leagues, most notably that they fill a need for “action” and that they work well for a select few but fleece the masses.\nIt’s hard to avoid the tidal wave of fantasy sports advertising these days.\nThe concept itself is not new. I was part of a football league in high school, more than 30 years ago, but it typically involved sports fans playing games with friends, putting some money in the kitty to be part of a season-long competition of who can have the most statistical success by drafting, trading and playing the athletes in their chosen sport.\nWebsites collecting and distributing money in fantasy leagues was allowed by a 2006 federal law that prohibited games like online poker, but allowed the sports fantasy games, which are legal now in all but five states. The action has picked up in recent years with the advent of daily and weekly games, which promise quicker payouts and more action.\nFantasy sports providers say on their websites that their services aren’t gambling, but are a game of skill, exactly as Lee pointed out.\nThat said, there’s a real question as to whether many of the people playing have any skill. Sports Business Journal — which has reported that 1.5 million Americans paid over a billion dollars in tournament entry fees in 2014 — did an analysis that showed that “daily fantasy sports pros” lay out the most money and also win the most, and that the average guy is small fry, losing about half of his money on average.\nWhereas poker is considered a game of chance — and amateurs have defeated top pros in some of the biggest events in cards — sports fantasy clearly favors the active players with the most experience.\nSerious players use analytics and services and more, akin to the way an investor might buy a newsletter or subscribe to an advisory service. Unlike the simple game my high school friends played in the days before computer analysis, the fantasy leagues have complex, difficult rules, and that level of intricacy makes it harder for the hobbyists.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:08:33.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
