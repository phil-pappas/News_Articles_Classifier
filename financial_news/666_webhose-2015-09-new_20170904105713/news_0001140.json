David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd There are traps in store for Small Business Minister Kelly O'Dwyer ​ as she moves to make a decision on crowd-sourced equity funding in Australia.\nIf she simply copies the models used in other countries such as New Zealand, Australia will end up with a sub-optimal outcome. The platform will not work for those who most need it – small companies seeking amounts of money less than $1 million.\nCrowd-sourced equity funding is meant to be an innovative form of funding for small and medium-sized businesses. Ideally it is structured in a similar way to other disruptive peer-to-peer services such as car riding service Uber and accommodation site Airbnb.\nWith these fast-growing business models, the users find their way directly to the service without having to deal with complicated and costly gatekeepers. With Uber and Airbnb there are no fees going to middlemen who have to pay for the cost of bureaucratic regulation.\nThe problem for O'Dwyer is that all the reviews and international comparison studies done over the past two years have assumed the crowd-sourced equity funding models elsewhere are best practice.\nBut just because crowd-sourced equity has been raised in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand does not mean they have landed on the best model.\nUnfortunately, all those countries have perpetuated the old world funding models which rely upon costly licensed intermediaries.\nO'Dwyer will have to be brave to carve a different policy direction on crowd-sourced equity funding to the one laid out by Treasury officials and the now defunct Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee.\n Under the CAMAC model a startup would automatically become a public company after early stage exemptions, and face a fundraising limit of no more than $2 million per year with individual investors being able to commit only $2500 to a company per year. O'Dwyer's bravery will not be in questioning the bureaucrats but in standing up to the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\nBig challenges ahead Turnbull said in May that the most pressing challenge with crowd-sourced equity funding was weighing the interests of both tech start-ups and potential retail investors .\nIt's about balancing the need for consumer protection versus the extraordinary aggregation power of the internet,\" Turnbull said. He claimed that finding the right balance was the reason legislation had not yet been finalised.\nTurnbull said he favoured the New Zealand model which requires companies to submit a business plan, but there is no requirement for ongoing financial audits.\n\"I'm very attracted to just taking the New Zealand law, deleting New Zealand and inserting Australia. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I'm happy to flatter the Kiwis as much as we can on this one,\" he said.\nBut statistics show that the New Zealanders have not set the world on fire with their approach to crowd-sourced equity funding.\nThe country, which has the gatekeeper approach, has only raised about $13.55 million as of July 1, this year.\nSnowballeffect, Equitise, PledgeMe and Crowdcube have been responsible for the money raised. About 3250 shareholders have participated in the crowd funding in New Zealand.\n'Don't copy NZ' Paul Niederer, who has helped Australians raise about $144 million through the Australian Small Scale Offerings Board (ASSOB), says that if O'Dwyer follows the advice of Turnbull and simply copies the New Zealand model the system will ultimately fail.\nNiederer, who now runs ASSOB International, says the New Zealand model for crowd-sourced equity funding is not that different to the ones used in other countries. It is well suited to investment bankers, institutions, venture capitalists, angel investors and private equity.\nHe says investor aggregation can work with those players but the costs are too high for the small businesses that need the capital more than their larger-sized peers.\nNiederer says the system for crowd-sourced equity funding will not work if it involves a regulatory regime which includes Australian Financial Services Licenses.\nThat would be grandfathering the existing regulatory system and not embracing the disruptive nature of peer-to-peer business as seen with Uber and Airbnb.\n\"Having companies with AFSLs interposed between the company and the investors would be like saying to an Uber user that they must book a ride through a third party,' he says.\nNiederer says that after working for more than a decade helping small businesses raise money through the ASSOB, he knows that the largest potential users of crowd-sourced equity funding are small businesses seeking about $600,000.\nThe ASSOB platform operates under the prescriptive requirements of ASIC Class Order 02/273 (Business Introduction or Matching Services) and section 708 of the Corporations Act.\nNiederer says this provides for an issue of securities being made to certain types of investors without a disclosure statement and regulated promotion securities offers.\nIdeally, O'Dwyer will come up with a crowd-sourced equity funding policy that is not that much different to eBay. It will allow investors to see all disclosures made by the company raising the money. A truly revolutionary crowd-sourced equity funding model would include an exchange trading platform to allow investors to achieve an exit.\nBeer wars have it all\nThe battle for domination of the global brewing industry under way in London through the hostile takeover of SABMiller is a perfect example of what can happen when central banks flood the world with easy money.\nBelgium-based beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev is capitalising on the low cost of corporate debt to do one of the deals of the decade – a $US275 billion ($382 billion) bid for its smaller rival . ABI could easily borrow about $US50 billion to pay for the cash component of the bid.\nIf it is successful ABI will control about one in three beer brands in the world. This has implications for Australia because SABMiller owns the former Foster's brewing business. That cash generating machine is one of the prime assets inside SABMiller.\nFoster's was bought by SABMiller in 2011 for $11 billion. It is obvious it did not deliver what was promised at the time. It is now valued by analysts at about the same value as it was when it was purchased. As is the custom for takeover offers launched in the City of London, the weekend papers were full of price-sensitive disclosures about the inside workings of the deal.\nEdward Mundy, beverages analyst at Nomura, told clients on Monday of the revelations contained in the Saturday Telegraph and the Sunday Times.\nThe most significant news was that SABMiller's largest shareholder Altria Group, which is a holding company for tobacco companies such as Marlboro, had apparently been approached by ABI in the week before the bid proposal was released. That implies that ABI would be willing to sell its 27 per cent stake in SABMiller to ABI. Mundy says the movement in the Altria share price implied a bid premium of about 33 per cent. The man in the centre of this mammoth takeover is Rio Tinto chairman Jan du Plessis, who took over as chairman of SABMiller this year.\nHe will be trying to maximise the price paid for SABMiller but the usual option of seeking a white knight is looking difficult to execute.\nDutch brewer Heineken, which was the subject of takeover bid rumours involving SABMiller in 2010 and 2014, has ruled itself out of the takeover play. Mundy says that the takeover of SABMiller would most likely trigger an auction of brewing assets around the world. He has suggested there could be a bidding war between Heineken and Diageo for breweries in at least nine countries valued at $US25 billion.\nSABMiller's Australian assets are valued by Nomura at $US9.9 billion but Mundy says ABI would not sell a business with such large cash generating profit pools. Other brewers that would want to pick of the SABMiller pieces would be Carlsberg and Molson Coors.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-21T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:11:01.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
