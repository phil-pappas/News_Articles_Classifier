His heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian (who writes columns for Bloomberg View), announced in January 2014 that he was stepping down. Gross started writing long, philosophical missives about life and death. He donned sunglasses at a conference presentation in June 2014, at which he said, “When you’re 70 years old, you need things. You need props. Even guys need a little makeup and stuff.”\nHis angst was mirrored in unpredictable returns. The Total Return Fund, which managed as much as $293 billion at its peak, gained 4.2 percent in 2011, even though a broader benchmark index returned almost twice as much. Gross was unable to avoid the carnage of 2013, losing almost 2 percent, which was in line with the market’s decline.\nIn May 2014, he vowed to rank on top, “not close to the middle,” after some of his funds trailed peers in the previous year. Instead, the year ended early with his abrupt departure on Sept. 26 after he lost an internal power struggle.\nHis less flashy successors have held their own, even while facing about $360 billion of investor withdrawals . For example, the flagship bond fund rebounded earlier this year as the new managers reduced the fund’s exposure to debt maturing within five years, with Gross going the other way.\nPimco’s Total Return Fund has eked out a 1.7 percent gain in the past 12 months, performing better than 57 percent of its peers during the period. That compares with outperforming only 49 percent of its rivals during the past three years, which included two years of Gross calling the shots.\nGross, meanwhile, has been overseeing the $1.4 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Fund that’s lost 2.3 percent over the past 12 months. That’s similar to the Pimco Unconstrained Fund, which is down 2.7 percent in the period, but worse than the $49.2 billion Pimco Income Fund, which has returned 1.7 percent in the past year, ahead of 67 percent of its rivals.\nWhile the unprecedented withdrawals from Pimco have slowed, Gross has been unable to regain his touch in attracting piles of cash from investors for his new fund.\nPimco avoided the palace drama of a king who was struggling to come to terms with losing his grip on his throne as it became harder and harder to replicate his earlier victories. It sidestepped sweeping fire sales and didn’t prompt a paralyzing bond-market liquidity crunch. It’s still enormous.\nMore important, it has demonstrated that the kingdom can survive -- and perhaps even thrive -- through a crisis, and without its mercurial monarch.", "external_links": ["http://www.morningstar.com/cover/videocenter.aspx?id=651696\\", "https://www.pimco.com/our-firm\\"], "published": "2015-09-26T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:17:35.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
