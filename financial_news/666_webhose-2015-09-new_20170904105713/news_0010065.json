It has just under 60 currently.\nThe airline is a unit of Dart Group PLC, and flies to 55 destinations from seven UK airports.\nThe order lifts Boeing's order backlog of current generation 737s to 1,400 planes. It has an additional 2,869 orders for the forthcoming 737 MAX aircraft, due to enter service in 2017.\nBoeing also said on Thursday it had firmed up orders for 30 of its 737 MAX jets from Ruili Airlines, a Chinese startup. The provisional order, valued at about $3.2 billion at list prices, was announced at the Paris Airshow in June.
