People who purchased cards for themselves or someone else have priority status for payment of claims, along with people who \"reloaded\" existing cards with more money. A small subset of people who hold cards that were issued between 2000 and 2004 and have since been \"deactivated\" also would be allowed priority claims. Holders of other cards, including promotional giveaways, and cards given in exchange for merchandise returns or in response to customer service complaints, are lumped in with general unsecured creditors.\nHowever, under the proposed add-on to the settlement, all gift cards also would be honoured at RadioShack stores, good for half of the purchase price of merchandise being bought. Thus, a holder of a $20 card could use it to cover $5 of a $10 purchase, but could redeem the full amount of the card for a purchase of $40 or more.\nAttorneys said that's a significant improvement for nonpriority card holders, who as general unsecured creditors would at best recover only pennies on the dollar for their gift-card balances and would be subject to a $10 minimum recovery threshold. That means they likely would receive nothing at all unless the gift-card balance was between $500 and $1,000, said Clint Krislov, an attorney representing the purported class of individual gift-card holders.\n\"There's not a large amount of merchandise returns at that number,\" the judge noted.\nWhile Krislov said the proposed change to the settlement was an improvement, he also argued that it means little if RadioShack does not take adequate steps to ensure that as many gift-card holders as possible receive proper notice of their rights.\nRadioShack attorney Greg Gordon said the company has agreed to send email notices to all gift-card holders whose addresses are on file. Card holders also will be able to go to a website to learn about their rights, with the creditors committee and attorneys general overseeing the notice process to ensure that consumers are adequately informed.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T03:50:51.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
