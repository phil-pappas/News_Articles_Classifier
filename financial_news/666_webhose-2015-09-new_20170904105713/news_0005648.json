On Tuesday, the blue chip swap rate was 13.66 pesos per dollar.\nThe CNV's ruling means those funds would have to report a steep loss in their holdings. Rather than face that, some decided on Tuesday to sell their bonds, traders said.\nThe price of Argentina's over-the-counter bonds fell an average of 0.5 percent, with the Bonar 24 leading the fall, down 2.1 percent.\nThe sell-off helped soak up pesos on the local market and dampened demand for the dollar which is trading close to the psychological barrier of 16 pesos on the black market, traders said.\n\"In order to not have to report strong losses in the future, these institutional investors are selling their positions today, which is relieving pressure on the dollar,\" a local trader said on condition of anonymity.\nThe peso was trading 0.25 percent weaker at 15.94 per dollar on Tuesday but did not breach the 16 barrier.\nRuling party candidate Daniel Scioli, who leads the presidential race, said on Monday that he would not let the market determine the exchange rate if he were elected president. Instead, he would uphold the current system whereby the central bank manages the rate.\nHis main rival, market-favorite Mauricio Macri, has said he would allow the peso to float freely.
