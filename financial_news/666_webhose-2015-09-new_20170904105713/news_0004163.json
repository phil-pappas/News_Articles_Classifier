(Submitted rendering) \nThe Minnesota Vikings said Friday they want to develop the former Northwest Airlines headquarters site in Eagan with up to 3 million square feet of new uses, ranging from new housing and commercial space to team offices and practice facilities. \nThe team unveiled the ambitious plans for the roughly 194-acre site at Dodd Road and Lone Oak Parkway in Eagan during a Friday press conference at the team’s existing headquarters in Eden Prairie. \nLast month, the Vikings announced they have a purchase agreement in place for the Eagan properties, which currently house the 570,000-square-foot former Northwest headquarters building and a flight simulator building. \nTeam officials described the plan as a “strong, bold vision” for the Eagan property, but they hastened to add that they’re still in the “due diligence” period with the city. \nOn Aug. 28, the Vikings submitted an application to the city for a comprehensive plan amendment to allow the new uses. The plans are expected to go before the city’s Planning Commission on Sept. 21, followed by City Council review on Oct. 6. \nThe concept plan calls for a new 140,000- to 160,000-square-foot team headquarters, a 200,000-square-foot conference center, outside practices facilities, a 120- to 150-room hotel, 500 to 800 housing units, and other uses, the team said. \nUnder that development scenario, the existing buildings would likely come down. But the fate of the buildings “is not a certainty at this point,” team spokesman Lester Bagley said. \nThe team said the development would be led by the Wilf family, which owns the Vikings, and would proceed in phases over the next 10 to 15 years, though ideally they would like to move on the new headquarters within the next five years. \nThe Vikings aren’t saying how much they would invest in the new development. \nThe city said in a statement that some of the team’s planned uses are consistent with the site’s current “major office designation,” and some fall outside of that designation and would require an amendment to the current land use. \n“While the city of Eagan is excited about the prospect of welcoming the Vikings organization to the community, both the city and the Vikings are in the early stages of considering the opportunities for the site on which the Vikings are completing due diligence, near I-494. Projects of this magnitude are not unusual for the city of Eagan and the City Council, Advisory Planning Commission and city staff are accustomed to processing such requests in a timely manner,” the statement continued. \nAfter City Council review, “additional steps in the process will likely include rezoning, preliminary planned development and preliminary subdivision, the city said. \nLike this article?
