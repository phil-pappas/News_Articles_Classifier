We are in contact with all political parties. And nearly all parties except Congress are in favour of this bill. In Lok Sabha, except Congress all political parties had voted in favour of the bill. Congress has walked out, they (other parties) had not walked out. If situation changes then cabinet will again reconsider the matter,” he added.\nFirst Published on September 09, 2015 3:43 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:28:09.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
