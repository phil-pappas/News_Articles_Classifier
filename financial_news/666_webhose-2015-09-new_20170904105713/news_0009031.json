U.S. economic activity is also expected to accelerate, she said.\nCote's comments were in line with the bank's most recent economic assessment released in July. The central bank has cut interest rates twice this year to try to bolster an economy that has been hit by the cheap price of oil.\nMarkets see a more than 80 percent probability the bank will hold rates at 0.50 percent when it makes its next decision in October.\nIn contrast, policymakers in the United States began a two-day meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Most experts see a slightly higher probability the Federal Reserve will stand pat for now.
