The lots, sized from 407 to 604 square metres, sold between $400,000 to $600,000.\n\"Even though it's only land for about $500,000 I'm getting a four-bedroom house with better view... it's already $800,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in Sydney ... would you rather look at a building or at a park?\" Aaron Tindall, 25, who bought a lot, said.\nMr Tindall and his girlfriend who already lived in the area were happy with their purchase saying their only concern was the lack of public transport.\nBut not everyone thought the auction was a good deal.\nLocal resident in nearby Narellan, Ian Parale , who had his three-bedroom home – similar in size to those on auction recently – valued at just over $600,000, was shocked at the prices.\n \"Paying $500,000 just for land, that's very expensive,\" he said.\nThe Hermitage is close to the \"boutique\" township of Gledswood Village and has 300 homes.\nIn one of many firsts, buyers on Sunday also signed e-contracts instead of paper documents.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:06:11.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
