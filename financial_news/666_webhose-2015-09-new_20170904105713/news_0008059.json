We look forward to exchange learnings from two of the worlds largest markets and the tremendous synergies this partnership can bring, towards our commitment of building mobility for a billions of Indians,” an Ola spokesperson said.\nIn April this year, Ola had raised USD 400 million (about Rs 2,500 crore) from a clutch of investors led by DST Global.\nEstablished in 2012, Kuaidi Group has a peak of six million daily ride requests and focuses on city-bound travel covering nearly 300 cities in China, including Hong Kong.\nCurrently, it operates two branded services — Kuaidi Taxi and Kuaidi ONE — which provide taxi and chauffeured limo services, respectively.\nDidi Kuaidi is backed by Chinese Internet giants Tencent and Alibaba Group. Earlier this year, the company had invested USD 100 million in San Francisco-based Lyft.\nInterestingly, Ola and Didi Kuaidi have common investors like SoftBank, DST Global and Tiger Global Management.\nOla has majority market share of India’s taxi business with more than 7,50,000 rides a day and and expects to hit the one million milestone soon. It offers services in over 100 cities.\nIn comparison, Uber plans to average more than 1 million rides a day in India over the next few months as it steps up investments to take on Ola.\nRich with cash, Ola has also been steadily investing across various programmes to grow the driver partner ecosystem.\nIt has also introduced services like shuttle services, expanded mobile wallet, introduced wifi enabled cars and offers a cafe service on its app.\n 28, 2015 4:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:38:59.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
