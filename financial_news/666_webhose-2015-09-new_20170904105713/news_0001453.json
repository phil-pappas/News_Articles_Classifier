They do it because they have no other argument\". \nSpain's conservative central government, which fiercely opposes Catalonia's moves to break away to form its own country, denied accusations that the central bank was trying to scare voters with its warning. \n\"If my friends are going to jump off a bridge I will ask them not to jump. And if they jump it is no use to be waiting below to help them,\" Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters. \n\"Warning what might happen does not seem to me to be trying to frighten people, it is simply telling them to measure the consequences before they vote,\" he added. \nThe latest opinion polls show separatist parties could win a majority in the Catalan regional parliament on September 27. \nThe independence drive has intensified over the recent years of economic crisis. Catalans complain about how much of their tax money is redistributed to the rest of Spain. \nTheir vows to secede have posed a tough political challenge to the conservative central Spanish government. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is looking to strengthen Spain's economic recovery and preparing to fight a general election in December. \nCatalonia, a region of 7.5 million people which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economic output, has its own language which was suppressed during General Francisco Franco 1939-75 dictatorship. \nWith an economy about the size of Portugal's, Catalonia houses global firms including toll road, telecoms and airport operator Abertis (Amsterdam: IF6.AS - news ) and healthcare group Grifols.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:02:47.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
