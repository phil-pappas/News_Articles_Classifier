At the start of 2015 new rules came in which limit interest charges to 0.8pc per day, and cap late repayment fees at £15. \nAs a result, customers should never end up paying more than twice their original debt. However, this has also pushed payday lenders to re-evaluate their risk models, only lending to the customers most able to repay the debt. \nThe FCA and the firms involved declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:38:54.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
