The billionaire businessman has unleashed a flurry of personal attacks against Bush.\nBush is proposing individual tax rates of 10 percent, 15 percent and 28 percent. Currently, there are seven tax brackets, ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent. Bush said 15 million people would not pay any tax under his plan.\nHe proposes doubling the standard deduction, eliminating the marriage penalty, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and ending the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax.\nHe would end the employee's share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers 67 and older.\nBush wants to reduce the corporate income tax from 35 percent - among the highest in the world - to 20 percent and give businesses the chance to deduct new capital investments immediately. He also wants to eliminate the deduction for interest on business loans.\nDemocrats called the plan \"more trickle-down Bush economics.\"\n\"Bush is embracing a disastrous economic agenda that benefits himself, and those like himself, while leaving the middle class out to dry,\" said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.\nBush planned to offer more details during a visit Wednesday to North Carolina manufacturer.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that the top tax rate Bush is proposing for individuals is 28 percent, not 25 percent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:52:25.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
