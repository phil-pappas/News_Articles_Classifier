Nifty closed 47.60 points up at 7,843.\nS&P BSE Sensex\nSource: BSE\n3.00 pm: Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) cuts benchmark lending rate by 0.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent. The share price of SBI was up 1.50 per cent at Rs 243.15. The BSE Bankex was up 1.06 per cent at 19,800. Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer, Bank Bazaar.com, said, “I expect base rate cuts by banks over next few days which will pass on the benefit to retail borrowers.”\nNaveen Kukreja , managing director, Paisabazaar.com, said, “The 50 basis points cut was much than the market was expecting. This time it is a large cut by the RBI, we believe banks will surely pass the cut to retail borrowers on immediate basis. I expect banks will pass the cut between 30 basis points to 40 basis points to borrowers.”\n2.47 pm: Sensex was up 270 points at 25,886. In the 30-share index, HDFC, Maruti and Mahindra & Mahindra were up 4.19 per cent, 3.63 per cent and 3.03 per cent, respectively.\n2.25 pm: The BSE Midcap index and BSE Smallcap index were up 0.60 per cent and 0.18 per cent at 10,636 and 10,936, respectively. Sensex was up 371 points at 25,988.\n2.11 pm: Sensex jumped 421 points at 26,038. S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, said, “We believe there was substantial scope for interest rates to come down in India as a result of developments in commodities prices across the world. Hence, a 50 basis points rate cut is a step in the right direction to improve the long-term growth of the economy. Going forward the key factors required for driving growth would be Goods and Services Tax (GST), resolution of non-performing loans (NPL) problems and ease of doing business. Over a period of time, we expect further moderation in interest rates from current levels and investors should continue to invest in duration with an aim to benefit from the same.”\n2.08 pm: Sensex was up 390 points at 26,007. Nifty was up 113.85 points at 7,909. Arun Singh, senior economist, Dun & Bradstreet India, said, “While it has been largely expected that the RBI should cut the repo rate, the front-loading of the rate cut has been more than anticipated. However, this will give room to the RBI to tinker the policy rate when the US FED hikes the policy rate. Till now, a cumulative 125 basis point reduction in the repo rate has not been adequately transmitted via the banking system. The onus now shifts to the banking system and the government for flow of funds to the productive system of the economy.”\n1.52 pm: NSE Nifty was up 81 points at 7,877. Sahil Kapoor, chief market strategist, Edelweiss Financial Services, said, “The 50 basis points repo cut by RBI and the corresponding measures are indicative of a change in stance from being a strong inflation hawk to a data dependent dove. RBI has repeatedly indicated that its accommodative stance on monetary policy continued to be in place and the current policy statement indicates a renewed commitment towards growth. We believe this interest rate cut would support equity markets, lead bond yields lower and continue to support currency markets as growth focus attracts investments.”\n1.46 pm: The top gainers on the Sensex were HDFC up by 3.76 per cent, M&M (up 3.09 per cent), State Bank of India (up 2.15 per cent), Larsen & Toubro (up 1.90 per cent). On the flip side, Vedanta down by 4.55 per cent, Hindalco (down 2.55 per cent) and Tata Steel (down 2.48 per cent) were the top losers.

The scrip was trading 9.87 per cent up at Rs 4.12 in the afternoon trade. Sensex was up 205 points at 25,822. Nifty was up 62 points at 7,858.\n12.55 pm: Wiping off its initial losses, the benchmark BSE Sensex jumped by 172 points and the NSE Nifty regained the 7,800-level as rate-sensitive stocks rallied after the Reserve Bank cut interest rate by 0.5 per cent today. Sensex was up 0.68 per cent at 25,790. Nifty was up 0.59 per cent at 7,841.\n12.06 pm: Meanwhile, Navneet Munot, chief investment officer, SBI Funds Management, said, “A cut of this magnitude was warranted and this will have positive ramifications on growth and markets. We should test 7.50 percent on 10-year yield with potential to go even lower. The linkage of real rates to 1-year treasury bill opens up room for further rate cuts.” Sensex was down 20 points at 25,596.\n11.18 am: Home loans are set to become cheaper after the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday in its monetary policy review announced to cut repo rate by 50 basis points to 6.75 per cent. Shares of SBI, IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank were up 0.15 per cent, 0.62 per cent and 0.68 per cent.\n11.11 am: Post rate cut interest sensitive banking and realty stocks turned green.

A Reuters poll last week showed only one out of 51 economists had expected a 50 basis points rate cut, while 45 had expected a 25 bps cut. Sensex and Nifty were up 6 points and 10 points at 25,622 and 7,805.\nWithin minutes of RBI policy announcement, Andhra Bank cut its benchmark lending rates by 0.25 per cent. The other banks are likely to follow suit.\n11.02 am: Sensex was up 86.54 points at 25703.38. Shares of HDFC was up over 2 per cent at Rs 1,199.70.\n11.00 am: RBI cuts repo rate by 50 basis points. Sensex wiped off some its losses and was down 133 points 25,483. Repo rate is now at 6.75 per cent. Jyoti Vaswani, chief investment officer, Future Generali Life Insurance, said, “Repo rate cut of 50 bps by RBI is a positive surprise. On the back of a slowing private investment, RBI has delivered what industry wanted with an aggressive rate cut. Also, more importantly RBI will continue its accommodative stance and work with Government towards transmission of bulk of the 125 bps cut which augurs well for revival of capex cycle. The increase in the FPI limit for investment in central govt. securities and introduction of a separate limit for SDLs would go a long way in ensuring increased FII participation in the Indian Debt markets. It also indicates RBI’s comfort with the improving macro-economic scenario in India. Today’s policy actions should be accepted positively by both equity and debt markets.”\nWhat is Repo Rate: Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country lends money to commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds.\n10.54 am: All the major sectoral indices in the BSE were trading in the red as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices lost 1.3 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.

Vinod Nair, head, fundamental research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, said, “We are in a wait and watch scenario ahead the RBI policy meet on Tuesday. We believe that the market has already considered a rate cut of 25 basis points, hence the commentary will be more important. Given the volatility in the global currency and the likelihood of a US rate hike by Dec-15, the commentary is likely to be hawkish and may not be taken positively by the market.”\n(With inputs from agencies)\n 29, 2015 9:18 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/SFP-bMNlZos"], "published": "2015-09-29T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:17:07.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
