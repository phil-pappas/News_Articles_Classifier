The broader All Ordinaries index fell 21 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5096.2.\nBut the ASX 200 finished the week 0.6 per cent higher and the All Ordinaries 0.7 per cent higher.\n\"It was quite the ride for Aussie stocks over the course of the week, with the promise of further Chinese stimulus helping to lift much of the Asian region,\" Suncorp Bank senior economist Darryl Conroy said.\nChina's sharemarket, which returned to trade this week following a two-day hiatus, advanced for the week amid speculation that China's government would undertake more spending to boost its slowing economy.\nBut stronger US jobs data on Wednesday night brought next week's looming US Federal Reserve meeting back to the forefront of investors' minds, and equity markets pulled back as participants mulled what a stronger US dollar would mean to already under-pressure emerging market currencies.\nBack home, the market struggled for direction on Friday, partially due to the number one stock by market capitalisation, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, being placed in a trading halt as it completed the retail bookbuild portion of its $5.1 billion capital raising.\n \"Investors seem to be loathe to commit to any major positioning as we approach the lead up to the Fed rate decision next week,\" IG markets analyst Angus Nicholson said.\nFor the week the best performing stocks were market darling Blackmores, up 11.3 per cent to record a whopping $123 share price, followed by vet chain Greencross, which advanced 10.9 per cent, and Oil Search, up 10.2 per cent following an $11.65 billion takeover bid from Woodside Petroleum.\nWoodside was among the worst performing stocks, down 7.1 per cent for the week, joined by fellow oil and gas companies including Beach Energy and Liquefied Natural Gas, the worst performing stock, down 20 per cent for the week.\n\"Energy stocks were back under the pump after a credit ratings downgrade to Brazil and the threat of additional supply via Iran dogged the sector,\" Mr Conroy said.\nThe energy index fell 2.6 per cent, the hardest hit sector for the week.\nThe best performing sectors were information technology, up 2.2 percent, and financials, up 2.1 per cent.\n\"Attractive bank yields prompted investors back into the financials,\" Mr Conroy said.\nDespite being in a trading halt on Friday, Commonwealth Bank shares fared well over the four sessions, up 4.1 per cent to $75.13. Westpac Banking Corporation rose 1.9 per cent to $30.50, while National Australia Bank added 1.3 per cent to $30.19. ANZ Banking Group rose 2.5 per cent for the week to $27.52.\n\"Given the muted trading today, it probably was an apt decision for CBA to try to close up its refinancing offer ahead of the previous deadline of Monday as renewed global volatility around the Fed meeting could hamper these efforts,\" Mr Nicholson said.\nThe mining stocks were mixed, despite iron ore and oil prices steadying. BHP Billiton fell 4 per cent for the week to $23.71, while Rio Tinto rose 4.5 per cent to $52. Fortescue Metals Group rallied 9.1 per cent to $2.03.\nAmong the other blue chips, Wesfarmers fell 0.6 per cent for the week to $39.19, while Woolworths fell 3 per cent to $24.74. Telstra fell 1.1 per cent to $5.55.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-11T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:05:07.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
