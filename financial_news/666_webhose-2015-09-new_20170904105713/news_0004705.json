And the media and mobile advertising businesses were wiped out overnight? That’s not exactly how it played out, despite the never-ending slew of headlines and tweets on the topic. Major media companies, including CBS and Univision, say they haven’t felt any sort of impact yet , reports CMO Today, despite the early popularity of ad blockers in the app store. It may be that it’s just too early for any one publisher to feel the impact on their mobile traffic. What will be interesting to watch for is whether any major content publishers see mobile advertising fall off a cliff over the next few months. Then you’ll have a better sense about whether ad-blocking apps are products for a few tech savvy ad haters or a broader movement for the masses.\nOVERBLOWN? Have we all gone a bit crazy over how big ad blocking is and how big a threat it poses to the ad industry? A new report issued by J.P. Morgan based on a survey of Web users says maybe so, reports Business Insider. The report says that Apple’s decision to allow mobile ad blocking may be “overblown” and that most consumers--if they care about blocking ads at all--are more likely to do so on desktops. Plus, there’s good news for publishers: 40% of people polled by J.P. Morgan said they’d be inclined to whitelist their favorite publishers. In other words, they’d be OK with not blocking ads on their favorite sites. Before any huge conclusions are drawn and the media and ad world brushes ad blocking aside, it’s worth noting that the survey was conducted among just 520 people. Ultimately, mobile Web traffic for top publishers will tell the true story.\nFACEBOOK FLOOD : Remember all the hype and fear over whether media organizations should publish their content directly to Facebook? While a bunch of big name publishers signed on, like the New York Times, it still seems rare for anybody to ever see these Instant Articles in their Facebook feeds. Well, that seems likely to change soon. The Washington Post says it is all in on Facebook Instant Articles and plans to dump every single story it publishes onto the platform -- about 1,200 stories a day, reports The Wall Street Journal. Even as some fear that Facebook’s potential dominance marks the start of the media apocalypse since the social network gains so much control over the ad experiences and data, publishers like the Washington Post are taking the position that if you can’t beat ‘em, you might as well join ‘em. It’s worth noting that the Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , who’s not somebody that’s afraid to challenge old business models.\nNATIVE CONTENT UPGRADE : From the looks of it, so-called sponsored content is stepping up in class. Take the ambitious work that The Wall Street Journal recently produced for the Netflix series “Narcos.” It was executed like a news story , reports AdAge. Members of the WSJ Custom Studios group conducted video interviews with Drug Enforcement Agency officials, for example, as they looked to produce a content package that brings to life the era “Narcos” chronicles--the rise of the Colombia-to-U.S. drug trade of the 1980s. The native content package even includes an interactive map tracking cocaine trafficking. The treatment -- akin to the New York Times’ recent “Orange Is the New Black” native ad -- speaks to the potential of digital content marketing.\nElsewhere A group of European researchers say that YouTube and YouTube advertisers are vulnerable to non-human traffic [ FT.com ]\nThe ad tech company Turn has a new CEO [ AdExchanger ]\nVerizon Communications’ AOL is spinning off its database of startups, Crunchbase [ TechCrunch ]\nInstagram now has 400 million users [ WSJ ]\nGeneral Electric’s new CMO plans to market GE as a digital industrial company [ CMO Today ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://adage.com/article/media/york-times-runs-native-ad-orange-black/293713/", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/53ac3fd0-604e-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3mUVCk9VF", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://www.businessinsider.com/jp-morgan-note-on-impact-of-ad-blocking-2015-9", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/aolverizon-completes-spinout-of-crunchbase-funded-by-emergence-capital/", "http://adexchanger.com/platforms/turn-appoints-media-vet-bruce-falck-to-ceo-post/", "http://adage.com/article/digital/netflix-latest-native-ad-showpiece-narcos-wsj/300478/", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-09-23T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:53:57.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
