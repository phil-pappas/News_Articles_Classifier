Ben Rushton Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Political hawk-eyes are enjoying John Howard PMO bingo under the new regime.\nFirst Tony Nutt reunited with Arthur Sinodinos . Bingo!\nThen Nutt favourite and legendary Liberal advancer Vincent Woolcock reappeared at Malcolm Turnbull 's signing in last Tuesday. Bingo!\n\"You know order has been restored when Vincent is opening and closing doors,\" a relieved Liberal told us.\nWoolcock is the husband of political columnist at The Oz , Niki Savva .\nHoward's long-time media adviser Tony O'Leary was along for the ministerial swearing in at Peter Cosgrove 's Yarralumla digs on Monday. Bingo!\nO'Leary is helping Nutt out with the transition to the Turnbull era. His reported snubbing at Peta Credlin 's 2013 election night party is ancient history .\nWhile it's not clear how long these Howard-era treasures hang around, life for the new administration will be much improved for having their considerable political brains on tap.\n But, as Turnbull's Sunday reshuffle demonstrated, not everybody's long service will be rewarded.\nThe odds that federal director Brian Loughnane hangs around till the next election are now longer than the Trans-Siberian. While a smart operator, Loughnane's marriage to Credlin puts him in an awkward position in the new administration.\nExpect a change on the other side of the NSW state Liberal council on October 10. By then, Nutt – still nominally the NSW state director – could relocate to his Canberra rose garden … or thereabouts.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/tony-abbott-in-command-but-is-peta-credlin-in-control/story-e6frg6z6-1227233035933", "http://neoskosmos.com/news/en/Costello-Niki-Savva-So-Greek-Confessions-of-a-conservative-leftie", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-09-21T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:09:23.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
