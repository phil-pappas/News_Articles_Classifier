Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger The low dollar , an influx of overseas tourists, and a packed calendar of sporting and business events has boosted occupancy, and driven up room rates in luxury hotel of Sydney and Melbourne.\nFor the owners, the improving metrics have finally driven solid improvements in return, according to a new Savills report.\nMelbourne has been the standout luxury hotel market for the year to date with occupancy rates reaching 88.9 per cent and room rates rising 8.1 per cent since January to average $302 per night. The city's top five star hotels grew revenue per available room (revPAR) – the key industry metric – by 9.2 per cent to $269 a night.\nIn Sydney, luxury hotel revPAR rose 5.5 per to $261 a night. Occupancies reached 85.6 per cent and room rates increased 4.9 per cent to reach $305 a night as both luxury markets outperformed the wider hotel market, where revPAR rose 3.7 per cent over the first six months of the year to $135 a night.\nStarwood Hotels and Resorts Pacific director of acquisition and development Andrew Taylor said occupancies in its flagship Westin Melbourne and Sheraton on the Park in Sydney, were running above 90 per cent.\n\"We can't keep up with demand to be honest. Sydney is in desperate need for more luxury hotels and we see room in the city for our ultra-luxury W or St Regis brands,\" he said.\nMr Taylor said overseas visitors accounted for about 30 per cent of occupancy at these hotels. \"Growth in room rates has been assisted by Chinese groups coming in and prepared to pay well above the room rates they were paying in the past.\n\"They are paying luxury rates. It's nice to see. It hasn't happened in a long time,\" he said.\n The rising returns are likely to drive more offshore investment into Sydney and Melbourne's luxury hotel sector, where yields have tumbled.\nEarlier this week Singaporean developer Pontiac Land won the rights to undertake the $300 million transformation of Sydney's heritage sandstone buildings into a luxury boutique hotel, on behalf of the NSW government.\nBy contrast, Perth's top hotels continued to feel the effects of weakening accommodation demand due to the mining investment slowdown with both occupancy rates (81 per cent) and room rates ($234 a night) falling resulting in a 3.2 per cent fall in revPAR. In Brisbane, occupancy rose above 80 per cent but room rates fell marginally to $165 a night.\nVasso Zographou, director of Savills Hotels, said Melbourne outperformed Sydney because of its better events calendar, including greater use of the Melbourne Convention Centre while Sydney's International Convention Centre remains closed for redevelopment, and because it had fewer luxury rooms to fill.\nBut, he said Sydney would most likely catch up with Melbourne once the International Convention Centre opens in late 2016.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-09-17T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:14:02.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
