My hairdresser — who ran her London salon for 15 years — is now renting a chair in it, having sold her lease and business to a gentleman's barber. More Take the plunge and raise interest rates \nHe essentially specialises in head shaving — not the kind of look I am after — but it turns out this is much more profitable than cutting women's hair. Lots of young (and not-so-young) men want closely clipped styles with neatly edged corners. It’s a forgiving look if you’re thin on top, and for the more fashion forward, there are also tramlines, notches in the eyebrow and matching beards to consider (think singer Craig David, and you won’t be far wrong). \nWhile you may question the fashion, the business logic is clear. These neatly manicured men’s styles need redoing every two weeks or so. As I have observed from my chair, they take about 15 minutes to execute, and cost £15. \nIt’s a high-volume trade, with lots of walk-up business, and minimal set-up costs: essentially, a couple of pairs of clippers and a bonce-dusting brush. \nBy contrast, women’s hairdressing is more complicated. Carrying a stock of hair dyes requires thousands of pounds of upfront investment (and the longer the hair, the more product you’ll need). It’s also less productive. My usual cut, colour and blow dry takes nearly three hours. And my trips are less frequent, coming around every three months. ©Getty Craig David - setting the style trend \nAs I waited for my dye to set, considering how a supposedly defensive business had got the chop started me thinking about the wider vulnerability of defensive shares. \nEveryone ploughed into defensives following the last crisis, valuing their steady and reliable income stream, despite relatively dull earnings growth. \nIn a crude reimagining of my school career teacher’s speech, I can hear her saying: “Invest in big tobacco companies, children, as no matter how bad it gets, people are always going to smoke!” \nThis argument has been somewhat undone by ever-tighter regulation and the rise of ecigarettes , though big tobacco is now rushing to buy up popular vaping brands. \nThe utilities sector has seen its classic defensive business model hit not just by rising regulation, but falling power consumption. In the US, some state regulators have been cutting back allowable returns on capital in an attempt to reduce consumer bills. \nSimilarly, former opposition leader Ed Miliband turned up the political temperature on the UK utilities sector by pledging to freeze energy prices for two years if he was elected, aiming to curb what he regarded as profiteering in the sector. Shares powered down in response. \nHe might have lost the election, but he certainly put the big power companies on the back foot, spurring on price cuts, more transparent information about power use and switching for consumers, plus an ongoing competition probe . \nRead more columns by Claer Barrett, the FT’s personal finance editor \nThen there’s the supermarkets. Their shares were once considered defensive darlings. After all, everyone will always need to buy baked beans. But the sector has been rocked by competition from German discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which have stolen customers and forced down margins as the big four cut prices to compete. \nThe wider consumer drift away from a weekly shop in a ghastly out-of-town hypermarket towards local “top-up shops” has also hit profits and share prices. The introduction of the national living wage next year has caused further upset, as it will push up staff costs and push down profits. \nSome of the biggest brands stocked on supermarket shelves have also been considered to have defensive attributes. \nTake Unilever and Procter & Gamble , which provide consumer staples from Bovril to Fairy Liquid. While they’re not classic “defensives”, their steady income yields have led them to be regarded as “bond proxies” by fixed-income investors craving higher, low-risk returns. As a result, the price of their shares has rocketed. \nUK utilities are still regarded as “defensive but dull” by the wider investment community, but some stock market analysts argue that a contrarian recovery story is emerging in the supermarket sector. \nThey are far from a defensive pick nowadays, but by the time of my next trip to the hairdresser in three months’ time, I think there’s a chance that some of the supermarkets’ share prices could have grown a bit longer as well. \nClaer Barrett is the editor of FT Money. claer.barrett@ft.com ; Twitter: @Claerb Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
