The jobless rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest level since April 2008.\n\"The outlook for a stronger dollar remains very much intact,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. in Washington. \"It lays the groundwork for continued dollar buying over the next few weeks.\"\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback versus 10 major peers, added 0.1 percent to 1,213.35 as of 8:52 a.m. in New York. It declined as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The U.S. currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.111 per euro and declined 0.7 percent to 119.26 yen.\nEmployers added 173,000 workers in August. The gain in payrolls, while less than forecast, followed advances in July and June that were stronger than previously reported, the Labor Department said Friday.\nAverage hourly earnings climbed more than forecast and workers put in a longer workweek, the report also showed.\nPersistent hiring indicates employers were upbeat about America’s demand prospects leading up to mounting concerns of further deterioration in emerging economies.
