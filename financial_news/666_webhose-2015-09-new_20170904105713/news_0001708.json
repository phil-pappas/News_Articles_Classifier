The fastest service costs £30 per month plus line rental on Sky, or £21.70 on TalkTalk. \nThe York network is also around three times faster than the “G.fast” upgrade BT pledged to invest in for 10m homes over the next five years if regulators and the Government resist calls to break it up. \nLyssa McGowan, director of Sky Broadband, said: “Sky is the first broadband service provider in the UK to offer guaranteed broadband speeds. As Ofcom continues its review of the broadband market, we believe trials like this are a valuable demonstration of the alternative technologies now available.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:26:37.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
