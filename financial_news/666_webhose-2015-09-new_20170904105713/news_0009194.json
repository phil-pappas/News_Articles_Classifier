Eskom said it had not sent its workers back to the area since Tuesday, when it was forced to withdraw them after residents threatened to harm them. \nThis was despite a series of meetings with residents and notices about the so-called split meters, the power utility said in a statement. \nThe aim of installing the new meters was to stop illegal connections and allow residents to control their own consumption. \nA split meter consists of a pad in each home, used to load pre-paid electricity, and a tamper-proof box on the pavement or on a pole outside the house. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T09:12:03.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
