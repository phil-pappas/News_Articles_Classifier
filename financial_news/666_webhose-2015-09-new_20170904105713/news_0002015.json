Telecom gaint Idea Cellular said it will invest Rs 500 crore and power solutions provider Jackson Power said it will invest Rs 500 crore.\nWith questions being raised repeatedly over the actual investments on the ground following the mega announcements at such summits, Yadav said he is confident of money flowing in, as all the companies which have signed agreements already have a presence in the state in some form.\nIt can be noted that a slew of Indian states have started organising such mega events to attract investments following the successes achieved by Gujarat over the last decade.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi , who led the Gujarat model, has now been speaking of the need for the states to compete with each other for investments for the benefit of its people.\nIn the past, other chief ministers including Madhya Pradesh’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal have held similar meeting in the city.\nYadav said UP has an efficient bureaucracy that will ensure ease of doing business, and also pointed out that having the largest population also makes his state the biggest market in India.\nHe also sought to correct some inaccuracies, pointing out that his state is the largest milk producer in the country and not Gujarat. Similarly, he claimed that UP is also ahead of Maharashtra in sugar production and can compete with Punjab on wheat production.\nYadav also sought to change perceptions of his Samajwadi Party, which has for long been accused of being averse to liberalisation, market integration, and against technology.\nIn support of this, he said UP government has distributed over 15 lakh laptops across the state and also sounded very open to the realities of the market.\n“Ever since markets have integrated, trade has also been integrated. Every Government is looking for investment,” he said, adding that investment will come to those where the sentiments are good, policies are better and the market opportunity is big.\nOn the policy front, he said even as a debate ensues nationally over land acquisition, UP has successfully acquired land to build an over 320-km expressway between Agra and Lucknow, and rued that nobody is asking his government for its experiences in making this possible.\nWhen asked as to why he has come to Mumbai seeking investments, Yadav retorted saying he will take this issue before the Prime Minister.\nWith migration from UP into industrially developed states still a contentious issue, Yadav made light of a specific question on whether he expects people from Mumbai to return.\nCiting the example of Mumbai BJP leader turned UP Governor Ram Naik, he asked, “where has the Governor of UP come from.”\n 11, 2015 10:27 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:04:12.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
