They did not give a start date for the policy. \nUnder current rules, individual shares can already move no more than 10 percent up or down. \nIn a separate move, the finance ministry said Monday that China will offer investors who hold shares for more than a year relief from a 20 percent dividend tax, with those holding for more than a month only having to pay half the tax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:25:32.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
