Analysts have explained that the metal rallied this week because it is widely used to make catalytic converters for gasoline vehicles, rather than diesel vehicles, which are involved in the scandal. December palladium PAZ5, +1.07% settled at $667.60 an ounce on Comex, up $11.15, or 1.7%, for the session.
