You don't want to negotiate something at General Motors and Ford that's unacceptable\" to FCA US, he told AFP. \nMarchionne was set to attend the launch of a new Alfa Romero in Frankfurt on Tuesday morning but cancelled those plans \"due to other commitments in the United States\" FCA said in a statement. \nWhile the automaker declined to comment on the negotiations a source confirmed Marchionne would be involved in the talks. \n\"It sends the message he thinks he can really get something done,\" said Kristen Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \nIt is likely that the union will agree to an extension of the contraction with FCA beyond midnight if they are within striking distance of a deal, Dziczek said. \nUAW President David Williams -- who warned last week that \"somebody was going to have a real problem\" if there was no deal before the deadline passed -- sounded more conciliatory in a statement Sunday. \n\"All three companies are working hard toward a collective bargaining agreement,\" Williams said. \nThis is the first time that the UAW has been able to use a strike threat to strengthen its hand since 2007. The terms of GM and Chrysler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) 's 2009 bankruptcies prevented the union from going on strike during the 2011 negotiations. \nWilliams has repeatedly said that he views a strike as a failure. \nHowever, the union is also looking to claw back some of the concessions made in order to help the Detroit Three survive the economic crisis. All three carmakers are now posting massive profits and the industry is booming. \nWilliams has vowed to end the two-tier system, where newer workers are paid significantly less than long-term employees. Roughly 43 percent of FCA US employees earn about $16.50 per hour, while workers with seniority earn $30 per hour wage. \nThe union is was looking for a raise for seniority workers, who have not seen a wage increase since 2006 and have lost roughly four percent of their purchasing power to inflation. The union gave up automatic cost-of-living adjustments during the 2009 bankruptcies. \nWilliams also wants the contact to reflect a commitment to slow or end the flow of auto company investment into Mexico. \nMarchionne appears more willing to meet the union's demands than executives at GM and Ford, which this year have announced significant new investments in Mexico, Shaiken noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:51:12.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
