Tetteh, condemned the coup of September 17, noting that it violates with impunity \"the internationally brokered process to promote the principle of entrenching democracy and constitutional governance in Burkina Faso.\" \nThe statement also called on the people of Burkina Faso to remain calm and exercise restraint while urging the political stakeholders to embrace dialogue to ensure the protection and preservation of lives. \nSource: Flagstaff House Communication Bureau Ghana \nJustice Dery allegedly taking bride in the investigative video see more » Copyright © 2015 Government of Ghana.
