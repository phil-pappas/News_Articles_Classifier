Photo: Getty Images\nTwo of the country's biggest banks have been getting pats on the back from unlikely sources: environmental groups opposing massive new coal mines.\nAs Tony Abbott vowed to clamp down on the green \"sabotage\" of mining, National Australia Bank this month volunteered that it wouldn't finance Adani's controversial $16 billion Carmichael mine .\nThe proposed Queensland mine's environmental approval was revoked last month, only for Abbott to set about changing the laws to stop this happening again.\nIllustration: Michael Mucci\nAt the same time, NAB also said it wanted to fund more renewable energy.\nAdvertisement Commonwealth Bank, one of the biggest financiers of resources projects in the country, also confirmed its mandate as an adviser on the project had ended in August .\nThat doesn't necessarily mean it won't fund the project, but observers say it will be unlikely.\nWhat's behind these uncharacteristic moves from the big banks? Normally, the banks are loath to publicly discuss their stance on individual projects, let alone one the government is backing so keenly.\nIs it just about limiting bad publicity?\nOr could they reflect policies on climate change risk within NAB, chaired by former Treasury secretary and environmental advocate Ken Henry; and CBA, whose chairman David Turner is also a director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation?\nIf you'd like the banks to cut their lending to big carbon emitters, I wouldn't be celebrating yet.\nThese decisions are almost certainly more about commercial interests and corporate reputations than they are about the environment.\nHowever, it's also impossible to disentangle these moves from the growing emphasis within finance towards taking climate change seriously as a purely economic risk, as well as an environmental one.\nCBA and NAB's comments follow in the footsteps of a long line of huge international banks that have ruled out financing the controversial Adani project, including Citi, HSBC and Deutsche Bank.\nFormer NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne said: \"You would be hard-pressed to find a financial institution that would make a different call to NAB's today.\"\nHis point was that ruling out lending to the project was \"proper\" and \"prudent\" for shareholders; purely on financial grounds.\nHowever, the banking sector's response to the Adani mine is also part of a broader story about the real risks to financiers from carbon exposure; one that's increasingly catching the eyes of regulators overseas.\nA report this month by Tim Buckley from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis – a group pushing for action on climate change by investors – uses the Adani story to highlight the risks of \"stranded assets\" in a fossil fuel-heavy economy like Australia's one.\nThis concept says carbon-intensive assets, like coal mines, could have a much shorter economic life than thought because of climate change policies in Australia or overseas.\nAside from the banking sector's less than enthusiastic stance towards the Carmichael mine, Buckley, a former head of equity research at Citi, argues the market for exporting thermal coal is in \"structural decline\".\n\"Structural decline\" is the idea that China and India are moving away from importing thermal coal to burn in power stations as they seek less polluting forms of energy; cutting a crucial source of demand just as supply ramps up.\nCiting figures that coal miners' share prices have tumbled 70 per cent globally in the last five years, Buckley makes a convincing point.\n\"Investing in coal companies is increasingly accepted by the financial markets as a wealth hazard,\" Buckley says.\nHe's not alone in highlighting this risk.\nOne of Britain's most senior banking regulators said in March that insurance companies \"may take a huge hit\" as the world moved to lower carbon emissions.\nBank of England governor Mark Carney has launched an inquiry into the broader risks to the country's financial system from a decline in fossil fuel asset values if the world is successful in limiting climate change to a 2 degree rise in global temperatures.\nAnd the Financial Stability Board , a global body that tries to protect against future crisis, is investigating the same issue for the Group of 20 economies.\nWhat's interesting about this is that it appears to be driven by regulators charged with managing real financial risks, rather than the politicians (though, of course, politics is relevant). It's about the cold hard numbers and what happens to asset values if the world does tackle climate change.\nFor the local banks, there has also been mounting pressure from powerful super funds that own billions in stock.\nOne of the country's biggest investors, Australian Super, last year revealed it had asked the chairmen of the big four how they were responding to their carbon-exposure risk.\nFacing pressure like this, the major banks have promised to beef up their disclosure of the amount of carbon emissions they help to finance by lending to businesses or big infrastructure projects.\nI'm not holding my breath for more examples of banks publicly distancing themselves from coal like they have from Adani's project, which is unique in its sheer size and potential to damage banks' brands.\nHowever, if financial regulators are thinking seriously about carbon risk overseas, surely it also warrants a close look in a carbon-heavy economy like ours.\nRoss Gittins is on leave.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/adani-and-commonwealth-bank-part-ways-casting-further-doubt-on-carmichael-coal-project-20150805-gisd1l.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11563768/G20-to-probe-carbon-bubble-risk-to-global-financial-system.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/australian-super-calls-on-banks-to-assess-climate-change-risk-20141223-12d16q.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/national-australia-bank-rules-out-funding-adanis-carmichael-coal-mine-20150902-gjdsfl.html", "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/804.aspx", "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/01/bank-of-england-investigating-risk-of-carbon-bubble"], "published": "2015-09-14T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:47:34.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
