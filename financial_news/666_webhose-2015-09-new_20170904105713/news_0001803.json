BA -0.96 % lost an order for four 747-8 jumbo freighter aircraft from Japan’s biggest cargo carrier as the air-freight-market recovery receded in July.\nAfter giving a cautiously optimistic outlook on air cargo earlier this year, the plane maker confirmed on Friday that Nippon Cargo Airlines Co. canceled an order for four 747-8F freighters. Boeing confirmed the loss on Thursday, but didn’t identify the customer.\nThe cancellation is another warning sign for the manufacturers of large, dedicated freighter aircraft as worries about economic growth, especially in Asia, threatens to chill demand.\nGlobal freight traffic fell 0.7% in July from a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association. The drop in demand came as freight capacity grew 6.7%, spurring fears of another downturn in air cargo.\nRead more\nAir Cargo Volumes Drop, as China’s Economy Stumbles (Sept. 2) Atlas Air Adding Freighter Capacity on Robust Outlook (July 30) Boeing Gets Cargo Boost for 747 Jumbo Jet at Paris Air Show (June 17) Boeing keeping it in the freight family (June 17) Boeing Boosts Jet Forecast, Trims Traffic Growth Outlook (June 11) “The disappointing July freight performance is symptomatic of a broader slowdown in economic growth,” said IATA Director General Tony Tyler , in the traffic report.\nBoeing executives earlier this year forecast a rebound in cargo traffic after years of weakness following the 2008 global financial crisis.\nWhile the loss of four 747s is small, it cuts Boeing’s backlog by nearly 14% according to its orders outstanding as of the end of August.\nBoth Boeing and rival Airbus Group SE have suffered from a dearth of demand from airlines for their largest jets. Only Boeing, however, builds a dedicated freighter version of its biggest aircraft, the 747-8, which has made up the majority of 747 purchases.\nBoeing is slated in September to scale back 747-8 production to a monthly average of 1.3 aircraft from 1.5, its third such cut since 2013. Boeing had 29 orders left to fill as of the end of August.\nThe 747-8 is a larger and more fuel-efficient model of Boeing’s venerable jumbo jetliner, with major changes to the jet’s wings and new General Electric Co. GE -2.08 % engines.\nExisting customers may help boost a backlog of around 19 months of production at its announced rates.\nBoeing signed an agreement Russian cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group in June for 20 747-8 freighters, breathing new life into the program, but the agreement has yet to be finalized.\nIn an interview on Thursday, the chief executive of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., William J. Flynn, said the cargo carrier may order more, having added a deal for one plane earlier this year.\n“We certainly want more [747]-8s,” Mr. Flynn said. “It’s an excellent aircraft. … I do think there will be additional orders of -8s.”\nThe cargo hauler is the third-largest operator of the latest version of the jumbo freighter and the biggest in North America.\n—Paul Page and Loretta Chao contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:33:08.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
