Jones Capital Equities Management, accessing roughly 100,000 people’s information. ADVERTISEMENT Officials accused the firm of having no written policies for safeguarding customer information. R.T. Jones, the SEC said, did not conduct regular security risk assessments, encrypt sensitive client data or install a firewall, a common security measure that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.\nAlthough the SEC could find no evidence that R.T. Jones’s clients were financially harmed because of the breach, the agency chose to take action anyway as part of its burgeoning efforts to pressure companies to tighten their cybersecurity. \n“As we see an increasing barrage of cyberattacks on financial firms, it is important to enforce the safeguards rule even in cases like this when there is no apparent financial harm to clients,” said Marshall Sprung, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Asset Management Unit. \nR.T. Jones agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty as part of the settlement. \nIn addition to enforcement actions, the SEC is also considering requirements that would force companies to reveal more information about their cybersecurity vulnerabilities. \n“Firms must adopt written policies to protect their clients’ private information and they need to anticipate potential cybersecurity events and have clear procedures in place rather than waiting to react once a breach occurs,\" Sprung said.
