China's exports dropped 5.5% in August from a year earlier in dollar terms after a 8.3% drop in July, according to the General Administration of Customs, better than the 6.6% decline that was expected by analysts. However, Customs said China exports will continue to face \"relatively big pressure\" in the fourth quarter amid a slowing economy. \nImports last month decreased 13.8% in August in dollar terms compared to a year ago, more than the 7.9% dip that was forecast, after a 8.1% fall in July. \nChina's trade surplus widened in August to $60.2 billion from $43.03 billion in July, beating projections of $48bn. \nCapital Economics said trade was \"healthier than headlines suggest\", adding the figures would likely have been stronger in August had it not been for temporary disruptions to industrial activity following the Tianjin warehouse blast and factory closures ahead of last week's WWII Victory Day parade. \n\"Looking ahead, we think trade growth ought to recover over the coming quarters,\" said China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"The drag from the Tianjin blast and Victory parade disruptions ought to have mostly faded this month. Meanwhile, stronger growth in China's main trading partners ought to shore up exports while a pick-up in investment spending will boost imports.\" In the eurozone, Germany's trade surplus narrowed to €22.8bn in July from €24.4bn a month earlier, slightly more than the €23.5bn expected by analysts. Exports rose 2.4% in July, compared to forecasts for a 1% gain and the previous month's 1.1% drop. Imports climbed 2.2% in July, smashing estimates for a 0.7% rise and better than June's 0.8% fall. \nOn this side of the pond, British retail spending stagnated in August due to poor weather and the later-than-usual date of a public holiday. The British Retail Consortium said retail spending in August was 0.1% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since April and down from 2.2% growth in July. \nThe US resumes trading after a break for Monday's Labor Day. US reports on small business optimism, labour market conditions and consumer credit will be released in the afternoon session. \nCompany-wise, Betfair rallied after the company and its rival Paddy Power (LSE: PAP.L - news ) agreed on a £5bn merger. \nAmlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) surged after MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings said it was in talks to buy the group. \nUnited Utilities (LSE: UU.L - news ) was at the top of the FTSE 100 amid reports that it could attract takeover interest due to its current valuation.
