No major new roads have been built in Kuwait City for years despite the population swelling considerably.\nExpats now must be employed in certain roles and meet strict salary conditions to qualify for a driver’s licence.\nUnemployed expat wives also can only qualify if their husbands’ do, however Kuwait Times said still not all those women are granted the right to drive.\nEgyptian expat Marwa Salem told the English daily her right to a driver’s licence had been rescinded even after passing the exam.\n“I have four children in school. Their father goes to work early and no one can get them to school but me,” she told Kuwait Times.\n“I already have a driving license from Egypt, but I cannot drive here unless I have a Kuwaiti driving license.”\n Expats must have a minimum monthly wage of KD400 ($1,418) and a university degree to qualify to apply for a driver’s licence.\nOnly certain job titles also qualify, including diplomats, professional sports people, drivers, judges and members of the prosecution, some university staff, members of the media, doctors and pharmacists, engineers, teachers, social workers, researchers, Imams and sports trainers.\nIn July last year, the General Traffic Department announced employees with multi-worded titles also would be prohibited from gaining a driver’s licence.\nNew measures also were taken to weed out employees’ whose job titles were misrepresented to make them qualify.\nThousands of expats also have been deported from the country for driving without a licence or breaching traffic rules.\n ", "external_links": ["http://news.kuwaittimes.net/website/driving-license-woes-for-most-expat-wives/"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:41:36.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
