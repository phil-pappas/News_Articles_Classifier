They fell about two per cent to $NZ1.50 on Friday morning. The Kathmandu board rejected Briscoe's offer saying it undervalued the chain, adding it had been valued at between $NZ2.10 and $NZ2.41 a share by Grant Samuel's independent assessment of the offer. Briscoe's stake reverts to 19.9 per cent, the most it can hold without making a full takeover. Briscoe stock last traded at $NZ2.99. Kathmandu last traded on the ASX at $A1.31, down 8.00 cents or 5.76 per cent.
