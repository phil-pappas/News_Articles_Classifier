The raising was achieved via a series of rolling closures after PEP reached its first close of $1.1 billion last year.\nLink is expected to post an underlying EBITDA of $180 million this financial year, up from $150 million last year.\nElsewhere, brokers were pitching to sell down part of TPG and The Carlyle Group's $1.7 billion stake in private hospital operator Healthscope on Wednesday night.\nGoldman Sachs, Macquarie Capital and UBS were understood to be fighting it out for the mandate to sell just over 300 million shares, or about half TPG and Carlyle's stake.\nFinally, as revealed by Street Talk Online , Wilson HTM sold a line of 2.3 million shares in Bellamy's Australia, worth around $15 million.\nThe floor price was set at $6.40 a share and the deal was done at $6.70. Bellamy's closed at $6.91 on Wednesday.\nBellamy's chairman Robert Woolley, managing director Laura McBain and other management are selling down stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:05:51.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
