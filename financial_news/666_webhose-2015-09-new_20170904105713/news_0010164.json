It's made with money you’ve already paid tax on (like Roth contributions). The contributions grow tax-free (like a pre-tax and Roth), but all growth will be taxed upon withdrawal. Therefore, the main difference between a Roth and non-deductible contribution is that income and gains from a Roth IRA or 401(k) plan would, upon withdrawal, be tax-exempt, assuming that the Roth account has been opened at least five years and that the individual account holder is over the age of 59 &frac12; (qualified distribution). Conversely, income and gains from a non-deductible IRA or 401(k) plan would be subject to tax upon withdrawal. Non-Deductible 401(k) Plan Contribution Tax Strategy Generally, when an individual is over the age of 50, he or she is able to make employee deferrals in a pre-tax fund or Roth 401(k) plan of up to $18,000 or $24,000 for 2015. A profit-sharing contribution can be made in pre-tax funds in the amount equal to 25% of compensation (20% in case of self-employment or a single member LLC), and both contributions cannot exceed $53,000 or $59,000 in the aggregate for 2015.An after-tax deferral (neither Roth or pre-tax) is also an option that can go up to $53,000 or $59,000 on a dollar-for-dollar basis and include other plan contributions, such as employee deferrals and profit-sharing. For example, if Joe, a 40-year-old self-employed individual, earned $100,000 in 2015, he would be able to make a maximum employee deferral contribution of $18,000 in pre-tax funds or Roth and also make an after-tax contribution dollar-for-dollar equal to $35,000. This is the difference between $53,000 (the maximum annual 401(k) contribution for 2015) and $18,000, the maximum employee deferral contributions limit. Those employee deferral or employer profit-sharing contributions can then be converted to a Roth.The advantage of making after-tax contributions versus a profit-sharing contribution is that you can make a dollar-for-dollar contribution as opposed to a profit-sharing contribution, which is based off a percentage of your compensation (20% or 25%). If Joe elected to make profit sharing contributions instead of an after-tax contribution, he would be limited to a $20,000 contribution (20% of the $100,000 salary), giving him or her an annual contribution of just $38,000 versus $53,000 if, in addition to making elective deferrals, he made after-tax plan contributions, which can be made on a dollar-for-dollar basis.Using the after-tax contribution strategy allowed Joe to defer an additional $15,000 versus just making employee deferrals and employer profits sharing contribution. The nice thing about after-tax contributions: the salary deferral limits that apply to other participant contributions do not necessarily apply to after-tax contributions. Of course, the individual must have disposable income available to make the after-tax contributions, but if so, the strategy can help one boost their retirement savings.Recent IRS Notice 2014-54 has made after-tax contributions significantly more appealing to Solo 401(k) plan participants. Prior to Notice 2014-54, there was a question as to whether after-tax funds can be converted to a Roth IRA, which would significantly limit the benefit of making an after-tax 401(k) plan contribution.Notice 2014-54 clarified this rule and allowed the pre-tax and after-tax funds that were distributed from a plan on a pro-rated basis to be separated once a distribution is made. Allocating after-tax contributions is only possible when the entire account (including both pre-tax and after-tax amounts) is rolled over. If only part of it is rolled over, the pro rata rules still apply. The IRS notice is also only applicable to after-tax contributions to employer plans; it doesn't apply to IRAs. The pre-tax funds can be rolled into a Traditional IRA, whereas the after-tax dollars can be converted into a Roth IRA. Boost Your Solo 401(k) Plan Annual Contributions Now that IRS Notice 2014-54 has made it clear that after-tax 401(k) plan contributions are eligible to be converted to a Roth IRA, the strategy of using after-tax contributions to boost one’s annual Solo 401(k) contributions is much more attractive. The advantage of using the after-tax Solo 401(k) contribution strategy is that contributions can be made on a dollar-for-dollar basis versus employer profit sharing contributions, which are based on a percentage of salary.This allows a Solo 401(k) plan participant with available income to contribute more to their Solo 401(k) plan on an annual basis than they would be able to by just making employee deferrals and employer profit sharing contributions. In addition to being able to supercharge their annual retirement plan contributions, IRS Notice 2014-54 opens the door to make greater Roth contributions. Instead of making pre-tax contributions to an employer plan, an individual could intentionally elect to make only after-tax 401(k) plan contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis.These after-tax contributions will then be available upon retirement (or separation from service) to rollover to a Roth IRA without additional taxes or penalties. This technique is essentially a backdoor strategy for funding a Roth IRA while simultaneously being able to supercharge your Solo 401(k) plan contributions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T22:11:13.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
