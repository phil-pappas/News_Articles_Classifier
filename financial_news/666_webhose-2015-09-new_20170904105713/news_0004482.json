Both are to be delivered between September and December 2016, Flightglobal's Ascend Fleets database shows.\nRwandair chief executive John Mirenge said that the new A330s would support the carrier's plans to expand into Europe and Asia, enhance its regional presence, and open up new routes.\n\"We were delighted to have the opportunity to close this important financing for RwandAir and contribute to Rwanda's economic development and the delivery against transport and infrastructure components of the Rwandan government's Vision 2020 Initiative,\" says PTA Bank president Admassu Tadesse,\nPTA Bank, which styles itself as an \"eastern and southern African trade and development bank\", has been instrumental in RwandAir's fleet acquisition process since the carrier in 2009 disclosed plans to acquire its own fleet with the purchase of two ex-Lufthansa Bombardier CRJ200s.\nThe bank has provided a $13.5 million loan facility for those units, along with pre-delivery payment and US Export-Import Bank-backed 10-year loans for the acquisition of a pair of Boeing 737-800s in 2011.\nThe following year, RwandAir acquired a pair of new CRJ900s via Export Development Canada guarantee.\nRwandAir operates two 737-700s, two 737-800s, two CRJ900s, two Q400s and a single Dash 8-100, Ascend Fleets shows.\nRelated Content Ethiopian selects PDP arrangers for 777Fs RwandAir closes Ex-Im Bank financing RwandAir closes first 737-800 financing RwandAir receives $20m loan from government RwandAir secures CRJ financing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T11:59:42.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
