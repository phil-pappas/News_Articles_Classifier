But the policy led to billions of dollars in losses and contributed to making Petrobras the world's most indebted major oil company.\nBringing domestic fuel prices in line with international levels is vital to shoring up Petrobras' finances and enabling the company to sell refinery assets, sources with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.\nAlthough international fuel prices have fallen dramatically, a 35-percent weakening of the real against the dollar this year has meant prices at the pump in Brazil remain low.\nBut the price increase could give a further kick to Brazil's already high rate of inflation, which economists predict will reach 9.5 percent in 2015.\n(Reporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Paul Tait and Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T06:33:03.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
