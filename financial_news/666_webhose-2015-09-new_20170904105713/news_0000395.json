The answer is fiendishly simple By Ben Wright | Telegraph – 3 minutes 10 seconds ago 500.43 +2.13 \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) believes China will recover, commodity prices will pick up again and the value of the company’s assets will be boosted by its leverage. If none of that happens... \nLeverage is a little like sunlight: not enough and your returns will be somewhat anaemic; just enough and they’ll have a healthy glow; but too much and you get frazzled. Right now Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) is in need of a soothing squirt of aloe vera. \nWhat is leverage? Essentially it is when companies or investors borrow money and use it (like a lever) to turn a small movement in prices into a big movement in returns. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) accentuates the positive but also (and this is why it needs to be handled with care) the negative. \nHow do you know that a company is too highly leveraged? Banks provide a good case study, because their business models are predicated on leverage: they need to borrow money in order to lend it. The capital structure of banks, which determines how highly levered they are, has also been one of the main focuses of regulatory attention since the financial crisis. \nThere is no way of knowing exactly how much leverage is too much until a bank or a company goes “pop”. Then everyone stands around examining the wreckage with 20/20 hindsight, and deciding that, on reflection, the ex-company was probably carrying a bit too much debt. \nBut old industry observers have a useful rule of thumb. They argue that if a bank grows more quickly, through the cycle, than the economies in which it is operating, then something is amiss. Either the bank is undercutting its competitors in order to increase market share (and is likely therefore to be mispricing its loans) or it is using too much leverage. Both tactics can be interrelated, and work well, until they don’t. \nThere is a problem, though. It is encompassed by those words “through the cycle”. A well-run bank might slightly outperform the market in fat years and slightly underperform it in lean years. That is fine, as long as things even themselves out through the credit cycle (which can roughly be defined as the expansion and contraction of credit through time). The difficulty is that no one knows how long a cycle will last, or the depths and heights it will reach, until it’s over. \nGlencore is not a bank, but it shares some of their characteristics. It has a big trading operation and it employs a lot of leverage. It also has to manage its business through the cycle (albeit the commodities cycle rather than a credit cycle). On Monday, analysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) released a note which suggested that we are still on the downswing of that cycle and might well remain in the trough for some time. They argued that demand for certain commodities from China will remain depressed, which will keep prices low and, consequently, Glencore’s assets will be worth less than its debt (which means its shares aren’t worth the paper they’re not written on). The company’s shares plunged nearly 30pc in a single day . \nOn Tuesday, analysts at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) countered that the market wasn’t valuing the company fairly and, should that continue, the management team should take Glencore private. The company itself issued a fairly bland statement saying that it believed that commodities prices would pick up again in the medium to long term and that its balance sheet was robust enough to hang on in there until they did. The shares rebounded 17pc. \nHow can a couple of research notes cause such massive swings in the value of a multi-billion pound company? Part of the answer is they are arguing about where we are in the commodities cycle. Glencore (and Citigroup) believe that commodity prices will pick up again and the value of the company’s assets will be boosted by its leverage. Investec thinks commodity prices will stay where they are (or fall further) and that the value of the company’s assets will be wiped out by its leverage. \nThe reason there has been such volatility in the company’s share price this week is that this is essentially a binary bet: either Investec is right and the shares will soon be worth nothing, or Glencore is right and they will continue to be worth something. And that will depend on where we are in the cycle, which we won’t know until we’ve been through it. \nThis is what people mean when they talk about Glencore’s shares essentially being a leveraged bet on the Chinese economy. You pays your money and you takes your choice. \n= Uber sensitive = \nLove it or hate it, Uber is a phenomenon. The app-controlled taxi-ride service epitomises the on-demand service industry; new products are constantly being marketed as “the Uber for this” or “the Uber for that”. \nSome people dislike the fact that its surge pricing means you pay more when demand for cabs is high (perhaps without realising that the same mechanism keeps prices down when demand is low). But, of course, if you don’t like it, you can easily choose another provider. It’s a free world and a free market. Except that soon it may well not be in London. \nTransport for London has launched a consultation process for new regulations , which it says are designed with public safety in mind. But look at some of the proposals: a minimum wait time, banning operators from showing cars for hire within a smartphone app, and demanding operators allow customers to book cabs up to seven days in advance of their journey. \nIt is hard to see how these proposals might improve public safety; it is even harder to see how they aren’t squarely aimed at Uber’s business model. Black cabs don’t like Uber. But that is because customers do. The answer is not to wrap Uber up in red tape but abolish some of the regulations that black cabs have to deal with. That will maintain consumer choice and help push prices lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:51:55.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
