Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Before you jump on the Glencore bankruptcy bandwagon consider these perspectives from an investment banker, a debt market investor, an equity trading desk veteran, a credit rating analyst, a hedge fund manager and, believe it or not, the company itself.\nBut first, here is the controversial view of the world's biggest commodities trader from the analyst at Investec Bank who triggered a 30 per cent plunge in the company's share price on Monday .\nInvestec's Hunter Hillcoat said in a note to clients: \"At current spot prices, all else being the same, Glencore's equity value is zero\", according to The Financial Times.\nHe went on to say that \"using a PE-based approach to evaluate equity value going forward, in proportion to debt, we note that the heavily indebted companies could see almost all equity value eliminated under spot conditions, leaving nothing for shareholders\", according to Zerohedge.\nIn other words, the total equity on the Glencore balance sheet of $US47.45billion is worthless.\nWhile that is a scary conclusion for Glencore shareholders to digest, it was Hillcoat's statements in relation to Glencore's readily marketable inventories or RMI, which really put the cat amongst the pigeons.\nRMI is the physical commodities trading inventory owned by Glencore and used in its day-to-day business of trading commodities on global exchanges and over the counter. The RMI is worth about $US18billion.\nHillcoat gives Glencore no credit for something which the company and credit ratings agencies regard as being as good as cash.\n In other words, he is saying that the debt burden at Glencore is not the net amount of $US28 billion the company has repeatedly referred to in market announcements and in meetings with investors.\nInstead, it is $US45 billion. That puts a very different complexion on a company with a market capitalisation of about $US16.7 billion.\nIt is against that confusing backdrop that Chanticleer sought the views of various market players.\nA turning point for debt tolerance The investment banker, who did not want to be named, said the collapse in Glencore's share price marked a turning point in the market's tolerance of debt in the resources sector .\nHe argues that investors are not only sending a message to Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg about the need for a less leveraged balance sheet, they are also sending a message to BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto about their unsustainable dividend policies.\nThe banker says BHP's Andrew Mackenzie and Rio's Sam Walsh should take on board what the markets are saying.\nThey should abandon capital management policies that will ultimately force them to borrow to pay dividends. He says they should return to the traditional resources industry strategy of investing for growth at the bottom of the commodities cycle.\nIt is noteworthy that the banker has been around long enough to have had several clashes with Glasenberg. However, they always departed as friends.\nHe says it would be a mistake to underestimate Glasenberg's ability to handle a crisis. Nor should investors forget the fact that he got through the global financial crisis with his business intact.\nThe equity trading desk veteran says that Glencore is basically a cyclical company with too much debt. \"When commodity prices fall the value of the whole enterprise is clearly worth a lot less,\" he says.\n\"The value of the whole company is the enterprise value. The issue is that when you have a lot of debt, the value of the debt doesn't change. So effectively the equity piece takes a disproportionate hit. The more the debt, the greater the impact on equity.\"\nHe says Glencore is in a difficult situation because it is trying to sell assets into a sceptical market. Also, it is being seen as a proxy for betting against China.\n'Priced for junk status' The debt market investor, Jonathan Rochford at Narrow Road Capital, says Glencore's debt is being priced for junk status even though it has an investment-grade credit rating.\n\"In the risks section of the recent company presentation a fall in the copper price is listed as the biggest commodity exposure, with a 10 per cent drop reducing profit by $US615 million per half year,\" he says. \"With copper hitting fresh lows and down around 17 per cent since June 30, there's $US2 billion dollars of earnings per annum gone. All things being equal, that has the business struggling to pay interest let alone generate a profit regardless of how much of the profit adjustments you accept. No profit means that lenders won't want to rollover debt when it matures and there's also limited ability to amortise debt from cash flows.\"\n\"Whilst the investment grade ratings (BBB/Baa2) remain for the time being the movements in the debt prices are indicating they won't last much longer,\" Rochford says.\n\"Goldman Sachs raised the possibility of downgrades last week, noting that the proposed steps to reduce debt by $US10 billion were inadequate.\"\nThe hedge fund manager is Glencore shareholder John Burbank from Passport Capital, who is on the record as shorting Glencore shares.\nHe said in a recent interview with RealVisionTV that energy commodities are about to be \"liquidated\".\nHe said \"we are on the precipice of a liquidation in emerging markets like the fourth quarter of 1997\".\nHowever, that bearishness is not being reflected in the latest missive from Simon Redmond, the primary credit analyst at Standard & Poor's responsible for analysing Glencore.\nIn a note issued soon after Glencore announced a $US2.5 billion capital raising and a $IUS10 billion debt reduction plan, Redmond wrote that under the S&P base case Glencore will have adjusted EBITDA of $US9 billion to $US10 billion in 2015, proportionately consolidating three sizeable joint ventures, before a moderate increase in 2016. Importantly, Redmond gives Glencore cash credit for 90 to 75 per cent of its RMI.\nHe includes positive commentary about the company's mining operations and its commodities trading business. \"The company's very well-diversified mining operations and large-scale, long-lived, low-cost assets partly offset the cyclicality of the mining industry. The group compares well with most peers in terms of commodity diversification,\" he said.\n\"We factor in our assessment that the group's cost position will further improve because of currency changes, efficiency measures, and as new projects reach full capacity. The business risk profile is further supported by Glencore's strong business position, notably thanks to the scale and scope of its marketing operations – which span from metals, oil, and coal to agricultural commodities – as well as to perceived supportive risk management and risk position.\"\nThe company itself made it clear to Chanticleer that it will bunker down and tough it out. It will go ahead with the sale of about 30 per cent of its agricultural business which is worth about $US12 billion in total.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-29T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:06:38.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
