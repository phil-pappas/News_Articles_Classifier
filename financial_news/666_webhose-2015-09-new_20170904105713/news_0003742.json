REUTERS/Mike Segar (Reuters) - U.S. video camera maker GoPro Inc (GPRO.O) shares could plunge to $25 from a recent $35 as its latest product launch underwhelms consumers and competition comes on strong, Barron's said in a report on Sunday.\nBarron's said investors in GoPro are \"skittish\" about the company's ability to ward off competition from Apple Inc (APPL.O), which has upgraded the camera on its iPhone to produce more high resolution video.\nOfficials at GoPro declined to comment.
