Peter Braig Share on twitter by Patrick Commins Shares enjoyed a strong bounce on Wednesday as a more upbeat global mood filtered through to the ASX, with a more stable session of trading on Chinese exchanges trumping ongoing worries about the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting.\nEquities were provided with a solid offshore lead after Wall Street gained on Tuesday night, rising sharply at the open before trending higher through the day.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 finished close to the day's high, adding 80 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 5098.9 , while the All Ordinaries jumped 77 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 5123.5.\nAfter two days of heavy losses, mainland Chinese shares stabilised and helped sentiment across the region. The main Shanghai Composite index was up 1.2 per cent in late Wednesday trade, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index bounced 2.7 per cent.\nThe session's trading continued a trend of marked volatility, Celeste investment analyst Paul Biddle said.\n\"The market has been crazy,\" Mr Biddle said. \"It has a good day and then a bad day, which suggest there's a lot of uncertainty and a general lack of direction when it moves in such big swings on a daily basis.\"\nEconomists and analysts are broadly split on whether the US central bank will early Friday morning lift rates for the first time in almost a decade.\n\"It's potentially the best flagged [monetary policy] move in the history of the world,\" Mr Biddle said. \"I would be absolutely gobsmacked if the market has an enormous negative reaction [to a rate rise] given how well it's been flagged.\"\n The big four banks provided the main impetus for sharemarket's solid rally, as they bounced off the previous day's losses. Commonwealth Bank of Australia added 2.6 per cent to $75.35, Westpac Banking Corp gained 2.9 per cent to $31.07, ANZ Banking Group lifted 2.7 per cent to $27.88, while National Australia Bank closed 2.3 per cent higher at $30.51.\nBank share prices have been see-sawing due to the generally negative mood clashing with ongoing support from the high dividend yields on offer, investors said.\n\"We are getting a pretty extreme spread between grossed-up bank yields on the one hand and what you can get on a term deposit on the other, and you have to think that is starting to put a bit of a floor on bank share pricing,\" Russell Investments strategist Graham Harman said.\nResources also bounced, with mining heavyweights BHP Billiton rising 2.3 per cent to $23.97 and Rio Tinto 1.1 per cent to $51.31. Woodside jumped 3 per cent to $29.10 as reports emerged that the oil and gas producer was looking to take its offer for Oil Search directly to its smaller rival's investors.\nWoolworths continued to struggle, slumping 0.6 per cent to $24.52, its lowest in more than three years. Fellow supermarket owner Wesfarmers added 0.3 per cent to $38.97. Among other blue chips, Telstra gained 1.8 per cent to $5.58.\nMedia stocks enjoyed a surge of support on the second day of trading following the appointment of Malcolm Turnbull, an advocate for media reform, as Prime Minister. Ten Network Holdings jumped 5.6 per cent to 19¢, Seven West Media added 3.4 per cent to 76.5¢, Nine Entertainment climbed 3.3 per cent to $1.57, while APN News & Media rallied 7.1 per cent to 53¢.\nASX debutant Vitaco enjoyed a strong start , finishing its first day of trading at $2.38, 13 per cent above its $2.10 listing price. Fellow vitamins and supplements business Blackmores continued its astonishing run in 2015, adding 5.1 per cent to $130.
