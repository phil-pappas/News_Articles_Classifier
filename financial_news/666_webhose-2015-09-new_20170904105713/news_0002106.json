Bloomberg by Christine Baalham Despite recent market turmoil, consensus expects US interest rates to rise over the next 12 months. Conventional wisdom is that rising interest rates will lead to underperformance of higher-yielding equities. However, there is limited historical evidence to support this thesis.\nThe financial crisis that began in 2007 resulted in the generous provision of central bank liquidity and falling bond yields, to help stabilise the economy and financial system and promote investment. This, in turn, has supported risk assets and driven equity markets higher, so with consensus expecting interest rates to rise in the US and UK over the next 12 months, investors are questioning what impact this will have on risk appetite and equity market valuations.\nAt the same time, the better economic conditions that allow rates to rise from current levels should also support corporate profitability and growing dividends. The resulting tension between these two forces could lead to a greater degree of market volatility.\nIn a world of unusually low interest rates, a strategy that focuses on higher-yielding equities seems inherently attractive and so it is perhaps not surprising that such strategies have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, as we begin to anticipate a rise in interest rates – at least in the US and possibly also in the UK – it seemed important to investigate whether this might pose a threat to such strategies. On our analysis the evidence is far from conclusive that this need be a matter for concern.\nThere have only been three periods of rising US rates in the past 25 years. If we allow that the period of the tech bubble was exceptional, it seems that rising rates need not pose much of a headwind at all for higher-yielding global stocks. Research that has looked at the US since 1972 reaches a similar conclusion: in most instances, higher-yielding stocks actually outperformed in the 12 months following the first rate rise.\nFurthermore, it should be remembered that through virtually all the back-test period, dividend yields have been well below those of bond yields because of the growth equities offered. Global bond yields would have to rise quite some way to restore that relationship.\nIt is also worth noting that with very little sign of inflation, and global economic growth forecasts remaining vulnerable, the assumption that US interest rates will start rising in the near term may once again prove to be premature. Against a backdrop of weak growth and high debt, real rates are unlikely to rise very far or very fast.\nA less benign monetary background is, however, likely to lead to a more volatile environment for all assets. Investec's Global Endurance Equity Strategy was conceived as a way of exploiting our analysis that suggested higher-yielding equities deliver superior long-term returns over time and provide some downside protection in difficult markets.\n Our more recent work suggests that rising rates need not overwhelm these attractive characteristics. In the more turbulent markets that a normalisation of interest rates might produce, it could continue to prove its merits.\nChristine Baalham is a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:26:33.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
