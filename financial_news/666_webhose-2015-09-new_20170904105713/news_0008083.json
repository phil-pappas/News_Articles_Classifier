Calif., Silicon Valley, United States Macate Group Corporation (Macate), developers of software programs and mobile technology, announces the release of CyPeers™ Mail mobile app, with customer friendly security tools. In recent months, data security breaches have affected major retailers, government employees and even celebrities - who have had their personal accounts hacked. Now, Android® and iPhone® users have a new way to keep highly confidential e-mails safe during transmission. “There are a lot of public employees, private citizens and small businesses who have concerns about guarding their e-mail confidentiality. This app will help subscribers apply a sophisticated level of security to their information without needing technical skills,” says Isaac Daniel - CEO of Macate Group Corp. The CyPeers™ Mail app provides military level email encryption. It protects e-mails and attachments from data breaches and access by unauthorized persons and devices. The revolutionary app was released by Macate’s Innovation Research and Development (IRAD) Center located in Miramar, Florida. Easy to Use, Patent-Pending e-Envelope Design The app is powered by Macate’s SEMPostmark® technology. It uses a unique patent-pending digital envelope which requires senders to simply ‘click’ - to seal, stamp and send their message to the intended recipient. The e-mail now becomes a legally protected document. By “breaking the seal” to open the digital envelope, it demonstrates that someone has intentionally accessed the secured communication. “The Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides that a person who intentionally accesses an electronic communication without authorization, while in transit or storage, may be liable for criminal or civil penalties. The app is uniquely designed to specifically aid in the prosecution of unauthorized access,” said Alberto Interian, Legal Counsel for Macate Group Corp. Works with Popular E-mail Platforms CyPeers™ Mail integrates seamlessly with popular email platforms like G-Mail® and Yahoo® among others and is available for free download on Google Play ® or the App Store® .
