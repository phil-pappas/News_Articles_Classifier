The system will allow large international companies doing business with China to settle payments faster. \nAmong the first batch of banks qualified to participate are 11 Chinese banks and eight Chinese branches of foreign banks, including HSBC, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) PLC, the sources said. \nThe launch of CIPS will remove one of the biggest hurdles to internationalising the yuan, and should greatly increase global use of the currency by cutting transaction costs and processing times. \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters. \n(Reporting by Zhao Hongmei and Nick Heath; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:16:30.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
