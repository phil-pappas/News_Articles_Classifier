The US took back the crown as the chief recipient of German cars, machines, technology and appliances, which it had last held in 1959.\nBut Joerg Zeuner, the chief economist of the German government-owned development bank KfW, said that in no way do the latest statistics mean that the Americans will continue to outbuy the French. He said the development in the first half of the year was brought about by the higher economic growth that the US is enjoying in comparison to France and the weaker euro, which makes goods produced in the eurozone cheaper in other regions. German exports to the US rose to 56 billion euros ($A87.48 billion) in the first half of this year from 45 billion euros in the first half of last year, the Wiesbaden-based Statistical Office said. That total outdid France's 53.5 billion euros, up from 51.6 billion euros in the first six months of 2014. Differences between economic growth on either side of the Atlantic could encourage the trend. The International Monetary Fund has forecast the US economy will grow 2.5 per cent this year and 3.00 per cent next year while the eurozone is to see 1.5- and 1.7-per-cent expansions. France, however, sold more of its products to Germany than the US did and, therefore, had a better trade balance with its neighbour across the Rhine. Germany's other biggest trading partners are the Netherlands in third place and China in fourth. German exports are seeing their biggest growth in four years, rising 7.00 per cent year-on-year in the first six months of 2015 to 595.3 billion euros.
