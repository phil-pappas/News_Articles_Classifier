The KMIII Airport, formally known as Sikhuphe, was built on the instructions of the King, without benefit of a needs analysis. It has proved to be a disaster since it was formally opened in March 2014. Only one airline uses the airport, and that is partly owned by Swaziland. \nNo other commercial airline has publicly said it is interested in using the airport. \nDlamini in his interview with the Observer also said the new seaport would be superior to ports in both Maputo in Mozambique and Durban in South Africa. The initial announcement said the Swaziland port would be capable of handling four ships at a time. \nDlamini was reported by the Observer saying, 'The problem with the Maputo and Durban ports is their shallowness. These two ports are not deep enough to handle heavy ships and we have received reports that there are ships that face difficulty docking in these ports because they are not deep enough,' he said. \nDlamini added, 'The proposal for our seaport shows that it will be very deep and this would enable bigger ships that cannot dock in both Maputo and Durban to come here. The seaport that we will have will be of first world status and will have better facilities compared to Maputo and Durban. The deeper the seaport the better and ours will be better than Maputo and Durban.'
