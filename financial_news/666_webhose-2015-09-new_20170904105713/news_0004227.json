Bloomberg by Dani Burger Two of the bull market's biggest cheerleaders are reining in their enthusiasm as US stocks head back to their lows from an August selloff.\nRBC Capital Markets's Jonathan Golub and Canaccord Genuity Securities's Tony Dwyer, who were among 21 strategists with the highest year-end forecasts for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, cut their estimates by as much as 9.7 per cent. The two add to a chorus of souring sentiment amid concerns over global growth and selloffs in commodities and biotechnology companies.\nA total of eight strategists surveyed by Bloomberg have sliced their year-end forecasts for the benchmark since August 10. Strategists now predict the S&P 500 will reach 2176 at the end of 2015, down from an average estimate of 2233 in early August, a 2.6 per cent decline.\nWhile that still suggests a 16 per cent gain from now until the end of the year, it may be a high hurdle as stocks struggle to regain ground after the first correction in almost four years. Equities are also about to enter an earnings season in which profits are forecast to drop 6.5 per cent.\n\"Commodity weakness (oil) and slower global growth have pressured corporate earnings in 2015,\" Golub wrote in a Monday note. \"Our constructive outlook is predicated upon our belief that economic activity will remain slower for longer, resulting in an extended business cycle.\"\nHe estimates S&P 500 companies will report earnings per share of $US120 for the year, down from his previous forecast of $US125. He lowered his S&P 500 price target to 2100 from 2325.\nAfter years of resilience from US companies, cuts to profit estimates outnumber increases by the most in three years, based on an index tracking the changes compiled by Citigroup.\nAnalysts estimate earnings for S&P 500 members to be flat in 2015 - the benchmark's worst performance since 2008 - before an estimated rebound of 9.4 per cent in 2016. That's largely driven by declining oil amid a 27 per cent slide in a Bloomberg index of commodities over the past 12 months.\n As uncertainty over Federal Reserve interest-rate policy and deteriorating corporate credit weigh on investor sentiment, expectations are for the S&P 500 to retest its August lows, according to Dwyer. He considers the August 24-25 selloff to qualify as a crash. Since 1970, all 14 crashes in the S&P 500 have resulted in a retest of the lows, he wrote in a Monday note.\nIf that scenario plays out this time, Dwyer sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 2150, below his previous forecast of 2340.\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 2.6 per cent to 1881.77 on Monday, as commodity prices and biotechnology companies continued a selloff and small-cap stocks slid. The S&P 500 has fallen 8.8 per cent this quarter, its worst performance since 2011. The benchmark index reached an all-time high of 2130.82 in May and has since fallen 12 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:04:34.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
