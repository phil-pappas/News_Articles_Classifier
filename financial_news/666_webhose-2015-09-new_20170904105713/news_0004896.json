The new phase of the campaign features a charity drive in support of the local chapter of Ronald McDonald House, which serves the families of hospitalized children.\nWaukesha, WI (PRWEB) September 24, 2015\nScott Campbell Agency introduces a new charity campaign as part of its established Community Program in Waukesha, WI, and directs their efforts to raise funds for the local Milwaukee chapter of Ronald McDonald House. Ronald McDonald House supports the families of children around the world who are hospitalized with serious injuries and illnesses. Enabling parents and siblings to be housed in peaceful, safe locations close to children receiving treatment enables families to stay together and support each other during stressful hospital stays. Keeping families together raises spirits and enables parents to communicate more effectively with their kids’ medical teams. Donations are now being accepted through the campaign’s page at https://www.crowdrise.com/supportingfamiliesin1/fundraiser/scottcampbellagency\n“Being in the hospital is frightening enough for anyone, but most especially when you’re dealing with children,” said Scott Campbell, the Agency’s principal. “The peace of mind these families find with Ronald McDonald House is priceless. We feel privileged to do anything we can to help.”\nThrough the agency’s network of customers, business partners, friends, family, and staff, the initiative to spread the word about the current campaign for Ronald McDonald House will hopefully bring greater awareness and support for this deeply worthy organization. Scott Campbell Agency will employ its valuable resources and reach out to the community in order to reach their fundraising goal of $500. The campaign will be promoted over the course of the next 30-90 days through the agency’s social media channels, email and text message communications, as well as through their monthly magazine, delivered to thousands of households in the greater Waukesha area, where the agency currently operates. Our Hometown magazine reserves a full page to feature the campaign and all its details. The electronic Flipbook version of the current issue may be accessed here: http://www.scottcampbellinsurance.com/Our-Hometown-Magazine_48 .\nThose with a desire to help better the community and bring awareness to important local causes are encouraged to visit https://www.crowdrise.com/supportingfamiliesin1/fundraiser/scottcampbellagency and also to share the page with friends and family. The agency will acknowledge those who contribute to the cause in their monthly magazine.\nThe Community Program initiated by Scott Campbell Agency will continue to highlight and support people in need in the local community. A new campaign will be launched every 30-60 days, in collaboration with local non-profits and community members. Through the agency’s website, people may now submit information on groups, families or individuals who would benefit from assistance: http://www.scottcampbellinsurance.com/Add-Community-Cause_51 .
