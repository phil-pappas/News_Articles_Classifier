However, Hong Kong continued to drop, shedding 0.44 percent. \nTokyo tumbled 2.34 percent by lunch as trading began for the first time since Friday owing to a three-day public holiday. \n\"Japanese markets have still got some catch up to do after the uncertainty that?s been washing through global markets,\" Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities in Sydney, said. \n\"The issue is gauging the extent of the slowdown in China and the ongoing debate about whether the Fed is doing the right thing\" on when to raise interest rates. \n- VW scandal hits cars - \nAutomakers were among the big losers on Japan's Nikkei as the industry is rocked by the Volkswagen emissions scandal. \nToyota fell 1.44 percent while Honda plunged 3.21 percent and Nissan was off 1.40 percent by the break. \nGerman giant Volkswagen has lost a third of its value this week in Frankfurt after it emerged it had installed in as many as 11 million diesel cars software capable of fooling official pollution tests. \n\"We expect the market to consider the situation to be a risk factor for Japanese carmakers as well,\" said Heo Pil Seok at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. \nAttention will now turn to Yellen's speech later in the day, her first since last Thursday when she warned about the troubles in overseas markets. \nDealers will be looking to see if she sheds any more light on when the bank will lift borrowing costs, with some economists saying a lack of clarity is worse for global markets than an actual hike. \nWhile the dollar initially retreated after the decision, it has risen this week against most emerging currencies after three Fed regional presidents argued for a liftoff by 2016 saying the US economy was strong enough. \nAnd it extended those gains in Asia Thursday. The Australian dollar was 0.05 percent lower, the South Korean won eased 0.11 percent, Indonesia's rupiah lost 0.19 percent and Malaysia's ringgit sank almost one percent. \nEconomists expect a rise in interest rates would likely see a flight of cash from emerging economies as investors look for better and safer returns in the United States. \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this story --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:34:52.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
