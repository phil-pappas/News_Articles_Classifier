However, Hong Kong was up 0.62 percent and Sydney rose 0.31 percent. \nBeijing also Sunday unveiled a broad set of reform guidelines to partly privatise its vast state-owned companies aimed at making them more competitive overseas and increasing transparency. \nThe move comes after leaders in 2013 said they wanted the market to play a greater role in the economy, easing government influence on key sectors such as transport, energy production and arms manufacturing. \nAmong the reported changes are efforts to modernise SOEs (state-owned enterprises), improve management of state assets and diversify their ownership structures through \"mixed ownership\" -- or the introduction of \"multiple types of investors\" -- ultimately meaning more private shareholders or capital. \nHowever, the main focus this week is on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, with hopes it will hold off hiking borrowing costs until later in the year. \nThe central bank is expected to announce a lift-off before 2016 but its decision has been muddied by the latest bout of volatility to hit global markets caused by concerns about China's economy and after Beijing announced a shock devaluation of its yuan last month. \n\"Trading will remain volatile ahead of the (Fed policy) meeting,\" Bernard Aw, a strategist at IG Asia in Singapore, told Bloomberg News. \n\"Sunday's data reinforced concerns about China's economy slowing down. Investors may expect more stimulus in the pipeline, which could provide some support to Chinese equities.\" \nUS dealers ended last week on a high. The Dow jumped 2.05 percent, the S&P 500 climbed 2.07 percent and the Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) rallied 2.96 percent. \nWhile traders remain wary of any shocks to the financial system they were confident enough to look for riskier investments. \nThe dollar edged up to 120.68 yen from 120.57 yen Friday in New York, while the euro was at 136.95 yen against 136.64 yen. The yen is regarded as a safe bet in times of crisis and turmoil. \nThe single currency also ticked up to $1.1349 from $1.1333. \nHigher yielding emerging market currencies also advanced against the dollar. The South Korean won added 0.36 percent, while the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesia's rupiah were marginally higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:03:47.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
