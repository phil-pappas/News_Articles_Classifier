It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was just the latest sharp downward move in a dramatic decline; the shares have fallen more than 96pc from their peak in February 2014, when the company was talking up its chances of becoming a rare British technology power on the global stage . \nAt £61m, the company is now worth less than the dwindling cash pile that new chief executive Lee Cameron will rely on as he tries to make it profitable. \nMr Cameron was promoted from chief operating officer after Ms Buse resigned late on Tuesday. \nHe said: “I’ve been with the business a long time. It’s not like I have been dropped into a new job with no training. It feels like a seamless transition rather than a jolt.” \nThe sudden leadership change came as a jolt to investors, who had been braced for poor financial results but not Ms Buse’s departure, due to what Monitise (EUREX: MOTF.EX - news ) said was “her desire for personal reasons to return to the United States”. The pre-tax losses were also much larger than analysts expected as Monitise wrote down the value of some of its technology and business relationships by £129m. \nMs Buse, a former Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) executive, became sole chief executive in March, after previously sharing the job for less than a year with Monitise’s founder, Alastair Lukies. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) said she was leaving “confident that Monitise is now better positioned for profitability and future growth”. \nThe company is attempting to shift its business model away from software licences and bespoke services for banks and payments companies. Instead it is trying to sell internet-based subscription mobile payment services, in line with trends in the technology industry. \nMonitise’s chairman, Peter Ayliffe, admitted the shift was “slower and more challenging than expected”. To date two customers have signed up and Mr Cameron said neither has so far rolled out the technology. \nHe added: “We’re really in the nascent stages of getting deal signatures.” \nAnalysts at Cannacord Genuity, the AIM-listed company’s in-house broker, said: “The primary driver of long-term profitability remains uncertain, in our view. \n“We still have limited commercial evidence of market demand for the company’s new cloud-based product.” \nDoubts about Monitise’s prospects have increased as the banks and payments providers shifted their own strategies to take account of the arrival in the industry of consumer technology giants such as Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) and Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) . Visa, which had been a key partner, dealt a heavy blow by selling its stake in the British company last year, followed by Visa Europe this July . \nThe company’s heavy losses came alongside a 6pc decline in sales to £89.7m. Monitise flagged up the decline in July, its latest revenue warning in a run of four. \nAs it revealed the full extent of its problems, it said its cash reserves had been eroded from £146m a year ago to £88.8m, as operating costs, which nearly tripled to £170m, were not matched by revenues. \nMonitise sought to calm potential fears over the burn rate by saying it expects its cash position to remain above £45m throughout its new financial year. Mr Cameron said he would maintain a focus on cost cutting by reducing staff numbers and technology spending. \nMr Cameron, a lawyer by profession, has been with Monitise since before it was spun off from the banking technology provider Morse in 2006. He said he does not intend to change the plans set out by Ms Buse following a strategic review earlier this year. \nAs well as recommending a major overhaul of Monitise’s business plan, investment bankers explored whether the company could be sold and gathered expressions of interest from multiple parties. The board did not pursue talks, saying that the expressions of interest were too vague or too complicated. \nAsked whether shareholders would have been better served by a deal, Mr Cameron said on Wednesday that “I don’t have a time machine”, and argued the distraction of takeover talks could have done even more harm to the business as it attempted major operating changes. \nThe new chief executive said the only way Monitise could rebuild the trust of investors would be by successfully implementing its subscription strategy. \n“Clearly confidence has been knocked severely,” he said. “[The share price] doesn’t look good on screen today but frankly it is one indicator and my job is to turn the business around.” \nMonitise’s deepening woes are likely to further damage City confidence in Britain’s small clutch of public technology companies. Investors have also been stung in recent months by failures and missed targets at the advertising technology companies Blinkx (Other OTC: BLNKF - news ) and Matomy, as well as the online work market Blur Group . \nPartly as a result of the consequent City investor caution around the sector, the private owners of successful UK technology businesses are now often turning to the Nasdaq or American trade buyers rather than the domestic public market. The London Stock Exchange’s High Growth Segment, created more than two years ago in an attempt to address the lack of technology flotations, has attracted only one member .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:00:10.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
