The getting approvals of major projects through and then managing them, I think that's where the major bureaucratic heartache is going to be.\"\nThe Royal Australian Air Force is taking part in the U.S.-led coalition campaign against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Australian troops are also helping to train Iraqi ground forces.\nIn August Abbott announced that two naval shipbuilding programmes, the A$20 billion SEA5000 Future Frigate project and the SEA1180 Offshore Patrol Vessels, would be brought forward to guarantee the continuous domestic construction of surface warships.\nBut the jewel in Australia's defence crown is the SEA1000 Future Submarine project, one of the world's most lucrative defence contracts and a thorny political topic.\nAbbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe enjoyed a close relationship that saw Japan emerge as the early front runner for the programme, and his removal is seen as a setback for their bid.\nJapan's reluctance to commit to building the submarines entirely in Australia, where manufacturing jobs are a hot political topic, has seen it lose ground to German and French proposals.\nPayne joins a small number of woman defence ministers around the world and becomes the first to fill the role in an English speaking nation. Germany, Norway and the Netherlands all have female defence ministers.
