The second train will take all the gas from TEN and Jubilee.” \nAccording to Dr. Yankey, Ghana Gas is expecting the new train which when added to the existing infrastructure, will give the company a total capacity of 350 million standard cubic feet of gas per day. \n“Ghana Gas is currently working on the second ‘train’ which will be ready before the TEN gas becomes available. So we are also preparing ourselves to be able to take the extra gas and process it,” Dr. Yankey stressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:53:51.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
