Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nIf you use web connected devices, you need to learn how to protect them. If a cyber criminal gains access to one of these devices you are at serious risk for identity theft and other threats. Being aware of the new ways criminals can hack into your life will not only save you money but your identity. Following is an overview of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's recent list of devices that you would never think would be the target of a cyber attack. Unfortunately, whenever you connect to the internet your device is a target. If you are using your computer, you most likely have virus and firewall protection, but if you recently bought a security camera or smart appliance you may need to secure them before you continue going about your daily life. When it comes to identity theft, hackers are always looking for new ways to get their hands on your information, so before just hook up your new device and forget about it take the necessary steps to secure your property and identity. Heating Devices Tim Boyle/Getty Images Heating Devices \nHeating, ventilation and air conditioning units are designed to reduce energy use as well as maintain the best indoor temperature. Unfortunately this type of device needs to be connected to the internet so if its vulnerable and unsecured, criminals can gain access to your home or business network. If this happens, cyber criminals can obtain full ownership privileges to collect your personal information and even go so far as spying on you in order to gain information about your personal home and computer habits. Security Systems Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Security Systems \nWI-Fi cameras, garage door openers and video monitoring systems can all be targeted for attacks if the security on your device is weak or doesn't exist. Cyber criminals use these devices to exploit the Universal Plug and Play Protocol (UPnP). The problem with this system is that it connects to the internet each time without authentication so a hacker can use this vulnerability as a way to reconfigure it and run commands which allow them to gain full access to your personal or business information. Medical Devices Ethan Miller/Getty Images Medical Devices \nWireless medical devices such as wireless heart monitors, wireless insulin dispensers and wireless blood pressure monitors are also at risk to be hacked. Usually no one thinks to protect this type of device which is the reason why cyber criminals have targeted them according to the FBI. Since these devices have the capability to connect to the internet at long range this puts them at even higher risk to be hacked. If a cyber criminal is able to penetrate a medical device, they can not only steal your personal information, they can also change the settings, coding and may even be able control it themselves. Thermostats George Frey/Getty Images Thermostats \nThermostats which connect to the internet may be the last place you would suspect a cyber criminal to hack, but think again. According to the FBI, most people don't know they need to secure these devices. Unfortunately criminals use the security holes in them to gain access to other devices connected on the same network which puts you at risk for identity theft. Fitness devices Eric Thayer/Getty Images Fitness devices \nIf you just bought a fitness device like a smart watch, you may be able to monitor your heart rate, keep track of your steps and monitor you overall movements but if your device is unprotected this could make it an easy target to hack into. If a cyber criminal gains access through your fitness device they could steal all your information, send spam and malicious emails to try to infect all your devices on your network. Smart appliances Sean Gallup/Getty Images Smart appliances \nSo you bought a new smart appliance and now you can stay connected using your smart phone. You can now control your stove, your washer/dryer and even your refrigerator and you now have the convenience of knowing when things are ready. While it is nice to be able to have complete control of your appliances, you could be leaving the door wide open for a hacker to gain control of your entire home or office network. According to the FBI, these smart devices need to be secured just like your other devices. Lighting modules Jed Leicester/Getty Images Lighting modules \nYour house is set up with a full alarm system and automatic lights which go on each time a threat gets too close. You have these lights connected to your smart phone so you are able to control them no matter where you are. Unfortunately criminals can use this unsecured internet connection to gain access into all your accounts. The FBI says that email and spam attacks can be launched from home network routers which can ultimately be turned into channels used to control your entire network. Office equipment & Printers Ethan Miller/Getty Images Office equipment & Printers \nYou own a business and you currently have all your office equipment connected to your business network. The data shared on your printer is confidential so if a hacker manages to penetrate your office equipment, important sensitive information becomes compromised. A cyber criminal could also use this connection to send off a virus that could end up infecting your whole company. If you have other devices connected to your business network, the hacker could remotely control them which could end up costing you a huge amount of money. Entertainment devices Sean Gallup/Getty Images Entertainment devices \nIf you recently bought a device to remotely control your TV or your music player, the FBI says this device could also be subject to a cyber attack. Anytime this devices connects to the internet to bring your smartphone and TV together, you are at risk for identity theft. A hacker is only looking for a way in to your home network, so to keep yourself protected be sure to change the settings so no one can access your device without a password. Be sure to choose a password that is difficult to guess. Fuel monitoring systems Warren Little/Getty Images Fuel monitoring systems \nOne of the most dangerous devices vulnerable to hackers is the fuel monitoring system which is usually connected to the internet in order to monitor gas pumps. If a hacker is able to compromise a business' fuel monitoring system they could cause the pump to read the wrong levels which could then cause customers to overfill their gas tanks which could end up causing a fire. Hackers could also interfere with this system so customers are able to fuel up without paying. Protect all things Internet Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Protect all things Internet \nThe FBI recommends that you keep these 10 devices on their own network separately protected. You should also only buy these devices from makers who have a good record of keeping them secure. Make sure the password on your device is hard and not a name or important date so hackers won't have an easy time guessing it. You should also disable the UPnP on your router. If you have a loved one who owns a wireless medical device be sure to warn them about the risk they face. Ultimately when it comes to protecting yourself from identity theft and fraud it means you need to go the extra mile to make sure all your equipment is secured.
