His mental health is fragile. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) adds to the stress and strain these proceedings have put on him.\" \nIf the extradition is successful he will face 22 counts of fraud and commodity manipulation, carrying a maximum of 380 years in jail. \nMr Sarao was released on bail and is expected to return to his parents' modest semi-detached house near Heathrow Airport. \nThe conditions of his bail stipulate that he is unable to travel outside the M25 and restrict him from using the internet for financial purposes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:08:29.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
