More than 7,800 Subway Restaurants are contributing a total of $1,028,500 to their local communities through their \"You Share, We Share\" efforts,\" said Jack Luttrell, the North America Regional Director for the SUBWAY® restaurant chain. During You Share, We Share, weekend volunteering has had the potential to benefit local nonprofits in a number of ways. For every 1% increase in weekend sales in select regions across the U.S., SUBWAY® restaurants pledged to donate thousands of dollars to local nonprofits. When volunteers shared their weekends with SUBWAY® restaurants, SUBWAY® restaurants shared its profits with over 30 local organizations working on community improvement. \"Subway Restaurants have passionate franchisees with a history of giving back to their local communities. With the \"You Share, We Share\" program, they hand picked local non-profit organizations to join forces with, in an effort to raise money that would go back to making a difference in their community. And with the VolunteerMatch partnership, we helped Subway extend the program by connecting their customers with supplemental volunteer opportunities in their area. It's one common goal, to give where you live,\" said Bryan Christian, President, Proof Advertising. Community members were encouraged to find ways to give back through VolunteerMatch's award-winning online platform, which makes it easy to find local volunteer opportunities for both individuals and groups. \"Summer is a great opportunity for friends and family to get out and give back to their community,\" says Greg Baldwin, President of VolunteerMatch. \"Together, we hope to inspire more people to share their time and talent to make a difference\" For more details on You Share We Share, including a list of participating nonprofits, visit causes.volunteermatch.org/youshareweshare.   100,000+   \nA photo accompanying this release is available at: http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=35821 Stephanie Hong 415-321-3634", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T23:59:45.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
