Do you know how to write mobile code? Then you might have a bright future making ad-blocking mobile apps. At least during these early weeks since Apple’s new mobile software has set off a flurry of interest in ad blocking-- so much so that it’s spawned a cottage industry of more than a dozen companies , reports CMO Today. Since launching on Sept. 16, Purify’s $3.99 app has made $150,000. Considering that most of these apps are built by small teams of one or two people, you can bet we’ll see more software developers trying to make a similar quick buck. That can’t be good for publishers who rely on ad revenue from their mobile sites, or advertisers who want to reach mobile consumers. But that’s where this small industry takes a more ruthless turn, depending on your point of view, because companies like Eyeo GmbH let companies pay to make sure their ads aren’t blocked. One man’s opportunistic capitalism is another man’s extortion.\nNO E-SHOPPING: Isn’t this the year when mobile commerce is supposed to really break out, now that smartphone penetration is so vast? Well, not if you can’t actually see any products you want to buy on your phone. That could happen if mobile ad-blocking software takes off, reports Fortune. In fact, while the advertising and media world has been focused on what ad blocking does to the Web publishing economy, ad blockers like Crystal can completely mask product pages on the mobile versions of retail sites like Sears.com. Plus, ad blockers can potentially mess with all the data and back-end analytics that help retailers deliver better and more targeted products to shoppers, and ultimately sell more stuff.\nAD MESS: If it’s not ad blocking that’s got brands wary about digital advertising, it may be all that fraudulent Web traffic. Major advertisers like Heineken and Kellogg’s are questioning the efficacy of their digital ad spending after finding that huge chunks of their ads are being delivered to non-humans through all sorts of bogus means, including the use of computer-powered bots. Ad fraud has been a persistent issue for years, but as Bloomberg Businessweek reports, the problem is really starting to make marketers think twice. We’ve already seen at least one advertiser pull back on programmatic ad buying because of its lack of transparency, and it’ll be interesting to see if other brands follow suit. Ad giants Google and Facebook may be the ultimate beneficiaries because they theoretically promise marketers more direct relationships and control of where their ads run. But the irony is that both companies are knee-deep in ad tech themselves.\nNIELSEN EMPIRE: In an era where the very concept of tuning into watch TV is rapidly becoming an anachronism, here comes season 2 of “Empire.” This week’s premiere drew over 16 million live and same-day viewers , keeping it on pace with last season’s amazing breakout performance. Fox’s big ratings smash comes at a very welcome time, considering that the first few days of the new fall season had shown an alarming decline in overall live TV viewing and few promising freshman shows. So here’s a question: when will a dozen more “Empire” clones be on the air?\nElsewhere A new report finds that despite lower ratings and cord-cutting, most people say they find out about new TV shows from TV commercials [ CMO Today ]\nNetflix content is coming to Facebook’s soon-to-launch virtual reality device the Oculus Rift [ WSJ ]\nAd Age has released a report on which primetime TV shows command the highest ad prices [ Ad Age ]\n20th Century Fox Television is eyeing a reboot of the classic 1980s action show “The A-Team” [ The Hollywood Reporter ]\nLive video apps like Periscope have become a major drain on consumers’ mobile data plans [ WSJ ]\nMore marketers, including Hershey’s Ice Breakers mints, are selling their products via Amazon Dash, which lets people automatically reorder items with the click of a button in their homes [ Digiday ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "http://adage.com/article/media/ad-pricing-chart-sunday-night-football-empire-broadcasts-most-expensive-ad-buys/300516/", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/apple-ad-blocking-retailer-walmart/", "http://digiday.com/brands/brands-flock-amazon-dash-largely-remains-experiment/", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-brian-williams-ratings-msnbc-20150923-story.html", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/a-team-becomes-latest-tv-827015", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:34:07.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
