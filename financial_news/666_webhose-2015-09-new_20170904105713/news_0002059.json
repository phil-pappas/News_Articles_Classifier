In London, another perennial favorite among travelers, prices are down 7%, according to the Hotels.com report. And Paris, home of all things luxurious and glamorous, is witnessing a 16% drop in hotel prices. \nThere are a variety of reasons behind the price drops in cities such as New York, Paris and London. \n\"In New York, a number of new hotels have come on board, that were recently built, increasing the supply,\" continues Cole. \"The overall increase in hotels has meant that demand has changed slightly.\" \nAs for London and Paris, Cole attributes decreased costs to fluctuating currencies, noting that there are several international destinations now where luxury rooms can be had for less than $200. \nIn Pisa, Italy, for instance, travelers can find five-star hotel rooms for just $141, says Cole. In Warsaw, Poland, five-star hotel rooms are averaging just $130 per night, while in Delhi, India, luxury rooms are around $169. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:38:49.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
