EU court sets U.S. privacy pact ruling for Oct. 6 Reuters – 34 minutes ago View Photo \nA 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of the logo of the European Union in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on May … \nLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Court of Justice will deliver its ruling next Tuesday on a complaint about privacy on Facebook that has major implications for a data protection agreement between the EU and United States. \nJudgment in the case has been set for Oct. 6 at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT), a court spokesman said in a statement. \nLast week, the court's adviser said Austrian Max Schrems had a sound complaint against the Irish data protection agency, which oversees many tech firms in Europe, and said the 15-year-old Safe Harbour agreement by which EU states automatically recognise U.S. privacy standards should be regarded as invalid. \nOn Monday, the United States strongly criticised that advice from the advocate general, saying it was based on an inaccurate view of U.S. data security following Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations of data-gathering by U.S. intelligence agencies. \nIt urged the court, which normally follows such advice, to make a different ruling and said the end of Safe Harbour would damage trade and privacy on both sides of the Atlantic.. \n(Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T11:53:38.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
