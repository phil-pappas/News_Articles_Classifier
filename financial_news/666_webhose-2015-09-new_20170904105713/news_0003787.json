Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: India should have better bankruptcy laws for the banks to manage the ballooning non-performing asset (NPA) problem, said Bryan Marsal , co-founder and co-CEO of the turnaround firm Alvarez & Marsal. \"If you modify the bankruptcy law you would attract a different type of investor (coming to India). Not just the guy who is bottom fishing but somebody who can take a risk,\" said Marsal, who took over the role of Lehman Brothers' CEO after the bank filed for bankruptcy in 2008. He said the Indian regulators were on the right track and more investors, especially in the turnaround space would enter India if there is more clarity on regulations around bankruptcy. For some time the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been trying to form stronger regulations to keep NPAs under control. In December, last year RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had said that there is a category of promoters that is deliberately standing in the way of loan recovery, and that a strong message must be sent to them. To help banks recover bad loans, the RBI, in June this year, issued new norms for strategic debt restructuring that say that loan agreement should have an inbuilt clause giving banks the right to acquire 51% stake in the company if the promoter fails to meet the milestone set by banks while restructuring the loan. According to a report by rating company Icra, stress loans in the banking system at the end of March stood at Rs 14.8 lakh crore. \"India is a nation of laws but those laws historically have not been favorable for the companies coming in and investing due to issues like (filing for) bankruptcy in an expeditious way,\" said Marsal, who has been involved in many other major turnaround situations globally. \"In the US there may be some problems with the banking system, but the banks remain banks and they do not become de facto equity owners. The biggest private equity owners in India, in a way today are banks,\" said Marsal. He said that more teeth should be given to the banks so that they can take control of companies that are unable to service the debt. At a time when India is looking curiously at the world economy for cues there is also a concern that there could be a bubble building up in the global economy. However, Marsal is of the view that this time around the bubble is not exactly like it was in 2008. \"I don't see bubbles like in 2008 where leverage was at high multiples. But I do see that central banks around the world are pumping in money which has created a bubble and this time that bubble is in the stock markets,\" he said. He said central banks of some of the developed nations, including the US, could just increase the rates in the few months to come. He also hinted that the stock markets across the world could see some correction. Marsal co-founded A&M with Tony Alvarez in 1983 is now a more than Euro 1 billion turnaround and performance enhancement firm. In India A&M has been flexing its muscles to expand and has been involved in three main areas; turnaround, private equity and forensics. A&M has recently been involved with Housing.com and Jet Airways for performance enhancement.
