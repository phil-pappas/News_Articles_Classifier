Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Somewhere there's a focus group of voters whose response to the words \"China Australia Free Trade Agreement\" is to running screaming from the room lest they turn into exploding light bulbs under an onslaught of poorly qualified Chinese electricians.\nThat thing Australia signed with China only in June is already getting a makeover in the ratification process. Forget China-Australia FTA: it's now the much catchier China Export Agreement, after a vociferous union campaign warning of little job protection for Australians, as part of a tight by-election pitch for the WA seat of Canning in just over a week.\nOn Thursday, government ministers and MPs stopped referring to the free trade agreement and starting talking about a strange new beast called the Australia-China Export Agreement (or ACEA, if you must); an economic bonanza at risk from the union movement's \"racist\" advertising campaign featuring Aussie battlers trapped in exploding lightbulbs.\nIt had all the appearance of the famous May 17, 2007, Howard government missive that no one was to mention the words Work Choices anymore because the electorate hated it after a massively persuasive union campaign.\nGovernment types were left wondering why unemployment dropped to 6.2 per cent on Thursday. And the government's whole sensitivity is about jobs. The skittishness was evident on Thursday when the unemployment rate for August dropped from 6.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent to the tremendous surprise of a number of government types who had been preparing in a buttock-clenching fashion for a much worse number – as high as 6.5 per cent.\nThere were even speaking points ready: thanks to the government's tough love-dole program, almost 40,000 dole bludgers had been forced to \"get off the couch\" in July and were now actively looking for work.\nPotential headache avoided With a potential jobs headache successfully avoided and the Syrian refugee issue defused by Tony Abbott's sensible decision to grant 12,000 new permanent refugee places, the political debate moved back to a well-worn track of the China trade agreement and Labor's racism.\n With Abbott in Port Moresby for the Pacific Islands Forum, Nationals leader Warren Truss was in the prime minister's chair for the day and was the first to be asked about this ACEA not the unpopular old ChAFTA.\nTruss must not have got the memo about the rebranding for he ploughed on, spouting the deal's benefits – $100 billion of agriculture products going to China, 95 per cent of them tariff-free – as his sonorous tones acted with a sedative effect on Question Time.\nBut by the time the sixth or seventh Dorothy Dixer from a government MP had rolled past, the change in government terminology was obvious,\n\"A point of order,\" Labor's Tony Burke interjected.\n\"Ministers can only answer with respect to their own responsibility. There are ministers responsible for a free trade agreement but today we are hearing about this new thing, this export agreement.\"\nTrade minister Andrew Robb, who has now spent a large chunk of his life trying to clinch the deal, rose with ill-concealed rage to answer Labor taunts whether \"imports\" would be allowed under this new export agreement.\n\"Why are they carrying on in such a nonsensical way?\" Robb asked.\nPoor Robb. Earlier in the day even conservative broadcaster Alan Jones gave him earful for an failing to \"put the boot in\" into Labor and the CFMEU's campaign. Labor MPs could sense they'd got under his skin and amped up the volume of taunts as Robb tried to explain Australia's \"spectacular\" future if only we play our cards right.\n\"If you shut up, I'll tell you,\" he shouted.\n\"Goose,\" he added for good measure.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-09-10T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:53:52.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
