Ford is stepping up production to meet robust demand for its new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup, the company's most popular vehicle that accounts for almost half its earnings. \nItalian automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles's US unit, FCA US, said it had its best August sales in the United States since 2002 at 201,672 vehicles, an increase of 2.0 percent from a year ago, with the Jeep brand kicking in an 18 percent jump. \n- Foreign automakers skid - \nJapanese auto giant Toyota reported US sales dropped 8.8 percent to 224,381 units. Sales of signature gasoline-electric hybrid Prius dived 24.2 percent as low gasoline prices at the pump continued to prime demand for bigger gas-guzzlers. \nToyota's mid-sized pickup Tacoma and Highlander SUVs had their strongest monthly increase since 2003. The luxury Lexus brand had its best month ever, up 2.1 percent. \nHonda's August sales fell 6.9 percent to while Nissan reported an 0.8 percent decline. \nIn total, Asian automakers saw their sales fall 3.3 percent and their market share shrink to 46.6 percent from 48.0 percent. \nGerman auto giant Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) posted a 2.8 percent decline, but Volkswagen Group's premium unit Audi (Other OTC: AUDVF - news ) had its second-best sales month in the US, gearing up a 9.9 percent increase with 18,794 vehicles sold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:56:41.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
