The Chinese central bank has announced changes that will make it more expensive for investors to hedge against further drops in the Chinese yuan against the US dollar. Bloomberg Share on twitter by Karen Maley Australia's bubbly property market is likely to lose some of its heat after Beijing's latest move to clamp down on capital outflows from the world's second-largest economy.\nOn Tuesday, the People's Bank of China, announced changes that will make it more expensive for investors to hedge against further drops in the Chinese yuan against the US dollar.\nAt the same time, China's largest banks are stepping up their checks on large foreign-exchange conversions by corporate clients, while China's financial regulators are targeting illegal money-transfer agents who help wealthy Chinese transfer funds out of the country.\nThe pressure on Beijing to stem capital outflows has intensfied in the wake of Beijing's surprise move three weeks ago to devalue the yuan.\nThe prospect of further falls in the value of the yuan only encourages wealthy Chinese investors to send more of their savings offshore, which further exacerbates the downward pressure on the Chinese currency.\nAlready-affluent Chinese investors, worried by the oversupply problems in the Chinese property market, the country's volatile sharemarket and Beijing's crackdown on corruption, have been sending large amounts of money offshore .\nAs a result, China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to an estimated $US3.5 trillion ($5 trillion) from last year's peak of about $US4 trillion. And analysts believe the pace of capital outflows has increased after the devaluation of the yuan last month, which may have alone spurred the exit of as much as $US200 billion.\nBut heavy capital outflows put downward pressure on the yuan, and Beijing is clearly determined to stop the currency from falling too sharply. To stop this from happening, the Chinese authorities have been intervening heavily in foreign currency markets to prop up the yuan.\n There was always a risk, however, that Beijing would eventually decide that instead of running down foreign currency reserves to support the yuan, it would be easier to severely restrict capital outflows.\nBecause China doesn't have a completely open capital account, Chinese investors need Beijing's blessing to move funds offshore. Individuals are not allowed to move more than $US50,000 a year out of the country, whereas Chinese companies can move money offshore either to pay for imports or for approved foreign investments.\nInvestors, however, have been able to find a way around these regulations, either by getting friends or relatives to remit foreign currencies abroad or by inventing fake invoices that allow them to send more money offshore.\nThese are the practices that Beijing wants to stop. China's foreign exchange regulator has now sent a list of people with a track record of trying to evade the rules to the country's banks, and is threatening to punish and fine banks that turn a blind eye to such transactions.\nAnd Chinese officials are cracking down on underground banks that help Chinese nationals to shift money out of the country.\nOf course, there is always a question mark over how strenuously Beijing will crack down on illegal money transfers. After all, late last month China's official Xinhua new agency reported Vice Public Security Minister Meng Qingfeng, who is also involved in the probe into \"malicious\" short selling in Chinese share markets, as saying money-transfer agents remained \"rampant\" even though there had been repeated crackdowns on them.\nBut if Beijing is serious about tightening up on capital outflows â€“ and there are good reasons why it should take this matter seriously - then this will severely curtail the amount of money that wealthy Chinese are able to pour into property investments in Sydney and Melbourne.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-02T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:07:54.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
