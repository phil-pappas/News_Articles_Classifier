(AP) - Japan Tobacco is buying the non-U.S. assets of Reynolds American's Natural American Spirit for about $5 billion in cash.\nReynolds American Inc., the second-biggest tobacco company in the U.S., is the parent of Camel and Pall Mall cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds.\nThe deal doesn't include rights to the Natural American Spirit brand name and associated trademarks in the U.S., U.S. duty-free locations, U.S. territories or in U.S. military outlets, all which will be kept by Reynolds American subsidiary Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co.\nThe Japan Tobacco Group and Reynolds are looking to get the proper regulatory approvals by early next year, with the transaction closing after that.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
