T-bills worth $20 billion were on offer. This was $2 billion lower than the previous week.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio rose 4.50% from the previous week to 4x. In 2015 so far, the bid-to-cover ratio has averaged 4.1x. The ratio depicts the overall demand for the auction.\n\nYield analysis Treasury bills don’t pay a coupon. They’re offered at a discount to face value. They’re redeemable at par on maturity. The high discount rate for the September 14 auction came in at 0.260%. It fell from 0.275% in the previous week.\nMarket demand falls Fundamental market demand fell last week. Accepted indirect bids fell to 49.50% week-over-week from 52.50% in the previous week. Indirect bids are bids from the foreign central bank. They depict the international demand for the auction.\nMeanwhile, the percentage of direct bids fell to 2.30% week-over-week from 5.50% a week ago. Direct bids include bids from domestic money managers—for example, Wells Fargo (WFC) and State Street (STT).\nDue to lower market demand, the share of primary dealer bids rose to 48.20% of the auction from 42% in the previous week. Primary dealers are a group of 22 authorized broker-dealers. They’re obligated to bid at US Treasury auctions and take up excess supply. They include firms like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup Global Markets (C). A rise in the percentage of primary dealer bids indicates weak fundamental market demand.\nInvestment impact Mutual funds like the MFS Government Securities A (MFGSX) and the Prudential Government Income A (PGVAX) invest in T-bills.\nMFGSX provided a weekly return of 0.20% while PGVAX came in at 0.21%.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Treasury Yields Fell as the Interest Rates Stayed the Same Part 2 - High Yield Rose Due to the 10-Year TIPS Auction Part 3 - High Discount Rate Rose and Demand Fell for 52-week T-Bills Budget, Tax & Economy Bonds Treasury bills", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:51:26.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
