If the striking teachers are to expect to get a salary raise from money saved by depriving MPs of what they regard as their birth-right, then they have a long wait ahead. \nSALARY HARMONISATION \nBut let us be charitable and give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he meant what he said. It is not a constitutional issue and if MPs feel sufficiently philanthropic, they can legislate the matter of salaries into being quite easily. \nIn fact, the issue of the obscene salaries paid a clique of politicians and state officers deserves a lot of thought. \nThe sheer disparity between that clique and the majority of Kenyans in matters of remuneration is dire indeed, and may one day come to haunt us. \nIt is time salaries were really harmonised, and this should start from the top. \nThe disharmony afflicts government bureaucracy in all its manifestations, and explains why you cannot convince a teacher that there is no money to pay him when his superiors earn millions in salaries and numerous perks. \nOMNIBUS BILL \nIt is not fair, indeed, when you have the members of numerous constitutional commissions raking in a great deal of loot for doing work that is not absolutely essential to the running of this country. \nThere are too many commissions and too many lawyers running the affairs of this country. \nI have nothing against lawyers, but the 2010 Constitution seems to have been drafted with them in mind. Come to think of it, they themselves drafted the document. \nDid we need to bribe constitutional commissioners with fat paychecks to make them work? Can't we do with a lot fewer commissions and their members? \nThis is food for thought, although, on the other hand, I do not want to appear to be keen on taking food from anyone's plate. \nBut had Mr Namwamba been serious, he would not have created an omnibus Bill with far-reaching implications of a constitutional nature. He would have stuck to the salaries issue. \nOTHER SUGGESTIONS \nBut he also wants the number constitutional commissions reduced, which is a good thing, the number of constituencies, counties and wards reduced, which is another good thing. \nBut these good things would require a thorough overhaul of the Constitution, and being a lawyer, the MP must have realised that Kenyans will not wait for a referendum before they can seek ways to calm teachers down. \nI suggest that the Budalangi MP forgets about raising cantankerous motions, which have no chance of passing muster, maybe he should concentrate on seeking ways to save his constituents from the ravages of the looming El Niño.
