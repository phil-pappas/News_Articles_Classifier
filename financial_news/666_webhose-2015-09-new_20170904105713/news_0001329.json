Photo: Brendan Esposito\nForcing the country's biggest banks and businesses to pick up the bill for the cost of policing them risks creating a bloated and ineffective corporate regulator, warn those being asked to pay.\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveiled a plan on Friday to charge companies an annual levy, based on market capitalisation and an assessment of each sector's risk, to top up the funding shortfall required by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission .\nUnder the proposed charges a large listed company is likely to pay $538,000, a big investment bank pay $768,600 and a big bank will face a levy of up to $4 million.\n\"Whacking the biggest companies with the highest proportion of costs based on their size is a lazy way to go about it,\" Australian Institute of Company Directors chief executive John Brogden said.\nAdvertisement \"And it is no use having a cashed-up regulator if it allocates those funds inefficiently or if it targets inappropriate areas with its new resources.\"\nAustralian Financial Markets Association chief executive David Lynch said it was unfair to assume the biggest companies create the most need for regulation.\nThe plan to overhaul funding of the corporate watchdog to a \"user pays\" model comes in a response to a recommendation of last year's sweeping financial system inquiry, chaired by David Murray.\nASIC chairman Greg Medcraft has long campaigned for increased contributions from \"those that cause the need for regulation.\nBankers slam plan \"At first blush, the proposed increases in many of the fees and charges payable to ASIC are prodigious, and the link to how this will improve confidence in the market is unclear,\" CPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley said.\nThe Australian Bankers' Association has also slammed the plan.\n\"It could lead to ASIC showing less constraint on increases in the cost of regulation because it would be less visible to government,\"ABA director of policy Tony Pearson said.\nThe Financial Services Council linked its support for a user pays model to limits being set on what industry contributions could fund, warning against industry contributions being used to fund policy development or education campaigns.\n\"ASIC needs to focus on its role as a corporate regulator to enforce the existing laws,\" FSC chief executive Sally Loane said.\nNational Australia Bank took a different line.\n\"NAB believes the alternative funding model proposed in the financial services inquiry report is an opportunity to broaden ASIC's operational efficiencies,\" a spokesperson from the bank said.\nThe Business Council of Australia said it planned to consult with members before commenting on the proposal.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/policy/big-business-will-have-to-pay-for-asic-20150827-gj8xvf"], "published": "2015-08-31T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:11:00.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
