The Federal Open Market Committee announced it would keep rates at 0.25% overnight. The move came as concerns over China's economic slowdown has weighed on international markets. \n\"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\" the Fed said in a statement. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen said in light of heightened uncertainty abroad the Fed decided to wait for a rate hike. An interest rate hike in future will depend on a wide range of economic and financial indicators, she added. \nHowever, Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker voted in favour of raising the key rate by 0.25 percentage point. \n\"In reality the decision to hold rates shouldn't really have been in doubt given the tepid wage growth and declining inflation, yet the fact that we only got one dissenter in the form of Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Richmond Fed suggests that there was probably a certain degree of unanimity,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets . \nChris Williamson, chief economist at Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) , said the Fed's decision may be seen by many as appropriate in the wake of slowing growth in China but \"this is likely to be merely a temporary forestalling of the inevitable\". \nHe said \"the lack of action leaves lingering uncertainty about the outlook for US policymaking, which will no doubt fuel further volatility in the markets\". \n\"Speculation will now shift to December as the next most likely month for US rates to start rising.\" Japan's finance minister Taro Aso said the Fed's decision reflected lobbying by emerging economies. Aso said the US central bank should raise interest rates slowly in the future to avoid the risk of sparking capital flight. \n\"A lot of countries would face depreciation of their own currencies if the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . raises rates rapidly just because of improvements in its own economy, which would cause a reversal of capital back to the US,\" he said. \nOn the company front, Ryanair descended as the Civil Aviation Authority began enforcement action against the airline over flight disruptions following a judgement from the European court of justice. \nPetra Diamonds (LSE: PDL.L - news ) declined after saying full-year revenues dropped 10% to $425m on the back of lower diamond prices, as expected. \nPace (Other OTC: PCMXF - news ) advanced as it said its recommended combination with Arris Group (NasdaqGS: ARRS - news ) continues to progress in line with expectations but reported that revenue is likely to be lower than previously guided. \nMiners Randgold Resource and Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) were top risers as the price of gold and silver rose. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) slumped after the Investment Association and the National Association of Pension Funds criticised the commodities group for not considering all the company's shareholders equally when it issued $2.5bn worth of new shares to cut net debt. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,050.75 -0.31% FTSE 100 6,119.77 -1.09% FTSE 250 16,972.43 -0.42% FTSE 100 - Risers Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 616.50p +4.49% Randgold Resources Ltd.
