The data, due at 8:15 a.m. ET (1215 GMT), will provide a snapshot of the labor market ahead of Friday's critical non-farm payrolls data.\n* Friday's job numbers is the last monthly employment report before the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Sept. 16-17, when an announcement on interest rates is widely expected.\n* The U.S. central bank has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy, with a key focus on labor and inflation.\n* But the acute market volatility in the last few days has prompted investors to scale back bets that the Fed will delay raising rates as early as this month.\n* Wall Street closed sharply lower on Tuesday, with renewed concerns about China's economy pushing major indexes down almost 3 percent and intensifying fears of a long-term selloff.\n* Chinese stocks on Wednesday bounced off from steep losses and ended almost flat as fresh supportive measures from brokerages eased investor fears that Beijing may be intensifying a crackdown on illegal margin financing.\n* Many Chinese brokerages pledged additional funds to buy shares, answering government calls to support the stock market.\n* U.S. factory orders data is expected at 10 a.m. ET. New orders for manufactured goods are expected to have increased 0.9 percent in July after rising 1.8 percent in June.\n* Ambarella's shares were down 11.5 percent at $79.35 premarket after the maker of chips for wearable and action cameras gave a third-quarter revenue forecast that largely fell short of estimates.\n** GoPro, Ambarella's key customer, was down 6.2 percent at $41.\nFutures snapshot at 7:05 a.m. ET:\n* S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.5 points, or 0.55 percent, with 274,916 contracts traded.\n* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 22.75 points, or 0.55 percent, on volume of 43,978 contracts.\n* Dow e-minis were up 91 points, or 0.57 percent, with 49,875 contracts changing hands.
