Monetary Policy Committee member Martin Weale said an increase in rates would give the central bank leg room to make cuts in the event of another financial crash. \n\"With wage growth remaining firm, the tightening labour market means that inflation is likely to rise above target in two to three years' time,\" Weale wrote in an article for The Scotland on Sunday newspaper. \n\"Policy needs to be set with reference to this, rather than the current rate of inflation. As a result, it seems likely to me that the Bank Rate will need to rise relatively soon.\" Meanwhile, China was in focus after reports on industrial production and retail sales. Industrial production rose 6.1% in August compared to a year ago, falling short of analysts' expectations for a 6.5% increase and following the previous month's 6% gain. Retail sales climbed 10.8% in August, more than the forecast for a 10.6% rise and a 10.5% jump a month ago. \nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets , said the latest Chinese data over the weekend has fuelled concerns about the slowdown in the world's second largest economy. \n\"With investors still unsure about what is going on with respect to the Chinese economy after last week's much weaker than expected inflation data, there is still an expectation that Chinese authorities will have to take further steps to ease monetary policy further in the coming weeks, and it is this, along with a weaker Chinese currency, that is fuelling concerns that we could see China export further deflationary price pressures into the global economy in the coming months,\" he said. \nOn the company front, the Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) advanced following reports the lender hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to prepare a spin-off of its Williams & Glyn-branded retail branches in the second half of 2016. \nTrinity Mirror (LSE: TNI.L - news ) slumped after saying it was in talks to buy out the shares it does not already own in rival Local World Holdings Ltd. \nFastjet (LSE: FJET.L - news ) declined as it named Colin Child as non-executive chairman with effect from Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 1. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) edged higher as it completed the sale of its copper business, Anglo American Norte SA, to an investor consortium led by Audley Capital Advisors LLP, with Orion Mine Finance as the principal co-investor. \nChemring Group (Other OTC: CMGMF - news ) rose as the protection solutions provider reiterated full-year expectations after reporting a sharp rise in revenue. \nShire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) climbed as the pharmaceutical company is reportedly mulling options to sweeten its multi-billion dollar, all-stock offer for US biotechnology group Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) by putting cash into shareholders' hands sooner. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,099.04 +0.78% FTSE 100 6,174.53 +0.93% FTSE 250 17,041.02 +0.43% FTSE 100 - Risers ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 966.00p +3.43% Coca-Cola HBC AG (CDI) (CCH) 1,376.00p +2.38% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL.) 1,194.00p +2.23% BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (BLT) 1,081.00p +2.22% St James's Place (STJ) 891.50p +2.06% Anglo American (AAL) 732.60p +1.98% Randgold Resources Ltd.
