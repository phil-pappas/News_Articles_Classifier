Myer will buy 25 percent of Arcadia Group Ltd.’s Australian Topshop chain and look to reduce the total area of its store network by as much as 20 percent, according to regulatory statements Tuesday.\n“Management has been actively addressing the underlying issues in the business,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Umbers said in a statement. The changes will “return the business to sustainable profit growth”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:44:35.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
