Employees are then on hand to load groceries into your car in a designated parking area for the pick-up service. EVP and Chief Operating Officer of Walmart Global eCommerce Michael Bender touted the service as having “the convenience of a personal trained shopper.”\n\n\n\nBender continues, “We’re excited to make this new option available to even more of our customers, and to use our existing assets in a way that offers not only convenience, but another great way to save.” Walmart plans to add more stores in other markets soon.\n\n\n\nOnline grocery shopping and delivery is a booming industry, one in which Walmart is smart to aggressively stake a claim in. It’s worth $10.9 billion, and is expected to grow 9.6 percent annually through 2019, according to a report by market research firm IbisWorld.\n\n\n\nThe retail giant has one important thing going for them, the one thing that Amazon, arguably Walmart’s biggest competitor in this arena, does not have: a brick-and-mortar foundation that allows customers to shop and pick-up at a store. If this venture is successful for Walmart, the company could very well see their slumping sales turn around.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
