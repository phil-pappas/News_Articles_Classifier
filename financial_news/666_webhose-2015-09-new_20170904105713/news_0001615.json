A recent wave of mergers and acquisitions involving logistics and transportation firms is likely to accelerate in the next year, a new survey from Penske Logistics finds. The WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that executives in the survey see more companies buying rivals or putting themselves on the block as a defensive maneuver , following big deals by XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics , ECHO -3.15 % United Parcel Service UPS -1.51 % and others. Shippers increasingly want logistics companies to provide a full range of services and transportation options, forcing specialized firms to partner up. It’s changing the shape of a business that has long been fragmented but it raises the pressure on companies involved in the spate of deals to pull off the transition without alienating customers. Another threat: investors have been punishing companies that use takeovers to fuel growth, including XPO, reports the WSJ’s Liz Hoffman.\nThe bill is coming due for emerging-market companies , and many are finding they aren’t able to pay. The WSJ’s Julie Wernau reports that companies in Brazil’s sprawling sugar industry are missing bond payments and entering bankruptcy as plunging local currencies and commodities prices leave them unable to pay back money borrowed during better times. The weak Brazilian real and rock-bottom sugar prices make the industry’s problems particularly severe, but it’s a problem in many developing economies. The coming wave of defaults poses a risk to supply chain managers, who must consider whether they can depend on suppliers in far-flung markets for raw materials or components.\nIt seems like a no-brainer: marine shipping rates are in the gutter because too many ships are on the water, so sell the extra ones for scrap. But ailing shipping lines are unlikely to find much salvation in demolition , Drewry Maritime Research says in a new report. For one, the value of a ship to scrap dealers isn’t what it was before steel prices tumbled to multi-year lows, writes the WSJ Logistics Report’s Robbie Whelan. And the ships most likely destined for the scrap heap tend to be on the small side—less than 6,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. That won’t do much to reduce capacity on the busiest routes, where megaships capable of carrying up to 20,000 TEUs are driving down rates. Shipping lines put in orders for those giants before the capacity glut fully took shape and are unlikely to write off those investments now.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES ENLARGE Once consolidation begins, says Northeastern University Professor Robert Lieb, “a little bit of a domino theory kicks in.” Photo: Bloomberg News The Volkswagen AG VLKAY -6.66 % emissions scandal is sending a cloud over the automobile supply chain. The WSJ’s Jeff Bennett reports that auto-parts makers in the diesel-car market are racing to salvage the technology’s reputation amid suggestions that the consumers and other auto makers may turn their attention to other types of vehicles. That may mean a shift toward hybrids and electric-powered vehicles—autos with engines that run on different kinds of parts supplied by a range of different companies. Shares of some parts makers were pummeled last week following the Environmental Protection Agency’s disclosure that VW cheated for years on emissions tests of its diesel-powered cars. For now, at least, it appears that predictions that diesel-powered cars would take a bigger share of the American market won’t be borne out anytime soon.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Brazil relied too much on commodities.
