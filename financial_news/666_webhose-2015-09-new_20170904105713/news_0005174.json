Photo: Angus Mordant\nOne in three women make the majority of financial decisions in Australian households and women stand to inherit $2.4 trillion in assets over the next 30 years, but financial services companies are still failing to meet their needs.\nThat is the finding of research from ING Direct, which noted a stark \"misalignment\" between women's needs, what's on offer by finance companies and the manner in which women wish to be served.\nMore than 90 per cent of women are the main or joint decision-maker when it comes to household finances, while 84 per cent will happily put their hand up to take charge. Only 1 per cent make zero contribution to financial decisions and defer to their male partners, the Women and Finance report found.\n\"There is evidence in the financial services industry of an increasing focus on women and supporting their financial needs, but I don't believe that the industry has got it right yet,\" Lisa Claes, ING Direct executive director of customer delivery, said.\nAdvertisement \"We are at the threshold of a time when women will be increasingly taking on more financial decision-making while assuming custodianship of a significant inheritance, supplemented by the vast wealth they have already earned, invested and amassed. The challenge now is for financial services to capture this opportunity.\"\nThe research found that women took a more conservative approach to investments compared with their male counterparts, and tended to pick capital-guaranteed deposits over riskier assets such as shares.\nOne out of three women receive professional financial advice and 35 per cent say they would use a financial planner if they were to receive a substantial inheritance.\nWake-up call The findings are a wake-up call to the finance industry, which is seeking to woo female customers, who are set to be the main beneficiaries of a $2.4 trillion wealth transfer from Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers in the next three decades.\nRising property values and a large allocation to equities are driving this wealth boom. The pipeline of asset growth is 3.7 times larger than that of the US, and it's tipped to favour Australian women in the long run, Ms Claes said.\n\"That's due to the simple fact of genetics - women live longer,\" she said.\n\"Women identify with feeling a responsibility to preserve wealth, particularly inherited wealth, and to leave a legacy for the next generation. For women, the focus is often on 'making it last' rather than 'watching it grow',\" Ms Claes said.\nSome companies are beginning to champion women's rights and needs when it comes to financial services. One of these is ANZ Bank, which is offering free financial advice for female customers if they have less than $50,000 in their superannuation, and will pay women staff members a $500-a year top-up to their retirement savings.\nSome financial planning firms have opted to look after women exclusively, while others target specific niches, such as professional or divorced women and widows.\nHowever, the industry needed to go beyond \"merely compartmentalising women's needs\", the research found.\n\"Traditionally, product development has occurred through a male lens,\" it said.\n\"Most definitely, the solution is not for financial services companies to offer one product for men and another for women. Rather, they must build holistic solutions that are flexible enough to cater for both men and women.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:05:50.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
