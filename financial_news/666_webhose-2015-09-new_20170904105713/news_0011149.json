By Keisha Bandz 16 hours ago  \n( Continued from Prior Part ) Gasoline prices \nPrompt gasoline futures traded on NYMEX closed 5.79% lower on a weekly basis at ~$1.46 per gallon in the week ended August 28. Prices on August 21, the previous Friday, were ~$1.54 per gallon. \nPrices fell as BP’s (BP) Whiting refinery restarted after being shut since August 8 following an outage. Prices had previously risen on the news of the outage on speculations that supply will tighten. Prices also fell as a result of the surprise increase in gasoline inventories as reported by the EIA on Wednesday.

The approach of the end of summer driving season could also be another reason for the drop in gasoline prices. Why gasoline prices matter \nLower gasoline prices may dissuade refiners such as Tesoro (TSO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Valero Energy (VLO) from producing more gasoline. But the price of crude oil is also a consideration when refiners determine their production levels. \nGasoline prices loosely track changes in crude oil prices (USO), usually Brent crude oil prices, the international benchmark. TSO, VLO, and MPC combined make up ~8.6% of the Energy Select Sector SPDRF ETF (XLE). \nSo when gasoline prices fall, refiners could choose to decrease production, provided that all else, mainly crude oil prices, remains unchanged. Lower production levels would mean lower volumes for MLPs such as Tesoro Logistics (TLLP), MPLX LP (MPLX), and Valero Energy Partners (VLP) to transport. This would be negative for their revenues. Gasoline price forecasts \nAccording to the EIA’s “Short-Term Energy Outlook” released on August 11, monthly average gasoline retail prices reached $2.79 per gallon in July, $0.01 less than the June average. Retail prices differ from the futures prices we mentioned above. They include the added cost of taxes, distribution, and marketing costs. \nMeanwhile, the EIA expects the monthly average to decline throughout the remainder of the year. The summer driving season will end in September, which should push prices lower. Gasoline prices are forecast to average $2.41 per gallon in 2015 and $2.40 per gallon in 2016. Prices averaged $3.36 per gallon in 2014. The 2016 price forecast is lower than in 2015. The EIA forecasts gasoline consumption will remain flat compared to 2015 consumption figures, offsetting the impact of economic growth. The EIA will release its next STEO on September 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:08:52.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
