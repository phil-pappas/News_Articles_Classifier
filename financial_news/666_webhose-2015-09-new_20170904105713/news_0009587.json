That's not only down 13.9% from last year, but it's getting absolutely swarmed by the 2.5 million crossover SUVs sold during the same span . Though the minivan is faring much better than similarly sized large SUVs (of which 154,000 were sold though July, down 6.8%) from last year, even the archaic, gas-guzzling midsize non-crossover SUV (542,000 sold) is leaving it in the dust. \nSubaru alone (322,000 vehicles through June) outsells all minivan sales combined in the U.S. market, and it's just 3.2% of the total U.S. vehicle market. Not surprisingly, however, the minivan market and Subaru have one thing in common: each offers the car-buying public exactly seven options. If you want to count Dodge's Grand Caravan and Chrysler's Town and Country as the same vehicle, the minivan market actually consists of six vehicles. More Headlines Volatility Is Actually Good for the Stock Market’s Returns \nOther than Chrysler, no other U.S. automaker even touches the minivan anymore. The Chevrolet Venture and Astro? They've been gone for a decade. The Chevrolet Uplander that replaced them? Barely saw the end of 2008. The Ford Aerostar, Windstar and Freestar? HBO was airing new episodes of The Sopranos the last year those minivans were produced. \nYet the minivan has managed to survive on the U.S. market despite what's become a deeply ingrained stigma against it. It's uncool, it's the symbol of parenthood and it isn't terribly exciting. What it is, however, is incredibly good at its job. \n“The minivan has had lasting appeal because of its practical functionality,” says Brandy Schaffels, chief editor for auto site AskPatty.com. When it comes to hauling around lots of people and lots of stuff, minivans can be the most practical choice. Unlike most large SUVs, their low and flat floors allow easy access for loading passengers and cargo, and sliding doors make it easy to get lots of people and big objects in and out quickly.” \nSchaffels notes that minivans have continued to evolve to meet families' needs, even if parents are reluctant to buy them. From underfloor “stow ‘n go” storage nooks in the Chrysler and Dodge minivans, to convenient moveable seats that easily flip and fold (across the all manufacturers), to the new vacuum in the Honda Odyssey, designers are constantly tinkering with minivan features to make life easier for the people who drive them and to make them overall more likable. The have the SUV's high vantage point, but are big enough to fit seven people in comfort. Also, their low floors make it easy to load cargo and for young children to get in and out of. \n“Honestly, on the simplest level, it’s much easier to change a baby’s diaper on the floor of a minivan than it is on the floor of any SUV I’ve ever driven,” Schaffels says. “And dealing with diaper changes on the go is something that parents often have to deal with. I’ve done it in the trunk of my 1996 Honda Accord and on the back seats of many other sedans; SUVs don’t offer the convenient floor space and their seats are usually too high to change a baby on.” \nWith that in mind, we take a look at the last seven (yes, we'll throw Chrysler a bone here) minivans still being sold new here in the U.S. Take a good look, families, because even these likely won't be around forever. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:50:04.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
