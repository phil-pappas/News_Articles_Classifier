The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets and compete, and security of the person and privately owned property. \nThe top 10 most economically free jurisdictions, based on 2013 statistics (which is the most recent year of available data), are: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Mauritius, Jordan, Ireland and Canada, with the United Kingdom and Chile tied for the 10th ranking. \n42 distinct pieces of data points are used to measure the degree of economic freedom in five broad areas. \nFor these five areas, Mauritius ratings, on a scale of 10, are as follows: \nSize of Government: expenditures, taxes, and enterprises - 7.87 \nLegal structure and security of property rights - 6.55 \nAccess to sound money - 9.67 \nFreedom to trade internationally - 8.49 \nRegulation of credit, labour, and business - 7.82 \nAccording to the Report, nations in the top quartile of economic freedom had an average per-capita GDP of $38,601 in 2013, compared to $6,986 for bottom quartile nations. Life expectancy is 80.1 years, compared to 63.1 years. \nThe rankings of some other major countries are the United States (16th), Japan (26th), Germany (29th), South Korea (39th), Italy (68th), France (70th), Mexico (93st), Russia (99th), China (111th), India (114th), and Brazil (118th). \nThe 10 lowest-ranked countries are Angola, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Algeria, Argentina, Syria, Chad, Libya, Republic of Congo, and Venezuela. \nThe Fraser Institute produces the annual Economic Freedom of the World report in cooperation with the Economic Freedom Network, a group of independent research and educational institutes in 90 nations and territories.
