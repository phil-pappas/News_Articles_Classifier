Glenn Campbell In the still-strong Sydney market, loss-making house sales fell to 2.2 per cent of all transactions from 2.7 per cent in March and the figure for apartments tightened to 1.8 per cent from 1.9 per cent.\nThe proportion of loss-making house sales in Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra also reduced.\nBut the markets in Perth and Darwin continued to deteriorate. Loss-making sales of houses in Perth jumped to 11.5 per cent of the total from 5.6 per cent just three months earlier, while the figure for apartments leaped to 18.7 per cent from 11.9 per cent.\nIn Darwin, houses to 13.2 per cent from 8.1 per cent, while more than a quarter of all apartments sold in the NT capital - 25.3 per cent - are going for less than their purchase price. In June the figure was 17.3 per cent.\n The pain-and-gain equation was little changed for owner-occupiers and investors, with 7.7 per cent of owners and 11.9 per cent of investors selling properties at a loss in the second quarter.\nWith the sole exception of Darwin, the pain for investors was greater in every capital city for investors than for owner-occupiers, the report said.\n\"With housing finance data having showed a surge in housing investment over recent years, investors should pay attention to these figures,\" it cautioned.\n\"When it comes time to re-sell a property owner occupier stock is much more likely to turn a gross profit than investment stock. This is most likely due to the fact that investment is more prevalent in the unit market than detached houses.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:10:59.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
