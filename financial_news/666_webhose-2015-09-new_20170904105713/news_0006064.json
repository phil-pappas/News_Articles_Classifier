That prompted Shire to file a series of lawsuits in 2011 and 2012.\nIn June 2014, Shire won summary judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey that its 16 patents on the drug were valid and would be infringed by the planned generics, prompting the generic drugmakers to appeal.\n\"We are extremely pleased that the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that the patents are valid, which further confirms that Shire has strong patents protecting Vyvanse,\" said Mark Enyedy, Shire's interim general counsel, in a press release.\nRepresentatives of Roxane and Amneal declined to comment. The other generic drugmakers did not immediately return requests for comment.\nVyvanse is approved by the FDA to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder. The drug brought Shire $841.6 million in revenue in the first half of 2015, about 28 percent of its total revenue.\nThe case is Shire LLC et al v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC et al, U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit, No. 2014-1736.
