If the bank wants to expand that portfolio, it would give a discount and may charge more if it wants to exit from that business line, said a senior public sector bank offficial.\nIBA is yet to finalise the components. These will be uniform across the banks but the weightage assigned to each one would differ, based on the business strategy and other factors.\nMarginal cost of funds is the incremental cost of borrowing more money to fund assets or investments.\nIn this financial year's first bi-monthly policy review, RBI prodded banks to use this for the base rate calculation.\n\n\"A base rate based on marginal cost of funds should be more sensitive to changes in policy rates. To improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, (we) will encourage banks to move in a time-bound manner to marginal cost of funds-based determination of their BR,\" RBI had said.\nBanks had earlier expressed hesitation on such a shift. Tthey were taking the average cost to calculate the cost of funds, of which a significant part was current and savings account deposits, which are low-cost. Most banks pay four% on savings account deposits, 20-40% of the total deposits.\nMonetary transmission by banks have been slow. In this calendar year, RBI has reduced the repo rate (at which it lends to banks) by 75 basis points. However, banks have reduced the base rate by only 25-30 bps.\n\nBoth RBI and the government had questioned this reluctance to cut. Bankers say the increase in bad loans has been putting pressure on their margins, as interest-earning assets slip into the non-performing class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:20:34.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
