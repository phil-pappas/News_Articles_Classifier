Alex Ellinghausen by Phillip Coorey Fleur Anderson The fragile consensus between the federal government and some states that the GST needs to be increased is at risk of collapse after South Australia rejected a push by Tony Abbott to spend the extra revenue on tax cuts, not health.\nSA Labor Premier Jay Weatherill spoke out after the Prime Minister gave his strongest statement of support yet for an increased GST by endorsing the efficiency argument of experts such as former treasury secretary Martin Parkinson.\n\"There is an efficiency argument for taxing earnings less and taxing spending more, I accept there is a strong argument, but it's got to be in the context of overall lower taxes,\" Mr Abbott said.\nMr Parkinson told last week's National Reform Summit that the tax system was too reliant on company income tax and personal income tax, both of which he said, were \"inimical to productivity and participation and inimical to growth\".\nDavid Rowe The government has promised income tax cuts as part of a package to take to the next election, which will at least redress bracket creep.\nBut Mr Weatherill said a GST increase could either fund tax cuts or the growing cost of public health but not both.\nChange of heart He said it was unfair that the government used the 2014 budget to effectively force the states to ask for a GST increase by cutting $80 billion from hospitals and schools, but then wanting to use to money to fund tax cuts to take for the next election.\n \"There is an efficiency argument for taxing earnings less and taxing spending more, I accept there is a strong argument, but it's got to be in the context of overall lower taxes,\" Mr Abbott said. Ben Rushton \"The revenue, whether it's a rise in the GST or the Medicare levy that are being explored was fundamentally about addressing the gap in funding for the provision of healthcare services, a gap which was significantly contributed by the Commonwealth when it cut $50 billion (from health),\" he told The Australian Financial Review on Thursday.\nHe noted the communique Mr Abbott and the Premiers signed at their Sydney summit in July had agreed to keep exploring the GST for health proposal.\nHe said Mr Abbott's stated preference for tax cuts was \"inconsistent with what was agreed between the states and territories at the retreat\".\nMr Abbott dismissed the SA suggestion on Thursday.\n\"The problem with a lot of the people who are saying just whack up the GST is that they want the overall burden of tax to go up, they want government spending to go up,\" he said.\nNSW supports increase NSW also supports increasing the GST rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Liberal Premier Mike Baird says half the extra revenue could be used for compensatory tax cuts while the other half could be put towards health.\nMr Weatherill said this would not leave enough money to fund health and the Commonwealth should foot the bill for compensation.\nFormer Board of Taxation chairperson Teresa Dyson said the GST might well be efficient as a mechanism for collecting tax, but its distribution to the states and territories is complex, inefficient and time consuming.\n\"To me I think there is a fundamental inefficiency of the federal government collecting a tax that is ultimately distributed through a formula that has to be distributed to the states,\" she said.\n\"That's the way our GST works, and from a collection mechanism [perspective], it's probably the only way you could do it but it's very different to any comparable jurisdiction where the entity that collects the money is the entity that spends the money.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:42:49.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
