Getting inventions off the drawing board and into business By Alan Tovey | Telegraph – 1 hour 0 minutes ago Print \nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers going back to its roots to fund inventions \"likely to be useful to the world\" \nInventors hoping to get their ideas out of the workshop and into commercial use could get a boost from the inventor of the miner’s safety lamp. \nThe Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) has made the first awards to companies from a £2m fund intended to help ideas make the leap from the drawing board into production. \nThe IME was founded in 1847 by George Stephenson , pictured left, known as the father of Britain’s railways and the inventor of the safety lamp, and the body is now giving financial backing to start-ups that follow his aim when he set up the organisation to “give an impulse to invention likely to be useful to the world”. \nFive companies have been awarded support from the Stephenson LP fund, which is intended to back research in innovative fields of mechanical engineering. \nThe companies that will receive funding are: \n• Lontra , which makes compressors which abandon conventional piston and cylinder designs for a “blade compressor” in a doughnut shape with the piston rotating inside it . The system has been shown to be 20pc more efficient than conventional designs, and with compressors responsible for 10pc of industrial energy consumption, could deliver huge benefits if it goes into wide-scale use. Midlands-based Lontra’s design is already licensed for use in the water industry and the award will be used to develop the system for air compressors. \n• University College London spin-out Amalyst , which has developed fuel cells which do not need platinum to generate hydrogen power from water through electrolysis, making them much cheaper than current versions. Growing interest in hydrogen-powered cars means this technology could gain traction in the auto sector. \n• Oxford Space Systems , which is making lighter, cheaper and less complex moveable antennas, booms and panels mainly for small satellites. The company has signed contracts with leading players in the European space industry and is aiming to set a record of going from concept to space flight in three years. \n• Sensor company Oxsensis , which uses light to measure heat, temperature and pressure in harsh environments such as jet engines, energy uses and power stations. Oxsensis’s non-electrical systems use sensors made out of materials such as sapphire that are connected by fibre optic cables as long as 1km. As light is not affected by heat and electromagnetic interference, they are able to give accurate readings. The Oxfordshire-based business has agreed partnerships with aviation companies, including GE. \n• Tokamak Energy , which is working to speed up the introduction of fusion reactors that have the potential to provide limitless clean power from joining atoms, rather than splitting them. Tokamak is investigating how fusion could be achieved in small reactors, which it believes could be built in factories or even shipyards, rather than being huge civil engineering projects. \nThe awards showed that the IME was “getting back to its roots”, according to chief executive Stephen Tetlow. \nHe added: “These investments by the institution are not just about providing monetary investment, but about connecting these and other companies to the vast resources and network of the institution and its membership. The fund fulfils the institution’s original purpose to give an impulse to invention and also help companies overcome the investment hurdle between R&D and bringing a product to market.” \nWhile the financial backing is intended to support small companies and start-ups, an IME spokesman said that it could theoretically be awarded to a lone inventor working in their shed, as long as they come up with a good idea to bring to market. \n“While we are looking at cutting-edge technology which is a bit further down the line and has a clear business idea as we do due dilligence on the companies, we could not rule out such an award,” said the spokesman. \nThe fund is managed by venture fund investor Midven but candidates for financial backing were approved by the IME’s trustees and management. The institution would not say how much was awarded to each company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:15:47.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
