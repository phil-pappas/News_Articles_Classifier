Source: Supplied\n“Compared to standard airconditioners, geoexchange systems do not burn anywhere near as much fossil fuel.\n“They simply transfer heat to and from the earth to provide a more affordable and environmentally friendly method of heating and cooling.\nThe geothermal system is already being used elsewhere around the globe, including the UK.\n“This kind of technology is already being used around the world, generally for heating in cold climates, but it’s possible it could also be a more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way for West Australians to keep cool in summer as well,” Mr Marra said.\nThe hole at The Vive estate property was dug this weekend and is one of LandCorp’s “innovation through demonstration” initiatives.

This way, we can test the difference and measure the effectiveness of the technology, over a two-year period,” he said.\nLandCorp is working together with several partners, including the Alcock Brown-Neaves Group, energy specialists Carbonomics, The University of WA and GeoExchange Australia.\nThe two houses to be used in the trial will be released as turnkey house and land packages in early 2016. The Vive at Craigie also includes a supported independent living facility designed specifically for younger adults with disabilities.\nOriginally published as Could this be the answer to high energy bills?
