That pushed the share of analysts saying investors should buy the stock to 44 percent, the most since the end of October 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCommerzbank’s stock has been battered by a series of share sales to repay state aid it took after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. Chief Executive Officer Martin Blessing is pressing on with a plan to wind down unwanted assets to build capital levels to meet regulatory requirements and pay the company’s first dividend in eight years.\nThe shares rose as much as 7.5 percent, the most since the end of October. The stock traded at 10.38 euros as of 12:53 p.m. in Frankfurt on Tuesday, narrowing its decline this year to 5.5 percent.\nCommerzbank, the biggest lender to Germany’s Mittelstand, offers “cheap exposure to core Europe” as investors seek to avoid stocks that are more affected by slowing growth in emerging markets and a slump in commodity prices, according to Abouhossein. The Mittelstand is the mass of small and mid-sized companies that make up the backbone of Germany’s economy.\nThe stock trades at 0.45 times its book value, almost half the 0.87 times average for the 44 members of the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index. A price to book of less than one indicates that a bank is worth less than investors would expect to receive if the firm liquidated its assets.\nCommerzbank’s “low” profitability is “more than discounted” in the valuation, according to JPMorgan. The bank’s capital ratio is “comfortable” at 10.5 percent at the end of June and it faces no “major” risk of legal costs, Abouhossein said.\nThe stock declined this year partly because of concern over Poland’s plan to force banks to share the cost of converting loans denominated in Swiss francs to Polish zloty, according to Neil Smith, an analyst with Bankhaus Lampe.\n“Recent comments from the CEO about still planning to pay a dividend suggest they’re really not concerned about the situation in Poland blowing a hole in their capital ratio,” Smith, who has a buy recommendation on the stock, said from Dusseldorf on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:13:24.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
