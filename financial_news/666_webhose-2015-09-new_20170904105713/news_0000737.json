Jessica Shapiro \"A large chunk of what investors are receiving in dividends is from the big four banks, so if they're forced to hold more capital, that could have an impact down the track,\" Mr Mackay said.\nA couple of months ago, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) increased the benchmark for the amount of capital our major banks are required to hold in a bid to further stabilise the banking sector.\nWhether the changing requirements will trickle down to costs for banking customers or for shareholders is yet to be seen, but is worth factoring in to reinvestment strategies.\nAnother danger of automatically reinvesting is becoming too overweight to a particular stock or group of stocks and losing sight of your ideal asset allocation, which may be hazardous for conservatively invested retirees.\n \"I don't think you should reinvest because that means you're losing control of your asset allocation; it becomes an automated exercise and we don't think that's right,\" said Justin Hooper, a financial strategist and managing director of Sentinel Wealth.\n\"We think if you get all of your distributions in a central place and rebalance on a quarterly basis, you have more control over the whole thing.\"\nMr Mackay agreed. \"Cash dividend payments allow regular re-balancing of portfolios back to an investor's target asset allocation.\"\nAndrew Zbik, a senior financial planner at Omniwealth, suggested investors take the cash so they can then re-assess their investment strategy and review their goals for the next few months.\n\"Over the longer term, [by reinvesting] you're just averaging into the market,\" he said.\nAnd for self-managed super fund (SMSF) investors doing their own tax, it's worth thinking about the accounting factor before jumping to reinvest.\n\"Not reinvesting the dividend does make it a little bit simpler with regard to the capital gains tax calculation, which can add real costs to the overall portfolio,\" said Mr Mackay.\n\"If you've held shares for 20-30 years tracing back those dividends over that period can be quite complicated.\"\nHowever, Mr Zbik said reinvestment sometimes makes sense for investors who purchase shares for their children and want to gift them a lump sum after they've built value for 10 to15 years.\nCritics of dividend-based investing often say the bi-annual payment skews investors' attention away from the fundamentals of the company, but Mr Mackay said he is still personally a big believer in dividend-paying companies.\n\"For our clients who are approaching or in retirement, an income stream for their dream lifestyle is essential and they get that from dividends,\" he said.\n\"In addition to that, companies that regularly pay dividends have to be more careful with their capital, so it keeps them honest and if they're going to make corporate transactions, they have to justify that; they're less prone to rash actions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:08:32.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
