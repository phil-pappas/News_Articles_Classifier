The market expanded 2 percent from 5.5 trillion euros in December 2014, the ICMA said. That was about the same as in December 2013, the smallest size since June 2009.\nThe decline of the repo market in recent years has come amid an increase in regulation targeted at shrinking balance sheets at major banks. Borrowing of government debt has been most impacted as Basel III regulations on leverage ratios makes it less profitable to hold sovereign securities considering the relatively low returns and large trade sizes.\n“The stability of the headline figure over the last few surveys does not tell the full story,” said Godfried De Vidts, chairman of the ICMA’s European Repo Council. “The repo market in Europe is not growing in line with underlying conditions.”\nIncreased bond issuance, excess liquidity from central-bank monetary policy operations and increasing demand for collateral driven by regulation means you would have expected more growth, he said. Instead, regulation is beginning “to bite,” De Vidts said.\nMarket Peak The total market peaked at 7 trillion euros in June 2010. This year, the share of government bonds within the pool of European Union-originated collateral reported in the survey declined to 77 percent, from 81.5 percent in December.\nICMA surveyed 65 offices of 61 financial groups for the total value of outstanding repos and reverse repos on June 10. This was two fewer respondents than the December 2014 survey. Using a constant sample of banks to eliminate the effect of changes in the survey sample, it is estimated that the market grew over the previous six months by 4.6 percent but shrank 3.7 percent year-on-year, ICMA said.\nThe survey doesn’t measure repo transactions with central banks as part of official monetary policy operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:04:56.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
