Richard Drew Share on twitter by Philip Baker So after seven years of setting interest rates at emergency levels, to deal with the financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve thinks there is still too much uncertainty in markets to raise rates by just one quarter of a percentage point.\nInvestors will be torn between thinking the latest move is good or bad .\nGood that the cheap money is here to stay for a little longer. But bad because the world can't cope with rates rising by just one quarter of a percentage point from their current level of almost zero .\nNotably the Dow Jones gave up more than 250 points of initial gains once the decision sunk in, while the two-year US government bond yield fell about 10 basis points implying there were won't be a hike anytime soon.\nNormally Wall Street laps up the prospect of more cheap money but maybe its allure is starting to wear off. The local sharemarket, however, took kindly to it and Friday's rise capped the second straight week of gains. The major S&P ASX 200 index hasn't posted back-to-back weekly gains since the middle of June.\nPerhaps no one would be more disappointed by the Fed's latest move than Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The RBA has stopped jawboning the $A down but a rate rise would have pushed it lower, giving the local economy another boost.\nFurthermore, Stevens probably worries more about the dangers that record low interest rates pose to financial stability.\nFor example the RBA raised rates in 2003 when house prices were on the tear, while the crazy prices of Sydney property has played a big part in keeping local rates steady, rather then cutting them further.\n Dollar's possible decline a concern One concern that investors will have right now is if the Fed can't raise rates, or doesn't feel the US economy is in good-enough shape to hike, then it could signal the end of the strong US dollar.\nThe rise of the greenback over the past year or so as the Fed started to flag the landmark move to higher rates has been a winner for major economies that all got a free kick as their currencies weakened in response to the greenback.\nIt looks like the Fed has pointed to the low level of inflation as another major reason why they couldn't move now.\nBut as David Bassanese, the chief economist from BetaShares, is always pointing out, US core inflation has been below 2 per cent for 75 per cent of the time since the late 1990s.\nLittle surprise then that Bassanese called the decision by the Fed not to move \"ludicrous\".\nAs the accompanying chart shows, it's not that surprising that inflation in the US has been under 2 per cent.\n\"Indeed, annual growth in the \"core\" - excluding food and energy - price deflator for price consumption expenditure has averaged 1.68 per cent since 1997\" says Bassanese.\nDespite the US jobless rate falling from 10 per cent since 2008 to last month's 5.1 per cent, it looks like the Fed is adamant about maintaining an inflation target of 2 per cent when of course most measures of consumer price inflation remain well below that on an annual basis.\nAnd as Mark Wills - APAC head of the Investment Solutions Group at State Street Global Advisors - pointed out, the Fed cut its forecast for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which measures where the Fed thinks unemployment will start to generate inflation.\nHooked on cheap money The other concern for financial markets is that investors have got too hooked on all of this cheap money and wonder if they will ever be able to be weaned off it.\nThe world has been nervous about a rate hike. But if they don't hike then emerging markets start to rally again, all the ructions that caused the Fed to keep them steady will simply start up again.\nDoes that mean the Fed starts to talk a tightening again only to see financial markets get all wobbly and so they can't hike, and the whole interest rate hike issue just goes around in a circle\nWhen will they ever be able to hike?\nThe peak in interest rates over the past 40 years just keeps getting lower.\nIn 1974 it was 13 per cent, in 1980 it was 20 per cent, 11.75 per cent in 1984 and 9.75 per cent in 1989.\nIn 1994 when rates went up a lot quicker than the market was ready for and bond prices crashed causing all sorts of problems, they peaked at just 6 per cent, while in 2000 it was 6.5 per cent and 5.25 per cent in 2007.\nInvestors have placed great faith in the power of central banks to eventually right the global economy.\nBut if central banks turn out to be not the omnipotent force many thought they were, then financial markets could really start a wild ride.\nOn that score it was pertinent that the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet Yellen, made a point of saying that the \"Fed should not be responding to the ups-and-downs of markets\" but rather look at \"what is causing them\", which at the moment is the uncertain economic outlook seven years after the crisis.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-09-18T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:08:58.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
