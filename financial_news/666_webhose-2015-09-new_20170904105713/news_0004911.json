This most recent television home shopping sales event builds upon similarly successful events held in May in the U.S. and in June in the UK,” said Dr. Dolev Rafaeli, PhotoMedex CEO. \nReported Financial Results \nRevenues from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 were $19.9 million, a decrease of 37% compared with revenues from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 of $31.8 million. \nGross profit from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was $15.0 million, or 75% of revenues, compared with gross profit for the second quarter of 2014 of $26.0 million, or 82% of revenues. \nNet income for the second quarter of 2015 was $6.1 million or $0.28 per share, which included a $2.1 million loss from discontinued operations, a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $10.6 million, $0.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per share. \nPhotoMedex’s reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, nor superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of PhotoMedex’s current financial performance and to provide further information for comparative purposes. \nSpecifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook. In addition, PhotoMedex believes non-GAAP measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods.
