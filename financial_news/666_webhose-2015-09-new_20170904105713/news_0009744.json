The tires will be part of a broader \"throwback\" initiative at Darlington designed to honor the track's storied past in NASCAR racing. In addition, many NASCAR teams and sponsors are participating by running vintage-inspired paint schemes. \nThe throwback weekend is especially significant for Goodyear, as Darlington Raceway was the site of several key milestones in the company's 61-year history with NASCAR. Goodyear conducted its first official NASCAR tire tests at Darlington in 1954, and would go on to earn its first NASCAR victory at the 1959 Southern 500 with driver Jim Reed behind the wheel. \n\"Since our earliest days in NASCAR, Goodyear has used the sport as a proving grounds for tire development and innovation,\" said Stu Grant, general manager of global race tires. \"The Darlington Throwback weekend is a great opportunity for us to recognize our rich NASCAR heritage, as we continue to drive superior performance both on and off the track.\" \nThe tires will run during the NASCAR XFINITY Series VFW Sport Clips Help A Hero 200, September 5, and the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Bojangles' Southern 500, September 6. \nGoodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies. It employs approximately 67,000 people and manufactures its products in 50 facilities in 22 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry. www.goodyear.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:35:02.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
