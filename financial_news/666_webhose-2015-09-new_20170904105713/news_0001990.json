During his presentation, Tom will share strategies for securing the most favorable financing terms; how to build a team of trusted financial advisors; ideas for creating a winning loan package and how to deal with probable “red flags” when approaching a banker to obtain a business loan.\n“Bankers don’t often share the ‘secrets’ of obtaining a business loan,” states Tom. “However, I don’t believe the business financing process should seem like a mysterious black box.
