The bank has lost $12.8 million during the past three years as total assets have declined to $326 million. \nMost of the money held by the government came from a life insurance payout by John Hancock Life Insurance Co. after Stuart died on March 26, 2013 . Stuart allegedly diverted about $2.3 million of the TARP funds to repay the bank for funds he used to pay personal expenses. \nNo repayment of the TARP debt has occurred since the first quarter of 2012. \nIn addition to the U.S. Treasury, two other creditors have significant stakes in the well being of One Bank. \nBHL Financing LLC, led by trucking heiress Johnelle Hunt, holds a $14.7 million claim against the bank's holding company, OneFinancial Corp. as do investors holding $8 million worth of trust-preferred securities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:16:49.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
