The latest Apple model is expected to cost around 5,288 yuan.\n“Why sell your kidney when you can donate sperm? It’s a great deed that can bring happiness to a whole family,” said microblog Weibo user “Wojiushiwutong”.\nThe advertisement is titled “New Solution to Get iPhone 6s”, evoking some criticism that the sperm bank is being insensitive.\n“I don’t like the idea of making money out of sperm donation to buy new iPhones. Sperm donation is a very serious cause for public good,” one Weibo user said.\nBut a spokesperson with the Shanghai sperm bank told Xinhua the campaign has worked well so far, raising awareness and attracting potential donors.\nWhile there are tens of thousands of infertile couples in China, all sperm banks across the country face donation shortages because many young men are unaware or too embarrassed to donate, forcing the banks to turn to social media.\n 19, 2015 7:29 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:34:12.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
