Rs 1.10 lakh crore is coming through issuance of additional capital.\n“The idea is to first strengthen the banks and then issue the capital. I would not issue the capital at the present level of NPAs. I have indicated a 3-4 year road map. In the next three years, we would have complied with Basel III norms. Therefore, Rs 1.80 lakh crore is to be invested, including Rs 70,000 crore from the Budget.\n“My first tranche is to strengthen the banks. First, we need to bring down the NPAs, only then banks will issue the capital,” he said here at a press conference on the last day of his four-day visit to Singapore and Hong Kong.\nAsked whether he would look at merger of some banks, Arun Jaitley said, “That option after strengthening the banks is open.”\n 21, 2015 11:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:29:40.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
