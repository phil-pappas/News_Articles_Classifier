Chief Executive Travis Kalanick avoided providing many particulars in a public discussion with Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff on Wednesday, instead sticking to general talking points.\nHowever, the co-founder of the ride-hailing service did provide three specific numbers during a talk billed as a “fireside chat” at the annual Dreamforce tech conference in San Francisco .\n50% : Kalanick said that at least 50% of the drivers who will use Uber this week will work less than 10 hours. He used this stat to enforce that drivers appreciate the flexibility that driving for Uber provides, a sticking point for the company as it faces a class-action lawsuit from drivers seeking to be classified as employees instead of independent contractors .\n4,000 : Kalanick said that Uber currently has 4,000 employees, which obviously doesn't include drivers for the service. This indicates a massively expanding workforce, spurred by venture capital that has valued the company at more than $50 billion . Kalanick told The Wall Street Journal in early 2014 that the company had 550 employees and expected to have as many as 2,000 by the beginning of this year.\n100,000: Kalanick said that UberPool, Uber’s newest service , is attracting at least 100,000 riders a week in every active city. The service allows riders to share a car for a cheaper fare, and Kalanick said it is so far less profitable than Uber’s other services. Overall, though, Kalanick said the company is providing “thousands of rides per minute,” scoffing at a suggestion that it was 600 rides per minute.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304887104579306622013546350"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T06:47:30.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
