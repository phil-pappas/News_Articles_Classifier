The real problem is the difficulty and large cost they face if they transfer to another provider. \n\"We are looking at this in our consultation and investigations and we want members of the public who are experiencing difficulties in this regard to let us know what is happening.\" \nIn June Friends Life, part of Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) , cancelled plans to offer savers the new flexibilities, sparking concerns among ministers that other firms could follow suit by delaying or refusing flexible access. \nThis latest news cements those fears and increases the number of savers known to be currently facing barriers to using their pensions like bank accounts from five to seven million. \nAegon’s decision to delay the freedoms for most people comes despite it having provided new flexible pensions to customers who are prepared to pay for a financial adviser from April. \nAn Aegon spokesperson said: “Pensions can be complex and requires customers to make decisions about investments, how much income to take and how long their savings might need to last. We are still working through our offer and will launch when we are confident it will meet customer needs.” \nHave you been denied pension freedom?
