PayPal.me URLs can be customised to personalise the link to the sender or recipient. A transaction fee will be levied if the recipient pays with a credit card instead of a bank account linked to PayPal, at a rate of 2.4 percent plus 30 cents per transaction. The move pushes PayPal further innto the mobile world and out of its traditional desktop stomping ground - PayPal processed US$46 billion in mobile transactions last year compared to US$750 million five years ago.
