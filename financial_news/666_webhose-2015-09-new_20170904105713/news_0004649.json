Spot gold fell as much as 1.1 per cent to a session low of $US1,121.35 an ounce and was down 0.8 per cent at $US1,125.20 at 2.47 pm EDT (0447 Friday AEST). US gold for December delivery settled down 0.8 per cent at $US1,124.50 an ounce. \"No help for gold today: jobless claims, ECB hold(ing) rates unchanged, gains in stocks and wages show(ing) no inflation,\" said RBC Wealth Management adviser George Gero. The dollar rose 0.5 per cent against a basket of leading currencies, while global stock markets rallied amid news the US trade deficit fell to a five-month low in July. US weekly jobs data indicated a strengthening labour market, a day ahead of the more critical monthly jobs report, due at 8:30 am EDT (2230 AEST) on Friday, which should give a clearer picture about the strength of the world's biggest economy. \"Only amazingly good US data would bring the prospect of the rate hike back to September from December,\" Citi strategist David Wilson said. \"That could put immediate further pressure on the gold price.\" Bullion traders remain wary of taking up new positions until they receive more clarity on whether the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting on September 16-17, analysts said. Higher interest rates would increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. \"The euro's down with the ECB comments, and the market's book-squared and looking toward tomorrow,\" said James Steel, chief metals analyst for HSBC Securities in New York. The technical picture for gold looked bearish with near-term support at $US1,117, ScotiaMocatta analysts said. \"We are bearish gold so long as it trades below the recent high of $US1,170.\" Also weighing on bullion was the absence of Chinese buyers with markets in China, a major gold consumer, closed through Friday for public holidays. Other precious metals were also under pressure, with silver down 0.3 per cent to $US14.66 an ounce, platinum down 1 per cent to $US1,002 and palladium down 1.7 per cent at $US572.50.
