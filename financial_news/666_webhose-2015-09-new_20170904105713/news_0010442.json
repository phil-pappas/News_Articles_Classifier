Jesse Marlow by Vesna Poljak Australia's top 200 companies are on track to pay out a record $81.8 billion this financial year, shrugging off earnings downgrades in the wake of a downbeat profit season to boost their returns to shareholders.\nThe forecast dividend total for 2015-16 represents a 5.4 per cent increase on the $77.6 billion paid out in 2014-15 which includes the impact of dividend reinvestment plans, according to research by Credit Suisse. The pace of dividend growth is also accelerating, given 2014-15 payments were 4.7 per cent ahead of 2013-14's total.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 Index's global reputation as a high-yield market remains intact and the capital discipline of Australian companies will further endear stocks to self-managed superannuation fund investors who demand income. Around 40 per cent of the domestic market is owned by superannuation interests, including self-managed funds.\nHowever, the news is troubling for the Reserve Bank of Australia, which is facing a steep drop in business investment intentions at a time when the economy is seeking alternatives to mining investment.\nLast week, new figures revealed that Australian business spending plunged last financial year by the most since the early 1990s recession.\nAustralia's dividend culture has been a target of blame for this trend but it is hardly unique to the Australian economy.\n\"The outstanding point of the current reporting season is that earnings per share got downgraded and DPS\" - dividends per share - \"got revised upwards,\" said Hasan Tevfik, Credit Suisse equity strategist. \"The capex cuts expected over the next 12 months lead me to say you could see further dividend upgrades even from our current forecasts.\"\nGiven the rising force of super investors, \"dividends are literally financing our pensions,\" he added.\n Companies are not paying out all of their free cashflow this fiscal year on current forecasts, leaving capacity for further upgrades, according to Mr Tevfik. Payout ratios are considered to be high by investors but companies have shown an ability to find more cash to reward shareholders.\nThe Reserve Bank, which meets on Tuesday for its September policy meeting, believes that internal rate of return hurdles are too high among boards for the current environment of low interest rates. Directors argue that there are few attractive growth opportunities to invest in.\nWhile companies in the national capex survey last week upgraded their estimates for spending in 2015-16 by 9.9 per cent to $115 billion compared with three months ago, this is still 23 per cent lower than the equivalent forecast a year earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:29:03.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
