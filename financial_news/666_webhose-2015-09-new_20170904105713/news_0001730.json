Reuters Share on twitter by Angus Grigg After a decade of denial, the Australian coal industry must finally acknowledge it has not only lost the public relations battle but also the economic argument.\nThe expected announcement of an emissions trading scheme by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Washington on Friday, means the already bleak future for coal can only get worse.\nIn taking such concerted action, Beijing is acknowledging its development path must change if it has any chance of cleaning up the country's chronic air pollution. That means burning less coal.\nFor China's leaders this will be a 15-year task but one which is wildly popular among the public.\nUnlike Australia where environmentalists can be easily branded inner-city hipsters with an ideological hatred of coal, in China it's an issue as fundamental as food and shelter.\nEnvironmentalists are parents who want their children to play outside or hope their elderly relatives won't suffer from respiratory problems.\nIndeed, a survey published by the Pew Research Centre this week found air pollution was rated as China's second biggest problem, after corrupt officials.\nIt outranked crime, food safety, unemployment and healthcare as perceived problems facing the country â€“ water pollution was ranked third.\n Another sign of the public's outrage over pollution was seen earlier this year when the environmental film, Under the Dome , was downloaded more than 100 million times in the 24 hours after its release.\nThe Communist Party, despite not having to face elections, is highly sensitive to such concerns and its radical action on climate change is a function of public dissatisfaction.\nThis saw it declare \"war on pollution\" in 2014 and it now needs to start delivering on its promise.\nThe slowing economy has helped its cause but the problem remains daunting.\n'Unhealthy' air quality most of the time According to the government's own data, Beijing's air quality was \"unhealthy\" for at least an hour during eight of the last 10 days.\nIndustrial pollution from burning coal is the main culprit and this is what the government is targeting.\nLast year China's overall coal consumption was down 0.7 per cent but the country still managed to burn a staggering 3.87 billion tonnes.\nGreenpeace estimates over the first four months of the year China's coal consumption was down 8 per cent, compared to the same period last year.\nThis is a historic shift after double-digit growth for much of the last decade, but it has further to fall if the air is to be cleaned.\nWhile local coal producers have not been immune to the decline in consumption, importers have been the hardest hit.\nOver the first eight months of the year coal imports to China fell 31 per cent, according to the Customs Bureau.\nFor Australia, this saw overall thermal coal exports fall 0.7 per cent in the year to June, while coking coal exports rose modestly.\nIn the face of a global downturn this is not a bad performance but it's well shy of 10 per cent growth forecast by the now disbanded Australian Coal Association just three years ago.\nAnd while the Department of Industry and Science is predicting growth in coal exports to pick up at the back half of the decade this looks wildly optimistic if China is to meet its new climate commitments, but more importantly clean up its chronically polluted air.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:09:25.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
