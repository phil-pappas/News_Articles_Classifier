The fully-industrialized product delivers the key communications functionality and connectivity required at sea. It allows shipping companies to seamlessly integrate their fleet into the corporate network and provide Internet access for crew and applications. Maritime Connect is a single, integrated solutions platform, which provides the maritime industry with reliable connectivity over diverse communication interfaces and cuts costs at the same time. It delivers voice, VoIP, data and internet access in one solution, independent of the communication technology used. Shipping companies, IT managers, captains and the crew can control access to data and voice services on board vessels or remotely from shore. Typical uses of Maritime Connect include secure access to enterprise applications via the corporate network; better route planning to improve fuel consumption and cost control; enriched crew welfare by providing communication with the outside world; tracking and monitoring of ships and cargo; and telemedicine for remote care. Providing seamless connectivity in challenging environments Delivering innovative maritime bandwidth management and optimization features, Maritime Connect manages voice, video and data in limited bandwidth and challenging weather conditions. It can be used on ships equipped with any type of satellite communications systems, including, but not limited to, Fleet Broadband, Iridium or VSAT systems (Ku or C band). The solution was developed over a year as part of a European Union initiative dedicated to improving communications on vessels at sea. Maritime Connect is available in three tiered versions. The basic version provides on-board access to essential communications services like IP Routing, link switching, quality of service (QoS) and server hosting for applications onboard; the next level up adds licenses for increased security, WAN optimization and user accounting; while the premium version provides maximum connectivity for crew and captain with Wi-Fi on board, 3G/4G for near-shore operations. “Orange Business Services is uniquely positioned in the maritime market because we are able to integrate many different technologies and networks, both onshore and offshore. With the end-to-end integration and satellite connectivity offered by Maritime Connect, vessels on the high seas are now as well connected as terrestrial offices. This enables new ways of working right across the shipping industry,” says Michel Verbist, Head Business Development Satellite Solutions, Orange Business Services.
