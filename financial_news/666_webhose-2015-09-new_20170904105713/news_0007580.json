The stock was down as much as 6.8 percent earlier.\nA Wynn spokesman, Michael Weaver, identified the junket operator as Dore Holdings and minimized the impact it will have on Las Vegas-based Wynn, which gets most of its revenue from its Macau unit.\n“The current reported concerns with respect to Dore, one of Wynn Macau’s junket operators, have no direct financial impact on Wynn Macau,” Weaver said in an e-mail. “Dore owes no money to the company and continues to operate in Wynn Macau.”\nThe incident is likely to have a limited impact on Macau’s gross gaming revenue, David Bain, an analyst with Sterne Agee, said in a research note Thursday.\nGaming revenue in Macau, the world’s largest casino market, has plunged in the past year amid a broader Chinese government crackdown on corruption and a slowing of the country’s economy. More than $1 billion was allegedly stolen from another junket operator last year, according to news accounts at the time.\nJunket operators bring high rollers to Macau and supply them with credit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:44:45.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
