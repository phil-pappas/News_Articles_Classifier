Belgian 10-year yields were 2 bps higher at 1.04 percent.\n\"The environment for the auctions seems tricky amid the ongoing concerns about Chinese selling. No-one really knows how Chinese demand is going to behave and that's creating uncertainty here,\" said Commerzbank strategist Michael Leister.\n\"The last German auctions delivered quite subdued demand metrics so in one sense the market is quite well prepared.\"\nAt the euro zone's periphery, Portuguese 10-year yields were a touch lower on the day at 2.51 percent, keeping their yield premium over German benchmarks at their tightest in nearly a month.\nPortuguese bonds have so far proved resilient to rising political risk as latest polls show a tight contest ahead of an Oct. 4 general election that could result in a political logjam.\n\"Despite the ultimate composition of the government still being unclear we remain quite relaxed about the risks that this could pose to Portuguese government debt,\" Rabobank strategists said in a note.\n\"This is because both main party blocs still seem to remain committed to the budget deficit targets agreed with the European Commission.\"\nThat contrasts with the market's view of political fallout for Spain from a Sept. 27 vote in its wealthy Catalonia region which polls show is likely to hand separatists a majority. Spanish bonds have been underperforming their southern European peers with their 10-year bond yield premium over Italian 10-year debt this week hitting the highest in two years near 20 basis points.
