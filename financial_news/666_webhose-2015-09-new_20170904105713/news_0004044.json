With Emanuel's blessing and the city's checkbook, tens of millions of dollars have been spent to dispatch officers by the hundreds to work overtime in high-crime neighborhoods, parks and other spots around the city. \nThe results in 2013 and 2014 were promising. After the number of homicides spiked past the 500 mark in 2012, the total dropped to 419 in 2013 and 407 last year. But department statistics show homicides have spiked to 343 so far this year — 57 more than at the same point last year. The number of shooting incidents climbed to 1,753 so far this year, or nearly 300 more than in the same period last year. \nChicago is one of several U.S. cities, including Houston, New Orleans, Baltimore and Milwaukee, which have seen spikes in the number of homicides. But Chicago has been at the center of the story of gun violence, particularly since homicides climbed past the 500 mark — far higher than the totals reported in the much larger cities of New York and Los Angeles. \nAnd just this year, film director Spike Lee tackled the subject of gun violence in the city when he came to film a movie titled \"Chiraq.\" \nEmanuel plans to introduce the budget on Tuesday. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T21:18:54.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
