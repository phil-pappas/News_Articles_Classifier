Erin Jonasson by Lucinda Schmidt MBAs are marketed as a springboard to a better job, faster promotion, bigger salary or perhaps a career switch. But most of the focus is on the first two or three moves after finishing the degree. What about 10 or 20 years later, if MBA graduates are in senior roles and seeking to reach the very top? When executive search firms are scrutinising candidates for C-suite or board level jobs, does an MBA make a difference?\nThe answer seems to be no – with a caveat. None of the headhunters interviewed for this story could think of a single example where an MBA had tipped the balance in favour of one C-suite candidate over another. Although employers may brief the search firm that an MBA is highly desirable or preferable, it's certainly not mandatory. For senior appointments, experience and track record overwhelmingly trump educational qualifications.\n\"When we look at CEO candidates, it's much more about past performance and a track record of strategic leadership and results achieved,\" says Anthony Armstrong, managing director of Russell Reynolds in Australia. \"An MBA is not going to differentiate two people in a CEO scenario.\"\nNot just about MBAs And the caveat? An MBA won't be the deciding factor, but it can lay the foundations for strategic and analytical thinking, commercial acumen and problem solving skills that benefit an executive all the way up the food chain, setting them up for promotion or opening up new opportunities. \"It's not a lead indicator, but it can be a precursor to other things they've done,\" Armstrong says, noting that most of his 15 search consultants have the qualification. \"It's not the fact of the MBA, it's how they've used it to broaden their opportunities.\"\nAnd it's not just about MBAs. Armstrong, who holds a master of commerce from the University of NSW, says a postgraduate qualification, such as a doctorate in finance or public policy or a relevant specialist field, will often be viewed favourably for an employer's job description requirements.\nWhere an MBA-type qualification can help is to confirm that, say, an engineering or technology graduate has the skills to move beyond their specialisation into general management. \"It often helps to provide structures and approaches that broaden an executive's capabilities and give them new approaches, new ways of strategically thinking through issues,\" Armstrong says. He also says MBA-qualified candidates may have a stronger understanding of different industries, from their degree and from their friendship network of fellow alumni to act as mentors and sounding boards. \"Definitely the US schools, and increasingly the Australian business schools, provide lifetime connections and peers,\" he says. \"This helps broaden approaches across industries, functions and internationally, which is beneficial even at board level.\"\nCommitment to ongoing learning A third reason an MBA may spark the interest of senior headhunters is that it demonstrates a commitment to ongoing learning. \"There are other things that can show this, but an MBA shows they've invested time and effort at a time when often they are the busiest with their career and family,\" Armstrong says.\nFigures from top Australian and global companies show that an MBA is not a prerequisite for CEOs – but more than one in four have them. A BOSS analysis of the ASX 100-listed companies shows 27 MBA-qualified chief executives (excluding short intensive courses, such as Harvard's eight-week Advanced Management Program).\nThat's similar to Harvard Business Review 's ranking last November of the best performing 100 CEOs from S&P Global 1200 companies, where 29 had MBAs. (Almost as many, 24, had engineering degrees and eight of the global top 100 CEOs had both engineering and MBA degrees).\nThose figures are likely to increase as younger executives move through the ranks, benefiting from the explosion of MBA courses offered in Australia and overseas, and the move to part-time and shorter study options. But ubiquity also lessens the MBA's novelty value of 20 or 30 years ago, when many of today's most senior executives were studying.\n\"MBAs used to set you apart, more so than they do today,\" agrees Lynne Nixon, a senior client partner at Korn/Ferry. \"They have certainly become more common – but they are not quite mandatory.\" Sure, a Harvard MBA will still stand out, even 20 years later, but Nixon says prior experience and performance are always the top criteria. \"I would not shortlist an executive candidate on their MBA alone,\" she says. \"At less senior levels, an MBA is likely to carry more weight. It would help a mid-level manager get over the line, or stand out from their peers, provided their experience and performance also stack up.\"\nLike Armstrong, she says nowadays it's more generally about postgraduate qualifications, not just MBAs, because a bachelor degree is almost a minimum requirement. While an MBA is regarded as a broad business leadership and strategy degree, particular sectors or roles may favour a narrower postgraduate specialisation, such as a master of science degree with a tech/comms major for a CIO candidate or a master of applied finance for a banking role.\nCareer experience over education \"[Conversely], a master of arts majoring in history would have less relevance for a technical role but will demonstrate a candidate's discipline and ability to learn at an advanced level,\" Nixon says. At board level, she says employers rarely request specific educational qualifications because most non-executive directors have had successful executive careers and that's what they are judged on.\nGuy Farrow, managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles' Sydney office, agrees that a person's first corporate board appointment relies on their executive career and not their qualifications. Their second is more about whether they've been a constructive and contributing member of their first board.\nAt very senior executive levels, he too says most employers will request an MBA or some postgraduate qualification – but it's not a deal breaker. \"We wouldn't eliminate someone because they didn't have an MBA, if they had good experience,\" he says. \"Increasingly at higher levels there's a focus on what you've done in your career, you're being judged more on what you've achieved. A good MBA gives you the skill to think through problems, but it doesn't make you any smarter or your IQ any bigger.\"\nStill, he agrees an MBA from a top business school may still have some influence years later because the candidate has undergone a rigorous selection process to get into the school and the degree is likely to be top-notch. \"It's not just the quality of the professors, it's also the quality of the cohort, because you learn a lot from them,\" says Farrow, who has an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles.\nAndrew Horsley, director of boutique search firm, Horsley & Co, used his MBA from the Australian Graduate School of Management to move from law into consulting. He's a big believer in business management education, but says that after almost 30 years in executive search, an MBA has never been the deciding factor for him when ranking job candidates.\n\"It's always nice to see that a candidate has gone to a good business school, it means they've had that discipline,\" he says. \"But it's certainly not fatal if you don't have an MBA. It will always come down to how you've performed, your reputation and how much of a contribution you will make to the business. The key is to be energetic, focused, forward looking and have a vision and a view. An MBA gives you the enabling tools to help you realise that vision and the future for the business, it can help you with the stepping stones, but it is of decreasing importance as you get more senior.\nReal life experience wins hands down. What have you done with your talent in the real world? Employers don't want a highly educated nincompoop.\"\nMajority believe MBA made a difference The Graduate Management Admissions Council's 2015 Alumni Perspectives survey found that 10 years after a postgraduate business degree, one in four people were in executive positions and 5 per cent were in the C-suite.\nOf course it's impossible to know what these statistics would be if the same, presumably talented and ambitious, executives had pursued their career without an MBA. But the vast majority of the 12,000 respondents, from 71 universities across class years 1959-2014, felt their graduate management degree had made a difference.\nFour out of five respondents said it offered opportunities for quicker career advancement and 90 per cent credited their degree with increasing their earning power.\nAt C-suite level, the survey found that the average age of alumni was 48, an average of 17 years post business school graduation.\nThese alumni were more likely to describe themselves as \"innovative, proactive, creative and competitive\" – qualities that are certainly not unique to MBA graduates. In fact, when asked about the reason for their career success, the top response was \"personal effort\" (32 per cent), well ahead of graduate management education (15 per cent). Another 13 per cent nominated their \"attitude to life\" and the same number credited their \"innate abilities\".\nThe Boss 2015 MBA Ranking is published on Friday September 11.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
