No additional details on the settlement were made public. \nSony Pictures declined to comment on the settlement. \nThe news was first reported by Hollywood and media news website deadline.com. \nIn June, a U.S. judge had rejected a bid by Sony Pictures, the entertainment arm of Sony Corp, to dismiss the lawsuit. \nThe former workers, who had sought class-action status on the suit, had said Sony's negligence caused them economic harm by forcing them to beef up credit monitoring to address their greater risk of identity theft. \nThe attack, which surfaced in November, wiped out massive amounts of data and led to the online distribution of email, sensitive employee data and pirated copies of new movies. \n(Reporting by Lehar Maan in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:36:47.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
