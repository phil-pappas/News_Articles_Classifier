As per the existing Delhi Water and Sewer (Tariff and Metering) Regulations, 2012 provisions, the Board sanctions only single bulk water connection to a single property which has more than six flats.\n“Any such property requiring more than six individual water connections was to have an underground tank with boosting arrangement to supply water to the upper floors. Raising the limit of ten connections will benefit lakhs of people,” it said.\nDJB also said that the decision was taken on account of the long-standing demand of consumers living in multi-storey flats numbering more than six and having no underground tank.\n“A lot of properties in the city have been converted into multi story flats requiring more than six water connections and without any provision of an underground tank.\n“These individual flat owners have installed water connections and their applications were pending with DJB for regularisation of water connections,” it said.\nFirst Published on September 13, 2015 6:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T16:18:26.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
