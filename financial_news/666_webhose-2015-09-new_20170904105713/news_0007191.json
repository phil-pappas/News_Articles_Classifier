He also noted that in 2002 the agency downgraded Brazil twice in the same year.\nFitch rates Brazil at BBB, two notches above junk, with a negative outlook. Competing ratings firms have already downgraded Brazil this year - Standard & Poor's to BB-plus, in junk territory; and Moody's Investors Service to Baa3, its lowest investment-grade rating.\nInvestors and even the Brazilian government expect Fitch to catch up with its peers, but the main question has been whether or not it will keep the country's coveted investment grade.\nA second downgrade to junk status is expected to have an even greater market impact than the first, as many investors are required to hold securities with investment-grade ratings from at least two ratings agencies.\nFitch representatives met with Brazilian policymakers last week in Brasilia and a decision on the country's rating could come at any moment. Fitch has kept a negative outlook on Brazil's ratings since April.\nGuedes said Fitch's decision will take into account the likelihood of President Dilma Rousseff getting Congress to pass the austerity measures needed to plug next year's budget gap.\n\"The measures are not difficult to approve, but the government has no support in Congress,\" he said in an event in Sao Paulo.\nGuedes said that Brazil's debt dynamics will not stabilize even if the government delivers a primary budget surplus of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product and the economy grows 1 percent next year. The Brazilian economy is expected to contract 1 percent in 2016.\n(Reporting by Aluisio Alves; Writing by Walter Brandimarte ; Editing by Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:31:07.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
