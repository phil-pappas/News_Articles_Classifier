Mr Boinnet said the white powder had been sent to the government chemist. \nThe vessel had carried 257 Tata vehicles for the UN from Mumbai, India destined for peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n\"During a cargo inspection, which has taken place over the last few days in Mombasa, Kenyan authorities discovered weapons not declared in the cargo manifest, inside some of the UN vehicles. It is our understanding that these weapons belong to the UN vehicles in which they were found, and were for use by the UN during their peacekeeping mission,\" read the statement. \nThe shipment company said they had no information to ascertain whether the white substance found were drugs.
