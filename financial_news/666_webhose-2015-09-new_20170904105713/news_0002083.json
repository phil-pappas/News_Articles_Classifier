Its market share in July stood at just 16.7 per cent, third after private airlines, IndiGo and Jet Airways.\nAir India unions have in the past attributed the decline in its market share to pro-privatisation policies of the successive governments.\n“Senior executives will undertake surprise checks to monitor and supervise the safety and cleanliness inside and outside the aircraft. They will ensure increased servicing of equipment on-board as well,” it said.\nAccording to the release, senior officers from the engineering subsidiary will closely monitor cleaning service providers for quality of cleaning in the cabins.\nBesides, more manpower will be deployed on each aircraft for cabin upkeep, it said, adding that cabin crew and all concerned with aircraft ground operations including engineers, technicians, helpers, cleaning staff, catering and commercial staff are being sensitized to collectively ensure cabin cleanliness and maintain high standards of service.\n 20, 2015 7:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:35:19.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
