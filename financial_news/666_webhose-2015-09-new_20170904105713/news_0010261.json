Minister Mike Bimha (Black suit) with UK-based business people \nAs such, the minister said, the Government together with the private sector was working on a \"number of measures aimed at making the investment environment more friendly\". \nBimha said the London forum had come at a time when government was in the process of implementing its ZIMASSSET which he said identified FDI as a \"critical enabler for economic growth\". \n\"In 2015, FDI is projected to increase by 69% from US$349 million last year to US $591 million on the back of the ease of doing business reforms and the re-engagement process,\" he added. \nHowever, Bimha's visit to London was not without drama as some Zimbabweans, mobilised by the Zimvigil, demonstrated protesting against his presence and denouncing President Robert Mugabe's government. \nThe minister's comments come at a time when Zimbabwe is involved in a desperate bid to attract investors and to get support from the IMF and the Chinese. \nThe IMF recently announced that it could resume funding Zimbabwe early 2016 while China sent down a down government official to assess the country's bankability. \nZimbabwe has struggled along since the turn of the century due to poor relations with the west following the controversial land reform programme which saw the seizure of land from the white farmers. Zimbabwe \nChina's slowing economy is making the US a more attractive investor. see more » Copyright © 2015 New Zimbabwe. All rights reserved. Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media ( allAfrica.com ).
