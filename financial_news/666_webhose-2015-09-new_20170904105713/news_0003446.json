Sean Davey by Ben Potter Tax experts rejected claims by the Australian Council of Social Services that a reform package that cut income taxes but raised the GST would not provide much of a boost to the economy.\nPeter Davidson, ACOSS senior policy adviser, argued at the AFR Tax Reform Summit that the switch from labour income tax to GST would \"not be worth the candle\" because the GST was only slightly more efficient than the income tax.\nMr Davidson based this on Treasury's Re:Think tax discussion paper, which estimated the long-run marginal excess cost burden of a broad-based GST at about 19¢ in the dollar, of a flat rate labour income tax at about 21-30¢ and a company tax at a little more than 40¢.\nBut John Daley, chief executive of the Grattan Institute, said Mr Davidson was being \"naughty\" because the data he cited assumed a flat rate labour income tax of 25¢ in the dollar.\n\"Well we have not got one of those – nothing like,\" Mr Daley said.\n\"The real-life thing is around well, in particular what does it do around participation for people whose marginal rates of take-home pay are way higher than 25 per cent – and at-least it helps.\"\nEstimates differ Grant Wardell-Johnson, head of the Australian Tax Centre at KPMG, which hosted the summit with The Australian Financial Review , said Re:Think underestimated the marginal excess burden of income tax because it excluded the welfare payments and withdrawals.\n Mr Wardell-Johnson said the Re:Think estimates differed from the 2010 Henry review of taxation, which estimated the marginal welfare loss from a broad-based GST at about 8¢ in the dollar, the welfare loss from labour income tax of about 25¢, and the welfare loss from company tax at more than 40¢.\n\"There's difficulty in modelling but there's wide consensus among economists that the GST is a more efficient tax than the personal income tax,\" he said.\nMr Wardell-Johnson said he agreed with Labor's assistant shadow treasurer Andrew Leigh that the estimates also had to take account of costs of compensating low income earners.\n\"And the mere fact that they don't take into account transfer payments affects both elements but obviously over-simplifies things.\"\nFormer Treasury secretary Ken Henry said he stuck to his 2010 view that shifting the tax burden from labour income to consumption would boost the economy.\nFor the tax summit, Grattan modelled a 15 per cent GST which would raise $30 billion, and devoted $11 billion of that to compensating the bottom fifth of households and $19 billion to income tax cuts concentrated in the lower three tax bands.\n\"The reason for that is our best guess is that's where you'll get the biggest impact on participation,\" he said, whereas giving a tax cut to a high-income earner wasn't going to change behaviour very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:05:54.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
