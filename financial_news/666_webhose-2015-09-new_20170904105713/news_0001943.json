But volatility is likely to remain high as markets, like the Fed, will still have to confirm the U.S. economy is withstanding the adverse impact from the global economy,\" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nThe Fed's fresh economic projections showed 13 of 17 policymakers still foresee raising rates at least once in 2015, though that is down from 15 at the last forecast made in June.\nFinancial markets, which have constantly forecast a far slower pace of policy tightening than the Fed's projections, were less convinced.\nInstruments such as federal fund futures <0#FF:> and overnight indexed swap are pricing in only about one in two chance of a rate hike by the end of year.\nThe Fed's decision to keep rates at zero could give some relief to emerging markets, which have long suffered capital outflows on expectation of higher U.S. rates, but trade-reliant Asian economies are likely to remain under pressure as China's economy slows.\nAs the prospects of higher interest rates down the road had been a major attraction for the dollar, the U.S. currency slipped against many other currencies.\nThe dollar index fell to 94.360, its lowest level since Aug 26.\nThe euro jumped to a three-week high of $1.14415 while the British pound also hit a three-week high of $1.5628 . The yen also edged up 120.12 to the dollar from Thursday's low at 120.995.\nLonger-dated U.S. debt yields plunged, with the two-year notes yield dropping to 0.686 percent, returning to its familiar range only a day after it hit a 4 1/2-year high of 0.819 percent.\nThe 10-year notes yield slipped to 2.192 percent from Wednesday's 1 1/2-month high of 2.303 percent.\nCommodity prices were also relatively well-supported with U.S. crude futures last trading at $46.83 per barrel, down slightly from Thursday's high of $47.71 but still up almost 5 percent on the week.\nGold hit a two-week high of $1,136 per ounce.
