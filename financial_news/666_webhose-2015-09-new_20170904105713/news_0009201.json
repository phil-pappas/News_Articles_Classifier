This year, their payout will be partly determined by a new set of numbers: diversity metrics, including how many women they hired in the past year.\nRealizing that simply voicing support for diversity initiatives won’t lead to meaningful change, big companies are setting discrete goals for hiring and retaining women. These include mandating that diverse candidates are interviewed for jobs, and ensuring that new hires get interviewed or vetted by someone other than white men.\nJ&J, Intel Corp. INTC 1.67 % , BASF SE BASFY 1.28 % and many others say putting hard numbers around diversity and tying those numbers to pay and performance helps ensure real progress when it comes to advancing women. Data suggest that the approach makes a difference. But it remains controversial in the U.S., where companies must battle the stigma associated with quotas as well as risks of unintended consequences.\nSignal of importance The approach is one more attempt to speed a slow march toward gender equality in the upper ranks of companies. If firms proceed at their current pace, it will take 25 years to reach parity at the level of senior vice president and more than a century until 50% of C-suite executives are female, according to the Women in the Workplace study done by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co.\nRather than wait for change, managers are setting targets for progress—making it like any other business objective that managers must hit if they want their full compensation.\n“Until you actually put metrics on these things—the way you do everything else business leaders are measured against—you don’t get the right outcomes,” says Sandra Peterson, J&J’s group world-wide chairman.\nJ&J began experimenting with targets in 2013 and rolled them out globally last year. Twice annually, hundreds of J&J leaders get breakdowns of their groups’ diversity and are held to individualized goals; a vice president might aim to go from five female directors in her division to seven. The results will then affect the vice president’s bonus, with diversity representing one part of the leadership score that determines a chunk of incentive pay.\n“People say, ‘You’re discriminating.’ It’s not about that,” Ms. Peterson says. “The signal of the importance of something is whether you’re actually measuring it and you’re holding people accountable to improving those numbers.”\nIn Europe, quotas have become an accepted method of increasing the share of women on corporate boards. But in the U.S., resistance to the approach lingers. Corbett Anderson, assistant legal counsel with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, says employers should “proceed with caution” when implementing targets to make sure they stay on the right side of the law and aren’t creating too high a bar to employment for men and nonminorities.\nEven if the approach is legal, it can still alarm employees.\nAfter diversity goals were implemented at BAE Systems Inc., the U.S. arm of London-based defense company BAE Systems BAESY -0.79 % PLC, Linda Hudson, who was CEO at the time, heard from employees worried that the company would have to compromise on the quality of its workforce to hit targets.\n“Why are we doing this? What’s the point?” she says employees asked her. “I think that’s a natural reaction: ‘When you’re looking for someone other than me, what’s going to happen to me?’ ”\nTech metrics Still, many companies in a range of industries are adopting the metrics-driven approach. In tech, where prominent Silicon Valley companies last year disclosed numbers showing that their workforces are largely male and white or Asian, the efforts seem to be gaining popularity. This summer, Pinterest and Twitter TWTR 1.31 % made diversity goals public. Pinterest, the online scrapbook company, increased its female employees to 42% from 40% over the past year and said its 2016 goals include making sure 30% of its incoming full-time engineers are female.\nTwitter wants its staff to be 35% female by the end of 2016, a rise of one percentage point. It also wants to raise the share of women in tech jobs three percentage points to 16% and the share of women in leadership roles to 25% from 22%. Janet Van Huysse, vice president of diversity and inclusion, says Twitter looked at a variety of data, including Labor Department statistics, to set “credible and achievable” goals.\nShort-term goals should be realistic, and might be on the conservative side for companies that are trying to draw from male-dominated majors such as computer engineering, says Laura Sherbin, director of research at the Center for Talent Innovation, which studies workplace issues. But Ms. Sherbin says she thinks many companies should aim higher.\n“Some action is undoubtedly better than no action,” she says. But “30% to 40% really doesn’t seem like enough.”\nThe Lean In and McKinsey data, which includes some companies studied by McKinsey in 2012, suggests that goal-setting is effective. Firms with established targets in 2012 outpaced those that didn’t set goals when it came to bulking up the share of women in senior management, the organizations said.\nAs CEO of BAE Systems Inc., Linda Hudson says, she heard from employees concerned about the impact of diversity goals. Photo: Hyungwon Kang/Reuters Getting granular with the metrics and keeping feedback timely make a difference, according to Richard Taylor, senior vice president and director of human resources for Intel, whose CEO, Brian Krzanich, in January announced a $300 million commitment to increase workforce diversity. Intel’s push includes a dashboard that updates in nearly real time, providing about 500 of its leaders with information on hiring of women in their division and retention of minorities.\nMr. Krzanich gets a weekly summary of the data and sets a tone of accountability by “sending either encouraging or not-encouraging notes to people,” Mr. Taylor says. The CEO may note, for example, that a subordinate’s representation rate is lacking and ask what he’s doing to fix it. “That keeps people on their toes,” Mr. Taylor says.\nSo do incentives. Everyone at Intel gets an additional bonus—equal to as much as 7% of the person’s total bonus, though it varies by person—if the company hits two goals: hiring 40% minorities and women and ensuring that the retention rate of that group is at least equal to that of white and Asian men.\nSuch targets can yield results, but they also have the potential to backfire. Once given a goal, employees may “do lots of other dysfunctional things” to achieve that goal, says Max Bazerman, a professor at Harvard University who has studied the impact of goal-setting on human behavior. For example, someone who has been directed to hire more women might meet that bar, but could place them into less attractive positions or fail to promote them.\n“The more people are checking off boxes, the less they’re focusing on how to make this organization both fair and excellent,” he says.\nCompanies like simple, clear-cut initiatives—such as an approach known as the Rooney rule—because they’re easy to talk about, says Joelle Emerson, whose consulting firm, Paradigm, works with Pinterest and Slack on diversity initiatives. The Rooney rule, born in the National Football League as a way to ensure that teams interviewed minority candidates for head-coaching jobs, is now being transplanted to companies such as Facebook Inc., FB -2.85 % where some managers must have at least one diverse candidate on the slate for open jobs.\nThe North American arm of chemical manufacturing company BASF formalized its own version of the Rooney rule this year. Managers are expected to interview at least one woman or minority candidate for all open jobs and are required to do so for thousands of leadership roles. And at least one of the people doing the interviewing must also be a woman or minority.\nPatricia Rossman, BASF North America’s chief diversity officer, says it is “human nature for people to sometimes want to hire themselves.” But metrics and rules can combat that tendency, she says.\nAbout five years ago, the company found it was losing female employees nearly twice as fast as other workers. After adopting the Rooney rule and targets, the company now sheds 6% of its female employees a year, compared with 8% of all employees.\n“It matters that we operate with more intentionality in some of these areas and less patience,” she says.\nMs. Feintzeig is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
