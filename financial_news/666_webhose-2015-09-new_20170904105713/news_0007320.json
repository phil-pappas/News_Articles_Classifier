Paul Rovere by Mark Abernethy The value of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the exporting effort can be dramatic, with the latest statistics showing that 70 per cent of growth in Australian exporters in the 2014 financial year, was attributable to SMEs.\nAnd of the 2788 services exporters in 2013-14, 1662 of them were in the \"less than $1 million\" value range, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nEFIC's SME Export Index for the first quarter of 2015 shows sustained buoyancy among small and medium exporters, with 39 per cent of the survey expecting their export sales to increase over the next year and 28 per cent of exporters forecasting their exporting profits to increase over the next 12 months.\nHowever, the performance of SME exporters comes with a major caveat. Since the start of 2014, SME exporters reporting difficulty accessing finance has more than doubled and in the 2015 EFIC survey 58 per cent of the business owners expected export-related finance to be a problem in the next 12 months.\nThe main problem occurs when small businesses export into the Asia-Pacific region and there is a funding gap between the costs of fulfilling an order, and receiving payment.\nExecutive director of export finance at EFIC, Andrew Watson, says Australian SMEs are dynamic and often see exporting as a natural extension of their growth plans, but in the early days offshore orders can represent a major proportion of their business.\n\"In order to break in to a market in China, the business is probably required to fulfil minimum orders,\" says Watson, \"which are large by comparison with what the business does domestically. There is usually a cost of scaling-up for Asia-Pacific markets.\"\nOrder size causes strain He says the size of orders also puts strain on smaller companies' cash flow.\n\"In the manufacturing or food industries, it could take 60 days to make the order, and then 90 days to be paid.\"\nEFIC lends money against the order, so the client can fund its costs. And if EFIC backs the exporter, it also allows its AAA rating to be used if the client prefers to borrow directly from their bank (with AFIC providing the guarantee).\nWatson says EFIC also writes bonds for the exporters.\n\"Sometimes the offshore trading partner requires a bond against the order, usually 10 per cent of the order's total value. Banks write these bonds at dollar-for-dollar value, but we provide the bonds for as low as 20 per cent of the dollar value of the bond. Our bonds free-up cash flow.\"\nWatson says EFIC fills an important niche for SME exporters, because it funds finance facilities at the pre-shipment stage.\n\"A business's trade finance bank takes a different view of risk,\" says Watson. \"A bank will provide finance when the order is on the ship and you have the invoice. We cover the pre-shipment phase.\"\nWatson says EFIC lent $113 million to 95 small and medium-sized exporters in the last financial year, supporting about $500 million in export contracts.\nHe says EFIC operates in a specific part of the market, lending to exporters who have already licked-down their markets, partners and clearances but who need working capital prior to shipment.\nHe says the risk is not as great as it might seem.\n\"We have offices in the major cities, and our clients deal with a manager,\" says Watson. \"There's a lot of information they need to provide, but meeting the owners is still the key to understanding the business and the opportunity.\"\nPolitical risk assessment EFIC doesn't just fund working capital facilities, it assesses political risk in emerging markets such as Sri Lanka, Burma and Bangladesh, and insures Australian exporters into those countries – but in different ways, depending on the size of the trade.\n\"We have a political risk insurance product for the larger companies,\" says Watson. \"But the cost of it only really makes sense for big contracts.\"\nEFIC's political risk insurance covers potential losses due to political risks in emerging markets. It covers expropriation, political violence, currency inconvertibility, transfer risks and breach of contract, for investors, lenders and contractors and their equipment.\nHe says smaller exporters are \"insured\" against sovereign risk by EFIC advisers mitigating risk around the transaction.\n\"We encourage small exporters to really know who the counter-party is, and to have bank letters of credit. They can gain a certain amount of insurance by using their bank – we do a country risk assessment.\"\nHe says EFIC often covers the 'bank risk' – the risk that an emerging market bank won't transfer funds.\nOne of the largest trade finance providers in Australia, ANZ Bank, acknowledges that while Australia has a dynamic and offshore-focused small business sector, most of the business owners need help at some point.\nFTA Tool turns text into plain English \"We start with just giving business owners the information,\" says Kip Hanna, head of super regional business development at ANZ. \"We've developed an FTA Tool, which simplifies free trade agreements to plain English and allows business owners to search by industry and market and see tariff reductions at a glance.\"\nHanna says ANZ has a well-publicised $3 billion trade finance pledge currently in force, to attract business owners to exporting. But he says the bank also works on providing the advisory and helping-hand services that can make or break small exporters.\n\"We work with exporters on mitigating risk and better understanding their counter-parties in various markets,\" says Hanna.\nHe says the bank has a 34-market network and one-third of its workforce is now in the Asia-Pacific, giving on-the-ground expertise and timely market intelligence to exporting customers.\nSME exporters worked to tight cash-flow cycles and so the bank had developed its Trade Portal platform for trade finance customers, allowing the customers top to track their orders and transactions, he says.\nHanna says ANZ was also working with Austrade and taking roadshows to Asia-Pacific, the latest being an eight-day tour of China for Australian beef producers.\n\"We can write guarantees, organise trade finance and do all the foreign exchange and payments,\" says Hanna. \"But the SME customers also need insight and understanding.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:51:52.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
