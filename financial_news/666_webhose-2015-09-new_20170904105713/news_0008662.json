Simon Dawson by Jonathan Shapiro Australian sharemarket investors can take comfort in the fact that they're a long way from two of the global market's corporate pain-trades.\nBut it's a different story in the Australian bond market where both Volkswagen and Glencore have left their mark, or rather a dent, on a few local debt portfolios.\nThe bonds of these apparently high quality investment grade companies have been pounded along with their shares as investors reassess as to just how safe their debt exposures to these companies are.\nVolkswagen, which has a high A credit rating, has six lines of bonds outstanding in the Australian market and holders have been caught out by a swift repricing that has followed the carbon emissions cheating scandal which claimed the CEO's scalp overnight on Wednesday.\nCredit traders have repriced the risk of a debt in Volkswagen and Glencore from negligible to very possible Bloomberg The $250 million August 2019 bonds sold last month have lost 4 per cent of value in just three days – a hefty hit – as the spread over the benchmark rate has increased from 75 basis points to 210 basis points, to yield 4.4 per cent.\nVolkswagen's financing arm has also recently begun to issue asset-backed securities in the Australian bond market, raising about $1 billion in two deals but these are less likely to be affected, as the primary exposure is to borrowers rather than the auto-maker.\nWhile few could have anticipated the scandal at VW, Commonwealth Bank credit analyst Scott Rundell does believe the auto sector is riskier than the price of its debt suggests.\n\"We believe they trade way too tight relative to the risk, and are priced more like a consumer staple business rather than a cyclical industry,\" he says.\n Glencore bonds down\nFor investors in Glencore's $500 million September 2019 bonds sold exactly a year ago, the experience has been equally unpleasant. The 'BBB' bonds printed at a spread of 140 basis points over the swap rate and traded as wide as 270 basis points this month, before settling at around 250 basis points. That equates to about a 2 per cent loss over two months.\nGlencore has taken the role of the commodity market whipping boy with some well known hedge funds shorting its shares .\n\"It doesn't have the best assets and is a commodities trading business. Once the price of commodities dropped, its ability to skim margins has reduced,\" says Rundell.\nThe company's no-nonsense CEO Ivan Glasenberg's reputation for reading commodity markets has taken a knock, as has his bank balance when he and other staff committed 22 per cent of the $US2.5 billion capital it raised to reduce its debt.\nBut neither equity nor credit markets were convinced the worst was over for Glencore as the share price has fallen by a further 10 per cent while five-year credit default swaps had settled back to 300 basis points have now blown back out to 470 basis points. It's been worse though, Glencore suffered a near-death experience in 2008 as a private company when its credit spreads blew out to more than 2000 basis points. Access to emergency capital via the stock market is believed to be one of the reasons Glasenberg took the company public.\nThe moves in VW and Glencore bonds are relatively brutal in a sleepy market where spreads seldom move by more than a few basis points. But the pain is likely to be more than manageable. These companies remain well within their investment grade bands and a long way from even a whiff of a default – even though movements in credit derivative markets might suggest otherwise.\nIn fact these bonds are likely to comprise small parts of most corporate bond portfolios which are diversified across hundreds of names to guard against these risks.\nOf far more relevance to bond investors is the health of the Australian banks which comprise the largest single exposures.\nThe debt spreads of the big four banks have also widened amid rising risk aversion in credit markets – with the cost of insuring against the default of a major bank rising by 30 per cent since June 30, to its highest level since January 2014.\nCorporate credit has clearly not been immune from this recent bout of market volatility. Australian and corporate credit spreads, which have widened for the best part of a year, have continued to push out as investors demand more return for the risks of lending to even high-grade companies.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/26/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-passport-capital-managing-partner-cio-john-burbank-speaks-with-cnbcs-kate-kelly-on-closing-bell-today.html"], "published": "2015-09-24T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:06:06.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
