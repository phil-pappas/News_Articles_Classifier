Other factors behind these moves included slowing Chinese growth and the related fall in export revenues for commodity exporters.\" \nAccording to Moody's, when the anticipated Fed move occurs, there remains a low risk of a disorderly reaction should an initial move by the Fed cause investors to abruptly adjust their expectations for yields. \nThe biggest downward currency moves among the largest emerging markets during the course of 2015 occurred in Brazil, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, and Indonesia, with an average depreciation against the dollar of about 17% since the beginning of the year. \n\"Although currency depreciations can augur well for exports, they tend to be accompanied by turbulence in domestic financial markets, which can affect overall growth,\" said Moody's. \n\"Also, sluggish demand in trading partners has limited improvements in export performance in most emerging market exporters, despite the depreciation of their currencies.\" \nThat is why Moody's expects that the combination of these factors will lead to slow or negative economic growth in many emerging markets. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:40:34.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
