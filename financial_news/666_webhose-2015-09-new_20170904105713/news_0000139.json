Currently, only Lucentis, a product of Novartis, is available in the Chinese market. However, in Dec. 2013, as the first self- developed drug for the treatment of wet AMD in China, conbercept ophthalmic injection got CFDA's approval. \nRanibizumab developed fast after entering China, with sales value in 19 sample hospitals in key cities in 2014 reaching CNY 245 million with a year-on-year growth of 26.29% and CAGR during the last three years reaching 200%. With ageing population, the incidence of macular degeneration goes up gradually. Hence the vast demand for ranibizumab in China. Currently, ranibizumab injections in mainland China all come from Novartis. But as conbercept ophthalmic injection is proved by the clinical studies to improve vision better with a lower administration frequency, it is expected to break the monopoly of Novartis in the wet AMD drug market in the next few years. \nReaders can get at the following information from this report: \n- market size of ranibizumab in China \n- competitive landscape of ranibizumab in the Chinese market \n- price of ranibizumab made by different enterprises in China \n- market outlook of ranibizumab in China \nKey Topics Covered: \n1 Related Concepts of Ranibizumab \n2 Market Profile of Ranibizumab in China \n3 Survey on Sales Status of Ranibizumab in China, 2012-2014 \n4 Survey on Market Share of Major Manufacturers of Ranibizumab in China, 2012-2014 \n5 Survey on Dosage Forms of Ranibizumab in China, 2012-2014 \n6 Reference Price of Ranibizumab in Chinese Hospitals in 2014 \n7 Major Manufacturers of Ranibizumab in Chinese Market, 2012-2014 \n8 Market Outlook of Ranibizumab in China, 2015-2019 \nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vc9d2h/investigation \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150828005311/en/ \nContact: Research and Markets\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com \nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nSector: Chemicals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:00:27.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
