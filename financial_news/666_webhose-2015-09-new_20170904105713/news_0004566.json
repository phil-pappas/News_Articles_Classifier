The loan which is yet to hit the account of the Bank of Ghana is expected to further help appreciation of the local currency. \nGovernment is projecting that a little over 4 billion dollars is expected to hit Bank of Ghana’s account before end of the year. \nThe reserves of the Bank of Ghana will be boosted by inflows from the cocoa loan syndication, EUROBOND sale and inflows from IMF’s disbursement under the extended credit facility and inflows from the country’s donor partners. \nAccording to figures from the Bank of Ghana, the country’s international reserves as at August this year stood at 4.5 billion dollars. \nHowever if these reserves do not witness any sharp depletion, then the reserves could hit over 9 billion dollars by end of year. However figures from the Bank of Ghana show that on a monthly basis, the country actually spends a little over 1 billion dollars on imports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:38:17.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
