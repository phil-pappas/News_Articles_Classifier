For Hong Kong, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s message will be bittersweet.\nOn the one hand due to its currency USDHKD, +0.0013% peg to the U.S. dollar, there will be some relief that its liquidity-driven economy will be spared the undoubted shock of an immediate rate hike. Hong Kong has to directly follow U.S. monetary policy due to its exchange-rate mechanism.\nBut on the other, the fact that the Fed is widely believed to be biding its time due to worries about China should be troubling. If the world’s largest economy is concerned about the fallout from China all the way across the Pacific, what about sitting on the tip of its southern coast? Already Hong Kong has been feeling the chill as mainland Chinese visitor numbers dropped almost 10% in July.\nXi Jinping's Packed U.S. Trip in 60 Seconds (1:14) Chinese President Xi Jinping lands in the U.S. on Tuesday and will embark on a whirlwind of meetings. Here's a quick guide to Xi's itinerary.\nBut beyond the direct economic fallout, of more lasting concern are the same governance issues that triggered the recent global markets rout .\nThis summer’s succession of botched government interventions demonstrated how little President Xi Jinping’s administration understands the workings of markets and capital. The mishandling of the yuan USDCNY, +0.0581% devaluation unintentionally created new policy uncertainty, making further weakness the base case for many analysts. The arrest of short sellers and share suspensions has been similarly counterproductive as even local fund managers head for the exits.\nHong Kong may be next to feel the unintended consequences of the clumsy hand of Beijing. Last week China’s top representative in the city threatened the independence of the judiciary , long recognized as a cornerstone of its economic success.\nZhang Xiaoming, director of the Chinese government’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong caused an uproar after announcing that Chief Executive C.Y. Leung had a “special legal position that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.” The fear now is that Leung and future chief executives will become something akin to a feudal emperor, carrying out the wishes of Beijing.\nThis also demonstrates how a year on from vetoing democracy aspirations in Hong Kong after 75 days of protests, Beijing is not in any mood to build bridges. Aside from the potential to mobilize a much-wider political opposition, this assault on its institutional system of governance threatens the core of Hong Kong’s economy.\nMuch of its success as a logistics and financial hub is built on a freely convertible capital account and independent judiciary, where businesses have confidence in the rule of law and minimal interference from government.\nSimilarly its success as a shopping and investment destination for mainland Chinese is not just based on its low tax regimes but also its legal system, which gives an added security that comes from being in a separate jurisdiction.\nThese differences are accentuated next to China’s model of state-capitalism where the lines between business and government routinely converge.\nIndeed, much of the freewheeling city-state’s success can be explained by its opportunistic ability to arbitrage these differences. Sometimes this means when China drags its feet on reform, this can help Hong Kong. For example, delays in currency or stock-market liberalization in China allows Hong Kong to play an important role as an offshore yuan hub and capital market.\nBut this is unlikely to work if reform just means Hong Kong becoming more like Communist China.\nHere Beijing’s belief in a “transcendent” chief executive, effectively above the law, is troubling. This would remove the institutional oversight that gives investors and business the confidence that they are all equal before the law.\nAlready eyebrows have been raised in Hong Kong about perceived political interference from north of the border that appeared to undermine due process in handing out television licenses and cellular spectrum.\nThe latter was particularly controversial as it pitted China’s giant state operator China Mobile against the city’s largest tycoons. This penalized Asia’s richest man, Li-ka Shing of Hutchison Whampoa Group and subsequently led to speculation that was the reason he has been selling down Hong Kong assets.\nNotably last week HSBC HSBC, +0.87% Chairman Douglas Flint hinted that the bank would likely retain its domicile in the U.K. After announcing earlier it was considering moving its domicile, many had thought Hong Kong was a shoe-in given it accounts for the bulk of profits and has a substantially lower tax rate.\nBut would global businesses really want to put their faith in Hong Kong if China is determined to extend its highly visible hand of one-party governance? Running Hong Kong might appear easier if the chief executive has absolute power to follow Beijing’s policy shots.\nBut one thing is very different between Hong Kong and China — capital and businesses are already free to come and go. They come because it works. Beijing should beware unintended damage to Hong Kong from clumsy intervention.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/controlling-hong-kong-1442533198", "http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1858484/zhang-xiaomings-controversial-speech-hong-kong-governance"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:14:04.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
