Andrew Meares by Jason Clout Businesses need to adapt to what is amounting to a virtual intra-Asian trading environment on the back of recent trade negotiations.\nAlong with the free trade agreements which have been signed or are pending with various nations – although there are questions over the China FTA – there are also a number of important multi-lateral agreements being discussed such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is being negotiated by Minister for Trade Andrew Robb, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\nThe TPP includes a number of Pacific-rim countries including the US and Japan while RCEP is the ASEAN nations plus China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. Australia is in both the TPP and RCEP.\nIn addition to the trade talks is China's mammoth One Belt One Road project. Drawing on the ancient Silk Road which connected China in the east to the west, building the modern land and sea routes could cost about $US1.5 trillion ($2.1 trillion).\nJames Hogan, head of commercial banking for HSBC in Australia, says Australian businesses need to understand the scale and speed with which trade is changing in the region.\n\"While the TPP had a delay in the negotiations in Hawaii recently, it is a question of when, not if, it will be signed. About a third of Australia's total trade in goods and services is in the countries of the TPP while RCEP accounts for 30 per cent of global trade.\"\n\"Then we have the situation where there is the kickstart being provided by the One Belt One Road project. HSBC research indicates there is an $US11 trillion infrastructure gap in Asia by 2020.\"\nOpportunities should abound on the back of the trade deals and infrastructure programs, says Hogan. Australian healthcare and design businesses could be two which might flourish, while HSBC says agricultural exports to China could provide a four-fold increase to GDP if an Australia-China FTA produced the same proportional increase as it did in New Zealand.\n \"But businesses have to prepare for the new conditions. Trade can be complex but getting to grips with that complexity can produce tangible benefits.\"\nChief economist greater China for ANZ, Li-Gang Liu, noted in a research article the breadth of China's One Belt One Road initiative.\n\"The economic content and potential benefits are tremendous both domestically and globally,\" he says.\n\"China has never been such profile and proactive in international economic affairs. Through deepening the economic cooperation with dozens of countries as well as integrating the efforts of 31 provinces, the program has the potential to help China (and the global economy) leap to the next level of globalisation and is consistent with China's need to transform its domestic economy into an outward-orientated state.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:49:34.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
