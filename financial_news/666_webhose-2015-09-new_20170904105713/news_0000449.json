Variety, citing multiple unnamed sources, is now reporting that the mystery buyer was indeed Swift. \nThe 11,000-square-foot mansion would be Swift's second in Beverly Hills — she also owns a $3.55 million home there, in addition to properties in New York City, Rhode Island, and two in Nashville. \nThe Goldwyn Estate has six bedrooms, a tennis court, guest apartment, swimming pool, and large gardens. Goldwyn frequently used his home to host stars of the golden age of Hollywood, including Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Bette Davis, and Frank Capra. Though Goldwyn died in 1974, the estate had belonged to his son, the late Samuel Goldwyn Jr., ever since. \nSwift addressed Variety's report in a tweet Tuesday. \nWhat the press says I'm doing: Buying a Bev Hills mansion, getting married in an English castle What I'm doing: Playing a show in St. Louis — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) September 29, 2015 Since the sale closed earlier in September (and she had been in Los Angeles for the VMAs around the same time) it's still very possible that Swift was the buyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:27:36.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
