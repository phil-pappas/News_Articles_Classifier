(Bloomberg News file photo) Skanska plans to expand U.S. office property By: Bloomberg News September 29, 2015 1:30 pm 0 \nSwedish construction company Skanska AB is considering expanding its U.S. property development business to cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles where a technology boom is fueling demand for office space. \n“We have the opportunity to do more now,” Mats Johansson, head of Skanska’s U.S. commercial development unit, said in an interview Monday in Stockholm. Skanska already operates in Washington, Seattle and Boston, where competition for prime land has made new projects harder to come by. \nAs U.S. unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since April 2008, demand for office space is at its highest levels since the recession, with leased space expected to rise by about 47 million square feet this year, 48 percent more than in 2014, according to real-estate data provider Reis. Skanska entered the market in 2009 and expects to start one new project in Washington and another in Boston before the end of the year. \nIn addition to the two California cities, Skanska is also considering new developments in Miami, Denver and Dallas as part of its U.S. expansion plan, Johansson said in the interview. \n“Those are examples of cities we know well, where we have construction operations, and which have the right fundamental growth drivers and demographic properties,” he said. “They are successful cities with strong growth and quality of life.” \nWithin the next couple of years, Skanska expects to make a decision on entering one or two new U.S. markets. “The next step is to narrow down the list, and then you need to have people on the ground to understand the local market,” Johansson said. \nSkanska develops office property in central Europe and the Nordic countries. It started its first U.S. office projects in the wake of the financial crisis sparked seven years ago by the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. when many developers had a hard time borrowing funds. \nIts first U.S. office project was a building at 10th Street in Washington, D.C., which cost about $85 million to develop and sold three years later in 2012 for $140 million. \nReis forecasts 3.6 percent office rent growth in 2016, the highest since 2007, and expects vacancies to fall to the lowest level since 2008. Economic growth and demand for office space fueled by the expansion of technology companies in cities like Seattle and San Francisco has made it harder for Skanska to find land at reasonable prices. \n“Some of the fantastic projects we did in the beginning will be hard to repeat,” Johansson said. “It’s not impossible in any way. It’s just more difficult.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:16:32.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
