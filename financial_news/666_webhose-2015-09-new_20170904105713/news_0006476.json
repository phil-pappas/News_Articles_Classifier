We have a fire, I repeat, we are evacuating.\" \nPassengers on flight told how the flight crew suddenly ordered them to evacuate the plane as they realised an engine had burst into flames. \nMcCarran International Airport confirmed all passengers and crew had made it off the plane and been taken back to the terminal by bus. \nAn airport spokeswoman said: \"We cannot express enough gratitude to the emergency response crews, as well as the British Airways crew.\" \nFirefighters stationed at the airport reached the plane two minutes after getting reports of flames, and within five minutes everyone inside the plane had escaped. \nAfter the flames were put out, emergency vehicles could be seen surrounding the aircraft, which was left a grey colour from the smoke. \nThe injured were taken to Sunrise Hospital, with most receiving treatment after hurting themselves while sliding down inflatable chutes to escape the aircraft. \nBritish Airways said: \"We are looking after customers after an incident involving flight BA2276 due to travel from Las Vegas to London Gatwick Airport.\" \nFederal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the plane's left engine caught fire and an investigation was under way. \nThe National Transportation Safety Board was collecting information about the incident, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the agency in Washington. \nOne of the airport's runways was shut down, but operations continued on the other three runways, officials said. \nFormer pilot and former head of flight operations Mike Vivian told Sky News such an incident is \"very, very rare\" and that the Boeing 777-200 is \"a very successful aircraft\". \nHe added: \"I'm reluctant to speculate (what happened). But clearly this is a combination of an engine and fuel that has ignited and sometimes you have these massive blades inside that disintegrate but, beyond that, it's probably unwise to go further. \n\"\"The pilots are mentally prepared for this eventuality, however rare it is. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a very well-rehearsed routine with both the cabin crew and the pilots.\" \nIn its 21-year history, the 777-200 has been involved in two fatal crashes, one in July 2013 that killed three passengers when an Asiana Airlines (KSE: 020560.KS - news ) flight landed short of San Francisco International Airport's runway, and Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that disappeared last year and has yet to be recovered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:23:57.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
