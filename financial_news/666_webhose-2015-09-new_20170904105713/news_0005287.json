David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Evolution Mining's executive chairman Jake Klein had just completed a very bullish presentation to the Sydney Mining Club on Thursday when Chanticleer stumped him with one simple question â€“ how do you value a gold company?\nKlein was brutally honest when he said anyone can prepare a spreadsheet to value a gold mining company but the determinants of value all depend upon the assumptions made.\nThe assumptions are as long as your arm based on the latest analysis of the drivers of the gold price published by analysts at Nomura. The top seven key drivers of the gold price are: the US dollar, US real interest rates, risk sentiment, central bank buying and selling of gold, mine supply, Chinese demand and Indian demand.\nNomura this week reviewed all these drivers this week and the conclusions for gold bugs were not good.\nA strong US dollar is bad for gold because gold is primarily traded in US dollars. The US dollar is up 5.9 per cent this year and that is weighing on the gold price.\nPositive real interest rates make gold a less attractive asset. It is bearish for gold when US Treasury bonds yield more than non-yielding gold on an inflation adjusted basis and with a Fed induced lift off in rates due later this year that spells more volatility for the gold price.\nChanging risk sentiment affects gold but the recent sell-off in shares in China did little to boost gold buying, according to Nomura.\nCentral banks in emerging economies are expected to buy less gold in the future after being big buyers in recent years.\n Long term mine supply is expected to fall as global mine grades are declining. The Nomura analysts conclude that there was a 191-tonne surplus of gold in the first half of 2015, which is almost equal to the 205-tonne surplus for the entire year of 2014.\nThere are mixed messages from China. In the first six months of the year, China's jewellery scrap volumes rose 9 per cent year on year to 85 tonnes, while jewellery and physical bar and coins fell 22 per cent year on year to 357 tonnes, according to GFMS data, Nomura said. \"Recent yuan devaluation and fall in the gold price did not see a similar gold rush buying in April 2013,\" the broker said. The broker remains bullish longer term. \"Cultural affinity to gold as well as rising middle-class income and urbanisation would provide support to global demand,\" it said.\nIndia recorded a pick-up in August gold imports but that was likely due to earlier restocking, rather than consumer demand.\nPut all that together and there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about buying gold or purchasing shares in gold miners.\nKlein told the Sydney Mining Club that the two biggest factors working in favour of Evolution Mining were the quality of its mines and the depreciation in the Australian dollar .\nThe fall in the dollar has lowered the cost of production and lifted the amount earned from each ounce of gold sold in US dollars.\nEvolution has had a stunning year on the share market with its stock up 166 per cent since January. It has been a transformative year with the purchase of the Cowal mine from Barrick Gold and a combination with Egyptian controlled group La Mancha, which owns 31 per cent of the company. The company's market capitalisation has risen from $300 million to $1.6 billion.\nSeveral analysts have a \"buy\" rating on Evolution shares based on analysis using the net present value of future cashflows.\nIt has been a game changing year for Evolution, which is now Australia's second largest gold producer. If the company can deliver what Klein is promising it will be the new star of the local gold mining market.\nCredit cards The decision by Labor Senator Sam Dastyari to heartily endorse a credit card switching campaign that will deliver significant commercial benefits to News Corp and Seven West Media looks a little strange to say the least.\nDastyari has thrown his weight behind the One Big Debt Switch campaign being run in the News Corp papers and on Channel Seven by a company called One Big Switch Pty Ltd\nOne Big Switch was founded by former adviser to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Lachlan Harris. The company is partly owned by News Corp.\nThe endorsement of the campaign is strange for two reasons. Dastyari is supposed to be conducting an independent inquiry into the credit card market.\nHis public statements have indicated he wants to encourage increased competition including the use of peer to peer lending.\nBut the One Big Debt Switch campaign does not offer any dramatic market changing solutions. It is simply imposing itself between card issuers and consumers in order to boost the profits of the company in the middle clipping the ticket.\nWhile the One Big Debt Switch is dressed up as a campaign for helping consumers to save money, the reality is it will just be reheating the existing credit card offerings.\nSubmissions to Dastyari's inquiry by the big banks include data showing that Australians are already aware that there are a range of competitive cards offering different interest rates and features.\nWestpac's submission said consumers can currently choose from more than 80 credit card providers from banks, credit unions and non-bank institutions offering more than 250 different products.\nConsumers are already voting with their feet in order to get a better deal. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia submission to the inquiry says that its low rate card which carries an interest rate of 13.49 per cent is now the bank's most popular credit card.\nIt comprises more than 42 per cent of new applications, compared to around 33 per cent in 2011. Existing customers on CBA Awards and CBA low fee cards have transferred more than $1 billion in balances to low rate cards since July 1, 2011.\nChanticleer suspects that one of the best pieces of advice that Dastyari's inquiry could offer credit card users will be in relation to lifting Australia's standards of education in relation to financial literacy. That means teaching children and less well informed adults about the dangers of using credit cards for revolving unsecured borrowing, the availability of competitive products in the credit card market and the emerging unsecured lending alternatives thanks to disruptive fintech technologies such as peer to peer lending.\nIf Dastyari wants to encourage independent, well informed thinking by consumers he might want to point them in the direction of all the intermediaries offering comparison services including Mozo, InfoChoice and Cannex rather than favouring one provider.\nPrivatising ASIC's registry The privatisation of the registry business currently run by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission presents a perfect opportunity to remove red tape and make Australia a more attractive place to do business.\nBut the early indications from the federal government are not positive.\nIt is possible that the privatisation of the ASIC registry will be used as an opportunity to maximise the amount of money raised for debt reduction without passing on any benefits to business. An inquiry last year into the performance of ASIC recommended that the introduction of a user-pays model for funding ASIC should be used as an opportunity to reduce the fees prescribed for chargeable matters under the Corporations (Fees) Act 2001 with a view to bringing the fees charged in Australia in line with the fees charged in other jurisdictions.\nThat recommendation could go by the wayside. In order to maximise the sale proceeds it is possible the government will simply add the $260 million in cost recovery fees on top of the existing revenues of $680 million.\nThat explains why the estimates for the value of the ASIC registry business range so widely.\nIn other countries, there is no cost for searching information about registered companies. Also, it is much cheaper to register a company.\nResearch conducted by Nathan Lynch, a regulatory analyst with Thomson Reuters, has shown that about 80 per cent of the fees charged by ASIC's registry are paid by small business.\nRod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is right on top of the issues thrown up by privatisation and the incentives for governments to structure their privatisation processes in a manner that maximises the sale price they receive.\nIn a speech being delivered to Infrastructure Partnerships Australia on Friday, Sims will say that the incentive to maximise sale prices can sometimes result an effective 'tax' on future generations.\nHe says in the longer term, a less competitive market structure will lead to higher priced and lower quality goods and services for consumers.\nSims is also concerned about \"the selling of monopoly or near monopoly assets without appropriate access and/or pricing controls, such as Part IIIA undertakings or robust State or Territory access regimes.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-03T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:09:09.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
