Well, we have some options for you. \nVolkswagen admitted to using software to cheat on emission tests on its diesel cars in the U.S., which regulators estimate to have affected about 482,000 cars sold in the U.S. (the tally is closer to 11 million cars worldwide). Those cars include models Jetta, Beetle, Golf, Passat and Audi sold over multiple years. Essentially the software made it look like the cars involved were more fuel efficient than they actually were. \nSo what's the big deal about diesel fuel anyway? \"Much of the appeal of diesels comes from their fuel economy , which is typically better than that of their gasoline-powered equivalents,\" despite higher price tags for the vehicles, according to Edmunds.com.

Ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels also help reduce emissions from these vehicles,\" the report said. \nTheStreet culled the 2016 fuel economy guide for diesel cars not made by Volkswagen or any of its other brands. The vehicles on this list all use ultra-low sulfur diesel and they're ranked from least fuel-efficient to most. \n9. Ram 1500 \nThe 2016 Ram 1500 two-wheel drive has a 3.0 liter, 6-cylinder, automatic 8-speed turbo engine and gets an average 23 miles to the gallon. The four-wheel drive version gets 22 miles to the gallon. It has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $26,045.
