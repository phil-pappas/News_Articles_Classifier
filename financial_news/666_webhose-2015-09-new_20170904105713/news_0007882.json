Armando Arorizo Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby The US offers global property investors the greatest prospects for capital growth, with key cities that will undergo strong growth with an affluent population, according to real estate agency Savills.\nLA, Miami, New York and San Francisco are the cities that lead the ranking of 27 locations by the capital appreciation prospects of second homes in prime markets in Savills' World Residential Markets 2015-2016 report.\nThe US housing market isn't set for growth across the board though. It is polarised between high-growth major cities and slower-recovering, better-supplied areas like the Mid West. The dynamic at work in the US is also at work in other countries, the report says.\n\"US cities have been undergoing a renaissance in the last few decades, a trend accelerated by the rise of new technologies and creative classes attracted to vibrant urban environments,\" the report says.\nThe attractions of global cities that are reinventing themselves have not gone unnoticed. They have drawn at least two Australian architecture firms, Woods Bagot - which is basing itself in New York - and BVN , as they seek to not only tap the growing demand for design services, but also tap the pool of talented people that move there.\nDubai, Singapore and London are the next three locations in Savills' list. Residential prices fell almost 60 per cent between 2008 and 2011 in Dubai, but reducing volatility in property prices and improving infrastructure in what is regarded as a global centre of business make it an attractive destination again. Singapore's soft, but globally favoured, prime residential market offers opportunities. London will benefit from low interest rates and continued strong demand.\nSydney ranks half-way down the list at 14 on the list. After a lengthy period of sustained growth, investors will in the short term start looking at other Australian cities or asset classes, meaning the city is in for a slower period of capital appreciations. But prospects are good in the medium- to-long term, Savills says.\n\"Demand for city centre locations is still strong, particularly from younger generations,\" the report says. \"This means that 'City' Sydney is set to perform best over the next five years and development opportunities will continue be focused on an intensification of the centre.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-09T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:23:59.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
