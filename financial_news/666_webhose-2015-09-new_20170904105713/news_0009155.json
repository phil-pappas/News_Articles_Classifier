If it turns negative, it would be the first fall since the market took off in the late 1990s. \nThe gap between official growth figures and the situation on the ground in many sectors is posing a headache for some local executives who say headquarters use GDP data to set revenue and profit targets. \nA China-based executive in the heavy machinery industry said orders at his firm and affiliates were down about 50 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the sluggish real estate market, and he had his work cut out getting that message across to head office. \n\"I am now increasingly sending news articles that highlight weaknesses in the economy to HQ to make them understand our situation.\" \n(Additonal reporting by John Ruwitch and the Shanghai newsroom, Joe White in NEW YORK and Kevin Yao in BEIJING; Editing by Will Waterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:56:52.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
