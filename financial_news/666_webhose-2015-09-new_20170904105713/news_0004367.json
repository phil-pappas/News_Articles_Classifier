It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was the third monthly decrease in high street footfall and the fifth month in a row for shopping centres, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard. \nThe data is disappointing for retailers as they begin the 100-day countdown to Christmas. \nFootfall at retail parks increased 1.7pc, although this was the slowest increase since May and significantly below the summer average of 2.5pc, added Springboard. \nHelen Dickinson, director general at the British Retail Consortium, said: “It is clear that high streets and shopping centres are under increasing pressure once again. However, it is worth noting that these figures do not take into account the last two days of August, the Sunday and bank holiday Monday, which will, hopefully, add some cheer to the numbers in September.” \nThe rainy weather encouraged more people to avoid the high street and shop online. The Met Office said that parts of England, including Cornwall, experienced the wettest August since records began in 1912. \nRetailers are pinning their hopes on a good Christmas, which can make up more than half of sales and profits. \nRetail analysts are expecting September’s footfall figures to improve, taking into account the extra bank holiday spending and the back-to-school rush. However, they are still forecasting a “modest” fall of 0.9pc compared to last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T07:42:41.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
