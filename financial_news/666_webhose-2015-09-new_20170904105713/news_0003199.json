But there might be a smarter way to boost payouts \nIn a few weeks’ time the Government’s unique state pension “top-up” goes on sale. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will offer men and women of a qualifying age the chance, for a limited time, to swap lump sum savings for an increase in their state pension for life. \nIt’s like an annuity except it offers more attractive rates and is underwritten by HM Government. \nSound good? It could be, for some, and it’s attracting a lot of interest. \nBut if you are eligible to buy the top-up and have the spare cash with which to do so (the most you can spend on a top-up is £23,900), it might still not be the best way to get the most out of your state pension. \nWhile the top-up will buy you a small amount of extra state pension for life, an alternative boost to your entitlement could be achieved by deferring your state pension for several years. \nThe deferral arrangements mean you claim a far higher state pension when in future you start to claim it. The question is this: will you be better off spending your savings to buy the top-up now; or will you be better off living off your savings for several years, and then claiming a higher, deferred rate of state pension after that? \nNo, it’s not simple. Nothing to do with the state pension ever is. But hopefully the following explanations and calculations will help you decide what is best for you. \n= The benefits of the state pension top-up = \nTo qualify to buy the top-up, men need to have been born before April 6 1951, and women before April 6 1953. The top-up must be bought between October 12 this year and April 5 2017. \nYou can buy as little as £1 extra pension per week up to a maximum of £25 per week, with the cost depending on your age. \nBuying the maximum £25 per week (£1,300 per-year) top-up would cost a 65-year-old £22,250. \nA 75-year-old would pay £16,850. (Search “pension top-up calculator” online to get the Government’s tool allowing you to enter your age and see the cost). The top-up payments are taxable like other pension income; they are uprated each year in line with inflation, and your spouse inherits 50pc of the benefits on your death. \nThese terms are attractive compared with private sector annuity rates but other factors are at play. \nIf you’re healthy, with a long life expectancy, and/or you have a younger spouse, you’ll do better out of this deal. If inflation takes off you’ll have some protection. But you also need to consider your tax position and what you might otherwise have done with the cash. \nThe Government's pension top-up calculator can be found here. \n= The benefits of deferring the state pension = \nIf you reach state pension age before April 6 2016, you get a very generous future pension uplift for every year that you defer your pension. This works out at a 10.4pc increase in payments for every year deferred. \nFor example, by deferring for one year your full state pension of £115.95 a week (£6,029.40 per year), you’ll get an extra £12.05 per week or £627 a year. \nIt’s crucial to note that you cannot defer your state pension and benefit from an increased pension if you are claiming certain other welfare payments so check with the Pension Service if you’re in any doubt. \nEqually crucial is that fact that the benefits of deferral are being cut for younger people. If you reach state pension age on or after April 6 2016, the deferral benefit drops from an uplift of 10.4pc per year deferred to about 5.8pc. \nThe calculations that follow assume you’ve reached the state pension age before next April 6. \n= Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) for the sums: which route works out best? = \nTelegraph reader Chris Thompson, a retired pensions expert , helpfully shared calculations he’d undertaken when weighing up his own and friends’ choices. \nHe assumes three people a non-taxpayer, a basic-rate taxpayer and a higher-rate taxpayer each have £22,250 savings to hand which could be used to buy the top-up. All reach state pension age before April 6 2016. \nThey either buy the full top-up, or they defer their state pension and use savings to replace the pension not being received. \nHe assumes that the basic state pension rises by 2.5pc (the minimum increase, under the Government’s “triple lock” pledge) while inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index, to which pension top-ups are linked) rises by 2.2pc. \nAt the end of year one, the basic state pension plus the top-up would be £144.40 per week. After year two, the combined payments would be £147.93 and after year three, £151.54. \n= How would that compare with the deferral? = \nAfter year one, the deferred pension would be £131.21. After year two, £147.16 and after year three, £163.82. So by deferring the state pension for just over two years, you will have the same pension as if you’d spent the full £22,250 at the outset on a top-up. \nFor a non-taxpayer, who would have received his state pension gross, the decision to defer would mean using more savings to replace the income. Our notional non-taxpayer would have run down his savings by £15,500 in replacing the pension. A basic-rate taxpayer would run down their savings pot by £12,400 to replace the post-tax state pension income. And a higher-rate taxpayer, paying 40pc income tax, would run down their savings pot by just £9,300. \nThese figures are rounded. But in all cases, they suggest that the deferral route would be a better use of funds than the top-up. \nMr Thompson concluded: “Purchasing a top-up looks poor value, particularly for taxpayers.” \nWe ran the figures past Alan Higham, one of Britain’s top pension experts and founder of not-for-profit advice site Pensionschamp.com. He has for many years sought to alert savers to the benefits of deferring their state pension. He said: “The terms for deferring their pensions, for people reaching state pension age before April 6 2016, are very generous. They were set many years ago when life expectancy was much lower. \n“People have to live for just over nine years after they start to claim their deferred state pension to break even, compared to taking the pension when first entitled. People already drawing their state pension can suspend it and benefit from the generous increases, too.” \nDespite the generosity of the deal, few people actually choose to defer only around 8pc do so, according to data obtained by Mr Higham under a Freedom of Information request. \nHe said: “It could cost the Government billions if more people chose to defer, which is perhaps why the Department for Work & Pensions rarely highlights the benefits of deferral. This is in contrast to the way it promotes the concept of buying extra state pension through the new top-up.” \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T19:35:25.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
