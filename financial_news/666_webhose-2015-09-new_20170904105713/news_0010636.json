A drop in Wall Street overnight also put pressure on the market.\nChihiro Ohta, general manager at investment research and investor services at SMBC Nikko Securities, however, said he believed the sell-off in Japanese stocks was overdone, as the Nikkei traded below 10 percent of its 25-day moving average on Tuesday. A gap of 5 percent indicates the market is oversold.\nFor the first time in seven days, the short-sell ratio dropped below 40, according to data released by Japan Exchange Group after the market close on Wednesday. Short-sellers, who had expected the market to fall further, were eager to buy back when the Nikkei fell to near 17,500, traders said.\nU.S. shares weakened after Apple Inc declined in heavy trade after launching new products, with analysts saying that expectations were so high ahead of the event.\nAmong Apple suppliers, Nitto Denko Corp dropped 4.5 percent, Murata Manufacturing Co shed 3.0 percent and TDK Corp fell 4.1 percent.\nExporters also lost ground, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 3.4 percent and Honda Motor Co shedding 2.4 percent.\nBucking the weakness, GungHo Online Entertainment Inc jumped 10 percent after the Tokyo Stock Exchange approved its listing on its first section from Sept. 16.\nThe broader Topix dropped 2.0 percent to 1,477.11, with 32 of its 33 subsectors in negative territory.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 2.5 percent to 13,215.38.
