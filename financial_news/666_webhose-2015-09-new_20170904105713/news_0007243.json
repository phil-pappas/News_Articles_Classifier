Best Europe-Rating Services - also met the Sept. 1 deadline to submit a licence request, a statement from the regulator said. \nThis quintet can continue to operate until they receive their licences, which will happen by the end of August 2016. \nThe sixth firm to apply - Saudi Credit Bureau - missed the deadline and so is now banned from doing credit agency work but can request to resume such operations, a CMA spokesman told Reuters. \nLast November, the CMA issued new regulations governing credit agencies' operations in Saudi Arabia. These were effective Sept. 1. \n(Reporting by Matt Smith, editing by William Hardy) Saudi Arabia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:50:09.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
