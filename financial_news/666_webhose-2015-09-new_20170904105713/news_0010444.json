It has now cut interest rates five times since November.\nA Reuters poll suggested that China's central bank is highly likely to ease monetary policy again by the end of this year to support a rapidly cooling economy and calm financial markets.\nPremier Li Keqiang said recently international market instability \"has increased the uncertainties around the global economic recovery, and the impact on China's financial market and imports and exports has also deepened, with the economy facing new pressure.\"\nA similar official survey on the services sector showed activity was cooling there, too. Strength in services has been helping offset the broader economic downdraft from deteriorating factory conditions.\nThe official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.4 from July's reading of 53.9, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe services sector has accounted for the bigger part of China's economic output for at least two years, with its share rising to 48.2 percent last year, compared with the 42.6 percent contribution from manufacturing and construction.\n(Reporting By Kevin Yao and Winni Zhou; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T05:06:14.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
