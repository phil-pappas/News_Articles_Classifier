Neither the FHFA nor RBS responded to requests for comment. \nThe case was the first to reach trial of the 18 lawsuits the FHFA had filed in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nBefore that, the FHFA obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co (Xetra: 850628 - news ) and Deutsche Bank AG (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) . \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was unclear how much of the $33 million reflected the FHFA's overall costs in litigating against Nomura. The regulator had hired a private law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, for the lawsuit. \nIn July, the FHFA disclosed that it had paid nearly $373.5 million to two law firms including Quinn Emanuel from 2010 through Feb. 6 of this year, when Reuters submitted a Freedom of Information Act request. \nThe case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v Nomura Holding America Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06201. \n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:56:14.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
