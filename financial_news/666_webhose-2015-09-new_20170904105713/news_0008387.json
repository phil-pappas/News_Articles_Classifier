Oh, except she then tacked this little caveat on. \"But if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\"\nIf you were being unfair, that could be seen as Fed Speak for something like this: We will, unless we shouldn't, in which case we won't.\n But that would be ungenerous. In the world of central bankers, Yellen was as plain as she could be overnight. Investors and businesses and households can now examine the rest of the year with a bit of certainty – or at least prepare the volatility that will still accompany the rate rise, when it comes in either October or December.\nBut Thursday's nights events will also leave a bit of a question around the Fed's communications strategy.\nWhy did Yellen wait a week to make her intentions clear?\nWhy not do it at the press conference following the Fed's \"on hold\" decision?\nDid Yellen feel she had to do something to calm markets, given Wall Street has fallen 1.3 per cent since last Friday, the S&P/ASX 200 is off 1.9 per cent and commodities have fallen sharply?\nOr was this all part of a grand message massaging plan?\nOne thing's for sure – we're unlikely to get a straight answer any time soon from those cryptic central bankers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:03:35.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
