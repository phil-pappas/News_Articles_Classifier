For those looking for a silver lining, employers are expecting to give bigger pay raises — 4.6% on average — to their top performing workers, according to the numbers from consulting firm Towers Watson. \n“To a large extent, 3% pay raises have become the new norm in corporate America,” said Sandra McLellan, North America practice leader at Towers Watson. “We really haven’t seen variation from this level for many years.\" More Headlines Financing a Degree When You Return to College As an Adult \n“While most organizations are finding the talent they need at current salary levels, we are seeing more employers prioritizing how their salary budgets are being spent, especially in light of their ongoing difficulty in attracting and retaining top performers or employees with critical skills,” she added. \nThe survey of more than 1,100 U.S. companies showed nearly 90% of employees at US companies are eligible to receive annual or short-term bonuses this year, up from 86% last year — and 85% received a bonus this year, up from 81% in 2014. \n“Unfortunately, it's very rare to get more than a 3% annual increase within a company,” said Angela Copeland, career coach at Copeland Coaching. “Companies see a higher employer turnover now than ever with people switching jobs every three to five years. They save their money to recruit new talent.” \nCopeland and others, however, suggest there is a way to get that bigger salary increase one may be craving. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:27:38.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
