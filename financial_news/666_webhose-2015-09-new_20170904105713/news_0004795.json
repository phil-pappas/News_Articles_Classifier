PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Sep 21, 2015 GETTY InterContinental Hotels Group has a market value of £5.7billion \nIt operates hotels and resorts, with 724,000 rooms in nearly 100 countries in 4,900 hotels and has 168 million guest nights per annum. Its brands include Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts, Staybridge Suites and Holiday Inn. By region, 67 per cent of operating profit comes from the Americas, 11 per cent from Europe, 10 per cent in Asia, Middle East and Africa, and 11 per cent in Greater China. The company also has nearly 1,300 hotels in the pipeline. The company’s half-year results in late July were broadly in line with expectations, with revenue per available room growing in every region and by 5.1 per cent overall. Underlying revenues were ahead by 8 per cent, with profits and earnings per share rising by 10 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, the latter being bolstered by an early return of capital. There was, however, a slowdown in growth for the second quarter versus the first, such as in the Americas.

From an investment view, the current dividend yield of about 2 per cent is not especially attractive given the interest rate environment, while the industry is susceptible to travel-related security threats. Nonetheless, InterContinental continues to grow its business, while it is well placed to benefit from an ongoing recovery in the US economy, from where the majority of its business emanates. We last looked at InterContinental Hotels in October 2013, since when the share price has risen 31 per cent to stand at its current level of £24.30. More recently, the shares have also outperformed, having added 4 per cent over the past year, as compared to a 9 per cent dip for the wider FTSE100.With the group’s continuing growth, the general market view of the shares has recently warmed, now coming in at a cautious buy.
