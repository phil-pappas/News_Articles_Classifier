Michele Mossop by Chris Stott Analysts' low expectations of the 2015 financial year reporting season were certainly met. Earnings growth for the period came in at minus 2 per cent. This fall was largely driven by the weak energy and resources sectors.\nOnce again we saw a heightened level of short-term volatility around results announcements.\nFor example, digital real estate advertising business REA Group's result announcement was met with a 3.8 per cent share price dive on the day. As the market fully digested the results the following day, REA shares rallied 6.5 per cent against the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Accumulation Index's flat performance.\nSome of the small cap players stood out, with strong results from Pacific Brands, The Reject Shop and SMS Management & Technology Limited.\nWinners and losers aside, the reporting season provided three key themes: southern states outperform, businesses are reinvesting and cost cutting programs are largely complete.\nNSW is currently the nation's economic powerhouse. The wealth effect driving western Sydney – marked by some property prices doubling in the past five years – has lifted the state's economic output, as has the Baird government's ambitious infrastructure program. This program will see western Sydney grow as an economic hub faster than any other centre in Australia over the next decade.\nVictoria occupies a strong second place, while Queensland and Western Australia are continuing to languish as they adjust to the end of the mining boom.\nBoon to retail The impact of the federal government's small business stimulus package, in particular the $20,000 tax deductible allowance, provided a boon to retail businesses. In presentations to the market, both JB-Hi Fi and Harvey Norman announced that this package assisted their performance at the end of the financial year.\nIn response to slowing sales growth and anaemic economic growth a few companies announced significant capital reinvestment programs. All programs were generally met with negative share price reactions, indicating the market's short-term focus is not ready to acknowledge the need. Both Seek and Telstra traded lower after announcing spending programs. Even Fairfax dropped the day after announcing it would continue its Domain investment, which commenced over a year ago.\nSince the recovery from the global financial crisis, Australian companies have managed margins quite well by reducing costs. However, companies have generally finished their cost out programs and we have yet to see any notable revenue growth come through primarily due to the patchy economy.\nAs a result, cost reductions are a less effective tail wind for margins now than in recent years. For this reason it was interesting to see a few companies looking to deploy capital back into their business to help drive organic growth.\nAs a whole, company outlook statements were particularly downbeat and we think more meaningful earnings growth is needed to help equities trade higher.\nFor the current financial year, earnings per share growth is now sitting at 4 per cent. On stripping out the weak energy, resources and financial sectors this is a fairly respectable 12 per cent.\nChris Stott is chief investment officer of Wilson Asset Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:25:39.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
