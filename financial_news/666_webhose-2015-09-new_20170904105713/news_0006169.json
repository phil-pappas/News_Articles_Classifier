The list of items and supplies that they need to begin an semi-independent life is staggering. Check out the dorm packing list. In addition to the packing list, add a review of money management before they leave. \nCollege students are eager to break free from the constraints of parents and show that they can manage on their own. Giving your child the essential financial lessons will be as important as any course in their college curriculum. \nHere are a few basic financial points to review. As in most life lessons, you can not learn everything at once, so start to build these financial tools as early as possible with each child. \nNeeds and wants \nWe all struggle with the basic financial decisions, \"what can I afford\", \"what do I really need\" and \"what is just a luxury that is out of my reach\". Learning to make rational decisions about purchases is an important step in maturity and judgement. \nBudget \nStart with a short timeline, such as a weekly budget. Itemize the necessary living expenses for the week and set aside the amount needed with a bit of flexibility. Decisions such as buying a cafeteria food plan vs cooking meals may be important to compare costs before setting the weekly budget. \nThe cost of books and supplies may be a big budget item. Look for used texts and online sites. The campus bookstore may be convenient, but it may be the most expensive choice. \nCredit and debit cards \nEasy access to money is a convenience but it can lead to impulse buying patterns if your freshman is easily influenced. Be smart and responsible with credit. Look at the number of cards you have, consider the cost or annual fees and the transactions costs such as ATM usage. Set a reasonable limit for credit and debit cards and set them aside for emergencies. \nCar and travel costs \nDiscuss whether it is necessary to have a car on campus, reviewing the costs for parking, gas and maintenance. Plus the cost of auto insurance is very high for college age students. \nAlso consider whether the student will have time for a part time job during college to help with expenses. If there is a campus job available, it may not require a personal car. It is much cheaper to rely on public transportation during college. \nBe safe \nA financial review should include a discussion about security and avoiding identity theft. Be sure that your child has a responsible attitude when safe guarding credit cards, wallets and cash. \nAlso review the personal property that your student is taking to college, in particular, make a list of the valuables and electronics. And review your personal property insurance policy to determine the best coverage. \nFor the latest business news and local events, click on the subscribe button above and you will receive an email alert when the next article is released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:00:55.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
