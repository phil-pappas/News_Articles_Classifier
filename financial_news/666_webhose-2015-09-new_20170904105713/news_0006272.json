Currently all income from superannuation is tax free in the retirement phase.\n\"We rejected that in the Abbott government and I assume that will continue under a Turnbull government. It really was a commitment that we believed we should stay true to,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\nMr Abbott and his Treasurer Joe Hockey had repeatedly vowed, \" no adverse or unexpected changes to superannuation\".\n In recent months Mr Frydenberg has also taken to repeating this line, after causing a stir in June when he told the inaugural conference of the Committee for Sustainable Retirement Incomes that the government would consider good ideas put forward as part of the tax white paper process and any changes recommended by that process would be taken to the Australian people at the next election .\nThe government's commitment not to touch super taxes has been steadfast despite many conservative policy experts, including the Grattan Institute , warning the current system is unsustainable.\nThere was widespread agreement among stakeholders at the National Reform Summit last month that Australia needs a proper review of the entire retirement income system, including pension and superannuation taxes. The Reform Summit delegates – representing big business, unions, and the social services sector – also agreed the nation needs a more sustainable tax base if debt and deficit are to be tackled and productivity lifted.\nAddressing the GST conference on Wednesday, Mr Frydenberg said he had \"noticed a change in the public's mindset\" on the issue of the GST.\n\"I think people understand there could be benefits that will come from its increase,\" he said.\n\"They would also understand that other taxes would be either removed or reduced, and they would also understand there would be more money for services, for example health.\"\nHe said broadening the GST base to include food, education and health would be nearly impossible because of the politics.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/assistant-treasurer-josh-frydenberg-super-tax-change-could-come-after-the-election-20150602-ghf6me.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:04:49.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
