Jessica Hromas by Matthew Stevens It was as recent as late August that Grant King finally accepted Origin Energy was going to have to bite heavily on the silver bullet of equity to recapture market confidence that the energy company's balance sheet could afford his nearly constructed ambitions in liquid natural gas.\n\"Our job is to live in the world we live in,\" King offered in response to the media's invitation that he might contemplate resignation because of the apparently sudden necessity of the heavily discounted $2.5 billion rights issue and expanded $2.2 billion savings program Origin had confirmed on Wednesday morning.\nSo no, he had not bothered himself with the concept of resignation and had not been asked to by the board.\nKing was ever a canny operator. He had plainly anticipated he would be advised to follow a contemporary in LNG debt trouble – David Knox over at Santos – into early retirement. He must have anticipated too that his gaze would be forced to the certainty of the rear-vision mirror to reflect on the quality of Origin's decision in June 2011 to follow BG Group and Santos by committing to a stand-alone LNG project on Gladstone's Curtis Island.\nOn LNG, King remains as resolute as you might expect.\nBut yes, the business case has been profoundly altered by OPEC's October decision to stop defending prices. And yes, a debt burden that stands at $10.3 billion, with upside risk yet, was no longer sustainable. The headline-grabbing thrashing delivered to Origin, Santos and the billionaires at Glencore have made it clear the market does not like the coincidence of high debt loads and volatile commodities prices.\nThis is plainly not the way it was supposed to be. The original case for APLNG was built on an $US80 oil price. Origin's embrace of a rights issue that carries a 34 per cent discount over Tuesday's close says, above all things, that Origin can no longer bank on price recovery to sustain the LNG story.\nInvestment model-crippling pressure After nearly a year of living under the investment model-crippling pressure of global oil's new normal of a sub-$US50 a barrel price, Origin had eschewed equity as the answer to withering confidence in its ability to sustain its 34 per cent share of the APLNG project through that dodgy period between the completion of a $24.7 billion LNG plant and the point at which it starts to generate cash enough to support itself and the parents who financed it.\nThrough the opening quarters of this latest oil shock, King had to massage his way to security through a two-year, $535 million program of cuts to costs and capital investment.\nTo that he added the $1.6 billion sale of Contact Energy, which reduced his overall debt load by near to $3 billion, but which slightly irritated some owners because it trimmed underlying revenues and increased the company's overall exposure to the oil price.\nIn the end, King had to recognise he had been fiddling at the edges while Origin's share price burned.\n\"So why equity, and why now, when we have been so active for a long time on this issue?\" King mused on Wednesday. \"What changed is [that] the broader market has made it very clear the combination of price volatility and debt in the business are a deterrent to investment in the company and we have to fix that.\"\nFor mine, there is slightly more to this erosion of certainty than just the financial. In August Origin pushed out project completion and confirmed that the project required an additional $1.8 billion contribution over the coming 18 months. As management at Glencore and Santos can tell you, this is not a time to disappoint expectations.\nTo that end King was patently encouraged by news that Standard & Poor's has issued a pretty glowing endorsement of its debt reduction program. In endorsing Origin's investment grade rating, S&P observed that the King plan could see the company support a debt expected to fall under the $9 billion range from its existing earnings base and without any contribution at all. (Mind you, that's a good thing, given King revealed on Wednesday that APLNG will, unexpectedly, be cash-negative for Origin through FY16.)\nBut in good news … But back to the good news. In the end, S&P concluded that, if everything now runs to plan, Origin will have headroom enough to endure a further $US15 a barrel fall in oil prices before its rating might be again challenged.\nFor the record. Origin asserts that APLNG can support itself at an oil price of between $US23 and $US25 a barrel and that it covers both operating and interest costs when oil is at $US38 to $US42 a barrel.\nMeanwhile, we hear that Santos is maybe weeks away from profitable progress in its rapid-fire asset sale campaign. Certainly some positive news would be helpful right now. It share price was smashed again on Wednesday, falling another 7 per cent to a ruthlessly disappointing $3.98. It says much about the crisis still unfolding that Santos hasn't traded much lower than that this century.\nBut help is apparently at hand with firm and acceptable offers, we are told, for at least three of the assets on the market – the Cooper Basin business, the offshore WA assets and its 13.5 per cent stake in PNGLNG.\nInterestingly enough, as Santos endured its latest belting, S&P delivered a ratings affirmation that offers some carefully toned comfort on the outlook and the potential of the asset sale program to right this LNG boat.\n\"These initiatives, if successful, could repair Santos's weak credit metrics, which are being pressured by currently low oil prices and large capital expenditure required to complete its Gladstone project,\" the firm assessed.\nLess encouragingly, S&P observed it had wrongly imagined that earlier cost management programs would see Santos secure its BBB rating and that the rating would be at risk if the sale process fell short of expectations flagged. But it introduced it all with the observation that the board's commitment to addressing its problems through asset sales was a \"potential positive for creditors\".\nRio coal exit confirmed It is all to easy to overlook the importance of the subtle restructure of Rio Tinto's coal business that was attached to confirmation of the $US606 million sale of its Bengalla​ mine to New Hope.\nBut what looks like technical twiddling is actually a road map for Rio's staged exit from the mainstream of the seaborne coal business.\nConvincing Mitsubishi to swap minority positions in a suite of Rio assets for a 34 per cent stake in the jewel of its Hunter Valley has been a enormous undertaking and Japan Inc has extracted blood, sweat and a good deal of value from a deal that saw no cash change hands. In return, Rio assumes 100 per cent ownership of Coal & Allied and that would suggest it is the next cab sitting on the sale rank.\nAt its essence, the arrangements leave Rio free to market its coal operations on a piecemeal basis. And the word is that we should expect more Rio announcements over the coming weeks.\nThat all says Rio has largely abandoned hopes of a single-step out of the Australian coal sector that had been contemplated with the likes of Glencore. It says Rio's exit might take longer than management may have hoped 18 months or so ago. But it says, mostly, that Rio wants to divorce itself from coal as an investment class.\nThere are two reasons for that decision. First, the in-house view is that the coal price will be range-bound over the medium term so coal just is not competitive in the Rio portfolio. And second, it says that Rio has no little or no appetite for the long-tail of risk in the coal sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:06:08.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
