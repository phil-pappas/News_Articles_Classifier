David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Woodside's $11.6 billion bid for Oil Search could well be seen as a gift for debt-laden oil and gas group Santos and its executive chairman, Peter Coates, who is trying to stare down bearish market sentiment.\nIn a nutshell, the Oil Search bid proposal implies that Santos's 13.5 per cent stake in the PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea is worth about $6.5 billion, or about half of the company's $13.7 billion enterprise value.\nBut there is a real danger that the sale of the company's best asset in order to stabilise the company's balance sheet will not be in the long-term interest of Santos shareholders.\nWhy sell a 13.5 per cent interest in a superbly run LNG operation that is poised for significant expansion through a third LNG train?\nThe word out of PNG is that the PNG LNG project in the Hides area of PNG is poised to perform beyond expectations in terms of production.\nWoodside's proposed takeover of Oil Search has focused world attention on a country with enormous LNG growth prospects including the PNG LNG project and the Elk Antelope LNG development.\nNow that Oil Search is in play it would not be out of the question for one of its PNG partners such as Exxon to make an offer for the company.\nThat excitement is, of course, relevant to Santos because of its desperate bid to generate cash to slash its $9 billion in debt.\n Coates, who took the reins of the company from former chief executive David Knox late last month, could well exacerbate the company's problems if Santos sells the PNG jewel in its crown only to find it triggers a market de-rating of what is left.\nOrderly asset sales are on the agenda as a first priority in order to avoid the dilution involved in an equity capital raising.\nSantos has been fighting the market pressure for a capital raising since late last year. That fight was led by Knox but the end result was he lost his job. He is staying around while the company searches for a new CEO.\nOne fund manager said the company not only needs a new CEO but an entirely new board.\nThe company's problems are all of its own making. The board and management failed to conduct worst case scenario planning in relation to the oil price. That is unbelievable when you consider it is operating in a commodities business that has always moved in cycles.\nThe company appeared to assume that $US100 a barrel oil would be maintained for many years and, at the very least, until its $18 billion GLNG project in Queensland was operating and churning out cash flow. First LNG shipments are expected in February next year.\nLack of scenario planning meant the company came into the severe cyclical downturn in oil prices with too much debt. Its response to market questioning of its balance sheet was to reassure shareholders it had access to about $3 billion in undrawn lines of credit.\nThis strategy failed miserably. The company has been operating with a target on its back for short sellers.\nThere is a belief among fund managers and analysts that without asset sales a capital raising of at least $1 billion would be needed to stabilise the company's balance sheet and finally put an end to the concerns about excessive debt.\nSantos is probably the only oil and gas company in the world with an enterprise value in excess of $20 billion that has been crushed as hard by the oil price collapse.\nThe short sellers have pocketed huge profits partly because the market has held the board and management in contempt. The expectation that poor decisions would be made has played into the hands of those betting against the company.\nSantos is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the top 200 stocks. About 88 million shares have been sold short or about 8 per cent of the issued capital.\nOne interpretation of this very large short position in Santos is that the institutional shareholder base is sending a message to the board and management about how the company has been managed.\nSantos has 1 billion shares on issue and about half the share register is owned by retail investors. These investors do not lend stock to short sellers.\nThat means that about 20 per cent of the shares owned by institutions are being lent out to short sellers.\nThat dire situation, however, is being countered by the Woodside proposed offer for Oil Search.\nSantos shares rose 5 per cent on Wednesday and 5 per cent on Tuesday.\nA series of asset sales to reduce debt will probably help to put further upward pressure on the share price.\nHowever, the early signs are that the company is not willing to rush into any transactions.\nChanticleer understands Beach Energy approached the company with a proposal to consolidate their infrastructure in the Cooper Basin and sell it in a job lot.\nThis was an attempt to repeat the success of APA Group in its sale of its pipeline business in Queensland to BG Group.\nThe list of Santos assets is quite long. Its Gladstone LNG operation is probably worth about $9 billion. Its Cooper Basin assets are probably worth about $2.7 billion. It has assets in Western Australia that are worth about $1.5 billion and other assets worth about $1 billion.\nSantos has a market capitalisation of $4.7 billion and debt of $9 billion. That means that one single asset in a diverse portfolio of oil and gas interests makes up about half of the Santos enterprise value of $13.7 billion.\nThe additional responsibilities taken by Coates have prompted a change in his remuneration arrangements.\nEffective from August 24, Coates has been receiving an additional fee of $45,000 per month, inclusive of superannuation.\nThe company said: \"This amount is an extra services and special exertion fee to reflect the additional responsibilities of the role.\"\nIt said the fees relating to the executive chairman's additional responsibilities will not be paid out of the aggregate director fee pool and he will not participate in any of Santos' incentive plans.\nDirector Ken Dean will now serve as senior independent director while Coates carries out his extra duties.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-09T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:03:59.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
