VW boss apologises over pollution test 'cheat' on US cars By Alan Tovey | Telegraph – 8 hours ago Print \nMartin Winterkorn, boss of the German auto giant, makes public apology and pledges investigation into \"defeat devices\" allegedly fitted to American cars \nVolkswagen’s chief executive has issued a humbling public apology after the company was accused of installing software on cars sold in the US which allowed them to “cheat” on pollution measurement tests. \nMartin Winterkorn, boss of the German auto giant, said he had ordered an internal investigation after America’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused the company of fitting 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the country with so-called “defeat devices” which let them violate the Clean Air Act . \nAccording to the EPA these devices are software algorithms which detect when a car’s emissions are being tested and turn on the full pollution controls, cutting the amount nitrogen oxides (NOx) pumped out from the car’s exhaust. NOx is harmful to humans and has been linked with respiratory illnesses. \nHowever, in normal driving conditions the pollution controls on the affected VW cars were far less effective, meaning the vehicles emitted up to 40 times more NOX, according to the EPA. \nThe watchdog has issued a notice of violation against VW, saying that using defeat devices is “illegal and a threat to public health” and warned the company which sells almost 10m cars a year worldwide that it could be liable for huge penalties. \nIssuing the apology, Mr Winterkorn said: “I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will co-operate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly, and completely establish all of the facts of this case.” \nThe chief executive added that of “the trust of our customers and the public is and continues to be our most important asset” and that VW “does not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law”. \nThe EPA has ordered that VW recalls the cars to modify them, with the company bearing the cost of the work. It is estimated that recalling the almost 500,000 affected cars could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars, before any fines are imposed. \nLast year the US regulator hit Kia and Hyundai with a $300m settlement for understating emissions from their vehicles. \nVW cars fitted with defeat devices are four-cylinder diesel-powered VW Jettas, Beetles and Golfs from 2009 to 2015, Passats from 2014 and Audi A3s from 2009. \nThe chances of cars operating in Britain being able to cheat pollution tests is small, according to UK automotive trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders . \nMike Hawes, the group’s chief executive, said: “The EU [and Britain] operates a fundamentally different system to the US with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. \n“There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. Vehicles are removed from the production line randomly and must be standard production models, certified by the relevant authority.” \nHowever, he did agree that the current tests to measure the amount of pollution produced by vehicles are “outdated”. The SMMT and industry are pushing for the regime to be changed to “embrace new testing technologies and be more representative of on-road conditions”, Mr Hawes added. \nThe UK government is also pushing for a new test regime. A spokes for the Department for Transport said: “We are currently pursuing action at an EU level to ensure all vehicle emissions are robustly tested and we are one of the nations pushing hardest to bring forward a more accurate driving emissions test so vehicles cut their emissions not just in the lab but also on the road.” \nAction in the US came as European think-tank Transport & Environment released a report into vehicle pollution which claimed that in normal driving conditions diesel cars and vans emit about five times more pollution than the legal limit . \nThe Brussels-based group claimed current tests on emissions are “unrepresentative... and contain loopholes the manufacturers exploit to get low results. There is substantial anecdotal evidence that cars detect when they are tested and deploy ‘cycle beating’ techniques to reduce emissions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:45:59.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
