The hackers planted malicious code on that fake software. Phishing attacks detected \nThis marks the first major successful attack on Apple's mobile software site. Apple has since removed the affected apps, but not before the malware had \"already launched phishing attacks to prompt a dialog asking victims to input their iCloud passwords,\" Palo Alto noted in a blog post. \nThe malware also could, according to Palo Alto, read a user's password if that password was copied from a password management tool onto the user's clipboard. More to come? \nIn an interview with Reuters, a Palo Alto representative said his firm had not found any instances of data theft as a result of this hack. However, in its blog post, the company called XcodeGhost \"very harmful and dangerous,\" in part because it shows how iOS can be infiltrated. \n\"The techniques used in this attack could be adopted by criminal and espionage focused groups to gain access to iOS devices,\" according to the blog post. Affected apps \nThe 39 infected apps identified by Palo Alto include instant messaging, banking and stock-trading apps. The firm said the well-known apps affected include WeChat and Didi Chuxing, an Uber challenger in China. \n\"Apple takes security very seriously and iOS is designed to be reliable and secure from the moment you turn on your device,\" Apple said in a statement. \nRelated posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:12:23.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
