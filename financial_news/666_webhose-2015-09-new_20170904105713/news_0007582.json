Photo: Dallas Kilponen\nMy father was a wise man. He was one of those people who can see the world for what it is, call a spade a spade, but not be wearied by the negatives. \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall,\" was one truism that still rings in my ears – and the recent fall from grace of \"The Fresh Food People\" is the latest in a long line of examples.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nIt needs to once again become the supermarket people want to visit.\nWoolies has a long corporate lineage. And in recent times, It's been a rags to riches story of sorts. The shares listed in 1993 at $2.45 and looked like they'd break through $40 as recently as April last year. It was the story that analysts, experts – even mums and dads – loved to tell. Woolies, the humble grocer, had made a lot of people very rich!\nHow rich? Well, with dividends reinvested, buying Woolworths in the float turned $10,000 into $270,000 over just 21 years. That's some return.\nAdvertisement Of course, that was the high-water mark. Since then, shares have fallen from almost $38 to about $25. That's still a great post-IPO return, of course, but it does suggest that – at least as far as the market is concerned – something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\nTrouble at hand? And you don't have to go far to find out what that is. In the past financial year, Woolies' profit fell more than 12 per cent. Coles continues to beat Woolies in the head-to-head battle for shoppers. Aldi is making inroads. Woolworths' Bunnings-fighter Masters is continuing to lose money. And Big W is all at sea in its battle against its discount department store rival, Kmart.\nIndeed, in almost every respect, Woolies is being beaten all ends up by arch-rival Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, Kmart, Target, Bunnings and others.\nSo what happened? And is Woolies a dead duck or is this a great buying opportunity?\nBack to basics, Woolies Here's what I think happened. Under previous chief executives Reg Clairs and Roger Corbett, Woolies was run by \"shopkeepers\". Back when Jesus played fullback for Jerusalem, I worked for the Clairs-run Woolies, and the culture was so thick you could cut it with a knife. \"If you're not serving the customer, you should be serving someone who is\" ran the line at the bottom of the corporate stationery.\nWoolies lost its way. \"Retail is detail\", goes the cliche – it's a very simple business, but plans must be executed with relentless focus. Woolworths simply became too successful, and when the time came to reinvest some of its profits in making sure it remained the customers' preferred supermarket, it ducked the responsibility.\nAnd in one of the largest marketing fails in recent memory, the company that for years outmarketed its competitors with its Fresh Food People line was comprehensively beaten as its \"cheap cheap\" birds were no match for Coles' big red hand.\nThe recipe to get back on top is simple. It needs to once again become the supermarket people want to visit. Lower prices, better range, better customer service and a more enjoyable shopping experience. Rinse and repeat.\nOf course, Coles isn't going to sit back and just let Woolies march past. It is executing on that recipe far better, and that momentum is a powerful ally that Coles won't cede easily.\nFoolish takeaway In all of that, of course, Woolies' shares have fallen by a third in a little over 16 months – so they're no longer priced for perfection. If the Woolies' board and its new chairman Gordon Cairns can find a great chief executive to replace the outgoing Grant O'Brien, this company might just be one to watch. As a competitor or investor, you write off Woolworths at your peril.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared with term deposits.
