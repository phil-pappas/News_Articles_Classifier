Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Defence Minister Kevin Andrews has outlined a timeline for Australia military campaign in Syria and Iraq saying it was likely to be two to three years.\nAs the RAAF prepare to launch airstrikes inside the war-torn country within a week.\nMr Andrews told Channel Nine he expected the military engagement to last for the period but said Defence will review Australia's role each year.\n\"Well look, two, three years, I can't say in exact terms, but the reality is this is going to go on for a number of years.\n\"We review it on a year by year basis and ultimately we want to see a peaceful and hopefully prosperous Iraq,\" Mr Andrews said.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott quickly threw cold water on the statement, however.\n\"We don't want to put a particular timeline on this other than to say they'll be there as needed but no longer than necessary,\" Mr Abbott said as he visits PNG for the Pacific Islands Forum.\nAsked about the timeline, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said \"we should be thinking in terms of years not months\".\n Mr Andrews immediately came under attack by Labor for making the comments; Shadow Minister for Finance Tony Burke said he was \"not sure of the strategic benefit of announcing a two-year timeline\".\nAsked how we will judge when that mission is complete, Mr Abbott said on Wednesday night: \"well, when the Daesh death cult has been destroyed\".\nMr Abbott announced on Tuesday that the six fighters, the refuelled and surveillance plane currently operating over Iraq, will extend their operations into Syria.\nChief of Defence Air Chief Marshall Mark Binskin said the campaign would begin \"within a week\".\nWhile Mr Andrews has indicated that sending in troops is not under consideration, Mr Abbott did not rule out sending soldiers into Syria, saying \"as to what might happen in the long-term future, it's just not appropriate to speculate\".\nThe government's also announced Australia would accept an extra 12,000 refugees from the Syrian civil war at a cost of at least $700 million", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-10T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:49:16.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
