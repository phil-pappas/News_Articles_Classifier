Japan will become a society in which all can participate actively.\" \nAbe also said he was determined to ensure that 50 years from now the Japanese population, which is 126 million and falling, is stable at 100 million. \nHe said his new \"three arrows\" would provide a strong economy, support for child rearing and stronger social services to lighten the burden of child and elder care for struggling families. But with Japan also committed to reducing its massive public debt, it's unclear how he intends to achieve those goals. \nAbe recently announced plans to accelerate reductions in corporate taxes. The central bank also is widely expected to add to its already unprecedented monetary easing by pumping more cash into the economy later this year. \nJapan's economy, estimated at $US4.6 trillion in 2014, contracted at a 1.2 per cent annual rate in the April-June quarter. Economists have warned that China's slowdown and market turmoil might weaken an expected recovery in coming months. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:41:13.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
