Concerning the proper utilization of pesticides, Woldehawaryat Assefa, Director, Plant Health Regulatory Directorate said that dealing with pesticide identification, safeguarding and disposal is essential for the good relations of pesticide importing and exporting countries in addition to the protection of environment, human and animal life. \nHowever, irrespective of these, some traders indulged in misconduct act doing against the interest of the consumers and to address the matter consultation with stakeholders is essential. \nThere are a number of countries producing and supplying pesticide to the world market; in this regard, the emerging economies such as India and China are well known; In the case of African countries however, some irresponsible traders transfer substandard and outdated pesticides to the market. Because of the emergence of counterfeit and unregistered products creeping to the markets, the importing countries are experiencing the pain. \nThe damage to humans,animals and the environment caused by the counterfeit products is immense. The trend adversely impacts international trade which ultimately make both supplying and receiving countries losser. Side by side with mutual cooperation, managing and removing out dated pesticides helps to curb the danger that may triggered from the unwanted chemicals. \nThe importing countries spend their meager resources for the importation of agricultural inputs but some times they neither get the right goods nor regain the money they spent hence, consultation between stakeholders globally can brings remedy. \nStruggling for preservation of food security is a preoccupation for most African countries and to meet the goal in line with increasing the utilization of modern inputs, managing natural resources such as water,vegetation cover, forest, soil must be kept in healthy condition free from contaminant chemicals is vital. \nHowever, the above mentioned misconduct trends on trade put the effort futile; hence, commitment for checking the unwanted tendency is needed from all stakeholders. To that end, the African stockpiles program initiated in 2003 aimed to remove and destroy all obsolete pesticide from the African continent. \nIn this regard, the crucial cooperation of multilateral organization such as the World Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization,World Life Fund and Pesticide Action Plan brought immense result. \nSome of the benefiting countries from the cooperation are Ethiopia, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa,Tanzania and Tunisia. To support and strength the effort, Crop Life International initiated another assistance for four countries, namely: Cameron, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. And to reduce the risk that may come from obsolete pesticides, repacking and transporting work to central warehouse for security purpose has been done. \nDevelopment in most countries achieved through transferring knowledge, ideas and technology but the technology adoption capacity with in the receiving countries is crucial. Technology brings benefit which enable to achieve development and progress to all human beings,it also support increasing agricultural productivity. Thus, complementary and synergistic nature of technologies developed and offered by scientists and companies play key role for transforming agriculture. \nSimilarly, it accelerate innovation, guidance and principles derived from their scientific nature which helps decision makers. Scientifically advanced technologies particularly used for agriculture are vital to achieve sustainable development in the sector if they are applied responsibly. It protect plants from dangerous diseases which lead to extinction. It also enhance reproductive capacity and enable to maintain healthy environment which is a backbone of sustainable development. \nHowever, most African countries have no sufficient infrastructure, qualified human resource, finance, and experience to transporting, handling and removing of outdated chemicals which used as agricultural input. Therefore, sending their appeal to the donors is a reasonable direction, with their support curbing the environmental debacle can be possible. \nThe utilization of agricultural technology as an input has a tremendous positive out come which helps realizing food security and sustainable development. But the improper importation and utilization of agricultural inputs has a disastrous consequence; as the result, the continuity of ecosystem itself put in question. Thus, consultation between all producers and purchasers should be strengthen thereby enable curbing its demerit.
