The drivers were granted class action status, asking to bring on about 160,000 drivers, in a case alleging that drivers are employees, not independent contractors. The drivers also said Uber failed to reimburse them for expenses and failed to pay them the entire tip amounts given by riders. Uber said the court ruling narrows down the class action to less than 15,000 drivers because it only applies to drivers in a specific time period, does not include UberBlack drivers before June 2014 and those who registered with Uber as a corporation. \"Despite these facts, we will likely still appeal because partners use Uber on their own terms, and there really is no typical driver,\" Abby Horrigan, Uber's managing counsel for employment, wrote in a blog post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:25:48.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
