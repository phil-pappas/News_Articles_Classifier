James Davies The company audited 225 stores in July and found 69 per cent had payroll compliance issues. A 7-Eleven whistleblower said wage fraud was closer to 100 per cent but had recently fallen after the company clamped down on worker exploitation.\nMr Smith said the decision by Mr Withers and Mr Wilmot to resign was \"sad\". He said: \"Basically one is appropriate, the other is logical.\" He said the company would launch a search for a new CEO and would appoint new board members.\n'Boiling frog' \"This horrible experience has been progressively revealing itself overtime. It began as we saw it as a normal business problem. It turned out that we were aware that we had an element of franchisees who weren't paying properly and we saw it as being inappropriate and being inconsistent with what we told them,\" he said.\n Mr Smith said the problem had progressively got worse and worse. \"Your stories ran which were shocking and I think as we progressively got into it we saw we had a very big problem, and it is both in terms of our franchisees, and in our model,\" he said.\nMr Smith described the situation at 7-Eleven as a \"boiling frog\" where a series of factors had led to the company not being aware of the problem and not acting soon enough to stem those problems.\n\"There's a kind of petri dish of factors that are all acting with each other. One on their own could not have caused it all. You've had a bit of a boiling frog.\"\nMr Smith informed staff at 7-Eleven's head office today of the changes, with staff understood to have been shocked by the announcement.\nMr Wilmot has been with 7-Eleven since 1983 and last week admitted at a Senate hearing that 7-Eleven had previously used an ad hoc wage system that allowed franchisees to pay staff whatever rate they nominated even if it was below award wages.\n\"It came to a point I think we realised that with that there have been some real failings in terms of our communications, reporting and knowing,\" Mr Smith said.\n'Shocked, appalled' He said he had been \"shocked\", \"appalled\" by revelations in Fairfax Media and Four Corners of systemic wage abuse and a flawed business model. The media investigation also found head office had been complicit in covering up the extent of the problem.\n\"We're willing to bear the cost of this. There is nothing in us that wants to leave people disadvantaged out of this. We need to put this right, it has hurt vulnerable people.\"\nMr Smith estimated the soon-to-be-announced changes to the company's business model would cost \"many millions of dollars\".\n7-Eleven is also expected to run up costs from the company-funded panel to review back pay claims by current and former 7-Eleven staff. Former ACCC head Allan Fels has been recruited to oversee the panel.\nMr Smith said the company would announce in the coming weeks changes to the profit share arrangement between head office and franchisees.\n\"Everything is on the table.... The profit split needs to move.\"\nRegarding potential changes to store opening hours and the commission franchisees receive on fuel sales at their stores, Mr Smith said: \"We are modelling all of these things.\"\n\"As incredible as this might seem, I'd like to think I'm a careful, competent director who has taken a lot of care in this business with a high quality board and high quality advisers,\" Mr Smith said.\n\"If I was on the outside, I'd find that incredible to believe and I don't expect people to believe differently,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:48:20.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
