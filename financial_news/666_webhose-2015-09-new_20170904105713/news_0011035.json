Joe Shute asks what drives the 'because I’m worth it’ generation.. \nThroughout his 15 novels Charles Dickens told many a salutary tale of the English legal system, none more so than that of Bleak House. The case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce which dominates the plot is about a family fighting each other in the Court of Chancery to get their hands on the will of old Tom Jarndyce, who in a fit of despair some years previously had blown his brains out in a coffee house on Chancery Lane. So bitter and longwinded is the legal suit that all trace of the old man’s fortune has long ago been wiped out on lawyer bills. But still, in Dickens’s words, “Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on”. \nAnd indeed on, well into 2015, where record numbers of families are once more appearing in the courts; either in disputes over wills, or standing in the dock themselves for attempting to defraud elderly relatives out of their money. \nChief villains on both counts are the baby boomers, attempting to extract what they deem to be their fair share of inheritance from elderly parents whose property prices have ballooned. The latest report from the KPMG fraud barometer published a few weeks ago - revealed the value of relative upon relative fraud has jumped 300 per cent in a year from £2.1 million in the first six months of 2015 up from £544,000 in the same period in 2014. More than three quarters of culprits identified are over 45 and the vast majority of victims are their elderly parents. \nThen there is the huge rise in legal contests in the public courts more akin to that which Dickens envisaged and often as equally destructive. This week, the family of self-made British property millionaire Manny Davidson was named as the latest to publically implode over money wrangles. Mr Davidson, 84, and his wife Brigitta, 79, are fighting a bitter row with their son and daughter over their family home Lyegrove House, a 400-year-old Jacobean manor which adjoins Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate - and a £600m trust fund. \nMr Davidson claims he registered Lyegrove and a £3.5m villa in the verdant hills above Nice (Milan: NICE.MI - news ) in the names of his children to shelter them from inheritance tax bills, but now they are trying to sell both properties from under him . The children have so far refused to respond but in court documents have described their father’s as “dominant and domineering” and indicated they have “increasingly resisted permitting [him] to dictate to them the conduct of their lives, financially as well as otherwise.” \nMany offspring, however, prefer to wait until after their parents have died before attempting to get their hands on their money. According to Christine (HKSE: 1210-OL.HK - news ) Green, senior partner and head of private wealth at law firm Veale Wasbrough Vizards, since 2006 there has been a 700 per cent rise in the number of claims against will disputes. The volume of claims is said to be highest in areas where property prices are more buoyant. \n“We are in a more litigious society now,” she says. “People are more willing to challenge things more readily and perhaps there is a greater sense of entitlement that they are entitled to something from the older generation.” \nAccording to Green, the decline of personal wealth during the recession has had a major impact on the increase, with baby boomers relying on their inheritances to try and plug the gap in their own fortunes. The latest research shows us that more than a third of Britons are now relying on inheritance to fund their own retirement. \n“People feel they are entitled to inherit money from the older generation. I’m not sure what that is based on, really. One hopes to be able to leave something to one’s children but that may not be possible or there may be reasons why one chooses not to. I do think there is an increased feeling among the younger generation that they should be provided for by their parents.” \nThe courts do seem to be sympathetic to such a view. In July, following a mammoth 11-year legal battle , the Court of Appeal awarded 54-year-old Heather Ilott a £164,000 share of her mother’s estate after she successfully challenged the will. This was despite the fact that Melita Jackson had bequested her entire £486,000 fortune to animal charities alongside a clear accompanying letter “If my daughter should bring a claim against my estate, I instruct my executors to defend such a claim as I can see no reason why my daughter should benefit in any way from my estate”. The landmark ruling was made as the court decided Ilott, a mother of five who lived in social housing, had a real need for some of the money because of her own straitened financial circumstances. \nOthers, however, resort to criminal means in order to benefit from an inheritance. In one sorry tale uncovered by the KPMG fraud barometer, which only records cases over £100,000, a man stole his mother’s £600,000 life savings after realising that he was not the main recipient in her testament. In March, meanwhile, 58-year-old Gwenda Fox, of Bristol, was convicted of stealing £100,000 from her 81-year-old father after she was granted power of attorney while he was living in a care home. Fox sold his house in Devon and used the money to fly first class to the United States where she rented a property while leaving his care home bills unpaid. \nSo is it greed or desperation that is driving the baby boomer inheritance grab? Hitesh Patel, forensic partner at KPMG who has worked on its fraud barometer for close to a decade, says it is a bit of both. \n“I don’t think people have lost their moral values but they have been eroded through time because we are living through this culture of materialism and keeping up with the Joneses. It’s probably also driven out of desperation because of the difficult economic period we’ve been through. \n“The pressure of having to meet the higher cost of living, sense of entitlement and also possibly greed all come into play. People think, 'what’s the easiest way of getting my hands on something? Ah, family’. My sense is this is probably going to grow.” \nAnother rationale for targeting the wealth of those closest to us, Patel says, is the belief that if people do get caught then their loved ones won’t prosecute. This clearly is a misguided sentiment. For as Dickens shows us, no dispute is so fierce as a family come to financial blows. \nThe bitter battle over the Burgess family will is one such case in point when two years ago the siblings of the deceased 80-year-old Daphne Burgess, of Milton Keynes, spent more in lawyer fees than the entire £200,000 inheritance at stake. In summing up the case, Lord Justice Mummery invoked the infamous “foggy family law suit” of Bleak House. \n“The cost of contesting Mrs Burgess’s will is a calamity for this family in every way,” he told the Court of Appeal. “Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) worse are the human consequences for a once close-knit and loving family.” \nOnly Dickens himself ever put it better “Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:43:59.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
