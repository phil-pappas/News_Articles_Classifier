AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires A dividend bonanza of $18 billion is set to line the pockets of shareholders in the next six weeks, leading investors to mull their reinvestment strategies as market volatility continues.\nInstitutional and retail investors alike have been hoarding cash since the market came off its April peak, waiting for the market to settle. Some fund managers have increased their cash holdings to as much as 50 per cent of their total portfolio.\nBut with the record amount of dividends set to flow back to investors, those looking to reinvest are mulling whether to keep the dividends in cash, concerned it may be too soon to dive back into the equity market.\nThe big names kicking off payout season this week include Suncorp Group with $488 million, and Woodside Petroleum, returning $467 million. The big banks have already paid out interim dividends of more than $8 billion combined, excluding Commonwealth Bank, which will pay out on October 1.\nWith the market under pressure, opportunities are beginning to emerge, says David Sokulsky, UBS Wealth Management Australia head of investment strategy.\nBut until the US Federal Reserve lifted interest rates from near zero for the first time since 2006, a move that could occur in October or December when its policy-setting committee next meets, cash was the best place allocate dividends, he said.\nBanks may be promising \"It may be another month or so, but wait and see how the banks go [after the Fed decision]. They may be an attractive buy.\"\n He noted that while cash returns were low, with the official interest rate at 2 per cent with a risk of further easing, it was faring better than the sharemarket, down 4.5 per cent year to date.\n\"Given the volatility, cash is looking OK. The equity market is probably a bit oversold but could still go lower,\" Mr Sokulsky said.\nAMP Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said depending on the investment strategy, now could be a good time to invest in equities.\n\"Investors who are looking to grow their wealth over time and aren't too concerned about the short term volatility should be looking to invest in the sharemarket,\" he said.\nReferring to the adage \"sell in May and go away\" the seasonally weak period for the sharemarket was due to end in October, coinciding with the end of the dividend payout season and provided the ideal time to reinvest before the market picks up, he said, capitalising on dividend growth.\n\"Yes, the market can go lower from here, but we've already come a long way, and the bulk of the selling has been done.\"\nDavid McDonald, chief investment strategist, Credit Suisse Private Banking Australia said he had been advising clients that keeping cash on the side was a good strategy until the market bottomed.\n\"The pullback is getting quite significant now, there's certainly some value starting to appear,\" Mr McDonald said\nEuropean shares better buy While the Australian market was beginning to look \"cheap\", concerns around China's economic slowdown and falling commodity prices offset the opportunity, and offshore equities were a better buy, particularly Europe, he said.\n\"The Australian dollar is back around the US72Â¢ mark, that might be a big opportunity for people to take another chance to put money offshore,\" he said.\nEurope was particularly compelling if the European Central Bank initiated further quantitative easing measures, resulting in a boost to equities.\nAt home, the stocks that had US dollar exposure were the best buys. The greenback is expected to get a boost against most major currencies when the Fed begins its interest rate tightening cycle.\nBut Mr McDonald said he hoped to see some stability before taking the plunge.\n\"Day-to-day swings of up to 3 and 4 per cent makes it difficult for people to plunge in,\" he said.\n\"You'd have to be happy with the risk.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-22T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:41:51.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
