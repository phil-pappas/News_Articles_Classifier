While there could be a kneejerk sell off across EMs, India would likely emerge as relative value, given relatively higher growth.”\nBut the report warned that the worst is if the Fed delays action to October or December as more the delay higher will be volatility which will lead the foreign funds to keep of emerging markets, including India.\n“A delayed Fed action will stall capital inflows till the Winter, given the uncertainty about the turnaround in earnings and the Bihar poll results on November 8. With the RBI likely to await forex inflows and OMO purchases only in 1Q, this would likely tighten liquidity at a time credit offtake is already running at a low 9.5 per cent,” it said.\nOn its expectations from the September 29 RBI policy meeting, the report said it expects a 25 bps cut and warned that “an unlikely RBI push back to early 2016 may not be as positive for risk on as some think as growth fears could overwhelm comfort about lower rates”.\nThe report also said it expects the RBI to increase the foreign holding in government securities to by USD 5-6 billion from the existing levels as G-secs are already oversold by any macro parameters.\n 11, 2015 6:44 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T22:23:21.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
