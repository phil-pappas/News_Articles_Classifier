So if you have been unhappy with your current bank's customer service, interest rates or overdraft fees then take a look at our guide on where to find the best deals. \nAlmost no current accounts pay any interest, so if you have a healthy balance then look for one which pays at least something. However if you are familiar with living in your overdraft facility, then you'll want to pick one which charges no fees. \nMost of the major banks also offer some form of packaged account, where you will pay a monthly fee for a range of benefits such as mobile phone and travel insurance. If you are going to take the plunge - fees can be as much as £15 a month - then make sure you are happy with what the insurance covers. \nBEST MAINSTREAM BANK ACCOUNTS HSBC Bank Account There is no interest paid on credit balances with this account and no free overdraft – interest is charged at 19.9%. But customers will have access to their accounts via telephone, mobile and internet banking, as well as the opportunity to open a Regular Savings Account, which offers 4% AER for the first year. \nHalifax's Reward Current Account The bank is currently offering £100 if you switch your account to it and will also give you £5 every month if you pay in more than £750 a month and remain in credit. You'll also have the security of a £50 overdraft buffer, meaning you won't be charged if you merely slip into your overdraft at the end of the month. If you do use your overdraft then you will be charged a daily fee, beginning at £1 a day. \nBarclays Bank Account It pays no interest, has an overdraft rate of 19.3% and offers customers the chance to add a number of features including insurance benefits for a monthly fee. Its mobile app will let you manage your money, while your debit card can also be used for contactless payments for purchases under £20. If you so wish, you can also add a picture of your choice to your debit card. \nNatWest Select Account NatWest's standard account pays 0% interest and only offers a £10 interest-free overdraft facility. But its emergency cash service lets you withdraw up to £300 when your debit card has been lost or stolen and its mobile app lets customers pay bills, withdraw cash their card and transfer money to family and friends. \nNationwide's Flex Direct This free account pays 5% on balances up to £2,500 for the first 12 months as long as you pay in more than £1,000 a month; along with a fee-free overdraft for the year too. Access to the account is via online or telephone banking but branch help can be sought in an emergency. \nLloyds TSB Classic Account Pays tiered interest starting at 1.5% on balances up to £1,000, rising to 3% on   £5,000 – but only if you pay in more than £1,000 a month and stay in credit. The interest-free overdraft facility is limited to just £25 but its Money Planner service lets customers keep a close-eye on their spending. \nBEST PACKAGED ACCOUNTS Santander 123 Account For just £2 a month you can get cashback on a variety of household bills including 1% on water, council tax and Santander mortgages, 2% on gas and electricity and 3% on mobile phone, broadband and television packages. Interest is 1% AER on balances from £1,000 and up to 3% on balances over £3,000. \nNationwide Building Society: Flex Plus A £10 monthly fee will get you an enhanced interest rate of 3% AER on balances up to £2,500, a three-month fee-free overdraft facility with a £100 free-free limit after that, plus worldwide travel and mobile phone insurance and UK and European breakdown cover. \nBEST OF THE REST Co-operative Current Account Plus Doesn't pay interest but offers a fee-free overdraft of £200, online and mobile banking, plus call centres which are open 24/7. It was named Uswitch.com's top rated current account provider in 2013 and Co-op will pay you £100 if you switch to it. \nCoventry Building Society: Coventry First You can earn 1.10% AER on balances for the first 12 months (rate includes 0.85 bonus), plus a £250 interest-free overdraft facility. Its call centre is UK-based but not manned 24 hours a day. \nSmile Current Account The online bank offers a £500 fee-free overdraft and access to its saving accounts and credit cards, while the debit card offers contactless payment for purchases under £20. As part of Co-op it runs an ethical investment policy and customers can use its branches as well as Post Offices. \nFirst Direct First Account £100 will be credited to your new account if you switch to First Direct. The account also offers a £250 interest-free overdraft, plus customers can speak to them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Accounts can be managed online and by phone but customers can also use HSBC branches to pay in money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:19:27.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
