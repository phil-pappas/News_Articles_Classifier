The short opens with a marriage proposal, from there it moves back in time as the groom-to-be saves $2,225 to buy an engagement ring. By the end we learn that he used the Simple app to start saving when the bride-to-be first bonded with his young daughter. He has $1,783 when the trio moves into a new house, $351 as they hike in the woods. It's enough to make this sappy reporter tear-up in a crowded restaurant.But does the bank that produced the video just have a really good marketing team? Or are they delivering on the fundamental changes they claim to seek? Wednesday, Simple added a point to the change column when the Portland, Oregon-based company eliminated all fees.\"Rather than generating revenue when customers make mistakes, Simple earns money from interest and interchange, or rather, when our customers use their accounts,\" explained Simple CEO and co-founder Josh Reich in a blog post on the move. \"This revenue model is a manifestation of our belief that you should have access to your money when you need it, without paying fees.\"In recent years a number of online only banks have come onto the scene. They argue that in our mobile-first, internet-centric age bank branches are unnecessary. By eliminating branches and cutting the costs associated with them these newcomers claim they can better align their business models and offerings to customers' needs -- especially young customers. As a group they charge lower fees than the household name banks, reward users with higher interest rates and often provide sleek tools for managing personal finances. Founded in 2009, Simple was an early entrant into the online banking space. They have developed a cult following with a feature that automatically pulls aside a little bit of money each day toward personalized goals. Most budgeting tools allow users to plan but do not actually move their money, which arguably made Simple more effective. Plus people loved Simple's pastel-accented app and website, as well as its clean white debit card. (One guy, who has no relation to the company, even posted a video to YouTube to commemorate receiving his Simple Visa. The soundtrack? Jason Mraz's love ballad \"I Won't Give Up.\") In 2014 Spanish bank BBVA acquired Simple for $117 million.For most of its history Simple delivered on approximately one-and-a-half of the three promises made by the new wave of online banks. In addition to the savings tool, the company charged minimal fees, most notably doing away with the dreaded overdraft fees by not allowing customers to overdraft. Starting today Simple's required schedule of fees contains only zeros. This is a shift from its fee plan up to this point which stripped out the most onerous fees but included some charges to cover the cost of, say, replacing a lost card or printing a cashier's check.In an interview Reich explained if someone needs to withdraw $10,000 for a down payment on a house -- the largest thing users are saving for -- Simple has already made more than enough on that account to cover customer acquisition costs. Simple earns a fee from merchants every time a Simple card is swiped and earns interest on the funds held with them. \"It felt kind of petty,\" says Reich. \"A customer has been saving up to buy house, they are withdrawing $10,000 and we're charging them a $2 fee for that? Let's get out of the way.\"[caption id=\"attachment_17824\" align=\"\" width=\"725\"] Simple's fee schedule starting 09/09/15.[/caption]Where Simple isn't beating the big guys is on interest rates paid out. Users earn just 0.01% on money held in a Simple account, which is $1 for every $10,000 in the account and no more than a traditional bank. \"Interest rates are so low right now that you can gather headlines that are disproportionate to the actual savings to consumers,\" says Reich. \"You are going to end up paying a lot more in fees unless you are a super rich millionaire who has got hundreds of thousands of dollars in your account. We figure the better thing to do financially for customers is to eliminate points where they are paying actual cash.\" That said, he concedes a lot of different business models can work.With that in mind meet some of the other online bank accounts --- Aspiration Monthly Fees: $0Overdraft Fees: $33 (the company says it will only charge this fee on paper check transactions)ATM Fees: $0 in network; $0 after refund out of networkInterest Paid: 1%Required Minimum Balance: $0 BankMobile Monthly Fees: $0Overdraft Fees: $0ATM Fees: $0 in network; fees set by terminal owner at others; $0 after refund out of network if deposit more than $1,500 a monthInterest Paid: 0% in checking account; 0.75% in savings accountRequired Minimum Balance: $0 Moven Monthly Fees: $0Overdraft Fees: $0ATM Fees: $0 in network; fees set by terminal owner at othersInterest Paid: 0%Required Minimum Balance: $0 Simple Monthly Fees: $0Overdraft Fees: $0ATM Fees: $0 in network; fees set by terminal owner at othersInterest Paid: 0.01%Required Minimum Balance: $0When deciding between accounts consider what features are most valuable to you. For example, unlike some of its competitors Simple will not reimburse customers for fees charged by ATMs outside of its network. If it is important for you to be able to get cash from any ATM Simple may not be the best choice for you. For people with large account balances it likely makes sense to take the interest money and run. But it is possible younger folks with less cash and less experience managing their finances will gain more from a budgeting tool they can stick with and a fee structure that won't work against them.", "external_links": ["https://www.simple.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd_wi8gT0pw", "https://www.simple.com/blog/goodbye-fees", "https://www.simple.com/policies/schedule-of-fees"], "published": "2015-09-10T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:44:59.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
