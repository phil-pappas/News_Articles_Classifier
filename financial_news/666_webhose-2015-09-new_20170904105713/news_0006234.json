His colleagues, however, say that's not true. Getty Images Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Malcolm Turnbull was finalising his new frontbench and speaking with world leaders on Friday while behind him, the rancour caused by Monday's leadership spill was exploding with Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison turning on each other.\nAs Mr Turnbull spoke with Japan's Shinzo Abe to discuss China and other regional matters, and was briefed by Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens and Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin, Mr Morrison confirmed that Mr Abbott had offered to make him Treasurer and \"throw Joe Hockey under a bus\" so Mr Abbott could save his leadership.\nIn an extraordinary interview on radio station 2GB in which he was accused of treachery by pro-Abbott shock jock Ray Hadley, Mr Morrison confirmed he had been offered the promotion to deputy leader and Treasurer on Monday afternoon after Mr Turnbull had declared he would be challenging.\n\"The only person who offered me the job of Treasurer before the ballot on Monday was Tony Abbott,\" he said.\n\"He was asking me to throw Joe Hockey under a bus.\n\"I didn't understand if we were to be successful that night how we would explain to the Australian people why he thought Joe Hockey was the best man for Treasurer the day before and then I was the best man for Treasurer the day after.\"\nMr Hadley told listeners that Mr Abbott had texted him and said \"Scott has blotted his copybook\".\nMr Morrison, currently the Social Services Minister, is being accused of treachery by the Abbott camp because he ran dead during the leadership spill in the knowledge he would become Treasurer under Mr Turnbull.\n Mr Morrison voted for Mr Abbott in the spill but did not get involved, nor did he direct his followers to back Mr Abbott.\nJulie Bishop and Christopher Pyne face similar claims of treachery.\nMr Pyne, who is angling for the Defence portfolio, claimed on Friday that he only switched his support to Mr Turnbull on Sunday night after a group of plotters informed him they were going to trigger the spill Monday .\n\"I don't move around in the shadows and do the job on people. I come from the front not from the back,\" he said.\nThis was refuted by multiple sources who said Mr Pyne was fully aware of the plot for weeks and had been telling people days in advance there was going to be a leadership change.\nMs Bishop, who claimed she only switched to Mr Turnbull on Monday after being shown the numbers, declined to comment when asked about Mr Abbott offering her job to Mr Morrison as well.\nCampaigning in the WA seat of Canning ahead of Saturday's byelection, she said the by-election result would be the \"ultimate test\" of whether dumping Mr Abbott was the right thing.\nMr Morrison, a Christian, was livid when Mr Hadley demanded he put his hand on a Bible during the interview to ensure he was telling the truth.\n\"I don't have to swear on a Bible mate,\" he said. \"I'm not going to use my faith as a stunt for your program.\"\nHe repeatedly called Mr Hadley's demand \"offensive\" and said \"I thought we had a relationship\".\nMr Morrison said he warned Mr Abbott's office on Friday to take the leadership speculation seriously.\n\"I said on Friday to the PM's office that I thought things were pretty febrile and they should be on high alert.\"\nMr Morrison appears every week on Hadley's program.\nHe said after the interview that he would not be bullied by anyone but said they would probably make up and he anticipated appearing again if Mr Hadley requested it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-18T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:04:19.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
