Aaron Bunch Photographer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague China FTA: Sorting the facts from fiction\nElectrician Alan McPhail is at the coalface of the commodities downturn crimping the national economy.\nNot only is work drying up but his hourly rates are under pressure as unemployed miners return from Western Australia's north-west and cut their fees to secure dwindling work.\nMcPhail, 50, is angry and perplexed by politicians clamouring to sign a free trade deal with China that allows the importation of Chinese workers.\nBill Shorten pictured with the ALP's candidate for Canning, Matt Keogh. Philip Gostelow \"Tony Abbott wants to bring people in to work but there's not enough work for those of us here,\" McPhail says.\n\"Abbott might be earning a lot and having a good life, they [politicians] might have rental properties and the like. But me, I'm borrowing from my [home] loan to pay for the things I need for the business.\"\nMcPhail says it's not just him. Abbott is on the nose with his friends and customers.\n\"No one wants to vote for him,\" McPhail says.\nRelated Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party's Canning candidate Andrew Hastie in Perth last month. Thomas Davidson It is his deep concern for the economy that McPhail will carry with him to the ballot box in a fortnight to elect a new member for Canning.\nTwo years ago he voted for Liberal MP Don Randall, who died in July triggering the byelection.\n\"I voted for Don,\" McPhail says. \"He was in the area and had the policy that if you talk we listen. I know people and they've gone to him and he listened.\"\nBut a lot has changed since 2013 and the candidates for the two major political parties lack Randall's worn Canning shoe leather.\nFormer SAS captain Andrew Hastie, 32, is contesting the seat for the Liberal Party while Matt Keogh, 33, a dispute resolution lawyer is flying the Labor flag.\nThe ACTU has been running hard-hitting television commercials warning Australian jobs are at risk if Abbott signs the FTA with China and the timing couldn't be better for Keogh.\nThey are amplifying simmering concerns among swathes of Canning's tradies and about 10,000 fly-in, fly-out workers.\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics Census figures show in Armadale, the construction industry is the second biggest employment group after retail. Manufacturing comes in third.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten has played up the risk to jobs from the China FTA even though his stance appears at odds with several Labor leaders including Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, who back the deal.\nEven former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke has backed the agreement and warned Labor that \"talk of opposing it is just absolutely against Australia's best interests\".\nYet, Labor insiders know fear about the China FTA is white-hot in the electorate. The long leash that Shorten is giving to the unions appears to be a calculated use of anxiety about Chinese workers to maximise Labor's chance in an electorate filled with blue-collar technicians.\nBefore Shorten took questions from the assembled media at a press conference about crime in Canning on Thursday, he made this observation.\n\"I have to say, though, from the railway station to the bus stop to walking through the mall in Armadale, without a doubt the biggest issue is unemployment and jobs,\" Shorten said.\n\"I've had people come up to me and express their concerns with the China free-trade agreement. They can't understand why Mr Abbott hasn't chosen to stand up more strongly for Australian jobs.\n\"There's recognition that with the mining boom slowing that unemployment's a real challenge in Western Australia. So the real issue here ... is the jobs of the future, jobs for people in Canning and jobs for Western Australians. But it seems that Mr Abbott and his Liberals are just focused on saving Mr Abbott's job. Happy to take any questions.\"\nMcPhail is unsure who he will vote for. But he concurs with Shortens' assessment and says everyone he knows is worried about job security.\n\"They want to be able to pay their mortgage. It's so uncertain now,\" McPhail says.\nCanning is a vast electorate stretching 6178 square kilometres. It captures working class Armadale, which accounts for about 40 per cent of voters, as well as Mandurah, a seaside hamlet popular with retirees.\nFurther south lies Pinjarra, home of Alcoa's aluminium refinery, while to the east lies the Boddington gold mine.\nBut there are also sheep, beef and fruit and vegetable farmers.\nChris Birmingham owns Caraholly Orchard, which grows apples, nectarines, cherries and peaches. He also produces beef. He says Shorten's opposition to the China FTA is \"political games\".\n\"We know Bill pretty well,\" Birmingham says. \"He thinks he can pick up votes but it's not about the truth.\"\nBirmingham says Shorten's tactics are more about pleasing the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy union.\nOn Friday, former Labor energy minister Martin Ferguson hit out at the CFMEU for scaremongering over the China FTA. \"It's almost as if the CFMEU … wants to hold the rest of the nation … to ransom for their short-term political gain,\" he said.\nHe also suggested the deal had racist overtones.\nBirmingham has met Hastie and describes him as \"exceptional\". He has previously voted for Randall. Yet even the conservative farmer finds it difficult to support Abbott.\n\"He's a pain in the backside,\" Birmingham says. \"I say that as a conservative. There's plenty of better people than him.\"\nRandall held the seat with an 11.8 per cent margin, of which about 4 per cent to 5 per cent is thought to be Randall's personal margin.\n\"It really is a non-Labor electorate in its present structure,\" says political analyst professor David Black.\nThe electorate loved Randall. He was a grassroots local who, despite the vastness of his electorate, seemed to pop up everywhere. He fought hard for local issues and took on Canberra when he needed to.\nHe was active behind the scenes in moves earlier this year to dump Abbott from the leadership.\nYet polling suggests a big swing is on the cards. A recent poll of 768 Canning residents commissioned by influential union United Voice showed the Coalition's primary support dropping seven points since the 2013 election to 44.4 per cent. Labor rose 3.6 points to 30.2 per cent.\nBut there is speculation Labor isn't working as hard, or spending as much as it should, to win the seat.\nThe accusation, denied by Shorten and Labor insiders, is that Labor wants to rattle the Liberal Party but not by so much that it causes a change of leadership.\n\"The last thing they want is a federal leadership change,\" Black says.\n\"The standard view is that given Labor has a good candidate but not investing [in the campaign] suggest that they're not going to win but will put up a good show. They want to shake things but they don't want to change the [Liberal] leadership.\"\nIf Abbott were to be dumped Labor knows it would have a hard job winning the next election if the people's favourite, Malcolm Turnbull, took over.\nBlack suggests Abbott would survive even if there were a significant swing of 7 per cent because the party would attribute a large chunk of this to the loss of Randall's personal margin.\n\"Labor is in this election,\" Shorten confidently told reporters on Thursday.\n\"Judge us by the calibre of our ideas, not on how much money we spend on billboards. We think this byelection is tremendously important. The fact that the Liberals are somehow trying to say that their opponents are running dead is too arrogant for words.\"\nAbbott has appeared on the campaign trail twice. Shorten has appeared three times.\nHastie has batted away talk the byelection is a referendum on the Prime Minister's job.\n\"I'm very busy on the ground, I don't have time to take counsel from the east-coat Twitterati,\" he recently told reporters.\n\"The people of Canning are concerned about jobs, the problems of ice and infrastructure, so I'm focused on the ground here.\"\nIn a recent speech he took aim at his Labor rival Keogh, who Labor has talked up for being born in the area, educated in local schools but until recently was living in the trendy, inner city suburb Mount Lawley.\n\"My opponent across the road has a sign up that says 'Born in Canning',\" Hastie said.\n\"Now I don't take a born to rule attitude at all when it comes to this campaign. While he may have been born here in the electorate he chose to move out while I have chosen to move in.\"\nKeogh's campaign has targeted Abbott, warning the government has left Canning \"in the lurch\" and was making cuts that would hurt schools and hospitals.\nBut he has also made commitments based on Shorten securing office in 2017, such as spending $170 million on road infrastructure.\nHastie's campaign is running under the tagline \"Andrew is an experienced leader. Not another politician.\"\nIt picks up on a growing frustration from voters that both sides of politics are too consumed by playing politics at the expense of growing the economy.\n\"It's like what Bart Simpson says. You're damned if you do, damned if you don't,\" McPhail says.\n\"We are sick of the slagging. It's a circus. Unemployment is up. They need to get on with the job.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:03:27.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
