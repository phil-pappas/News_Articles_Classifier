Photo: Reuters\nConsumer confidence plunged last week after weak economic growth and retail data sparked worries Australia could be facing a sharp economic slowdown and even its first recession in a generation.\nThe weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index dropped 5.8 per cent to its lowest levels since July 2014, when sentiment was still affected by the measures of Coalition government's first budget.\nThe slide comes after three weeks of market volatility during which confidence remained surprisingly stable, holding up above its long-run average.\nConsumer confidence has plunged to its lowest since July last year.\nBut last week's weaker than expected data on second-quarter gross domestic product growth, which slowed to a snail's pace of just 0.2 per cent, and a disappointing 0.1 per cent decline in July retail sales dented confidence.\nAdvertisement \"In particular, weak June quarter GDP and an unexpected fall in July retail spending seem to have rattled consumers,\" ANZ co-head of Australian economics Felicity Emmett said.\n\"The magnitude of the fall in confidence is concerning, being the largest weekly fall we've seen since around middle of 2012. This highlights consumers' fragility in the current economic environment,\" she said.\nThe weak data prompted media and some economists to discuss the possibility of Australia dipping into a recession after 24 consecutive years of growth, possibly also hurting confidence.\nLaminar Capital chief economist Stephen Roberts estimated the chances of two consecutive quarters of negative growth - the conventional definition of a recession - at between 35 and 40 per cent, up from 25 per cent before the GDP data.\nLast week's decline in confidence last week was broad based, ANZ noted, with subindexes on financial and economic conditions all falling to nine-week lows.\nThe subindexes on economic conditions fell 5.7 per cent and household finances fell 4.5 per cent last week. Consumers' views about whether 'now is a good time to buy a major household item' fell 8.4 per cent, reaching the lowest level since May 2014.\n\"Interestingly, views on purchasing a household item have reached the lowest level since May last year, when confidence plunged in response to the 2014-15 Commonwealth budget,\" Ms Emmett said. Combined with the drop in households' view of their own finances as well as slower house price growth, this suggests that the outlook for retail is likely to remain challenging.\"\nInvestors will be watching Tuesday's monthly NAB business survey (due at 11.30am) and Wednesday's monthly Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence index for further signs of deteriorating sentiment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:01:03.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
