She’s just a trusting mother-in-law.\nMrs Solomon’s son-in-law Neil Taylor, 58, was the one with the problem. Between 2002 and 2013 the former bank worker spent a mind-boggling $2.4 million at the pokies.\nMore than $585,000 of that money belonged to Mrs Solomon, a widow and the mother of Taylor’s partner.\nThe problems for Mrs Solomon began in 2002 when her husband died, according to the Penrith Press .\nPenrith woman Elaine Solomon was robbed of her life-savings by her son-in-law. Source: News Corp Australia\nNot used to the responsibility, Mrs Solomon went looking for help. That’s when Taylor got involved.\nPenrith Local Court last Wednesday heard that Taylor blew a $300,000 inheritance, $500,000 in superannuation savings and $1 million from a lucky lottery prize he won.\nTaylor convinced Mrs Solomon to sell her home then gained access to her accounts to feed his habit. He covered up his crimes by presenting her with false bank statements.\nHe “preyed on” Mrs Solomon, the court heard, before sentencing him to two years behind bars.\n“The breach of trust in regards to this case makes it a worst-case scenario,” Magistrate Roger Clisdell said.\nTaylor came clean in 2005 and promised to pay the money back. But that never happened. Asked why he didn’t use the lotto win to repay his debts, he said: “Because that was my money. I won it.”\nMrs Solomon told the Press she was devastated.\n“I never thought that a family would do such a thing to a family. I couldn’t believe it actually.\nNeil Taylor’s gambling addiction corrupting his mind and his morals. Pic: Matthew Sullivan Source: News Corp Australia\n“And the trouble was we were close families. I had the two girls (daughters), so when I got the two boys (their husbands) I thought I had got two sons.\n“Never trust your son-in-law. I should never have trusted him. It is terrible. What he could do was wasted, he went crooked.”\nThe court heard that while Taylor was spending Mrs Solomon’s money, he didn’t once check on her. She said she won’t bother checking on him.\n“I wonder what jail he went to, not that I would go to visit him, there is no way in hell I would do that,” she said.\nProblem gambling is nothing new in Australia. Last year, poker machine revenue topped $9.8 billion dollars. This year to date gamblers have lost more than $3 billion on poker machines.\nIndependent MP Andrew Wilkie told The Project earlier this month that there’s a reason Aussie battlers are hardest hit.\n“They are the victims of a ruthless industry targeting disadvantaged areas,” he said.\nIn 2012, then prime minister Julia Gillard oversaw the introduction of mandatory precommitment legislation where gamblers would set a limit and be forced to stick to that limit. That measure never made it to the club floor.\nIf you need help with a gambling addiction phone Gambler’s Helpline on 1800 858 858 or Lifeline on 13 11 14.\nWaleed Aly from The Project talks about Australia's problem gambling addiction 0:23 Play video\nAustralia's spent $9.8 billion on poker machines in 2014 and government's are doing nothing to help.
