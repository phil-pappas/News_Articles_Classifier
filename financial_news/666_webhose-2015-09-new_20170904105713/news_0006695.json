Includes Real Life Trade examples.\nNew York City, NY\nAward winning author, Alan Ellman, announces the publication of his newest book, “Alan Ellman’s Encyclopedia for Covered Call Writing, Volume 2.” With this adjunct volume, Ellman pumps up the value of each classic Encyclopedia’s chapter with supplemental articles, charts, calculations and more that he has written and organized over the last four years specifically for his loyal followers.\nWe find ourselves living in a time where “Discipline trumps conviction,” according to Jim Cramer of CNBC. “Find your own form of discipline to make sure you are watching your stocks and have a game plan for when things go wrong.”\nDiscipline and position management are core principles of the BCI methodology, and the Ellman Encyclopedia, Vol. 2 is designed to provide today’s average investor with the best information and resources to generate a monthly cash-flow during all types of market conditions.\n“Education is key,” notes Ellman. With the recent instabilities in today’s market, such as Greece in early July, China’s devaluing of the Yuan in mid-August, and most recently the Fed watch regarding an imminent interest rate hike, managing one’s position and following a conservative investment model are the basis of sustaining one’s success.\nAn Amazon Best Seller since its publication in November of 2011, the classic Ellman Encyclopedia took the blue collar investor down a low-risk, wealth-building road that fostered short term pride of accomplishment, and long-term, monthly, residual income by selling options using stocks such as Apple Computer, Facebook, and Starbucks among many others.\nThis makes Ellman’s 6th book on stock option investing in 8 years. His book, “Stock Investing for Students” remains required reading at the University of Maryland.\nFor more information please visit: http://www.TheBlueCollarInvestor.com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12972084.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12972084.htm"], "published": "2015-09-21T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:04:11.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
