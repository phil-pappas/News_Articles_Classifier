All three are now rising. \n\"But wages can only grow as businesses grow. A £7.20 National Living Wage in 2016 and a £9 National Living Wage by 2020 are laudable objectives, but they are a gamble. \n\"They depend on organic productivity improvements. \n\"And we should be careful what we wish for. Our jobs-rich recovery is a success which depends on entry level jobs and progression routes on our high streets and in our leisure sector.\" \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that the introduction of the National Living Wage could cause 60,000 job losses in total. \nManpower, the employment group, raised similar concerns in a report this week which warned that firms were already scaling back on their hiring plans to account for the looming wage rise. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is due to take effect in April but will not be available to the under-25s. \nManpower said the living wage could mean that \"some employers may look to mitigate the extra costs by taking on more younger or self-employed workers, who are not entitled to the national living wage.\" \nIn July the Department for Business Innovation and Skills dismissed the more draconian job loss claims saying: \"The Government believes the new National Living Wage is affordable given the strength of the UK economy and labour market.\" \nIt added: \"The OBR forecasts an increase in employment of 1.1 million over the whole forecast period, with 700,000 of those coming after the National Living Wage is introduced in April 2016.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T10:39:21.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
