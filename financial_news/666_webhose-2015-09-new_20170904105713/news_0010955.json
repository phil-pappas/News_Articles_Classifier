They seem to care more about image and the accumulation of things.\" \nIn the book, he offers insight on how readers can determine what is truly important to them and make financial decisions that will help lead them to their ideal life. \n\"Life shouldn't be about trying to keep up with the Joneses,\" Berger says. \"In my experience, they're broke anyway. The people who you think have money, based on the cars they drive, the homes they live in and the vacations they take, may be living paycheck to paycheck, accumulating very little to fund even a meager lifestyle in retirement.\" \nAbout Brad Berger \nBrad Berger, a managing partner and owner of Cornerstone Financial Strategies LLC ( www.LiveYourIdealLife.com ) in Tacoma, Wash., is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ Professional with more than two decades of experience.
