The yield for the seven-day reverse repo stood at 2.35 percent, Xinhua news agency quoted the Bank of China's (PBOC) statement as saying.   Under a reverse repo, the central bank purchases securities from large banks and brokerages with the agreement to sell them in the future as an effective means to tackle short-term money shortages in the market.   The cash injection will offset the effects from earlier reverse repo due on Tuesday.   Given a stable renminbi (RMB), the money shortage was greatly eased in September and the PBOC's operations were smaller than those in August.
