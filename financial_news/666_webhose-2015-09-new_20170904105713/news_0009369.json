When there's not much money we sometimes say: 'We have to tighten our belts.'\" \nMorales, a leftist who nationalized the oil industry in 2006, said he had asked his cabinet to come up with an austerity plan. \nAt the same time, he said the Andean country was still positioned well to handle a downturn, cushioned by $15 billion in reserves, the greatest in Latin America as a percentage of GDP. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T21:38:16.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
