Alex Ellinghausen by John Kerin Long-serving NSW senator Marise Payne has become the first woman to be appointed Defence Minister and will have to deliver the government's new 20-year defence plan within weeks.\nThe appointment unveiled as part of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's post-leadership-coup reshuffle is being viewed by the defence sector as \"merit-based\" and befitting Senator Payne's strong interest in defence issues, including formerly heading some of Parliament's most powerful legal and national security committees.\nMr Turnbull hailed the moderate Senator Payne as one of the government's \"most capable and experienced senators\".\nSenator Payne becomes \"the first woman to be appointed Minister for Defence in our nation's history\", he said.\n\"She has spent two years in the human services portfolio and has done an outstanding job in modernising government service delivery.\n\"She will release the defence white paper later this year, defining our key national security priorities, and she will, of course, join the [powerful] National Security Committee of the cabinet.\"\nSenator Payne released a short statement on Twitter saying she was \"incredibly honoured to have been appointed Defence Minister\".\nSenior South Australian Liberal minister Christopher Pyne had been strongly tipped to gain the defence post, given Mr Turnbull's determination to lift the government's flagging fortunes in South Australia.\n Mr Pyne's seat was under threat after polls plummeted over former prime minister Tony Abbott's failure to keep a pledge to build the next submarine fleet in Adelaide.\nHowever, defence sources suggest with Mr Turnbull believed to be strongly backing an Adelaide build having a South Australian Minister in charge of defence could have been viewed as too much.\nAs it is, Mr Pyne will have some input as Industry Minister and a member of cabinet.\nBut Senator Payne's appointment was lauded by former defence minister Peter Reith, who said it was a recognition of her committee work and \"clearly based on merit\".\nThe executive director of the lobby group the Australia Defence Association, Neil James, described the appointment of Senator Payne as \"an inspired choice\".\n\"Senator Payne has had a longstanding and genuine interest in foreign affairs and defence issues, particularly through her committee work in the Parliament,\" Mr James said.\n\"Senator Payne is a great listener and receptive to a range of views. This is an imaginative appointment and hopefully one aimed at ensuring the longer-term interests of defence.\"\nSenator Payne, 51, was appointed to the Senate in 1997 under the Howard government and served a long apprenticeship on a series of legislative committees including the Joint Standing Committee on Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nShe served in a number of shadow portfolios including Indigenous Development and Employment and Housing before being appointed human services minister by Mr Abbott in 2013.\nSenator Payne will have to hit the ground running, given a new defence white paper is due to be delivered as early as October.\nThe paper sets out the government's vision for defending Australia for the next two decades and includes an extensive $300 billion-plus new weaponry wishlist.\nSenator Payne will also oversee the final phase of the controversial submarine bidding process, which is being fiercely contested by Japanese, French and German submarine firms and had been overshadowed by claims that Mr Abbott wanted the project to go to Japan.\nFormer defence minister Kevin Andrews, a close associate of Mr Abbott, also lashed out at Mr Turnbull on Sunday after it was confirmed he would not retain the post, saying Australia had had more defence ministers than prime ministers over the past three years.\n\"I am disappointed that Mr Turnbull did not accept my offer to work with him,\" Mr Andrews said. \"My remaining in the job was not about me, it was all about the stability of our defence and its leadership.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:47:18.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
