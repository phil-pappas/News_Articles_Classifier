It rose 1.3 per cent on Wednesday in its biggest daily jump since August 20, helped by data showing US consumer prices unexpectedly fell in August. \n\"No change in Fed rate target and little indication of a commitment to increasing rates still this year is driving the dollar down and providing support to gold,\" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for US Bank Wealth management. \n\"Fed comments about global market volatility and global economic risks are also supporting, likely, safe-haven flows into gold.\" \nSilver was up 1.8 per cent at $US15.16 following a 3.5 per cent jump in the previous session. Platinum was up 0.7 per cent at $US974.74 an ounce and palladium was up 0.1 per cent at $US609.50. \nBASE METALS \nCopper had hit nearly two-month highs after a massive earthquake in top producer Chile but since retreated as reports showed little damage to mines so far. \nMost base metals prices declined as investors refocused on concerns about demand in the biggest consumer, China, and ahead of a decision on US interest rates later in the day. \n\"Copper hasn't been showing huge conviction recently because there's still this worry about the demand side. \n\"Also, today's not the day for taking big bets in either direction ahead of the Fed decision this evening.\" \nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed up 0.4 per cent at $US5,400 a tonne after hitting its highest since July 22 at $US5,440.50 following initial reports of the Chile quake. \nLME zinc sagged 1.4 per cent to $US1,726; nickel slid 1.5 per cent to $US9,995; aluminium added 0.3 per cent to $US1,632; lead dropped 0.7 per cent to $US1,722 and tin shed 0.2 per cent to $US15,500. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook RBA to talk up economic outlook AAP \nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens will come to Canberra with a positive slant on the economic outlook when he â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:55:59.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
