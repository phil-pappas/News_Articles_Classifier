Cameron estimates that the failed adventure cost her $200 million - and it almost certainly led to her leaving the Bellamy's board, and selling her shares before the IPO.\nCameron offloaded 36.557 million shares at a dollar a piece. They are now worth around $226 million.\nShe is also missing out on extra boardroom perks. According to Bellamy's AGM notice its directors are seeking a 67 per cent pay rise, taking the board's remuneration pool from $600,000 to a cool $1 million.\nSpilt milk Speaking of dairy.\nCBD is counting down the days to the Harvey Norman AGM this year to see if Gerry Harvey 's detour into dairy causes more of a stir than the tea and coffee this year.\n\"If you want to put your money into a safe and boring company without any entrepreneurial skills then you should go somewhere else,\" was the billionaire retailer's message to the markets which sunk the stock below $4 following last week's announcement.\nIt sounds like either retail is going to continue to do it tough, or Gerry is getting bored with the same-old, same-old.\nAt least investors can't complain that he does not have their best interests at heart.\nGerry's only financial interest in Coomboona will be via the 49 per cent stake being acquired through his retailer.\nGerry even said he would have been happy to acquire the interest himself, had the Harvey Norman board given the deal the thumbs down.\nCBD is not sure if Gerry is heading off any potential shareholder insurrection this November by shoring up his own votes, or he just sees another bargain in the share price weakness.\nFor the second time in a week he waded into the market to buy shares. He pocketed another 1.2 million shares for just under $5 million.\nCharity Road Not everyone chooses a rubber chicken lunch, or, strap on a guitar, in the name of charity.\nCBD's hat goes off to the organisers of the 2015 Bullrush Rally \"a 2000km super car road trip down the east coast of Australia\" over five nights which ended in Melbourne on Saturday.\n\"Over five action-packed nights, entrants will look forward to driving breathtaking roads with over 30 super cars, building friendships over dinner at some of Australia's top restaurants, partying at the most exclusive venues, and pitting car against car, driver against driver, in a competitive yet fun environment at the Sydney Dragway.\"\nAnd after all of this tedious, but necessary fun was had, all proceeds went to the Starlight Children's Foundation.\nCBD must admit this sounds like our idea of a charity event with Lamborghinis, Porsches and Ferraris being the chariots of choice.\nParticipants include Finsure co-founder John Kolenda , who was obviously trying to stand out from the pack in his gull-winged Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.\nThere was also Rodney Michail , the Gold Coast car dealer who founded insurance broker 1800 Approved.\nHis team sported a Maserati GranTurismo.\nCBD wonders if he is the same Rodney Michail who used to own a classic 2005 Aston Martin DB9 Volante V12.\nAccording to reports, Michail wrote it off after driving off a Gold Coast boat ramp in 2011 into the drink while trying to retrieve a dropped cigarette.\nIt proved to be an expensive ciggy when the insurer refused to pay up.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T00:18:17.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
