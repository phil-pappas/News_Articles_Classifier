Guided by that certainty of the dispute settlement, I hereby order and direct that the application in question shall forthwith be served upon all the parties to the main appeal and a hearing date shall be taken before the registrar on Tuesday September 9 at 9am,\" he stated. \nSpeaking outside the court premises, the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) Chairman Omboko Milemba described the application as a delay tactic by TSC which he says will not succeed. \n\"What the judge has said is that he is not giving any stay orders meaning that as we talk now, the teachers are still having an order to be paid between 50 and 60 percent. He has told the Teachers Service Commission to serve the parties meaning ourselves, KNUT and other parties and then we will come back to court on the 9th of this month,\" he said. \nHis sentiments were echoed by KUPPET Secretary General Akelo Misori who stated that teachers will not be intimidated but will stay on the course of their strike. \n\"The work boycott continues because the teachers of this country have been provoked beyond measure by the Teachers Service Commission and government's failure to pay what is due to the teachers of this country. In the circumstances, there are no two ways about it. It is up to the government to see sense,\" he said. \nThe commission had filed the application on Tuesday while insisting that the government has no money to pay teachers. \nThe Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) lawyer Paul Muite described the move as insincere and stated that TSC was misleading Kenyans. \nMuite told Capital FM News that the order by the court of appeal required that the teachers' employer pay for the month of August using a total of Sh1.4 billion and not Sh17 billion. \nHe insisted that TSC had the capability to pay the money from their Sh181 billion fund kitty awarded to them by Treasury. \nThe development came even as learning remain paralysed in public schools countrywide as the teachers strike entered its third day. Kenya \nFormer President Moi on Wednesday celebrated his 91st birthday with students of Kabarak University. see more » Copyright © 2015 Capital FM. All rights reserved.
