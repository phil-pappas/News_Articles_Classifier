Courtesy of Christian Dior by Dan Thawley Subversion has always been the linchpin of Raf Simons’ aesthetic universe. The Belgian designer has been testing the outer limits of his creative capabilities (and our perspectives along with them) from the moment he switched from his studies in industrial design to pave a career in menswear in the late 1990s.\nFollowing those formative years, a time that honed not only his love for music and youth culture but also his keen eye for contemporary art and furniture, Simons’ remarkable journey into womenswear has been exhaustively documented. He started out with Jil Sander but is now at the helm of Christian Dior, where the designer pieces together the signatures that have come to define Dior’s 21st‑century woman.\nNot since Monsieur Dior’s own short career (he designed for a mere decade under his own name) have his inspirations and revolutionary silhouette been remixed with such subtlety, forming the foundation upon which Simons reinterprets the keystone traditions of French ready-to-wear – namely an abstract mix of pleating, lace, embroidery, fine knitwear and wool tailoring.\nThe autumn-winter 2012-13 haute couture collection, Simons’ debut outing for Christian Dior, remains a historic benchmark for this evolving style (captured in acute detail for Frédéric Tcheng’s 2015 film Dior & I ) which comprises such tropes as sorbet-tinged geometric lace, pleated and sliced bustiers hiding amorphous embroideries, gowns in degrade fur, and the transformation of Dior’s Bar suit into timeless metal-belted jackets, tuxedos, and coat dresses.\n“I want to bring a new dynamic, a new energy,” Simons said in 2013, upon unveiling his purist approach to Dior’s future. “It is a big challenge. The idea is to mix history and the future, fusing a more modern dress with, let’s say, a more historical one.” His ready-to-wear collections have seamlessly followed suit, combining unexpected colour (both violent and subdued) in such elements as asymmetric swathes of knife pleating, diaphanous overlays of broderie anglaise, laser-cut patent leather and, for his current autumn-winter 2015-16 collection, the unexpected pairing of sculptural camouflage knitwear with men’s shirting and delicate mesh collars.\nCollective expertise When applied to the flounced peplum tops, panelled cocktail dresses and strapless gowns inherent to Dior’s ladylike wardrobe, such a flurry of details has distinguished Simons’ tenure at Dior with a new feminine lightness and a decorative flourish, in marked contrast to his minimalist (at times severe) creations for Jil Sander. They have not, however, loosened his grasp on the deft handling of artistic references, from Sterling Ruby’s paintings transformed as printed silk gowns in that first couture outing to Andy Warhol’s early illustration picked out on the wafting “memory dresses” of his autumn-winter 2013-14 show.\nInstead, they have highlighted the benefits of the Dior atelier’s collective expertise. After all, it is their artisanal savoir faire that has allowed Simons to execute some of the most painstakingly detailed work of his career to date – pieces that despite their complex construction retain a striking sense of simplicity.\n This jarring contrast of his forward-thinking vision with the heritage of one of Paris’ most hallowed houses has produced the kind of ensembles that transcend the dated boundaries of high-society dress codes (he manages to inflect pieces with formal and sportswear details simultaneously) while radiating a French sophistication that hints “just so” at his ingrained sense of the avant-garde.\nThere is no doubt that Simons’ designs follow the gracious lines of his Dior predecessors, but it is up close that their ingenuity truly shines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:22:03.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
