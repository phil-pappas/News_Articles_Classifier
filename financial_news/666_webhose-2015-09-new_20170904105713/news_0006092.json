Peter Rae Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders It's been impossible to get prey Oil Search and predator Woodside in the same room but on Monday they found themselves sitting next to each other, speaking on the same panel at a conference in Melbourne.\nOil Search managing director Peter Botten and Phil Loader, Woodside's executive vice-president of global exploration and chairman of the conference, tried not to let things get too awkward on stage.\nLess than 12 hours earlier news had broken that Oil Search would reject Perth-based rival Woodside's $11.6 billion all-scrip takeover offer as \"opportunistic\" .\nMr Botten used his speech to talk up Oil Search as a \"true believer\" in Papua New Guinea, in a possible attempt to show up Woodside's offer as \"grossly undervaluing\" the company and its position in the Pacific Island nation.\n\"They were very, very special people that pioneered exploration in PNG, and to a lesser extent that has obviously continued into present day,\" he said at an American Association of Petroleum Geologists conference in Melbourne. Woodside wants Oil Search for its PNG assets.\n\"It's still a very challenging place to be â€¦ But our future in PNG and of doing business there has never been brighter.\"\nIt was put to Mr Botten that he was seen as the \"grand old man of PNG exploration\" in the country and there was concern about what a Woodside takeover would mean for his, and Oil Search's future.\nMr Botten said, \"I may be a grand old man but I'll be around for a little while longer.\"\n \"PNG is a great place and it's a country you either stay in for six months and get intimidated by, or you stay for a long, long time. You can actually make a big difference and combine a great commercial opportunity with social work, and it's a buzz.\"\nWoodside's Mr Loader was confident the depressed oil price would recover, saying it had collapsed \"mainly due to a supply imbalance\".\n\"This is the fourth time I've been through an oil price decline, and don't worry, it will come back.\"\nHe politely avoided the Woodside-Oil Search elephant in the room.\nThe theme of the three-day conference is Australia's emergence as an oil and gas powerhouse that can supply the world for the next 50 years.\nMr Botten said it was important to \"recognise that it's been a very long journey to the next 50 years\" in PNG, and talked to the \"challenges of doing business and finding hydrocarbons up there\".\n\"Oil Search holds the record in the Guinness Book of Records, I think, for starting exploration in 1929 and getting its first revenue stream from production in 1992. It's been a very long road, literally living on the smell of an oily rag.\"\nAbout 40 per cent of the potential resource base in PNG had been commercialised, he said.\nIt remains unclear if Woodside will return with a higher offer or a change in the structure to potentially include a cash component to sweeten Oil Search investors.\nAfter cancelling a planned meeting at the weekend between the two companies to discuss the potential deal, Oil Search formally rejected the offer on Monday morning, saying its board had made a unanimous decision.\nSpeaking after the panel session on Monday, Mr Botten said the Oil Search board met on Sunday night and did not meet with its potential suitor because \"we needed to have our own process before necessarily properly engaging or otherwise with Woodside\".\nOil Search has left the door open to consider rival offers for the company, after saying Woodside's offer would dilute its shareholders' interests in the company's growth prospects.\nMr Botten said on Monday that Oil Search was \"playing into a supply-demand balance we think is very attractive\".\n\"The oil price might be low but the quality, value, low-cost reserves are available, we believe, with PNG, and it all comes from the only people who stepped out and made the difference across many, many years.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/oil-search-to-reject-116b-deal-after-woodside-talks-canned-20150913-gjleyx", "https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-09-14T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:03:00.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
