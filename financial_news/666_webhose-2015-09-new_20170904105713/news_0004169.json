You can open the account online and withdrawing cash early will result in the loss of 90 days’ interest on the money. \n• Predictions on rates, stock markets and much more: get our weekly newsletter \nVirgin Money’s two-year cash Isa pays 2.06pc, an improvement on the previous best-buy from Halifax that pays 2pc. \nVirgin also launched an accompanying two-year savings bond, for money outside an Isa, that pays 2.06pc but the rate is some way off the best-buy in that category – 2.35pc offered by RCI Bank, Aldermore and Kent Reliance. \nCompeition among savings providers is heating up. Another challenger to the high street giants, RCI Bank, this week launched a three-year bond paying 2.7pc - beating the current best deal by a larger margin than is usual. \nTom Adams, head of research at savings adviser Savingschampion.co.uk, said: “Just as we were thinking that the recent flurry of new best buy fixed rate ISAs was starting to subside, in swooped two of the most active providers in this category in recent times with a couple of market leading accounts. \n“What is particularly pleasing about these changes is that both providers were already well placed in the best buy tables, with Virgin joint top and Shawbrook in joint second place and they were not content with this, wanting to stand out from the pack. \n\"Long may this type of move continue, as it is pushing rates back in the right direction and hopefully other providers will follow suit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:23:15.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
