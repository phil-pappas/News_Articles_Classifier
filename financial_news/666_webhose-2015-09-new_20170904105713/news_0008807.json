Reuters by James Chessell When the decomposing bodies of 71 refugees were found inside an abandoned poultry truck on the side of the main highway to Vienna last week, it seemed as if this summer's migrant crisis in Europe could not get any worse.\nAustrian police at the scene a few kilometres from the Hungarian border described the smell of death as \"overpowering\". The bodies were only discovered because a man mowing the grass nearby had noticed rancid liquid dripping out of the back of the refrigerated lorry. Among the dead were four children, including a baby girl.\nYet in the past 48 hours the sense of catastrophe engendered by Europe's biggest influx of migrants in five decades has intensified.\nAdded to the catalogue of horror, tragedy and desperation were shocking images of a three-year-old boy lying face down in the surf near the Turkish resort of Bodrum. He was one of at least 11 Syrians drowned trying to reach the Greek island of Kos.\nA paramilitary police officer carries the lifeless body of a migrant child near the Turkish resort of Bodrum. AP Photos of a Turkish border guard with the boy's lifeless body taken on Wednesday morning were the top trending pictures on Twitter under the hashtag #KiyiyaVuranInsanlik (humanity washed ashore).\nAs the bodies began to wash up on the Turkish beach, hundreds of migrants gathered outside Budapest's biggest railway station demanding to be let in so they could travel west to Germany and beyond.\n\"Merkel, we want to leave!\" shouted the crowd holding their children aloft, in a plea to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The station had been closed as part of efforts to protect the Hungarian capital from what Budapest's mayor described as an \"uncontrolled flood\".\nOn the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, an African man was found squeezed behind the engine block of a car choking on petrol fumes. Ceuta is the same place where people traffickers tried in May to smuggle an 8-year-old boy from the Ivory Coast across the border hidden inside a suitcase.\n In Norway, more than 130 Syrian refugees have begun to cycle across the border from Russia. It is illegal to enter Norway on foot or by car if you don't have the right papers. However, bicycles are allowed. And somewhere under the English Channel, passengers on the 7:13pm Eurostar service spent the night on board the train while police cleared migrants from the track. They did not arrive in London until 10:50am the next morning.\nThe magnitude of the refugee crisis is threatening to overwhelm Europe. One of the crowning achievements of the \"ever closer\" union formed out of the rubble of World War II – alongside democracy and free markets – was the creation of the passport-free Schengen travel zone. Comprising 22 European Union countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, Schengen has arguably been a united Europe's most popular founding principle – particularly for the millions of people who emerged from behind the Iron Curtain.\nYet a significant change in the pattern of migration has left Europe's system for dealing with asylum seekers in tatters. Last year, the majority of migrants made their way to Europe through Libya before landing in Italy or Malta. While the journey by sea was by no means safe, refugees had a relatively straightforward journey through safe countries once they made to land.\nThis year the numbers have not just grown – German and Hungarian officials both registered a new daily records for new arrivals on Tuesday – as people flee conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and parts of Africa. More migrants are entering through Greece and Hungary because Libya is stricken by civil war. As a result refugees are forced to make the dangerous journey through the Balkans relying on criminal gangs in order to reach preferred destinations such as Germany or Sweden. Greece's ability to deal with boatloads of refugees is poor.\nFuture of Europe at stake This influx has put Europe's open borders under extreme pressure and exposed simmering tensions between the continent's east and west about how to handle immigration. Europe's response to its biggest challenge since the fall of the Berlin Wall will not just have huge ramifications for the relationships within the union but could decide whether countries such as Britain remain part of Europe at a time when populist anti-EU sentiment is on the rise. The very future of the European Project is at stake.\n\"It is clear the Schengen Agreement is crumbling, as recent events are putting so much pressure on the political agreement,\" Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-EU UK Independent Party leader told The Telegraph .\n\"Schengen has now hit the buffers of the real world and is falling apart. In a crisis, national interests always prevail over European ideology.\"\nThe risks to a united EU have been laid bare this week. Unlike Australia, where the Abbott government response to asylum seekers has focused on \"stopping the boats\" and cracking down on people-smugglers, the debate in Europe has been mostly confined to the issue of how EU members should accept the new arrivals.\nIncreasingly frustrated by what she sees as a shirking of responsibility by eastern nations to accept their share of often-Muslim migrants, Merkel has warned that the Schengen area could be in jeopardy unless the EU agrees on quotas.\n\"I believe that our values in Europe are based on the dignity of every individual, without saying 'We don't want Muslims, we are a Christian land'\" she said on Monday.\nThe foreign ministers of Europe's three biggest nations – Germany, France and Italy – backed these words on Wednesday in an open letter calling for an an overhaul of asylum law and a \"fair distribution of refugees throughout the European Union\".\nIn some ways Germany has assumed a similar role to the one it played during the Greek bailout talks earlier this year when it pushed a smaller, poorer country to adopt rules it was not initially prepared to follow. This approach leaves Berlin open to accusation it is exerting too much power.\nCertainly, the response from former Communist countries has been lukewarm at best.\nHungary's conservative prime minister, Viktor Orban, is expected to travel to Brussels on Thursday to declare that his country will not accept Muslim migrants even if it means breaking EU rules against discrimination.\nHungary, which has struggled to process more than 130,000 refugees this year, has erected a 175-kilometre-long razor-wire fence along its southern border. Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic are also unlikely to back a system of permanent quotas expected to be announced by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker next week.\nThis raises the prospect of a showdown between eastern and western European members in the coming weeks. European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, of the Netherlands, warned that Brussels would punish countries with the loss of funding and voting rights if they failed to follow the EU's asylum rules.\nTimmermans said Europe's divided response could lead to a \"worrying rise in anti-Muslim hatred\" and said he would fight \"highly sensitive challenges to the rule of law\".\nAt the same time, German officials have warned Britain – whose share of European asylum claims has fallen since 2008 – that it must take its fair share of migrants or put its bid to win back powers from Brussels in jeopardy. Ahead of an \"in-out\" referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he will only support the status quo if the EU has less influence in domestic matters.\nThe loss of German support would almost certainly mean any attempt by the Conservative Party's Cameron to renegotiate the rules would fail and give the \"out\" camp a boost. But Cameron has repeatedly promised to curb the number of immigrants entering the UK and issued a strong response to Berlin on Wednesday.\n\"We have taken a number of genuine asylum seekers from Syrian refugee camps and we keep that under review, but we think the most important thing is to try to bring peace and stability to that part of the world,\" Cameron said during a visit to Northamptonshire.\n\"I don't think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees.\"\nCameron concluded his remarks by saying Europe faced \"big challenges but we will meet them\". The EU's response to the migrant crisis thus far does not suggest his prediction will be proven right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:08:17.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
