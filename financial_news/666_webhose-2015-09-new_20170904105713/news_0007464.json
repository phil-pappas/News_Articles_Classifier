Photo: AP\nDo you remember your first experience with chopsticks. Mine was as a 17-year-old having just arrived in Melbourne from the little country town of Stawell. It was my first trip to a Chinatown restaurant and there in front of me were two little bits of wood.\nNothing had prepared me for this moment. A wonderful old media man Hugh Anderson gently showed me how to handle these two sticks from an ancient culture.\nIn that moment I started to change from a slightly awkward country boy into an adult fascinated by the customs of people around the world.\nMy chopstick tutorial stood me in good stead this week as I accompanied Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews on his visit to China. It's a visit that every Australian should make because it's a culture and a country that we need to embrace more than we have to this point.\nAdvertisement As Giles Chance, a visiting professor at Peking University, says, \"China's global economic importance today may be greater than that of the US\" because he observes that the Chinese economy is more open to world trade. In his view, China's future is everyone's future because of our interconnected world.\nHow did China develop so quickly into such a major economy, an economy that could ultimately match the great Tang and Han dynasties? As I visited institutions and spoke with Chinese leaders three factors became clear.\nEducation key First, is education. The OECD measures education performance in science, reading and maths in 65 countries. China is first in each category.\nAustralia languishes in the middle and the United States is in the bottom half for science and reading and last for \"math\" as they say.\nSecondly, Chinese culture embraces family. Children respect and care for their elders and parents, and the Chinese parents have very high expectations of their children.\nChildren are given clear moral guidelines and are expected to take responsibility for their lives unlike the lackadaisical attitude of the West.\nAnd finally China operates with far-sightedness. On Wednesday I took the fast train from Beijing to Nanjing. It covered the 1160 kilometres in just over 4 hours.\nMany in Australia argue for the fast train system, others say it's not economic and won't work. I expect that was the argument when Henry Ford decided to make a motor car and look where that finished up.\nAnd how does this far-sightedness play out? By a government that decided to increase its public spending on transport and infrastructure up to 9 per cent of GDP. That compares with 2.4 per cent in the US.\nWith top-ranking education, strong families and a government that knows how to plan, can there be any doubt that China will be the world's dominant nation by 2050.\nAustralia is well represented in China and it plainly needs to be. The Victorian government has a formidable team of people on the ground working hard to build strong relationships.\nAndrews has instructed all of his ministers to travel to China regularly. Very wise! And the Chinese are visiting us, and in big numbers.\nTourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan points to China as Australia's most valuable inbound market, worth more than $7 billion a year to Australian tourism, a figure that's grown by 70 per cent in the last quarter.\nThe arts industry is doing its bit. This Saturday morning, as the outgoing chairman of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, I'm signing a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Symphony for the next three years which will see a high level of co-operation between two great world orchestras.\nAnd it's in the area of cultural understanding and co-operation that we have the most work to do.\nChina is not just an economic powerhouse for us to join with in partnerships. We must understand her people and culture. China will not let the disasters of the 19th century happen again which ended in the Opium Wars and commenced what they still teach in their schools as \"the 100 years of humiliation\".\nIt's all going to be different this time around and so it should be.\nLouise wants to finish with a simple message and it's this: Memo to federal opposition. The free trade deal must happen. Just do it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:26:59.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
