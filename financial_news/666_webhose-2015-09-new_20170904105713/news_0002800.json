He said foreign investments can give great additional resources and the country's infrastructure sector needs huge investments. \n“Railways, highways and power sectors are among those that require funds and the success of projects in these areas would largely depend on bankability,” Jaitley said. \nJaitley is in Hong Kong for two days, seeking to attract foreign investors, including large asset managers, to the Indian markets. \n“Special focus is being given to improve ease of doing business. Investors have felt in the past the procedures have been difficult in India,” he said. \nThe Digital India and Make in India initiatives are designed to boost manufacturing and India has huge potential in these areas, he said. \nSome states, Jaitley said, were not charging adequate tariff for electricity as a result of which the health of power distribution companies is being affected. \n“These states cannot expect the PSU banks to fund the deficit of discoms,” said. Many discoms are grappling with acute financial stress. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:23:31.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
