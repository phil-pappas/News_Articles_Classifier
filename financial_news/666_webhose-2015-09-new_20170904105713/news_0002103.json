Much of China's investment occurred prior to a sharp one-off yuan depreciation engineered by the central bank in August, which changes the calculation basis.\nODI outflows in August grew 7.0 percent from a year earlier to $13.5 billion, the ministry said in a statement.\nThe ministry said last week that the country attracted 525.3 billion yuan or $85.3 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first eight months of 2015, up 9.2 percent from a year earlier.\nFDI inflows in August rose 22 percent from a year earlier to 54.2 billion yuan or $8.71 billion.\n($1 = 6.3682 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Xiaoyi Shao and Nicholas Heath; Editing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:14:49.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
