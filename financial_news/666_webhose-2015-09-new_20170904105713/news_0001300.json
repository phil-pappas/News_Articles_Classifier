Asked what the current rate of inflation is, the median response was 2.1 percent. The official consumer price index for July stood at just 0.1 percent. \nA separate Yougov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) /Citi survey, published in late August, showed the public's expectations for inflation in the next 12 months fell back this month after hitting an eight-month high during July.
