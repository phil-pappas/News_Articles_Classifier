A good idea? \nA new online whisky market allows investors to gain exposure to an entirely new asset class: whisky in the barrel. \nBecause so much growth in Scotch sales is now arising from developing economies in Asia, Africa and South Amierica, the service is being promoted as a new way to tap into emerging market profits. \nBarrelled Scotch is traded in small units known as \"litres of pure alcohol\" (LPAs). \nWith whisky at roughly 40pc alcohol, this makes each LPA unit approximately 2.5 litres. \nThe new brokerage site WhiskyInvestDirect enables the trading in these units of Scotch before it reaches the bottling stage. \n= How it works = \nInvestors buy the spirit from distillers, who need to free up capital where it would otherwise be tied up for years as the liquor matures. Once mature, the Scotch is bought back by major brands for bottling and retailing. This is how the investor exits, hopefully at a profit. \nThe profit would come from the drink's appreciation in value as it matures. The producer oversees the maturation in secure storage. \nWhile the trade in pre-bottled Scotch has existed for many years within the industry, the market has never before widened out to include private investors. \nThe concept is the brainchild of whisky guru Rupert Patrick, who has for the past decade overseen the sales to emerging markets of giant Scotch brands including Teacher's and Laphroaig for Suntory, and Johnnie Walker and White Horse for Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) . \n• Wine investing: will you end up with profits or plonk? \nThe online market place for this new venture, where investors and distilleries will come to buy and sell, has been developed by Bullionvault - the firm which operates the highly successful online trading site for physical gold and silver, launched in 2005. \nOne of the key technological hurdles Bullionvault overcame was the ability to link securely an investor's name with his or holding in gold or silver, which would be stored in a vault in London, New York or Singapore. \nThe Scotch trading platform uses similar processes. \n= Potential returns - or losses = \nLikely returns? WhiskyInvestDirect claims the price for eight year-old single malt held from new, and sold each year of the decade 2005 to 2014, shows average historic returns of 13pc per year - or 9.5pc after charges (read on for more on charges). This growth is reflected in the chart below: \nBut over longer periods investors have made losses. \nThe following chart shows the historic return after holding Scotch for eight years, by the year of sale. \nSelling in 2005, for instance, would have triggered a loss of about 20pc, after storage costs. \nSelling last year, by contrast, would have resulted in more than doubling your original investment. \nTo kick off trading, the website has bought a range of young whiskies direct from distillers - and these are available now for purchase by the LPA. They include one, two and three year old whiskies from Ardmore, Blair Athol, Glen Spey, Inchgower and five other distilleries - labels mostly owned by firms like Diageo. \nPrices are as low as £2.70 per LPA, and the site promises that \"new stock lines are offered at less than a 2pc mark-up.\" \nWhile you can trade in just one LPA, costs of small holdings are a deterrent. \nTrading costs are 1.75pc of the value either selling or buying. Storage costs are £0.15 per litre per year - with a £3 per month minimum. \nThe emerging market theme is strong. Of all the Scotch produced, over 90pc is exported. China and Russian drinkers are being rapidly joined by those in Nigeria, Venezuela, Turkey and other growing economies. \n= The tax situation = \nThere is some uncertainty over tax treatment of this new asset class, however. The company says it has yet to hear from HMRC how these investments will be viewed for the purposes of capital gains tax calculations. \nIn the worst case, regular, capital gains tax of 28pc would apply to higher-income investors. \nThe Telegraph has also looked into the world of investing in wine, with Nick Martin of wineowners.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:33:18.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
