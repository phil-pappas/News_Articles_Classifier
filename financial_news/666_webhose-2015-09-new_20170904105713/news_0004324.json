Photo: Glenn Hunt\nThe IGA grocery chain has triumphed in a key battlefield in Australia's $90 billion supermarket wars: customer loyalty.\nAbout 30 per cent of consumers who mainly buy groceries at the Metcash-owned chain say they do not visit competitors Woolworths, Coles and Aldi in an average month, new research by Roy Morgan shows.\nIn contrast, only 7 per cent of people who shop mostly at German-owned Aldi have the same degree of loyalty. Aldi customers are also the most likely to visit all three competitor chains in an average month.\nAldi has the lowest proportion of exclusive shoppers. Photo: Louise Kennerley\nRoy Morgan's general manager of consumer products, Andrew Price, said he was not surprised by the findings on Aldi. The supermarket has tripled its market share in the past decade.\nAdvertisement \"While Aldi offers low prices and a popular home-brand range, it does not have such a huge variety of products as the other major supermarkets,\" he said. \"As a result, it's almost inevitable that Aldi shoppers will need to visit other chains during the month to complete their grocery shop.\"\nConsumers who indicated their main chain was Woolworths were the next most loyal. Twenty-five per cent say they exclusively shop at Woolworths stores.\nIn third place is the Coles supermarket chain.\nBen Ryan, owner of six IGA stores in regional Victoria and chairman of the national IGA council, said there was a high degree of customer loyalty because the stores, whether big or small, were tailored to the needs of the local community.\n\"So the IGA store in St Ives, which has a large Jewish community, has a lot of Kosher products. The Circular Quay IGA store has lots of grab-and-go food,\" he said. \"We have stores buying products locally, from local suppliers, and being the community hub. This happens right across the country.\"\nAn Aldi spokesperson said the chain was going from strength to strength, having received a string of customer satisfaction awards. It was also often rated the most affordable.\n\"In our experience, shoppers will first try us in conjunction with their regular shop before making the switch,\" she said.\nThe Roy Morgan research shows just over three-quarters of Australia's 14.2 million grocery shoppers visit at least two different supermarket chains in an average month.\nMr Price said the data showed the supermarket sector was \"incredibly competitive\".\n\"It suggests that customer loyalty programs such as Flybuys, which is held by more than half of Coles shoppers, and Everyday Rewards, which is held by more than 60 per cent of Woolworths and Safeway customers, are not achieving the desired result,\" he said.\nHowever, it is not all bad news for Aldi.\nNew research by Nielsen and industry lobby Ausveg, which was also released on Tuesday, shows the budget chain has posted double-digit growth in sales value across most vegetables in the past year.\nAldi has enjoyed above-trend growth in value for a wide range of fresh vegetables, including 48 per cent growth for fresh salad, 43 per cent for sweet potato and 37 per cent for celery.\n\"For fresh salads, for example, Aldi posted growth of over 40 per cent in both value and volume sales. Coles also showed expansion in both categories, while Woolworths actually lost ground,\" Ausveg spokesman Kurt Hermann said.\n\"Aldi has also managed to go against the overall trend for some commodities. While carrots, pumpkin and lettuce have all seen marginal drops in sales value this year, Aldi has increased their sales value for each of them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:59:27.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
