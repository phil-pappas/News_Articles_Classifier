Photo: Supplied\nThese days Aussies expect more than just dinner and a movie on the weekend. Escape room challenge on a Monday, ice-skating on a Wednesday, and an underground cinema screening on Saturday. So what are companies doing to spice up their services and keep customers interested?\nIn a throwback to the 'mystery flight' craze, a partnership between restaurant booking app Yumtable and Uber recently launched 'mystery dining' – whereby 120 winning customers who registered and logged on to a combined Yumtable-Uber app at the right moment were chauffeured to and from a secret dining destination in one of six CBD locations across Australia within ten minutes of winning.\nThe fancy night out competition was the first mystery dining event in Australia and attracted 5000 entries nationwide, reaching 76,850 people via social shares and making 224,819 impressions on social media.\nIt was a successful spruik to the ongoing Uber-Yumtable initiative of 'UberDINING' whereby diners can book a table, and an Uber driver through the Yumtable app.\nAdvertisement It was a Yumtable idea that Uber was quick to come to the table on, says Uber general manager Simon Rossi.\n\"People are looking for convenience and experience in everyday life. Uber brings convenient transport at the touch of a button, Yumtable brings convenient dining. UberDINING enhances the whole experience,\" says Rossi.\nCombining riding with dining fit perfectly with one of Uber's core principles of integrating into the culture of the country, Rossi says.\n\"Australia is a strong foodie place with an appetite for food experiences, so we were drawn to the idea of linking in with that,\" he says.\nWith parallels to the 'Uberchopper' experiences of Melbourne's 2014 Spring Carnival, Rossi recognised the mystery dining experience would provide the element of excitement.\n\"Everybody loves a surprise, and when you can create an environment that's easy for people to participate or connect in with, it's the right conditions for success.\"\n\"Uber is interested in creating unique experiences which is a hard thing to achieve these days, but the mystery dining experience was new to the Australian market, which was evidenced by the social media uptake,\" Rossi says.\nAnother first was the application processing interface (API) which connected both apps to work together.\n\"The mechanics of bringing our app into Yumtable's were new, and means customers can get better services and a better experience,\" Rossi says.\nTechnology is now the great enabler of what people ultimately want, says Rossi.\n\"People now want things at touch of a button, on demand, and nowadays smartphone penetration is very high across all ages and demographics.\"\n\"If you think of people home on a Saturday night wondering whether or not to bother going out, and all they had to do was open one app and press a button, with technology doing all the hard work they're much more likely to,\" he says.\nA relative newcomer to the scene, the collaboration was a bit of a coup for Yumtable, says general manager Levi Aron.\n\"We have access to over 2000 restaurants across Australia, and to take the pain out of the event, all we needed was transportation. Uber has had massive growth around Australia and many partnerships - but what we proposed - integrating their app inside ours - was a lot more than that,\" says Aron.\n\"It was Yumtable's idea and Uber loved it.\"\nThe inspiration was in part a recognition of the similarity of their clientele.\n\"We wanted to tap into the adventurous spirit of our diners and Uber's clientele. So many people are looking for something different and are spoilt for choice.\"\n\"The opportunity to be whisked away with 10 minutes notice in a chauffeured car to a mystery dining destination where they are greeted by Yumtable staff tapped into that desire,\" Aron says.\nIt was the lure of the new that prompted twenty six year old Sarah McCarthy, a regular user of both apps, to enter the mystery night out competition, a move that paid off in her winning ticket.\n\"It was such an awesome experience – the meal in Burma Lane, being greeted by Yumtable, the whole thing,\" says McCarthy.\n\"My friends and I are always looking for new things to do in Melbourne, and this was something really outside the box.\"\nIntegrated marketing campaigns between apps are the way of the future if we're to keep up with customer expectations, says Aron, who recently initiated a collaboration between one of Yumtable's major competitors, giving them access to another 400 restaurants.\n\"There's only so far you can take your customers on your own app before you need to reach out and collaborate. Watch this space for the next adventure,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T18:06:15.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
