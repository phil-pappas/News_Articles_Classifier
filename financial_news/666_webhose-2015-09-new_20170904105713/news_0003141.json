Photo: Luis Ascui\nIndustry superannuation funds are lobbying cross-benchers to vote down the government's controversial plan to overhaul the representative board structure of non-profit super funds, amid speculation new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will have more sway on how the independents vote.\nThe government wants to force all superannuation funds to have one third of their boards made up of independent directors, including an independent chair. The change is squarely aimed at the union-aligned sector, which operates on an \"equal representation\" model, whereby the board is split 50:50 between employer and employee representatives.\nAn overwhelming majority of for-profit funds have already gone a step further and installed a majority of independents after the Financial Services Council (FSC) made it a condition of membership.\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg introduced the Trustee Governance Bill to the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) chief executive Pauline Vamos welcomed a last minute amendment to clarify that only \"material\" past or present relationships should be considered in assessing a director's independence.\nASFA, which represents both retail and industry funds, supports the one third independents rule but wants to protect the equal representation model for the remaining two thirds of directors and the existing voting model. Currently two thirds of directors must agree for a vote to pass but the new rules would drop this to a simple majority.\nLabor opposes the bill but it is still expected to pass through the lower house comfortably. Stakeholders are gearing up for a fight when the bill gets to the Senate. Senator David Leyonhjelm is expected to vote for the bill, while Senator Jacqui Lambie is tipped to vote against it.\nPivotal in reform The FSC has been pivotal in pushing for the reforms and its chief executive Sally Loane welcomed the bill as, \"the first instalment of a package of reforms that are in the best interest of consumers and will deliver lower fees to working Australians\".\nBut non-profit super groups are staunchly opposed to the changes.\n\"Given there is no objective evidence that these changes will be in the best interests of 11 million-plus Australian workers, this will be a test of whether the Abbott-driven ideological hostility to not-for-profit super funds still rages in a Turnbull-led parliament,\" Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) president Angela Emslie said.\nAIST represents all non-profit funds including industry, public sector, and corporate funds.\nIndustry Super Australia (ISA), which represents the union-aligned funds, has been fighting back â€“ via both behind the scenes lobbying in Canberra and very publicly with its new \"Banks aren't Super\" media campaign.\nISA chief executive David Whiteley implored the new PM to reconsider the government's stance.\n\"The change in leadership provides a chance for the government to refocus its superannuation reform agenda priorities like getting the tax incentives right, or figuring out how to best direct the nation's $2 trillion pool of retirement savings to fuel economic growth, rather than getting involved with in-fighting between the industry funds and the retail funds\".\nThe proposed governance reforms follow recommendations of last year's financial system inquiry chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray and have been touted as a precursor to a wider shake-up of the $9 billion default super system, which is dominated by industry funds.\nMr Frydenberg flagged in August that the government is set to strip the Fair Work Commission of its role in umpiring how default super funds are nominated in wage awards .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/money/super-and-funds/fair-work-commission-set-to-lose-control-of-default-super-20150807-gitsen.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:41:00.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
