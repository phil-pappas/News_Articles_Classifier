By Kyle Caldwell | Telegraph – 10 minutes ago 65.00 -1.5000 \nWe put the popular Fidelity Special Situations fund, once managed by celebrated investor Anthony Bolton, under the spotlight \nFidelity Special Situations is one of the most widely held “UK growth” funds, targeting companies that reinvest back into their business rather than paying out profits to shareholders. \nIts popularity is down to the fact that the fund used to be managed by Anthony Bolton, the celebrated investor. \nToday the stock picker at the helm is Alex Wright, who has managed the fund since January 2014. \nMr Wright, often described as a star fund manager of the future, also manages the Fidelity Special Values investment trust. \nBut it is Mr Wright’s other fund, Fidelity UK Smaller Companies, which catches the eye. \nOver the past five years the fund has raced ahead of rivals under Mr Wright’s stewardship, returning nearly 300pc (blue line) since he took over the fund in March 2008. The average smaller company fund is up 100pc (red line) over the same period. \nFidelity Special Situations splits its money across the market. A third is currently in the FTSE 100 but experts are confident that Mr Wright can deliver the goods with a wider remit. \n= What makes the fund different…. = \nMr Wright describes himself as a contrarian investor. This means it is Mr Wright’s job to buy shares in which other investors have lost faith, and where further falls should be limited. \nSectors of the market Mr Wright is currently backing include banks, which he expects will pay juicy dividends in the coming year. Mr Wight owns HSBC, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and Lloyds. \nAnother area where Mr Wright is finding value is the bombed-out oil sector . \nMr Wright has bought BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) following Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) launching a takeover bid for the firm. Other purchases include small oil companies, such as Nostrum and Faroe Petroleum (LSE: FPM.L - news ) , which operates in the North Sea. \n= Top ten holdings = \n= What the experts think…. = \nBen Willis, of Whitechurch Securities, the wealth manager, said: “Mr Wright looks to tap into what he perceives as undervalued UK companies. His stock picking outside the FTSE 100 has produced some excellent returns and this is where he adds value.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:09:00.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
