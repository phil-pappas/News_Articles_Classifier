It’s already running dry.\nWhere once-continued easy money would have been a recipe for rising stocks, the Federal Reserve’s decision not to end its zero interest rate policy last week sent stocks tumbling.\nIt’s not just the Fed. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 2.75 percent the day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled more stimulus. Meantime, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.27 percent the day after the People’s Bank of China delivered its fifth rate cut since November on Aug. 25.\n“Central bankers no longer enjoy the same power to reassure” markets, Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at Societe Generale SA, said in a report to clients on Sunday.\nShe says investors are realizing that the policy makers are running out of the power to ease credit, weaken currencies and boost confidence seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ushered in an era of free money and quantitative easing. What’s more, the emerging market boom that helped sustain the global economy lies in tatters.\nCollateral Damage A survey of 135 clients released last week by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc before the Fed’s decision showed 63 percent now think monetary policy is losing credibility in financial markets.\n“The investor reaction function has clearly changed from QE-positive to worries about too much easing and its collateral damage,” said Alberto Gallo, head of macro credit research at RBS.\nThe new worry is that in losing their ability to pep equity markets, central banks also may lose another channel to drive their economies -- the wealth effect. That’s when loose monetary policy drives up stocks, encouraging investors to spend the resulting windfalls on goods and services.\nAs recently as last month, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley noted how market volatility could impede it.\n“This is the channel that seems to be fading fast,” said Marcussen. For the effect to be felt, markets have to hold “some degree of confidence that the real economy channels of monetary policy accommodation will ultimately work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T13:44:47.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
