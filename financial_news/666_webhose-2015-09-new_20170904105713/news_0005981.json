Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Small Business Minister Bruce Billson has brushed aside the concerns of corporate Australia and will put to cabinet on Tuesday policy changes to crack down on the misuse of market power by big business.\nThe policy proposals, which stem from the Harper Review into Competition Policy, contain two key changes, including an effects test , which Mr Billson says will \"make misuse of market powers work\".\nThe changes are being fiercely opposed by corporate Australia, as represented by the Business Council of Australia, and also the federal Opposition. But they have the support of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which represents small and medium businesses.\nThe cabinet is also understood to be divided on the proposed changes but there was an expectation late on Monday that the proposals would be adopted.\nCatherine Livingstone, with Ian Narev last week, opposes the 'effects test'. Louie Douvis The changes relate to Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act and concern introducing an effects test and strengthening provisions related to \"take advantage\".\nAn effects test would set a lower threshold than the current test, which requires proof of an anti-competitive purpose or intent.\nWider impact The effects test would change section 46 of the Competition Act so it only had to be shown that the effect, not the purpose of a decision by a corporation such as Coles or Woolworths , would be to eliminate competition.\n A review by Ian Harper (left) into competition policy led to planned law changes support by Bruce Billson which limit the misuse of market power by big companies. Jesse Marlow Mr Billson said the law should be changed to replace \"purpose\" with \"purpose, effect or likely effect\"'.\n\"After all, it is the effect of exclusionary conduct that damages the economy and harms consumers,\" he said.\nMr Billson said the changes relating to \"take advantage\" would be of greater significance.\n\"Dealing with the dysfunction and unreliability of the 'take advantage' element of the current law is probably of more significance than the albeit important effects test consideration,\" he said.\nWriting in Tuesday's The Australian Financial Review , Mr Billson explains how toughening the \"take advantage\" clause to bring consumer law in line with international practice, would benefit new market entrants and, ultimately, consumers.\n\"History and international experience show that an effective misuse of market power provision allows innovative firms to enter new markets and spread the benefits of disruptive technologies, new offerings and business models,\" he says.\nUS example He cites cases in the United States and Europe a decade ago which stopped Microsoft from forcing Windows users to install other Microsoft products such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player while excluding alternative products.\n\"Under the current Australian law, Microsoft's conduct would be unlikely to satisfy the 'take advantage' element necessary to be found unlawful, because bundling of these products is also practised by smaller firms without market power,\" he said.\n\"It is now clear that the enforcement action taken in the US and EU under their laws against the 'exclusionary conduct' of Microsoft a decade ago created opportunities for new market entrants like Google's Chrome browser, Apple's Safari browser and iTunes, YouTube, Adobe Flash, Skype and providers of web-based mail such as Google and Yahoo.\"\nThe BCA, backed by the federal opposition, argues the changes would be anti-competitive, pose a risk to small and big business and would expose companies to risk of prosecution due to competition effects that cannot be anticipated.\nBCA president Catherine Livingstone said recently there would be unintended consequences and regulatory uncertainty.\n\"Small business needs to understand they will not be quarantined from the impact of this change which will apply equally to all business, for example, in regional towns or markets where a small business' product or service is dominant,\" she said.\n\"In these circumstances, small businesses could be the instigator of actions against other small businesses, who would bear the unintended consequences of additional cost and uncertainty.\"\nMs Livingstone warned of \"major regulatory uncertainty for business\".\n\"It will expose our business to the risk of investigation and prosecution due to effects on competition that we cannot foresee.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-31T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:10:53.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
