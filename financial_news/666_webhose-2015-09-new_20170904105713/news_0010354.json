During a news conference Thursday, executives repeatedly talked about better shaping Jaguar’s as a “value” player. \nThe company’s sedans will be priced with a $35,000 base price, a relatively low entry point that rivals the lowest prices on most luxury-vehicle lots. The price tag represents the company’s strategy of more aggressively taking on General Motors Co. GM 1.40 % ’s struggling Cadillac brand, and competing with Toyota Motor Corp. TM 2.29 % ’s Lexus brand and Germany’s BMW AG BMW 3.98 % or Audi AG NSU -1.22 % . \nIn some cases, prices are being reduced by more than $10,000. A new version of the XF is getting a 9% reduction. \nThe Jaguar Land Rover company, owned by India’s Tata Motors , TTM 4.61 % is aiming to build a “far more competitive Jaguar portfolio,” Robert Filipovic, the company’s head of North American product planning said. It will “aggressively focus on the heart of the luxury space.” \nThe price cuts mirror a strategy Jaguar employed more than a decade ago while owned by Ford Motor Co. F 1.08 % Offering its X-Type car based on an existing Ford engineering architecture used in midsize cars aimed at the mass market, Jaguar officials failed to appeal to the lower end of the market and reversed course. \nLuxury brands have generally done well as U.S. auto sales are clipping along at the fastest pace in a decade. Mercedes-Benz, Ford Motor Co.’s Lincoln, Audi and BMW have all reported sales increases in excess of 5.8% through eight months compared with the same period a year ago, outpacing the 3.8% uptick for the wider industry, according to Autodata Corp. \nEuropean nameplates are the fastest-growing group of brands in the U.S. market. Jaguar joins GM’s Cadillac brand as one of the few luxury brands to report declines through August. \nThe segment, however, is proving to be fierce. Autodata estimates BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz, for instance, are offering far steeper incentives than were offered a year ago. Jaguar currently spends $6,121 on sales incentives per vehicle sold in 2015, an increase of 27.5% compared with the first eight months in 2014. \nWrite to John D.
