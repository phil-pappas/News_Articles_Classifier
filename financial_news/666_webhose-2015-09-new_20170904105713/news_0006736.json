The US is the largest healthcare IT market globally, and it accounts for about 40 percent of the overall spending. It is also a focus of global attention by information and communication technology firms due to the current ongoing investments in healthcare IT, driven mainly by the government’s Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which provides financial incentives for hospitals and physicians to invest in IT, including electronic health records and other health information management systems.\n“Planning, implementation and upkeep of such health systems are deriving spending in areas from consulting and core infrastructure to various health-specific applications,” said Jennifer Mazzucca, senior research analyst at Gartner.\nIT spending in the retail sector is forecast to decline 1.5% in 2015.\n 24, 2015 10:30 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:12:19.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
