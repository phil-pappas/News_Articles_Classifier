AB InBev and SABMiller both declined to comment. \nA takeover of SABMiller, the world's No. 2 brewer with brands including Peroni and Grolsch, could likely cost upwards of 68 billion pounds ($103.05 billion), according to analysts' estimates. \nThe companies said on Sept. 16 that AB InBev had approached SAB about a takeover. Under UK takeover rules, the company has until Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) . 14 to make a firm offer. \nThe two sides have been in informal contact since the initial approach, sources close to the situation said. \nPotential asset sales could also generate more M&A for banks to work on after disappointing levels of M&A financing so far this year. \nAlthough banks are eager to lend, they may have to hold bridge loan exposure for longer as companies wait to issue bonds at better prices after bond prices widened dramatically in September. \n\"Banks are more conservative about taking bridge loan exposure. Companies will have to pay up and banks will have to wait for it to be refinanced,\" a second syndicate head said. \nWhen the mega merger was first discussed last year, bankers speculated that AB InBev could seek to raise a bridge loan of $75 billion to $80 billion before issuing $72 billion to $110 billion of bonds to fund an acquisition. \nAB InBev is trying to reduce its net debt to EBITDA ratio to two times, down from about 2.5 times currently and is on track to do that by 2016, which would give it more room to finance a takeover. \nIf it goes ahead, the SABMiller acquisition is expected to completed in 2016 at the earliest. \n($1 = 0.6599 pounds) (Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; Editing by Tessa Walsh and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T07:03:21.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
