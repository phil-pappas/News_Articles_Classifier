Photographs of Russian troops in Syria were circulating on social media on Thursday.\nUS officials say Russian combat troops and equipment had been arriving by both air and sea.\nRussia complained after Bulgaria denied its airspace to Syrian-bound Russian flights. Sofia said future flights would be allowed only if they had their cargoes inspected.\nMoscow has long acknowledged it sells weapons to the Syrian government under long-standing agreements.\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that some of those arms were shipped by air.\n\"Russia sends military (equipment), in line with existing contracts, and humanitarian aid on planes going to Syria,\" Mr Lavrov said.\n\"We have never made our military presence (in Syria) a secret,\" he said, denying claims that Russia was beefing up its presence in the war-torn country. \"Russia is not taking any additional steps,\" Mr Lavrov said.\nHe denied suggestions Russia’s greater involvement in Syria would hurt plans of a Western coalition to fight the Islamic State (IS), which has taken control over swathes of Syrian territory.\n\"This logic is uncomprehensible to me,\" Russia’s top diplomat said. \"The Syrian army is the most effective force that can stand up to the terror threat on the ground.\"\nMr Lavrov said he had discussed his country’s presence in Syria with US Secretary of State John Kerry in two phone calls in the past few days.\nMr Lavrov said his American counterpart was concerned that Russia’s support for Mr Assad would ultimately strengthen IS because its sponsors would be forced to ramp up their military and financial support.\n\"Well, that logic has been turned upside down,\" Mr Lavrov said. \"Once again this is an attempt to appease those who are using terrorists in their fight against unwanted regimes.\n\"I believe this is a colossal mistake.\"\nThe US and its allies are leading an air war against IS but also oppose Mr Assad, whose government has been fighting an array of insurgent groups. About 250,000 people have died and half of Syria’s 23-million people have been driven from their homes to escape the conflict.\nGovernment forces have faced major setbacks on the battlefield this year. Russia’s only naval base in the Mediterranean Sea is at Tartous on Syria’s coast, and protecting it would be a major strategic objective for Moscow.\nRussia’s respected Kommersant daily on Thursday said Moscow’s advanced BTR-82A armoured personnel carriers were among arms supplied to Damascus.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:56:24.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
