We wanted to prevent the inconvenience caused to clients when ATMs are completely down because there’s no power,” Alhassan said. \nThe solar powered ATMs will also help sustain the environment while reducing the pressure on the national grid.Hendrix Glover, ATM Manager, Stanbic Bank, said the generator sets that are powering our various branches emit a lot of toxins and that is certainly not good for the environment. \n“It’s in the interest of society that we try and use the renewable sources of energy that have a negligible effect on the environment,” said Glover. \nEight ATMs have been installed so far and the Bank intends to install about 20 more in very high traffic areas and areas that experience frequent power outages.Power to each ATM is provided by up to 16 panels, feeding a system that includes a battery bank, air conditioners and CCTV cameras. \nThe solar powered ATMs come with over 20 years of warranty and have the capacity of producing between three and five kilowatts. Each solar powered ATM are estimated to save the Bank some GHS 36 000 in energy cost annually.“We spend about GHS 3000 each month on electricity and fueling of generator sets for each site. So this off-grid solution, expensive as it may seem in the short-term, saves us a lot of money in the long term,” said Glover. \nThe installation of the solar powered ATMs is in tandem with Stanbic Bank’s commitment to promoting positive environmental practices. Over the years, the Bank has undertaken green initiatives such the donation of solar powered lanterns worth GHS420, 000 to students in deprived communities in the Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper West, Upper East and Western regions.Stanbic Bank Ghana is part of the Standard Bank Group, Africa’s largest bank by assets. \n– CAJ  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=8053   10 2015.
