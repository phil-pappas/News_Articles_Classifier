Did we know defeat devices were being used in the EU? No.\" \nAnother source added: \"Future (Other OTC: FRNWF - news ) legislation (will be) more efficient to prevent their use.\" \nThe European Union since the 1990s has progressively adopted tighter auto emission standards for carbon dioxide and the harmful nitrogen oxides vehicles produce but it is up to the 28 member states to enforce them. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) banned defeat devices in 2014 under what is known as the Euro 6 regulations which require automakers to meet lower emission targets. \nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said Friday that \"currently emissions are measured on a laboratory test cycle (NEDC) which does not reflect the emissions of vehicles in normal driving conditions.\" \n\"To address this shortcoming, the Commission has been working to develop Real Driving Emission (RDE) test procedures,\" it said. \n\"RDE testing will reduce the currently observed differences between emissions measured in the laboratory and those measured on the road under real-world conditions, and to a great extent limit the risk of cheating with a defeat device.\" \nThe new testing procedure will come into force in January, the Commission added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T23:12:44.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
