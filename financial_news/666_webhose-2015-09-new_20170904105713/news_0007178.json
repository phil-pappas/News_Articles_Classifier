At Rs. 6,999, it’s one of the few phones to pack a gargantuan 6-inch screen. But is that enough?\nSpecs: 6-inch 720p HD display | 1.3GHz quad-core processor | 1GB RAM | 8GB internal memory, microSD card up to 32GB | 8MP rear camera, 5MP front camera | Dual-SIM, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4 | 3000mAh battery | Android 4.4 KitKat\nIs The Screen Good Enough?\nThe appeal of the Andi HD6 is pretty clear. If you want a smartphone with a large, 6-inch screen but you’re on a budget, this is among your cheapest options. And among those options, iBall is the most recognized brand—plus, the phone is not bad at all.\nObviously, it’s heavy and difficult to hold, let alone operate with a single hand. But those are the trade-offs you have to endure for a cheap phone.\nAs for the screen itself, its HD resolution is a letdown at this size. While the HD vs. Full HD battle doesn’t usually matter, in this case, the lower resolution is noticeable. There is an upside to this though.\nA Surprise Hit\nWhen I gave this phone to three senior citizens, they loved it. They liked the large screen with the large icons and the large text. Getting to talk on WhatsApp easily and the ability to see big photos were the big draws.\nThey were ready to put up with the added weight if it meant getting to see everything so clearly, and not have to worry about a tiny device.\nThe price, too, made it sound welcome. They said they would be happy to buy this themselves, or ask their kids to get it for them, since it wasn’t too expensive.\nWithout intending it, iBall has scored a hit with an unlikely audience—senior citizens who want to access the world of WhatsApp and Facebook. If you’re buying this phone for a loved one, set it up with essential Android apps for seniors.\nAnything Else To Know?\nBeyond that, there’s nothing remarkable or disappointing about the Andi HD6. The camera is decent, not great—low light shots are noisy. The performance is good enough for Android beginners. The battery life is quite good, lasting about 15-16 hours of average usage.\nOverall, there’s little to complain about the Andi HD6 from the perspective of a basic Android user. And that’s who the phone should be for. If all you want is WhatsApp, Facebook, email, light browsing, casual games, and calls and texts, then the iBall Andi HD6 delivers.\nIf you want anything more than those basic uses, look elsewhere. This isn’t the droid you’re looking for.\n 28, 2015 10:10 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:46:14.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
