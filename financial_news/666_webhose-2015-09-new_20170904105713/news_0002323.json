New York and London are the main centres for derivatives trading. \nDivisions over how clearers should publicly demonstrate their ability to withstand market shocks were underscroed by officials speaking at an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) conference in London on Tuesday. \nThe idea of a transparent, standardised \"stress test\" is \"extremely attractive\" for deciding which clearing house to use or avoid, said Stuart Anderson, director of electronic trading at BlackRock (NYSE: BLK - news ) , the world's biggest asset manager. \nBill Stenning, managing director of clearing at French bank SocGen (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) said it was \"remarkably hard\" to compare clearers, but he cautioned against a \"strait-jacket\" approach. \nClearers themselves are divided over how best to reassure users. \n\"We think a standardised stress framework... really goes one step to allowing the market to understand better this topic of resilience, and where the clearing house starts to hit problems,\" said Martin Pluves, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet Ltd, one of the world's largest clearers \nHowever, Sunil Cutinho, president of CME Clearing, said risks were always changing and a \"static\" common test cannot reflect this. \n\"To end up with standardised stress tests is actually quite dangerous,\" Cutinho added. \nThis lack of consensus is partly why the EU's executive European Commission is taking longer than expected to propose rules on what to do when a clearing house gets into trouble. \nBank of England Governor Mark Carney has said reforms are needed to avoid clearing houses becoming \"too big to fail\", meaning taxpayers would have to rescue them if in trouble. \nStenning wants clearers to \"stay awake at night\" thinking about how to keep customers' money safe, Top management should face curbs that have already been imposed on bankers, such as deferring bonus payments over several years. \n\"You want to hold management's feet to the fire,\" Stenning said. \nSeparately on Tuesday, global regulators published their timeline for checking if big clearers are sturdy enough but the work won't be completed until well into 2016, after market users have had to decide which clearing house to use.
