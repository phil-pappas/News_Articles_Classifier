Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Kevin Rudd was hoping for a \"sympathetic\" phone call from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the days after he was dumped as Prime Minister, according to previously secret emails released in Washington.\nUS President Barack Obama telephoned Mr Rudd soon after he had the leadership snatched from him by Julia Gillard in June 2010.\nBut Mr Rudd was also hoping to hear from Mrs Clinton, according to an email sent by the then US Ambassador in Canberra, Jeffrey Bleich.\nThe correspondence was sent to two of Mrs Clinton's closest advisers in Washington, one of whom forwarded the email to Mrs Clinton's personal email address on June 30, 2010.\n\"Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday,\" Mr Bleich wrote.\n\"Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called Edgard [Kagan in the US embassy in Canberra] afterward and noted that Rudd had not heard from S [Secretary of State Clinton], and would have hoped for a sympathetic call. I have no strong point of view on this one. He has received such a call from POTUS [President of the United States] already.\"\n\"But, I think he and S had a good relationship and he may want to talk to her about his future career goals.\"\nThree days earlier in a passing comment in a June 27 2010 email to close confidant Sidney Blumenthal, Mrs Clinton noted she was \"sorry about Kevin Rudd\". The sentiment was not immediately relayed to Mr Rudd.\n A source in Washington told The Australian Financial Review that Mr Rudd did subsequently meet Mrs Clinton in her office at the State Department, and that she gave him advice on potential future career plans.\nMr Rudd could not be reached immediately for comment.\nMr Rudd, like Ms Gillard, was well liked by Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton, former senior Obama administration officials said.\nWhen Mr Rudd later returned as Foreign Affairs Minister and met US national security adviser Tom Donilon at the White House, Mr Obama dropped in at the end of the meeting to talk to the former prime minister.\nThe US President rarely meets foreign ministers.\nMrs Clinton also valued Mr Rudd's views on China, the person said.\nThe correspondence is one of more than 7000 emails involving Mrs Clinton released publicly under freedom of information by the State Department.\nThe emails have been published after Mrs Clinton came under attack from political opponents for exclusively using a personal email account while Secretary of State.\nIn violation of State Department policy, her thousands of email exchanges over four years were not automatically archived as required for official records. Critics say she wanted to control how much of her communications would eventually become public in case she ran for president.\nClinton's aides belatedly handed over 55,000 emails this year after an official request, but had the luxury of choosing which files to hand over and which exchanges they withheld because they were deemed personal matters.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating security risks associated with any government secrets passed through the computer server at the Clinton family home in New York.\nThe controversy has raised fresh public doubts about trusting Mrs Clinton, who has claimed that she preferred a private email account as a \"convenience\" because it allowed her to \"carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:07:49.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
