The South American country's long-term foreign currency debt rating was downgraded to BB+, with the likes of Fitch likely to follow with another downgrade (by one notch) over the next year, according to Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . \nAs a result of the downgrade, the Treasury in Sao Paolo opted to cancel an auction of fixed rate, real-denominated, local bonds due to be held on Thursday. \nMeantime, the yield on two-year local bonds jumped 36 basis points to 15.29%. \nAgainst that backdrop, the Monetary Policy Committee opted on Thursday to keep its policy settings unchanged, as expected, with the meeting minutes revealing that recent events surrounding China and their possible impact on emerging markets were the main focus of discussions. \nNonetheless, although the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) did drop the reference to a \"finely balanced decision\" for some members, as analysts at Barclays pointed out, \"for some members\" there continued to be upside risks to inflation. \nYields on 10-year Gilts were to be seen one basis point higher by the end of the session at 1.87%. \nSimilarly dated US Treasuries registered the same gain in yields to reach 2.21%. \nBack in the Eurozone, European Central Bank governing council member Erkki Liikanen said the ECB might prolong its asset purchases past September 2016 if necessary. \nDespite that, German 10-year bund yields ended the day flat at 0.70%. \nTo take note of, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) 's gross domestic product surged at a 1.9% quarter-on-quarter clip in the three months to June, easily outstripping the 1% advance forecast by economists (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:16:46.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
