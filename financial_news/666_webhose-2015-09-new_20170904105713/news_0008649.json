The future still looks promising, after the company announced a deal last week to complete its exit from its drugs distribution business. \n= All change = \nThe FTSE 250-listed group has its roots in providing UK pharmacies with the medicines they need from warehouses located in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) . \nHowever, it became increasingly clear that to succeed in that business, then bigger would be better, and UDG was never going to be big enough on its own. So, about 15 years ago it was decided that the company needed to specialise in order to survive. The company now focuses on two specific areas of business. \nThe Ashfield arm has a large number of sales representatives who teach doctors and nurses about new drugs coming to the market and how they can be used. \nHistorically, big pharmaceutical companies had sales representatives in-house, but this has become too expensive as getting new drugs to market is so uncertain. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is far cheaper for pharma firms to call on a company such as Ashfield, which can provide this service as and when it is required. \nTrading at Ashfield is good, with profits increasing by 55pc in the first half of the year, following the acquisitions of KP360 and Galliard in 2014. \nThe second area of growth is packaging drugs. The actual pills are made by another company, but putting them into blister packs ready for sale is where UDG comes in. This business is US-focused and is being helped by changes to regulation that require labelling to be put on every piece of packaging so that all drugs can be traced also known as “serialisation”. \nUDG is one of the two largest companies that currently meets all the US regulatory requirements on this new packaging, which will become mandatory in the US from November 2017 and a year later in Europe. The packaging business reported first-half sales up 35pc and operating profits up 57pc to €11.8m (£8.6m), compared with a year ago. \n= Running the numbers = \nThe sale of UDG’s United Drugs Supply Chain Businesses for €407.5m to the US giant McKesson will allow it to continue specialising. Of those proceeds, some €30m will go towards the cost of completing the deal, leaving €377.5m. UDG plans to repay €142m in short-term borrowings, leaving the balance sheet with a €103m net cash position. \nJack Gorman, an analyst at broker Davy, thinks that, when combined with modest borrowing, the company should have around €400m to go shopping to expand the Ashfield business. The finances at UDG will radically change, because the businesses that are being disposed of contributed €1.4bn in revenue and €30.3m in earnings out of the group total of €2.1bn in revenue and €141m in earnings during the year to September 2014. \nSo, if the United Drugs Supply Chain Businesses deal closes as planned by March next year, the new company that emerges should generate something in the region of €700m in revenue and €110m in earnings, or about 47 cents (34p) in adjusted earnings per share, based on Questor’s rough estimates. The reported pre-tax profits to September 2016 are likely to be much lower as they will include one-costs associated with the deal. \nThe shares are therefore trading on 15 to 17 times forecast adjusted earnings, which looks reasonable for a company that has cash to expand, and has promised to increase the dividend this year and next. \nThe slight disappointment is that Liam FitzGerald, the chief executive, will be leaving in March next year after 15 years in the job. He will be replaced by Brendan McAtamney, the current chief operating officer. \nWe tipped UDG as a buy (349.6p, November 22), and it has provided gains of 50pc against a market down 10pc. We remain positive on the outlook following the deal. Buy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:54:52.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
