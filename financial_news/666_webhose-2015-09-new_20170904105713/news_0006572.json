On Monday, companies raised $15.75 billion in the U.S. investment-grade bond market, part of the $25 billion to $30 billion expected for sale this week, said Thomson Reuters unit IFR.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasuries notes were up 24/32 in price, yielding 2.127 percent, down 9 basis points from Monday, while the 30-year bond was up 1-30/32 points in price to yield 2.935 percent, down 10 basis points on the day.\nWall Street was in the red, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index losing 1.6 percent in late trading.\nWorries about global demand sparked selling in the oil market. U.S. crude futures settled down 1.8 percent at $45.83 a barrel.\nCopper prices fell 3.6 percent to three-week lows on jitters about economic growth and demand in top consumer China.
