Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images \nMonday, August 24 was the worst day of trading – when the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index gapped down at the open by 1,000 points. To put it mildly, “price discovery” was about as shaky as it has ever been – with SEC-mandated restrictions (“Rule 48” and “Circuit Breakers”) kicking in … which generated widespread frustration and consternation among active traders. \nMany articles in the financial press have covered the gruesome details surrounding trading on August 24 (dubbed “ Black Monday ”) and the scary “meltdown” during the final hours of trading on August 25 (when the market literally fell apart after an encouraging rally). [See slides for an image.] \nHowever, given the dominant role that 401(k) plans hold within the total asset base of U.S. investors, it might be more illuminating to review the reaction of 401(k) participants to Black Monday and its aftermath. \nAs of June 30 of 2014, 401(k) plan assets totaled $4.4 trillion – representing nearly 18% of all U.S. retirement assets ($24 trillion). Those metrics reflect a significant jump from 401(k) assets ten years before – when 401(k) assets stood at only $2.2 trillion, only 16% of total U.S. retirement assets back then. \nSo what did participants do when they learned about the turmoil in the markets on “Black Monday” and thereafter? \nThe fact is that (according to a report from the huge tracking analytics provided through Aon Hewitt) the number of participants who engaged in trading on “Black Monday” was seven times the normal level, and amounted to the third highest day of trading volume since 2008! \nDuring the preceding trading day (August 21) 401(k) trading reached twice its historical average level (the Dow fell 531 points that day, after that afternoon collapse). On both August 21 and 24, on an aggregate basis participants moved assets from equity funds to fixed income choices. \nHowever, the reassuring (and good news) is that the difference between “active” trading and “normal trading” was not very large on an absolute basis – with the percentage of assets being traded on August 24 amounting to a minute 0.17%... versus the “average day’s” volume of assets being an even smaller 0.02 to 0.03%! \nThis small scale of trading is “good news” because the historical data from 401(k) investments during and after the 2007-09 “Financial Crisis” reveals this crucial piece of data (which comes from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) and ICI Participant-Directed Retirement Plan Data Collection Project ): \n“the average account balance of 401(k) participants with consistent participation from year-end 2007 through year-end 2012 increased at a compound annual average growth of 6.8 percent over that five-year period.” \nThe lesson here is to remember (at all times) the true time horizon for retirement assets – which is long-term. Therefore, one shouldn’t be shaken by day-to-day movements in the markets, but instead, remain committed to consistent, steady 401(k) contributions and allow the markets to grow your assets over time (as it always has in the past). \nBy the way, I particularly commend that you view the video accompanying this article. It does a great job of viewing \"Black Monday\" from the perspective of those in the Middle East and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:59:22.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
