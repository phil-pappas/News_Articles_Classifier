The hotel company recently issued a press release announcing what it's calling the first ever in-room virtual reality travel experience. VRoom service, as the hotel has labeled it, allows guests engage in virtual reality travels in their room using a Samsung Gear VR headset and headphones. To date, that includes going on journeys via VR Postcards programs developed by Marriott that are immersive travel stories following a real traveler on a journey to a specific destination -- such as the Andes in Chile, an ice cream shop in Rwanda or the bustling streets of Beijing. Guests using the in-room headset experience the journey in 360 3D.

Since launching at ten hotels in November 2014, 190,000 members have registered their phones for SPG Keyless. The offering is now available at more than 140 of the company's hotels around the world, including Aloft, Element and W Hotels. \n\"Travel is by nature mobile and with everyone carrying a cell phone nowadays, it just made sense to design and build a truly mobile, keyless solution,\" says Alyssa Waxenberg, Starwood's vice president for digital. \nNot to be outdone by the giant chains, are smaller innovators such as Eccleston Square Hotel in London. The hotel has outstanding integration of technology within the guest room such as bathrooms with smart glass walls, bathroom mirrors with hidden televisions and an in-room iPad that can be used as a personal concierge. \nMeanwhile guest rooms at The Peninsula Hotel in Chicago include touch screen tablets that communicate in 11 languages and control every aspect of the room - from lighting to room temperature. Other information available on the iPad includes restaurant menus, hotel services, city information and attractions. Another fun feature here are the LED touch-screen wall panels that offer weather details, language and privacy options. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:37:05.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
