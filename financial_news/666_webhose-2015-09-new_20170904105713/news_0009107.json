Despite its growing population and slow paced infrastructural developments, Mumbai has shown positive growth. Property prices are soaring and city limits are expanding and realty experts predict the realty sector will be more encouraging and favourable for both end users and investors alike. Below are some of the developments that are fuelling the realty growth. \nMumbai Metro \nDespite being a slow paced project, the partially operational metro has caught the eye of many investors. The seamless connectivity that the metro offers to the eastern suburbs has resulted in the growth of many suburbs. The proposed route linking Colaba and SEEPZ too will put the city to the global map due to its seamless network. \nThe Navi Mumbai Airport \nCited to be another promising infrastructural project, the airport has been held up due to land acquisition problems. However, the new government plans to complete the project by 2019. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will not only be building a new structure but will also modernize and upgrade the existing structure. \nInfrastructural developments \nThe proposed Wadala Terminus that is cited to link Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) to the Eastern Express Highway has gotten many in the realty industry excited. This infrastructural development will not only reduce traffic bottlenecks between the two arterial points but will also improve connectivity to several CBDs of Mumbai. Creating smart cities in vicinities like Kalwa, Kalyan and Bhiwandi too has enticed many home buyers to invest in properties here. The extension of both monorail and metro rail routes to various areas too has roped in a lot of investment. \nArterial road networks \nThe ambitious project to link Nariman Point to Kandivali via a 35 kilometer long coastal road has got many investors going. The proposition to include an underwater tunnel too has added fuel to the realty market. With a two year deadline, the project is likely to improve networking in the entire western region. \nTrans Harbor Link \nAnother infrastructure project that has increasingly attracted home buyers in the 22 kilometer long Sewri-Nhava Sheva Trans Harbour Link. Despite its failed tenders, the project is likely to be implemented this year. The entire project is cited to cost INR 11,000 crore and is allegedly financed by Japan International Cooperation Agency. Once the project has seen light, the Link will offer direct access to the airport to those in south of Mumbai. \nNidhi C Thacker for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: “Worli skyline with BSWL (cropped)” by Woodysworldtv – This file was derived from: Worli skyline with BSWL.jpghttp://www.flickr.com/photos/woodysworldtv/5530750545/.
