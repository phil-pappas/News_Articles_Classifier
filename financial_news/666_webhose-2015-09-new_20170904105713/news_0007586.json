While steps have been taken to suspend non-profitable routes, further route rationalisation is also being considered.\nKhazanah adds that it will soon disburse MYR1.3 billion ($306.8 million) in condition investment funding to the airline to pay for termination packages of employees under a rightsizing exercise. Including this sum, Khazanah would have disbursed about MYR3.2 billion out of the MYR6 billion allocated for the restructuring effort.\nThe airline has also undertaken a review of its supply contracts, with deals identified for renegotiation, termination or novation. Among large supply contracts that have been renegotiated include new catering agreements with Brahim’s Airline Catering.\n“The review and renegotiation of supply contracts are crucial towards setting the airline on the path to recovery and sustained profitability,” says Khazanah.\nIn addition, around 98% of employees who were offered employment with the new company have accepted the offers. Of the airline's 13,000 workforce, 9,000 are on permanent employment while the rest are on short-term contracts.\nKhazanah’s update follows the carrier’s new air operator’s certificate from Malaysia’s Department of Civil Aviation, in which it effectively transited to Malaysia Airlines Berhad on 1 September.\nRelated Content Reunion debris came from MH370: French justice ministry Malaysia Airlines starts operations under new company New Malaysia Airlines corporate entity receives AOC Analysis ANALYSIS: MAS marks first year since turnaround plan MAS to remain international carrier with regional 'backbone'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:59:20.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
