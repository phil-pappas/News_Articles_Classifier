Volkswagen has said it will record a 6.5 billion euro ($7.3 billion) charge in the third quarter to help cover the costs of the debacle - and that the price tag could rise.\nGhosn said the scandal is a challenge for other global producers, who now face scrutiny over their own practices. Public trust of automakers has already fallen in the wake of high-profile recalls - including one linked to deadly ignition failures in General Motors cars.\nAsked what the industry needs to do to respond to the scandal, Ghosn replied: \"Be extremely open.\"\nGhosn said he was surprised the Volkswagen revelation did not come from an internal source, such as a whistleblower. The problem was first spotted by a research center at the University of West Virginia, which was analyzing diesel emissions under a contract from a European non-profit group.
