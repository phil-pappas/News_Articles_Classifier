This new partnership will allow Hyatt to offer IDT911’s LifeStages® Identity Management Services , providing a full range of identity management services to legal plan members. According to a report released last year by Javelin Research, an identity is stolen every two seconds. Identity theft affects people at all stages of life – from childhood to college through getting married, buying a home and retiring. Thieves only need a name, birth date and social security number to steal an identity and their methods to get this information can range from stealing a wallet or mail to hacking into computers or your phone. Last year, fraudsters stole $16 billion from 12.7 million U.S. consumers.\nWith this new partnership, Hyatt Legal Plan members will have access to fraud specialists at IDT911 that can assist with a wide range of identity theft issues. The new identity theft services will include document replacement services, resolution services if someone becomes a victim of identity theft, as well as assistance for a number of growing identity theft scams such as tax fraud, estate identity theft, military identity theft an break-in recovery. Fraud specialists will be available 24 hours a day and will stay on the member’s case until the issue is resolved.\n“We are very excited about this partnership with IDT911,” says Ingrid Tolentino, CEO of Hyatt Legal Plans. “This new partnership will allow us to help members address the very real current and emerging identity theft concerns out there. Paired with our attorney services, our identity theft resolution services offer our members a more comprehensive way to protect themselves and their families.”\nAll new plans effective January 1, 2016 will have access to IDT911 LifeStages® Identity Management Services as part of the legal plan.
