Japan’s government isn’t seeking any urgent budgetary support for now, he said.\nStocks worldwide tumbled last week on concern that China’s slowdown will jeopardize global growth. Japan’s Topix index fell 7.4 percent in August, the biggest monthly loss since May 2012.\nJapan’s economy is struggling to recover from a contraction in the second quarter as a slowing China -- Japan’s biggest trading partner -- weighs on exports and domestic consumption remains weak.\nThe Bank of Japan’s key inflation gauge slumped to zero for the third time this year as energy costs dropped, countering BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s effort to reflate the world’s third-biggest economy.\n“Concerns over the global economy are rising, and there’s no good news for the BOJ,” said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Chances for additional monetary easing in October have increased considerably as the inflation rate and economic growth have come in weaker than what people expected.”\nJapan’s gross domestic product fell an annualized 1.6 percent in the three months through June, ending two quarters of growth, a government report showed on Aug. 17. Government reports for July show industrial production and household spending unexpectedly declined, while export growth slowed.\nConsumer prices excluding fresh food were unchanged in July from a year earlier.\n‘Not in Deflation’ While Japan isn’t in deflation, it’s too early to claim victory, Amari said.\nFurther monetary easing and fiscal steps will be needed if the world’s third-biggest economy treads water or contracts in the three months through September, Koichi Hamada, an adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said on Aug. 25.\nEtsuro Honda, an adviser to the premier, said on Aug. 18 that Japan needs an economic injection of as much as 3.5 trillion yen to shore up consumption and stave off further economic contraction.\nSince coming to power in December 2012, Abe’s fiscal stimulus and the central bank’s monetary easing have weakened the yen and helped push up stocks. The government has also implemented a growth strategy aimed at reducing regulations and stimulating private-sector investment.\nPriority Abenomics In the latest iteration of the strategy unveiled in June, Abe’s administration said sustainable economic growth in Japan will depend on increased investment and a “productivity revolution.”\nThe strategy was “disappointing” and gave the impression that Abe’s administration lacked impetus to push through deregulation, according to Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.\nKodama said Abe’s government needs to more push through structural reforms in areas including the labor market, energy industry and the agricultural sector in order to boost productivity and make the economy more competitive.\nAmari said Japan will continue to push through measures to counter the falling birth rate, such as including women and seniors in the workplace. It will also use foreign human resources and boost productivity.\n“Pushing through Abenomics and the growth strategy is our top priority,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:15:14.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
