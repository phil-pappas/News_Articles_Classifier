During its Executive Summit held at Navy Pier, the theme was Leading with 2020 Vision, challenging corporate brand leaders to visualize where their brands will be in the year 2020. \nThe idea is to prompt leadership to develop plans for their brands and to turn those visions into reality. \nThe all-day event, moderated by world-renown author and keynote speaker Mark Jeffries , was geared toward the C-suite, as well as advanced sales and branding professionals. Ford Motor Company’s Sheryl Connelly – Global Trends and Futurist – served as one of the leading keynote speakers during the event. Connelly’s presentation shared startling figures of the current ever-growing population, which will in turn end up supporting the daily growing ranks of retirees. \nVistage International, founded in 1957, is headquartered in Dan Diego, California. The corporation attracts and assembles thought leaders from various industries and facilitates private advisory boards for CEOs, senior executives and business owners. Vistage currently boasts 19,204 members across 1,787 cities, as well as 801 different industries and membership is steadily increasing. \nAccording to their independent study, Vistage members outperform their competition via company revenues (CAGR); companies with Vistage-chartered leadership enjoying an 11.6% revenue increase over non-membership members, holding a 5.4% increased revenue rate, total US companies. \nGeek Squad founder and Illinois native Robert Stephens, Maria Kim, CEO of the global social good initiative The Cara Program , Adam Stock, co-founder of The Next Level Planning Group and Sandy Marsico, founder and CEO of Sandstorm also presented engaging keynote speeches during the summit. \nKeynote speech content ranged from millennials and their impact in the workplace, to vision building, to developing the right company culture. The Cara Program’s Maria Kim shared a bold and endearing story of her childhood; sharing how her parents shaped the leader and caregiver she is today. Geek Squad’s Robert Stephens – being true to form – shared a humorous story that paid homage to his Illinois roots and John Hughes films. Stephens keynote was a shout-out to the importance of originality and how setbacks prepared his brand for the success it still enjoys today. Startups today would appreciate the free and low-budget PR tactics Stephens employed. \nEvent attendee Jeff Breeden, CEO of Cook’s Direct – Warrenville, IL-based commercial kitchen and restaurant equipment supplier – came to network and for the agenda. “Events like these always have world-class speakers and unique perspectives. It’s a great learning experience.” \nAdrian Dinu, Principal and Executive Producer of Post Meridian – Schaumburg, IL-based broadcasting and media production services provider – also shared that sentiment. “I always like to meet people and hear new ideas to learn new best practices.” \nMany corporate sponsors and vendors – like content marketing consulting service provider Chief Outsiders – were in attendance, holding a high-tech drawing at the event’s close. \nTo join the ranks of the executive elite, as well as arm yourself with the necessary tools and resources to increase the revenue of your own brand, visit www.vistage.com for membership information.
