Air France endured an expensive pilot strike in fall 2014 over moves to improve its financial position.\nThe carrier has also said it could postpone planned deliveries of its order for Boeing 787-9s , which is due to start arriving late 2016.\nGendrot referred ATW to a weekend report in the French newspaper Le Journal Du Dimanche , in which Air France CEO Frédéric Gagey said that successfully fulfilling Perform 2020 would bring the carrier’s competitiveness closer to that of partner KLM, whose unions had accepted the Perform 2020 plan.\nAsked if failure to reach agreement by Sept. 30 would result in cutting routes and frequencies, Gagey noted Air France either has to improve its productivity or scale back its ambitions; the latter choice, he said, would be “extremely regrettable.”\nHe noted that other carriers—such as Iberia, British Airways and Delta Air Lines—had “drastically” cut some activities to improve their positions. Air France was extremely reluctant to do this, preferring to reach an agreement on reducing costs with its workforce.\nIf the company’s financial performance is satisfactory by the end of 2017, he added, Air France would put €100 million ($112 million) on the table for staff. It also aimed to recruit more pilots in 2017-18 “if our efforts bear fruit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:47:53.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
