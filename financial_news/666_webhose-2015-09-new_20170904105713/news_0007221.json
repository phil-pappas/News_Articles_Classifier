The main theme for IX World Aqua Congress 2015 is “ Reviving Traditional Water & Environment Conservation Techniques ”. For long, traditional wisdom has been seen as opposite of Modern Science. Aqua Foundation aims to change this notion through this conference and rather highlight upon how traditional wisdom is complimentary to modern science. In the face of mounting water and environmental crisis in the world, various groups have begun a campaign to promote a more sustainable lifestyle. Aqua Foundation, a non-governmental organization, has taken multiple initiatives over the years, to deal with these issues holistically, rather than applying quick-fix solutions to individual aspects. This conference aims to bring various stake holders i.e. policy makers, researchers, academicians, industries, NGOs etc., on a common platform for meaningful discussions & deliberations and implementation & execution. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mooted the idea of advance preparation for the monsoon in year 2015 in order to significantly increase water storage capacity in check dams, ponds and tanks in the country to help in improving storage and rejuvenating structures by following our age – old traditional methods of conserving our resources. This formed the basis and the inspiration for the theme of this year’s conference. Given the prominence that the Conference and the Awards enjoy within like-minded organisations, a number of key organisations have already come forward to support the initiative. These include – Ministry of Urban Development, Megaplast, and Parsan Overseas.‘Aqua Foundation’s Excellence Awards' are also key highlight of the two days international conference. These awards are given to promote, encourage & recognise innovations and contributions in the field of water, environment & humanity. Some of the previous recipients of Aqua Foundation’s Excellence Awards include Dr. S Z Qasim, Prof. M S Swaminathan, Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, Shri. K K Rao, Prof. Kapil Kapoor, Shri Bhure Lal, Dr. D K Chadha etc., for individual excellence. The organizations recognized and awarded for their meaningful contributions towards environment & social responsibility include ONGC, Tata Housing, Ion Exchange, Jain Irrigation, Tata Swach, Rashtriya Chemical & Fertilizers, IOCL, BPCL, Northern Coal Fields etc.’ The Inaugural Speaker for the event will be Shri Anupam Mishra, noted Gandhian, environmentalist and well-known writer on indigenous methods of water conservation. Speaking on the Conference, Dr. Sanjay Rana, renowned Geophysicist and Chairman of Aqua Foundation said, “ For long, traditional wisdom has been seen as opposite of modern science. The organization is tirelessly working to change this notion and incorporate useful elements of traditional conservation practices as well as modern science and technology, to arrive at a comprehensive solution to present day's problems and future challenges .” Sharing her thoughts Ms Praggya Sharmaa, Organizing Secretary, IX World Aqua Congress 2015 said, “ People and organisations, both private and governmental, understand and recognise the need for concrete action. We have received tremendous response from organisations across the board to be involved in the process and catalyse concreate viable options for holistically dealing with present-day environmental challenges. ” About Aqua Foundation \nAqua Foundation is a Non-Governmental Organization working on key aspects of Water, Environment & Humanity. The ever-balanced, ever-harmonized cycles & arrangements of nature have been greatly challenged and disturbed by humans in last century, which in turn pose a threat to their own survival. Aqua Foundation is working to reverse these damages and work towards a sustainable living, in oneness with fellow humans, other living beings, plants and nature. The ultimate goal of the organization is to ensure humanity’s long-term future. The activities of Aqua Foundation include knowledge creation, information dissemination, research and education. The organization works through a diverse range of tools and techniques including, but not limited to, conferences, seminars, training programs, on-line learning, capacity building, community projects, schoolactivities etc., with prime focus on Humanity and Sustainability. Aqua Foundation is organizing international conference 'World Aqua Congress' since year 2007. Previous conferences organized by Aqua Foundation initiated a useful dialogue on these aspects. VII World Aqua Congress (2013) was conducted with theme of 'Balancing Five Elements Strategically towards Sustainability' and the VIII World Aqua Congress (2014) on 'Balancing Development and Environment'. Aqua Foundation's philosophy relies on an inclusive understanding of the interconnections between all the elements of an ecosystem: plants, animals, people, and climate. Organization also believes that efforts are not yielding desirable results due to the fact that the building blocks of the universe i.e. five elements (Panch Tatwa- Water, Earth, Energy/ Fire, Airand Space) are being dealt separately, completely in isolation and against the very fundamental nature of these elements i.e. interdependence and interconnectedness. This is where we have a lot to learn from traditional practices wherein our ancestors mastered the art of living in harmony with nature, while preserving a perfect balance between the five elements (Panch-Mahabhutas).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:19:24.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
