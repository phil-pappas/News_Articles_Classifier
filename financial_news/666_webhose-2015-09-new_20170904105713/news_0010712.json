A rebound in global exchanges coupled with notification of the latest reform in the retrospective tax regime buoyed investor sentiments. There was a rally in the Indian stock markets and the major indices gained 1%-2% in Thursday’s trading. Analysts observed that the markets were buoyed after the government notified the new amendments to the income tax act based on the recommendations of the Justice AP Shah Committee report on the applicability of minimum alternate tax (MAT) on foreign investors. The report had recommended that MAT not be imposed on foreign portfolio and institutional investors. The MAT issue on capital gains was expected to impact the margins of foreign funds. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has notified the recommendations made by the Shah panel on the applicability of MAT pertaining to the capital gains made by foreign investors. Further, a rebound in Asian markets and rupee's relative strengthening has also supported the markets gains. The barometer 30-scrip sensitive index (Sensex) of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) closed with gains of 311.22 points or 1.22%.

The Sensex touched a high of 25,835.41 points and a low of 25,555.77 points in the intra-day trade.

Coincidentally, the Chinese markets remained closed on account of Victory Day celebrations held to commemorate China's victory over Japan in the Second World War. The Chinese markets will remain closed on Friday as well. Interestingly, the continuous slide in the Chinese markets had spooked global investors and dampened Indian equities on fear of another recession caused due to the slowdown in the $10 trillion-worth Asian economy.
