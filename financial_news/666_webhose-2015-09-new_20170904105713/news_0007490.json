Andrew Harrer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray\nIt was a corruption case of blockbuster proportions, involving the theft of half a billion dollars from the Bank of China, four false marriages to gain residency in the United States, and regular gambling trips to Las Vegas, Macau and Australia's own Crown Casino.\nThe scam was discovered during an audit in October 2001, prompting three small-town bank managers from the southern province of Guangdong, along with their wives, to skip town heading first to Vancouver and then to the US.\nBetween them, and with the help of other family members, they managed to siphon a whopping US$482 million over ten years from one of China's biggest state-owned financial institutions.\nUnsurprisingly, Beijing has been trying to get back the main perpetrators ever since.\nBut that quest had been unsuccessful until last week, when Kuang Wanfeng, wife of Xu Chaofan, the most senior of the bank managers involved, was put on a plane back to China. It was Washington's second repatriation of a corruption suspect in a week and came just as President Xi Jinping, who has made the anti-graft campaign a priority of his government, arrived in the US for a state visit.\nWhile both of those sent back were not the highest on China's most wanted list, their repatriation signals an important shift in the way Washington is cooperating with Beijing. It also confirms that bringing back fugitives, particularly those accused of corruption, remains at the top of China's foreign policy agenda.\nAnd the US is not Beijing's only target. Australia and Canada are also often mentioned as popular safe havens for corrupt officials. Chinese authorities released a list of 100 wanted fugitives in April, which included ten believed to be hiding in Australia. This newspaper found that at least five of those listed did have property and business links in Sydney, Perth and Adelaide.\n The question now is whether Canberra will follow Washington's lead and begin returning corruption suspects to China.\nHowever, it is important to note the US is treading cautiously, opting to focus on cases that appear rock solid. The Bank of China fraudsters have been through the American court system, which found the two bank managers, Xu Chaofan and Xu Guojun, guilty of racketeering, money laundering, international transportation of stolen property as well as passport and visa fraud. They are both serving 20-plus years in jail and their wives, Kuang Wanfang and Yu Yingyi, were also found guilty of money laundering and breaking immigration laws and handed eight-year prison terms. Kuang was released early and repatriated to China last week but it is unclear whether the others will follow.\nA third former bank manager Yu Zhendong pleaded guilty and agreed to return to China in 2004, after cooperating with the US authorities. He was later jailed for 12 years and his wife was allowed to stay in the US.\nIf ever there was a case that warranted international cooperation this one was it. The sensational details of the heist were laid out to the public via a series of court cases.\nAll three managers ran a Bank of China branch in Kaiping, a city of 700,000 people, which is small by Chinese standards. Over a decade they lost US$147 million in foreign exchange speculation and stole at least another US$265 million in off-the-book or sham loans, according to court documents. They also transferred more than US$80 million to casinos in Macau, Australia, Malaysia and the Philippines for gambling trips. All four entered sham marriages to gain US residency.\nThis case demonstrates not only the scale of the corruption problem facing Chinese authorities but also its global dimensions.\nHowever, despite increasing pressure from Beijing, foreign governments' cooperation with China on corruption cases remains limited.\nWhile it is valid for Beijing to seek international assistance on these big corruption cases, it's hard for governments to hand over people to a legal system that is controlled by the Communist Party, lacks transparency and where some corruption crimes carry the death penalty.\nChina is also not doing itself any favours with cases like that of Zhang Kai, a devout Christian and lawyer, who was helping churches in the eastern province of Zhejiang fight against the forced demolition of their crosses. He has been held by public security officials at a secret location for the past month and his case has attracted attention because he was due to meet the US ambassador-at-large for religious freedom the day after he was detained. Zhang is one of about 250 activist lawyers and staff who have been detained and harassed in the past three months, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe Bank of China fraud case shows that Beijing has a very good argument for why it needs international cooperation in corruption but until it creates an independent and transparent legal system at home, its requests for help abroad will be met with suspicion.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-09-29T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:03:24.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
