In recent times, there have been horror stories of plane crash survivors eating the dead among the passengers to stay alive. \nEast African telecommunication and Internet providers find themselves in a tight spot, where they have to consider cannibalism: \"Should I eat my own business? Should I charge flat fees by billing a fixed price per month or day, and provide unlimited voice, SMS and data usage and give up the more lucrative revenues of voice per second, SMS per message and data per megabyte?\" \nThe answer for most of them is a resounding yes. Charging a flat fee is a disruptive trend that cannot be neglected by any provider. \nThe question is not if but when to go down this route. Irrespective of the timing, East African providers will not be the first. If we look at developed markets such as Europe, flat fees have been a common feature for years. \nIn the European market we have seen an extremely unsettling change from fixed (analogue) calling to Internet calling (voice over IP). The average monthly calling bills of, say, $60, shrank to less than $15 in no time. Fixed line telephone providers were challenged to stay or exit. \nStaying meant more short term revenues on analogue calling, but losing market share in the mid-term. So the timing of their exits was crucial. \nThis was the first time operators had to cannibalise revenues in order to gain or maintain market share, of a market that suddenly had lower revenues though. It is exactly the same thing that is about to happen in East Africa. \nMixed offer \nNearly all operators in East Africa have a mix of offers that bill on usage and others that charge a flat fee. Airtel offers the unlimiNET proposition. This offers bundled voice, SMS and data in a period ranging from daily to monthly bundles. MTN Uganda has \"Freedom\" bundles while in Tanzania, Vodacom has \"Cheka Bombastik.\" Safaricom has \"Advantage Plus,\" which offers the same bundles to post-pay customers. \nThe traditional business model of selling voice, SMS and data as individual services is on its way out. The popularity of bundled services and the rate at which different offers are being churned out and tweaked tells us that it is here to stay. So telecommunications providers should go into innovative business models as fast as possible. It's urgent; the conventional \"voice\" will be swallowed up soon. \nIn fact, the unavoidable cannibalisation by flat fees (eat as much as you can), gets even worse. The consumer uptake will be accelerated by the attractive data-component, with unlimited access to WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and Instagram. \nThese over-the-top (OTT) service providers are already adding conventional calling and text messaging to their offering and are a direct competitor for mobile phone operators. \nIn January, WhatsApp, the world's most popular instant messaging service, announced that it had over 700 million monthly active users sending 30 billion messages daily. The number of SMS sent over the same period was just over 20 billion and they were on a gradual decline. Nine months later, WhatsApp has added an extra 200 million monthly active users and calling functionality to their app. \nThe issue is evidently a threat to the extent that the CEO of one of the region's leading telco providers suggested that OTT providers need to be regulated as they utilise and profit from the infrastructure put in place by mobile network operators. \nHaving observed the dynamic market movement in the recent past, it is difficult to predict whether a provider will have the same feeling in three years, when their market share will have materialised into revenue growth by offering new services such as music streaming and IPTV. \nIn the region, large segments of mobile customers have or are about to move to smartphones. Predictability in pricing will provide sufficient reassurance, especially to new smartphone users, to try out mobile data services. \nErik van der Dussen is associate director while Mbagara Karita is business development manager at Deloitte East Africa East Africa \nThe Employment and Labour Relations Court Friday broke the stalemate over teachers' pay by directing them to return to … see more » Copyright © 2015 The East African.
