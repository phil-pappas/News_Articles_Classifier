Uber allows for tip-free rides. \nChen's ruling was focused on whether the suit qualified to represent Uber drivers as a group and did not address merits of the case. \n\"While we are not surprised by this court's ruling, we are pleased that it has decided to certify only a tiny fraction of the class that the plaintiffs were seeking,\" an Uber spokesperson told AFP. \n\"That said, we'll most likely appeal the decision as partners use Uber on their own terms, and there really is no typical driver -- the key question at issue.\" \nCracks have begun to appear in the model developed by Uber and other peer-to-peer services. \nLawsuits in several jurisdictions argue that on-demand workers are not independent contractors, but rather employees entitled to unemployment insurance, workers compensation and other benefits. \nPoliticians are taking notice. \nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said recently she would \"crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors.\" \n\"This on-demand, or so-called gig economy, is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation,\" she said in June. \"But it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\" \nYet without a flexible workforce of independent contractors, \"the sharing economy could be stopped in its tracks,\" said Christopher Koopman, a research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. \n\"We would not see the dynamic, innovative environment we have today.\" \nUber has been maintaining an aggressive international expansion plan, despite fierce opposition in some countries from regulators and established taxi industry players. \nSan Francisco-based Uber says it operates in some 250 cities and 58 countries. Its app allows smartphone users to connect with drivers and bypass traditional taxi services. \nDespite its spectacular growth, Uber has faced troubles in many countries. The company decided to suspend its low-cost service in France after a nationwide taxi strike in protest against Uber turned violent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:15:23.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
