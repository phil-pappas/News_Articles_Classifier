Look closely at the underlying companies, however, and you may find balance sheets buckling under weighty debt loads or deteriorating profits, making the stocks much less of a bargain than they appear on the surface. See Also: 7 Good Stocks That Keep Raising Dividends \nMore promising are dividend-paying stocks that have solid long-term prospects but appear to have hit some speed bumps. Buying these stocks involves taking a chance that their businesses will revive. In exchange for that risk, you can get stocks with low P/Es and above-average yields. If the companies’ turnaround plans show even modest signs of success, the stocks could take off. \nOne stock in this camp is International Business Machines (symbol IBM , $148.14), a favorite of Warren Buffett, who owns shares through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B $131.47). Expectations for Big Blue are now low, to say the least. The stock has slumped 25% over the past year, giving IBM a P/E of just 9 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months. That’s well below the P/E of 16 for Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The stock yields a robust 3.5%, compared with 2.2% for the S&P 500.

Indeed, even though IBM has jettisoned much of its less profitable hardware and chip manufacturing businesses, and reinvested in more profitable software and technology services, it hasn’t been able to kindle revenue growth. Sales peaked at $106.9 billion in 2011, and analysts see revenue slumping to $83 billion this year. Wall Street expects sales to remain flat in 2016 and 2017. \nThe bullish case for IBM is that it’s pouring money into promising new technologies, such as cloud computing, data analytics, social media and digital security products. IBM expects these areas to generate annual sales of $40 billion in 2018, up from $25 billion in 2014, and to account for 40% of sales, up from 27% last year. These businesses should eventually bolster overall corporate profit margins, IBM says. \nWall Street sees IBM’s profits dipping 4.8% this year, to $15.73 per share. But profit growth should resume in 2016, when analysts expect IBM to earn $16.12 per share. The company also generates mountains of cash it can use for additional share buybacks, higher dividends or both. “IBM is unloved and misunderstood, but the company actually has a good story,” says Kim Forrest, an analyst with investment adviser Fort Pitt Capital in Pittsburgh. Despite the slumping stock, Buffett remains a fan too, recently adding to his IBM stake and saying, \"I love it when it goes down. I get to buy it cheaper.” \nUnited Technologies ( UTX , $93.31) also looks like a promising turnaround candidate. The company makes aircraft engines through its Pratt & Whitney division, along with Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and other products. Despite its strong lineup, the business has been in a funk. Sales have slumped in Europe and China, and because United Tech derives more than 60% of its sales in foreign markets, the strong dollar has been a headwind, denting profits earned in foreign currencies (which are worth less when converted to greenbacks). \nNone of this has been good for the stock, which has tumbled 14% this year. But patience could be rewarded. United Tech recently sold its Sikorsky helicopter business to Lockheed Martin ( LMT , $207.60) for $9 billion. ( We recently recommended Lockheed as a good stock to buy because it keeps raising its dividend.) Profits are taking a hit as a result; analysts estimate earnings of $6.20 per share this year, down from $6.82 in 2014. Yet profits should recover in the years ahead. United Tech says it plans to use the $6.2 billion in cash proceeds from the Sikorsky sale to buy back more stock, which should help lift earnings per share. With $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, the company could make acquisitions to boost growth as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:13:39.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
