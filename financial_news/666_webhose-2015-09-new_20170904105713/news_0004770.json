Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Sponsor broker Macquarie Capital has valued IPO hopeful Link Group at 14.2 to 16.8 times forecast 2016 earnings on an enterprise value basis, equating to a $2.582 billion to $3.047 billion enterprise value, according to fund manager sources.\nMacquarie analyst Bryan Raymond and his team valued Link's equity at $2.222 billion to $2.747 billion, which equates to a FY16 price to earnings range of 23.3 times to 28 times.\nThe FY16 multiples normalised after the recent Link acquisitions in the fund administration space reduce to FY16 EV/EBITDA 9.9 to 11.7 times and 14.7 to 17.7 times forecast net profit.\nPre-marketing research reports from joint lead managers Macquarie, Citi, UBS and Deutsche Bank landed on fund managers' desks on Wednesday morning, ahead of the analyst and company marketing roadshows, as flagged by Street Talk.\nThe total range across all the joint lead managers on an enterprise value basis is $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion, implying a total EV/EBITDA range of 12.7 to 17.7 times. It should be noted this does not reflect the margin upside to come post integration of acquisitions.\nLink has forecast net profit of $95.5 million in fiscal 2016, on revenues of $750 million. Operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are expected to be $181.2 million.\nRaymond pointed to the company's organic growth of around 4 per cent to 6 per cent in recent years and in 2016, underpinned by its fund administration business, which has been growing at 5 per cent to 7 per cent.\nLink's $150 million Superpartners acquisition last year was identified as another growth driver, with management expecting to extract substantial synergies as clients are migrated to Link's platforms and legacy platforms are retired.\n The news comes after Street Talk revealed Link had appointed former Macquarie Bank executive Michael Carapiet as its independent chairman.\nGlen Boreham, Sally Pitkin and Fiona Trafford-Walker have been named as non-executive directors on the board.\nCarapiet, a former heavyweight of the investment banking industry, serving as chairman of Macquarie Capital and Macquarie Securities, joined the Link board as a director in June 2015.\nLink's joint lead managers will cover four different continents on the analyst roadshow. Macquarie Capital will front domestic institutions, UBS will meet with Asian investors, Deutsche Bank will look after the United States and Deustche Bank will travel to the United Kingdom. Pre-marketing research will hit fund manager desks tomorrow morning.\nFund managers will be asked to compare Link Group to ASX-listed IRESS and Veda Group, as well as SS&C Technologies Holdings, the Nasdaq-listed \"fintech\" company which trades at close to 30-times forecast 2015 calendar year profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:07:09.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
