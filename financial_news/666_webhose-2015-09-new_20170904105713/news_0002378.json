The orange plantation operator said the outturn reflects the impact of previously announced events and trading updates. \nThe company said turnover for the half year was reported as down by around 21.9% on the comparable period and the outturn for the full year will reflect a similar performance. The core net loss for the full year is expected to be more than double the RMB193m that was reported for the first six months of the year, it said. \nCitrus said the deterioration in the second half performance reflected the significant impact of the Huanglongbing disease infection at the group's Xinfeng plantation, announced on 15 April and 7 May, and the damage sustained from Typhoon Rammasun and Typhoon Seagull. \nThe company said the typhoons affected both production yield and the selling price of the orange harvests, with the average selling price of the group's winter and summer oranges crop for full-year 2015 around 15.2% lower than 2014. \nAt 0954 BST, Asian Citrus (HKSE: 0073-OL.HK - news ) shares were down 9.1% at 8.75p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:26:06.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
