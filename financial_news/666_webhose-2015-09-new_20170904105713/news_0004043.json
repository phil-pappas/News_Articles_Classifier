Before they take the plunge, others get to know the hidden potential and enter into these stocks, pushing them out of reach. \nSo, instead of repenting, spotting the off-the-radar potential winners and immediately investing in them could be a smart decision. \nOne such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Silver Standard Resources Inc. (SSRI). This stock in the Mining-Silver space has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 145%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock has lost 13.22% over the same time frame. \nYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is 190%, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation. \nAnd if this isn’t enough, SSRI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance). \nSo if you are looking for a stock flying under-the-radar that is well-equipped to bounce down the road, make sure to consider Silver Standard Resources. Solid estimate revisions and an impressive Zacks Rank suggest that better days may be ahead for SSRI and that now might be an interesting buying opportunity. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
