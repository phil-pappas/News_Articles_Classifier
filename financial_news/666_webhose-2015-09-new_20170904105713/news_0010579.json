Mr. Einhorn has lost nearly $1.4 billion so far this year. A Greenlight spokesman declined to comment on the firm’s performance.\nGreenlight’s losing streak so far in 2015 marks a rare setback for Mr. Einhorn, a baby-faced, poker-playing hedge-fund manager who shot to fame with his critique of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in the months before the firm collapsed in September 2008. The former analyst started Greenlight after getting the go-ahead, or “green light,” from his wife to do so.\nHis clout has mushroomed since the crisis as his lengthy, bearish presentations on companies, which often incorporate cartoons and video clips, have regularly moved markets. Companies with shares that sank after getting criticized by Mr. Einhorn include real-estate developer St. Joe Co. JOE -0.06 % and coffee maker Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. GMCR -2.33 % Questions from him on a 2012 Herbalife Ltd. HLF -3.55 % earnings call sent the stock price tumbling within minutes before it closed down 20% that day.\nGreenlight told investors Monday that its losses so far this year “came primarily” from its investments in Consol Energy Inc., CNX -2.92 % Micron Technology Inc. MU -1.28 % and SunEdison Inc. SUNE 6.44 % The stock price of renewable-energy company SunEdison, a popular holding among hedge funds, dropped 55.3% in August. Consol and Micron also fell in August.\nGreenlight has notched average annualized returns of nearly 20% since its start, including its 22.7% loss in 2008. But this year Mr. Einhorn has struggled despite a relatively cautious stance toward the markets. The hedge fund in recent months has decreased its exposure to stocks, investors said.\nPeople who are close to the 46-year-old Mr. Einhorn said he is embarrassed about his performance and upset about the losses. Some investors said this week they would like Mr. Einhorn to hold a conference call with his clients.\nVolatile markets have whipsawed hedge funds this year, crimping what appeared to be a resurgence for hedge funds that specialize in stock picking following years of lackluster performance.\nSome star managers were caught off guard by the recent stock swoon, which included an intraday collapse of more than 1,000 points on Aug. 24, though the subsequent rally has helped some minimize those losses. Others are up double digits for the year, according to investors.\n“It’s been a tough period” for investors who look to snap up stocks that trade at low prices relative to their earnings, said Greg Dowling of Cincinnati-based Fund Evaluation Group, referring to a “value investors” camp that includes Mr. Einhorn. “There are global growth concerns around the world, so if you can find a consistent grower people are going to pay up for that.”\nFor the month of August through Friday, the median return for stock hedge funds such as Greenlight was a 2% loss, according to a private note Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage sent clients Monday. That is better than a 5.3% loss by the S&P 500, including dividends, and a 6.2% loss by the MSCI AC World index.\nEarlier this year, Mr. Einhorn told his clients he was moving away from his long-held target of a 20% annual return in favor of gains relative to certain benchmarks instead.\nIn recent letters to his investors, Mr. Einhorn has said high valuations make it difficult to find attractive stock bets.\n“In today’s market, the best performing stocks are companies with exciting stories where accountability is in the distant future,” he wrote in a July investor letter.\nIn recent weeks, Greenlight used a third-party consultant to conduct a telephone survey of its investors. During the 30-minute survey, one client said, the consultant asked questions about Greenlight’s operations, longer-term performance and investor communications, among other items.\nA person familiar with Greenlight said the firm commissions the survey every few years and that this year’s survey wasn’t related to Greenlight’s performance.\nOne longtime investor said she would give Greenlight more money if she could. The firm is currently closed to new investors after raising roughly $1 billion total in new money late last year.\n“Intellectual skills are not perishable,” said Amanda Haynes-Dale, managing director of New York-based hedge-fund investor Pan Reliance Capital Advisors.\nWrite to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:46:56.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
