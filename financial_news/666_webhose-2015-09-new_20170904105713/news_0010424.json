While the nation won’t disclose its latest holdings until Sept. 7, Societe Generale SA estimated the People’s Bank of China has offloaded at least $100 billion of its $3.7 trillion trove of reserve assets since the currency regime change on Aug. 11, including Treasuries.\nBut the impact of China’s selling isn’t so straightforward, Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets research at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a report Wednesday. Changes in the global economic outlook typically trump money flows in determining the direction of bond yields. With the world’s second-biggest economy slowing and global markets in turmoil, China’s reduction of Treasuries is partly offset by investors parking cash in fixed-income assets, he wrote.\n“We would advise against following a narrow flow-of-funds approach,” Garzarelli said in the report. “Shifts in macro expectations tend to win the day.”\nOn a longer-term basis, the decline in reserves by China and other central banks, which together hold $11.4 trillion of assets, will hurt dollar-denominated bonds as private investors eventually rotate out of debt and into riskier assets, Garzarelli said.\nChina, with $1.27 trillion of Treasuries as of June, is the biggest overseas holder. If the International Monetary Fund’s aggregation of international reserve assets is any guide, around two-thirds of the nation’s war chest is in dollars.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.15 percent Wednesday, up from as low as 1.9 percent last month. Goldman Sachs forecasts yields will end the year at 2.5 percent, still well below the 3 percent where their model of fair value, which is based on macroeconomic fundamentals, says it should trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:46:56.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
