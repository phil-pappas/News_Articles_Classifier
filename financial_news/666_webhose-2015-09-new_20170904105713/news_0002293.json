Meanwhile, more data shed light on the housing market's strengthening recovery. Sales slow down, prices inch up \nSales of existing homes fell from a downwardly revised, seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.58 million in July to 5.31 million in August, which amounts to a 4.8% decrease, according to data released this week from the National Association of Realtors. \nHowever, the August rate is 6.2% higher than the same time last year. \n\"The housing report may be viewed as negative, but I think we can dismiss the decline as being a normal down after several ups,\" says Joel Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \nAlso released this week was the Federal Housing Finance Agency's monthly house price index. Prices increased 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis from June to July, and were up 5.8% from July 2014. 30 year fixed rate mortgage -- 3 month trend Yields take a tumble \nU.S. Treasury yields continued falling this week following the Federal Reserve's decision last week to hold off raising the federal funds rate. \n\"We did see a pretty decent drop in the 10-year (Treasury yield), which has a high correlation to where mortgage rates are priced,\" says Bryan Sullivan, chief investment and strategy officer at loanDepot in Foothill Ranch, California. \nFalling oil prices and China's ongoing economic turmoil added to the demand for government bonds, MarketWatch reported Tuesday. With bonds, yields fall as prices rise. A look at this week's rates The benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4% from 4.06%, according to Bankrate's Sept. 23 survey of large lenders.
