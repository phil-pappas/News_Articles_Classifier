This allowance does not include their residential address, second homes or personal holiday homes. \nLandlords are advised to allow a minimum of five working days for any payment to reach LPS and 10 working days for any payment made via the Post Office. If LPS does not receive full payment by 30 September 2015 the allowance will not be awarded. \nLPS is actively pursuing landlords with arrears of rates. LPS is willing to assist any landlord in arrears by agreeing mutually acceptable payment arrangements that could allow for discount to be awarded for current year rates. \nLandlords having difficulty paying their rate bill should contact LPS as soon as possible by telephoning 0300 200 7801. It may be possible to discuss alternative payment arrangements to avoid LPS taking legal debt recovery action. \nFor more information on the different types of landlord accounts available visit the nibusiness info website at the nibusinessinfo website . or the nidirect website . Alternatively you can contact the LPS helpline on 0300 200 7801. Notes to editors: \n1. Liability for rates on a rental property is determined by the Capital Value for Domestic Properties or Net Annual Value for Non Domestic Properties. Article 20 accounts – From 1 April 2015, where a rented domestic property has an assessed capital value of £150,000 or less it is the landlord that is liable for the rates. For properties with a higher value (above £150,000) the tenant will be liable for rates unless the landlord has signed up to a formal agreement with the Department to pay rates on the property, in which case Article 21 applies. \n2. From 1 April 2015, the amount of allowance given to landlords is standardised at 10% for both Article 20 and Article 21 types of rate accounts. This level of allowance will apply across the board to all landlords. \n3. More detailed information about landlord status can be found on the nidirect website or on the nibusinessinfo website . \n4.
