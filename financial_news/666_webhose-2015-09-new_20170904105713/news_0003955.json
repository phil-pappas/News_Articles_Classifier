US crude-oil production fell for the fifth week in a row, dropping by 83,000 barrels per day to 9.14 million barrels per day. \nThough still high, the decline in US production was seen as potentially easing the global oversupply that has outstripped demand and sent prices diving more than 50 percent since June 2014. \nUS stockpiles at the key Cushing hub sank by 900,000 barrels, to 56.4 million. Meanwhile, US demand for petroleum products rose about four percent from a year ago. \n\"Strong economic data, strong demand for oil products, drop in oil production and drop in Cushing stocks seems to provide support to oil prices so far, despite the 2.57 million increase in US crude stocks,\" said Natixis (Paris: FR0000120685 - news ) analyst Abhishek Deshpande.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:56:32.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
