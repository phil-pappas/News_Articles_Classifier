While discussions are advanced, talks could still fall apart and the size of the deal and the makeup of the assets could still change, they said.\nThe former Japanese tobacco monopoly has sped up acquisitions of brands and products abroad in the face of a shrinking population and a stagnating smoking rate at home. Japan Tobacco has said its priority is investing to boost the competitiveness of its tobacco businesses, which led to its withdrawal from drinks and vending machines.\nJapan Tobacco President Mitsuomi Koizumi said in February that 2015 would be the company’s “year of investments,” including increased stakes in other types of tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.\nReynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the second-largest U.S. tobacco company. It completed its acquisition of Lorillard Inc. in June for about $25 billion, adding the Newport cigarette brand and selling some of Lorillard’s other brands to Imperial Tobacco Group.\nReynolds’ Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which owns Natural American Spirit, reported $658 million of revenue in fiscal year 2014, compared with $572 million in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The brand is facing pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Association, which sent a letter to Reynolds on Aug. 27 stating that the company needs to prove cigarettes they’ve labeled as “natural” or “additive-free” are less harmful in order to keep marketing them that way.\nA representative for Japan Tobacco didn’t have an immediate comment, and a spokesman for Reynolds couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.jt.com/media/press_releases/2014/0730_01.html\\"], "published": "2015-09-25T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:14:40.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
