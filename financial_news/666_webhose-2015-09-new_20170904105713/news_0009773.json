PUBLISHED: 21:39, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:44, Thu, Sep 3, 2015 PH Chief executive Richard Pennycook \nThe mutual was boosted by strong trading in its food and funeralcare businesses as it posted a £36million profit compared with a £9million loss a year ago. \nRevenue was slightly lower at £4.6billion. \nBut it warned that ongoing investment in new stores, IT systems and staff pay meant it would only break even, or make a small loss, for the full year. \nIt has completed the rescue phase of its three-stage turnaround after selling its pharmacy and farms businesses, which helped it to a £124million pre-tax profit last year compared with a £2.3billion loss in 2013. \nIt is now modernising the business after years of underinvestment. Our customers and members are beginning to see the difference Chief executive Richard Pennycook \nChief executive Richard Pennycook said: “We’ve made a good start on the three-year journey to rebuild the Co-operative Group. \n“These early days are about fixing the basics – putting in place new leadership teams and providing the investment to deliver the strategies for our businesses. \n\"Our customers and members are beginning to see the difference.” \nChairman Allan Leighton said commercial improvements went hand in hand with moves to strengthen the board and management teams. \nReforms were pushed through after its previous management was labelled “dysfunctional” by former City minister Lord Myners, who oversaw a review of the business. \nThe Co-op increased its capital spending from £97million to £144million in the first half as it opened 35 new food stores and 10 funeral homes. \nSales across its food business rose 0.8 per cent and underlying profit jumped 21 per cent to £120.4million, with its convenience stores enjoying 3.3 per cent higher turnover. \nIt plans to open 60 new convenience stores and complete 150 refurbishments. \nFuneralcare had its busiest start to a year since 2008, with profit up by nearly 50 per cent to £51.8million on 16 per cent higher sales of £216.4million. \nIts insurance operation had a £500,000 profit from a £6.8million loss last time, while the bank in which it holds a 20 per cent stake was £204.2million in the red.
