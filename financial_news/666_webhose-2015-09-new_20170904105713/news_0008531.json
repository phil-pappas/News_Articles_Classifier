Britain's Met Office forecasts temperatures could reach a high of 21 degrees Celsius on Thursday and 22 degrees on Friday, compared with normal average temperatures for September of around 17 degrees. \nMeanwhile gas supplies were also likely to increase over Thursday and Friday. \nGas flows through Britain's Bacton Seal gas terminal were zero on Thursday morning but operator Total E&P said a slow ramp would begin on Thursday or early Friday. \nAn unplanned outage of offshore production affecting gas flows at the site started on Sept. 5. \nWith total supply flows at 152.2 million cubic metres (mcm) per day in Britain and demand expected at 164.6 mcm, the system was 11.9 mcm undersupplied, National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) data showed. \nFurther out on the curve the Winter 15 contract was flat at 43.95 pence per therm. \nAnalysts at London-based Energy Aspects said cooler weather due to the El Nino weather phenomenon could lead to higher gas demand across Northern Europe in winter. \n\"At a minimum, this will lead to a 17 bcm (billion cubic metres) y/y increase in demand over winter 15-16 (Q4 15 and Q1 16),\" the analysts said in a research note on Thursday. \nHowever strong gas supplies from Russia and high deliveries of liquefied natural gas would keep a lid on prices, they added. \nEnergy Aspects forecasts average prices of 44.00 pence per therm in the fourth quarter of the year, down from 53.00 pence per therm during the same period last year. \nIn the Dutch TTF gas market, prices were also lower. Day-ahead TTF gas was down 0.05 euros at 19.35 euros per megawatt hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, benchmark EU Allowances (EUA) were up 0.02 euros at 8.30 euros per tonne.
