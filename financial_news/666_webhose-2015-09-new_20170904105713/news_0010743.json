China's exports dropped 5.5% in August from a year earlier in dollar terms after a 8.3% drop in July, according to the General Administration of Customs, more than the 6.6% decline that was expected by analysts. \nCustoms said China exports will continue to face \"relatively big pressure\" in the fourth quarter amid a slowing economy. \nImports last month decreased 13.8% in dollar terms compared to a year ago, more than the 7.9% dip that was forecast, after a 8.1% fall in July. \nChina's trade surplus widened in August to $60.2bn from $43.03bn in July, beating projections of $48bn. \nCapital Economics said trade was \"healthier than headlines suggest\", adding the figures would likely have been stronger in August had it not been for temporary disruptions to industrial activity following the Tianjin warehouse blast and factory closures ahead of last week's WWII Victory Day parade. \n\"Looking ahead, we think trade growth ought to recover over the coming quarters,\" said China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"The drag from the Tianjin blast and Victory parade disruptions ought to have mostly faded this month. Meanwhile, stronger growth in China's main trading partners ought to shore up exports while a pick-up in investment spending will boost imports.\" However, Oanda's senior market analyst Craig Erlam warned that \"if the consumer cannot fill the void left my falling export demand, then the government has a big job on its hands to stop the economy slowing at a much faster pace\". \nThe market volatility caused by China slowdown concerns has prompted some analysts to pull back their expectations for an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The Fed meets on 16-17 September before making its latest policy announcement. \n\"A rate hike looks unlikely at this stage given the recent China-driven market volatility and the mixed data seen in recent months, but it is certainly not off the table so any data releases will be monitored closely,\" Erlam said. \nFor their part, analysts at Citi told clients the Fed might be on the cusp of committing a policy mistake if they raise rates come September. The US market resumed trading on Tuesday after the Labor Day break a day earlier. The National Federation of Independent Business said its small-business optimism index rose 0.5 points to 95.9. Of the 10 components, five posted gains, three fell and two remained unchanged. \nStill to come, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, a non-voting member of the FOMC, speaks on the outlook for US monetary policy at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, at 2215 BST. \nEuropean data Eurozone economic growth for the second quarter was revised higher following an improvement in exports. Eurostat said gross domestic product increased 0.4% in the second quarter from the first, compared to an earlier estimate of 0.3%. The first quarter was also revised higher to 0.5% from a previous forecast of 0.4%. GDP was 1.5% higher in the second quarter than in the same period a year ago, up from a previous estimate of 1.2%. \nGermany's trade surplus narrowed to €22.8bn in July from €24.4bn a month earlier, slightly more than the €23.5bn expected by analysts, the Federal Statistics Office said. Exports rose 2.4% in July, compared to forecasts for a 1% gain and the previous month's 1.1% drop. Imports climbed 2.2% in July, smashing estimates for a 0.7% rise and better than June's 0.8% fall. \nCloser to home, British retail spending stagnated in August due to poor weather and the later-than-usual date of a public holiday. The British Retail Consortium said retail spending in August was 0.1% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since April and down from 2.2% growth in July. \nMeanwhile, ahead of Thursday's Bank of England policy announcement Citi analysts said they see no changes to interest rates. \n\"The MPC are still likely to signal that the first rate hike is on the horizon, consistent with Carney's warning at Jackson Hole that developments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert,\" said analyst Michael Saunders. \"However, we do not expect the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) will seek to encourage markets to price in any urgency for the first hike.\" Companies Amlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) surged after MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings said it was in talks to buy the group. \nUnited Utilities (LSE: UU.L - news ) jumped amid reports that it could attract takeover interest due to its current valuation. Bernstein upgraded the stock to 'outperform', saying it is \"an attractive acquisition target for a pension or infrastructure fund\". \nBerkeley Group climbed after the homebuilder reiterated its earnings guidance as it continued to expand its operations in the current financial year. \nHikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) was higher as it agreed to acquire almost the entire share capital of Egypt-based EIMC United Pharmaceuticals (EUP) from a consortium of shareholders for an undisclosed sum. \nRSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) rose as it signed contracts to sell its operations in Latin America to Suramericana SA. \nStandard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) reversed Monday's fall amid the prospect of facing Iran-related fines, the reported axing of senior staff, and the impact of China's slowdown on their Asian business. \nGoing the other way, Whitbread (LSE: WTB.L - news ) slumped as the owner of Costa coffee shops reported a slowdown in sales in the second quarter. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,091.27 +0.54% FTSE 100 6,146.10 +1.18% FTSE 250 17,000.28 +0.94% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 137.60p +4.40% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 703.90p +3.87% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 317.40p +3.02% Standard Chartered (STAN) 721.20p +2.82% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 619.00p +2.74% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 276.70p +2.67% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,309.50p +2.60% Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,696.00p +2.43% BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) (BG.) 983.80p +2.43% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL.) 1,115.00p +2.39% FTSE 100 - Fallers Whitbread (WTB) 4,636.00p -1.59% Next (EUREX: NXTI.EX - news ) (NXT) 7,545.00p -0.92% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 974.50p -0.66% Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 775.50p -0.64% Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.) 5,716.00p -0.02% FTSE 250 - Risers Amlin (Stuttgart: 4A8A.SG - news ) (AML) 655.00p +32.99% AO World (Other OTC: AOWDF - news ) (AO.) 150.80p +10.07% Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 338.40p +5.19% Ashmore Group (Other OTC: AJMPF - news ) (ASHM) 257.10p +5.02% Aggreko (EUREX: AGKF.EX - news ) (AGK) 1,087.00p +4.92% Lancashire Holdings Limited (Other OTC: LCSHF - news ) (LRE) 685.00p +4.90% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 254.80p +4.60% Serco Group (Other OTC: SECCF - news ) (SRP) 109.20p +4.30% Workspace Group (LSE: WKP.L - news ) (WKP) 945.00p +3.85% CLS Holdings (LSE: CLI.L - news ) (CLI) 1,910.00p +3.80% FTSE 250 - Fallers Lonmin (LMI) 24.00p -4.84% Wetherspoon (J.D.)
