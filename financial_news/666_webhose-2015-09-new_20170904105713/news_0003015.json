Unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent and wages accelerated.\nThe report underscored the U.S. economy's vibrancy in the face of volatile global financial markets and China's slowing growth, and kept alive the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.\nS&P 500 e-minis were down 32.75 points, or 1.68 percent, with 428,567 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 68.75 points, or 1.63 percent, on volume of 67,094 contracts. Dow e-minis were down 283 points, or 1.73 percent, with 50,987 contracts changing hands.\n\"The unemployment rate has fallen while wages have accelerated - that will certainly give the hawks more ammunition for a September rate hike,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nThe August jobs data, however, has often been sharply revised upward after initial weak readings due to seasonal fluctuations.\nThe recent turmoil in the market has prompted some investors to bet the Fed might wait until the end of the year to hike rates.\nBut Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said last Friday it was still too early to decide if the volatility, which left the S&P 500 with its biggest monthly drop in three years in August, had made a September hike unfeasible.\nThe Fed has said it will increase rates only if it sees sustained economic recovery. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation stubbornly remains below the 2 percent target set by the central bank.\nSeparately, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said he had seen enough healing in the U.S. labor market to warrant raising interest rates soon.\nU.S. stocks mostly ended higher on Thursday in choppy trading as investors remained on edge ahead of the data.\nNear-zero rates have allowed the U.S. stock market to stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and impact the profit margins of companies.\nCaterpillar's shares were down 2.3 percent at 74.38 premarket after Baird downgraded the stock to \"neutral\".\nNetflix was down 3 percent at $98. The stock has fallen for the past five days.\nVerifone Systems was down 4.4 percent at $29.70 after the payment device maker's current-quarter forecast disappointed expectations.
