In the announcement made a couple of hours ago, Google released two new Nexus models. For the first time, the company has partnered with a Chinese manufacturer, namely Huawei. The other model is made by LG, which has been a Nexus maker for many years. Sponsored Links \nFirst up is the Nexus 5X. This particular model is not as powerful as the Huawei Nexus 6P, yet it comes with enough punch to handle most tasks. Although the body is made out of plastic, the phone looks pretty well built. It comes with Snapdragon 808 hexa-core chipset under the hood with 2GB of RAM and 16GB/ 32GB of storage options. The display up front is of 5.2-inches which is quite compact, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080p. At the back, the Nexus 5X comes with a new camera, a 12.3MP Sony sensor with 1.55 micron pixels and f/2.0 aperture. This should reportedly produce better low light images. Up front, there is a 5MP f/2.2 aperture shooter. The battery is also decent, at 2700mAh capacity. Also, the new Nexus model will come with Google’s latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS right out of the box. \nNext up is the Huawei made Nexus 6P. It will be the flagship model in the series, featuring a much larger display, and better specs. The phone comes with a 5.7-inch display, which many consider as quite large. However, Google highlighted that the phone measures only as much as the iPhone 6S Plus in size. As for the processor, inside, you will have the controversial Snapdragon 810 chipset. However, it’s the version 2.1, which is reportedly better at managing overheating issues. This becomes necessary as the 5.7-inch display features an impressive Quad HD resolution. As for memory, you get 3GB of RAM on board with 32GB / 64GB / 128GB non-expandable storage options. \nHuawei has really focused on the looks of the device as it comes with a premium aluminum body and measures just 7.3mm. In this slim body, the company managed to pack in a large 3500mAh capacity battery, which is quite impressive. The rear camera is the same as the Nexus 5X, so you have a 12.3MP 1.55 micron pixel sensor. The front camera, however, is upgraded to 8MP. \nBoth the models come with the new USB Type-C port. Also, for the first time, the new Nexus models have a fingerprint sensor, aka Nexus Imprint at the back. This particular sensor is faster than most competitors and can unlock the device directly from sleep unlike Apple and Samsung phones. \nNexus 5X will be available for sale today itself, for a price tag of $379 for the base, 16GB model, and $429 for the 32GB version. On the other hand, the Huawei Nexus 6P will start at $499 for the 32GB model, $549 for the 64GB and goes all the way up to $649 for the 128GB version.
