Nor has it been through the Liberal party room.\nThis means that any aspect of it could now be reconsidered.\nAdvertisement Given Mr Morrison and Ms O'Dwyer will have their names on the inquiry response, they may decide to go through the work of their predecessors with a fine-tooth comb. At the very least, the new treasury team and their advisers will want sufficient time to get their heads around the detail of the response as prepared. But they may choose to open up some areas for a deeper look at how particular conclusions were reached.\nIt also seems likely that the new Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Christopher Pyne, will want to understand the response to Murray's recommendations on innovation, given the new Prime Minister's desire for innovation policy to be co-ordinated across government .\nSo the release of the FSI response could be delayed by at least a month, and potentially longer depending on how many responses to the 44 recommendations the new team wishes to re-examine.\nPlethora of issues on the table\nSo what are the issues the new treasury team will find in their in-tray?\nA selection of the key ones include: Should the purpose of superannuation be defined in legislation? Should self-managed super funds be continued to allow to borrow to buy property? Should selection of default superannuation funds be opened up to a more competitive process and taken out of the industrial system? Should the corporate regulator get new powers to change the design of bank products? Should banks be stopped from describing marketing material as \"general advice\" and be forced to disclose their ownership of brokers and advisers?\nWhile the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has already moved to implement Murray's recommendations on bank capital , forcing a spate of equity capital raisings by the big banks in recent months, the only part of the inquiry that has been the subject of government legislation is its call for super funds to have one third of their boards made up of independent directors, including an independent chair. Ms O'Dwyer will now have responsibility to see the Trustee Governance Bill through the Senate.\nMr Frydenberg also pushed forward several other key aspects of the FSI, including a deal with the life insurance industry to cut in half commissions for selling retail life insurance, and improving professional and education standards for financial advisers. Yet while these issues were pulled out of the inquiry report in order to be accelerated, finalisation of the details were ultimately always reliant on the holistic government response to the report.\nIndustry sources suggested it is unlikely that the new treasury team will interfere with areas where consultations have already taken place. One of these is whether super trustees should be required to pre-select a \"comprehensive income product in retirement\" for members unless they choose otherwise, which could include deferred annuities in a post-retirement version of MySuper. A public consultation for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to be funded by industry was also announced by Mr Frydenberg, along with a capability review of ASIC.\nBanks on the backfoot\nThe government was expected to go further in its FSI response by granting ASIC new powers based on those used by the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain. These will allow the regulator to require amendments to bank product marketing, restrict distribution or, potentially, ban products, without suspected breaches of laws. The government may also adopt the inquiry's call for a targeted and principles-based \"product design and distribution obligation\" to be imposed on banks.\nIt seems likely that the banks will be in the ear of Ms O'Dwyer about the design of such powers, given their concerns about how they might be targeted by ASIC and fears they might stifle innovation.\nIt is understood the government response to the FSI was also planning to stop banks from describing marketing material as \"general advice\" and forcing banks to more clearly disclose their ownership of financial advisers and mortgage brokers.\nTwo of the more contentious issues that will require Ms O'Dwyer's consideration are whether the government should define the purpose of superannuation in law as being to provide an individual with an income in retirement. This was recommended to limit ad hoc superannuation policy-making but may also be seen as a precursor to limiting superannuation tax concessions, which are considered more generous than is necessary to ensure a comfortable retirement.\nThe second highly contentious issue is whether a new, competitive process to allocate default superannuation fund members to high-performing superannuation funds should be established, which would break the link between union-negotiated awards and superannuation by stripping the Fair Work Commission of its role in selecting default funds.\nIt is possible that these issues could be carved out of the FSI response, allowing them to be dealt with over a longer timeframe without delaying the release of the rest of the document.\nActing sooner rather than later\nThere are two reasons to think that Mr Morrison and Ms O'Dwyer will move relatively quickly to finalise and release the government response to the FSI.\nOne is that Mr Frydenberg adopted a highly consultative approach to the final report, conducting detailed consultations with all sides of the industry on many of the issues before finalising the government response. He was advised by high-quality staff and personally took a hand-on approach to working through the detail. This should provide confidence for Ms O'Dwyer that the hard thinking on the policy detail has been done in a thorough and trustworthy manner.\nThe second reason is the government has plenty on its plate one year out from a federal election, especially in tax policy, which Ms O'Dwyer will also have responsibility for. It would therefore seem prudent for the new treasury team to release the FSI response as soon as possible, which will enable them to focus on the tax white paper and building an electoral consensus for tax reform in the new year.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/how-malcolm-turnbull-and-lucy-turnbull-will-give-fintech-a-boost-20150919-gjqm8g", "http://www.afr.com/news/politics/malcolm-turnbulls-cabinet-talking-about-a-revolution-20150920-gjqtoa", "http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/expect-more-capital-raisings-from-the-banks-20150914-gjm58d"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:58:23.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
