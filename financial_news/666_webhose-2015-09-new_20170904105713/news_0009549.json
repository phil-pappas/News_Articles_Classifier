Koh had rejected an earlier $US324.5 million settlement of the case reached in 2014 as inadequate. The lawsuit accused Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe Systems of forming a secret cartel that agreed not to recruit each other's workers. Lawyers for the employees argued the pact illegally suppressed the wages of the affected technology workers.
