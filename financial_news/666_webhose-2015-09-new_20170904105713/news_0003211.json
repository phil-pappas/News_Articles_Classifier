I expect the RBA to reinforce the notion that they have shifted to a neutral stance.\" \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* 71.20 US cents, from 70.61 cents on Friday \n* 85.88 Japanese yen, from 85.22 yen \n* 62.77 euro cents, from 62.59 euro cents \n* 112.50 New Zealand cents, from 112.81 NZ cents \n* 46.08 British pence, from 45.73 pence \nGovernment bond yields: \n* CGS 5.5pct Jan 2018, 1.859pct, from 1.853pct on Friday \n* CGS 4.25pct April 2026, 2.796pct, from 2.808pct \nSydney Futures Exchange prices: \n* The September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.243 (implying a yield of 2.757 per cent), up from 97.230 (2.770 per cent) on Friday. \n* The September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.090 (1.910 per cent), up/down from 98.095 (1.905 per cent). @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T05:53:15.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
