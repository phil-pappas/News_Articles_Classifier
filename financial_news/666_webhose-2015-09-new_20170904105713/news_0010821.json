This could be a dampener for the lakhs of salaried class who eagerly wait for their monthly pay.\nAbout 13 lakhs employed at 24 state-run banks, eleven private banks, nine foreign banks and 56 regional rural banks and 650 cooperative banks will go on strike. This would mean about 1,00,000 bank branches would remain closed.\nPeople can withdraw from ATM’S, as they are managed by third-party private firms who will not be part of the nationwide strike. But, if the machines run out of cash, they will not be replenished, due to lack of bank staff to give them cash.\nClearing of cheques and loan documentation will also be affected, as the work is done at the branches.\nOnly respite is that internet banking will work, because the Reserve Bank of India’s clearing will remain open.\nEmployee unions at State Bank of India are not participating in the strike on Wednesday. SBI bank branches will remain open, giving a major relief to salaried class.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 8:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:10:30.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
