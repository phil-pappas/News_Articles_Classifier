As many look to the week ahead for directional signs of what the Feds might do when they meet again in October, there is enough documentation to support their hesitation to raise the rates. Mortgage rates continue to be at historically low levels but consumer demand appears stalled. This is attributed to newcomers in the employment sector not fully seasoned to take on the role of home buyers. \nLoan applications down, mortgage rates up \nLoan applications decreased in week over week data as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. The 7% dip is pretty significant but not enough to create unnecessary worry. As we head into fall many families have settled in for the school year and by all accounts will be taking a welcomed breather before the holiday season. \nMortgage rates inched up a hair but even that metric is well within trends which typically bounce around an eighth to a quarter of a percent and in some cases one-half a percent. What the data shows is a calm financial environment. \nWhile our outlook incorporates a moderate increase in mortgage rates over the next 18 months, rates are likely to remain low by historical standards and should not be a determining factor for most Americans looking to purchase a home.\" Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac \nUnemployment back to pre-crisis levels \nMortgage rates as well as applications are based on sustained consumer activity. Since the housing crisis which started in 2008, the unemployment rate has rebounded and sits now at pre-crisis levels. That is another reason why some insisted raising the Fed rate was a prudent decision. Very few provide arguments on why a rate increase will not eventually happen. However, most agree timing is everything. In the week ahead it is more critical to understand consumer demand will increase based on more people who are employed and participating in the economy and this will be an important factor in projecting that rates will inch upwards in correlation to week to week reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:42:18.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
