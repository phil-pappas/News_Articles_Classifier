Good luck getting your tax refund.That’s the problem 64-year-old John P. McManus, one of Ireland's richest, is facing. He won the money in 2012, so he filed a non-resident 2012 U.S. federal income tax return setting forth the gambling winnings, the amount withheld by the IRS and his entitlement to a refund based on a straightforward international tax treaty claim.What’s the hold up? McManus’ tax return was selected for audit in May, 2014. Then, in August 2014, the IRS approved his refund claim. But one month later the claim was remanded to another department for additional review. Since then, the IRS has taken no action on the claim.So McManus has sued the U.S., seeking a refund of the $5.22 million federal income taxes withheld by the IRS. “It’s a shame we had to resort to this particular approach, but if the IRS stonewalls you, you have no resort but to take this action,” says his lawyer, Houston-based celebrity litigator Terry Giles . “The IRS knows what the law is; it’s really pretty straightforward and simple,” Giles added.[caption id=\"attachment_12786\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] John P.

McManus, known for his race horses and business interests around the world, sought out Giles who has been in the news himself lately for putting presidential candidate Ben Carson’s team together (he says he’s now busy organizing super PACs for them). It wasn’t horses that brought in the winnings; Giles said absentmindedly, he thought it was either backgammon or poker, as if a $17.4 million win wasn’t a big deal. The case, McManus v. U.S., filed August 31, 2015, is before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Gambling income is taxable in the view of the IRS, so you must report winnings as income on your tax return in the U.S. That’s what McManus did. But in McManus’ case, since he is a citizen and resident of Ireland, his gambling winnings are exempt from taxation in the U.S., he claims.The reason: a treaty between the U.S. and Ireland, signed at Dublin on July 28, 1997, designed “for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains.” It’s a pretty good deal. Earned income outside of Ireland is generally not subject to Ireland’s provincial income tax structure. Instead, McManus is subject to an Ireland domicile levy, a flat tax of €200,000 that applies to any Irish domiciliary whose world-wide income exceeds €1 million and whose Irish property is greater in value than €5 million and whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than €200,000. (The domicile levy was introduced in 2010).McManus’ hometown is Limerick, Ireland; he has other homes, including one in Barbados reportedly worth €150 million (he also is a part owner in the island’s luxe Sandy Lane Hotel where he golfs with buddy Tiger Woods). So waiting a little longer for his refund isn’t going to hurt his lifestyle.In addition to the tax refund, the complaint also seeks pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, attorneys’ fees and other relief. That will be subject to negotiations, Giles says. The IRS has until October 30 th to respond or file for an extension, but he hopes the complaint will force the IRS to move the file upstream to the right person.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/22/ben-carsons-colorful-campaign-chief-a-k-a-richard-pryors-attorney/"], "published": "2015-09-02T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:28:19.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
