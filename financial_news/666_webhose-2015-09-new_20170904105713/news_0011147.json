Fourteen such campaigns were launched since January, data from FactSet Shark Repellent show - three less than a post-crisis record set in 2013. \n\"With U.S. valuations in general 25 percent higher than those in Japan or Europe, it was only a matter of time until Europe came into focus,\" said Neil Dwane, chief investment officer at Frankfurt-based Allianz Global Investors. \nDwane said the European corporate sector has yet to recover from the financial crisis. \n\"The sector has a lot of 'self-help' earnings potential across most of its industries,\" Dwane said, adding that the only exception was the pharmaceuticals industry and the consumer staples sector. \nU.S. activist ValueAct reported a 5.44 percent holding in engine maker Rolls-Royce in July. The influential San Francisco-based activist, which has invested in Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) and American Express (Swiss: AXP.SW - news ) , is now Rolls Royce (LSE: RR.L - news ) 's largest shareholder, and according to media reports, is also investing in British engineering group, Smiths. \nActivist advisors interviewed by Reuters say lower valuations and the U.K. corporate governance code make it an enticing target for activists. \nUK industrial companies worth more than $500 million - as one example - have on average, a pre-tax return on equity of 0.19 percent, Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data show, compared with 0.23 percent for the U.S. sector. \nThe UK corporate governance code is also more shareholder friendly than the U.S. version, both in terms of disclosure requirements and the ability to nominate board directors, the advisors say. \nU.S. EXPORT \nThe amount that U.S. activists spend on foreign campaigns is still a tiny fraction of what they allocate domestically. \nBut corporate targets in the U.K., Japan and Canada are increasingly in the cross-hairs. Elliot Associates took on U.K. financial services group Alliance Trust earlier this year, and Third Point just bought a nearly $1 billion stake in Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp.. \n\"If you look beyond Europe, Japan's corporate governance rules are likely to change, which is one of the mandates of the Abenomics agenda. We expect to see more activist activity there,\" said Ajay Khorana, Global Co-Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) of Citi's Financial Strategy and Solutions Group (Other OTC: SOLU - news ) . \nActivist assets reached $129.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015, a 177 percent increase from 2010, J.P. Morgan (Other OTC: MGHL - news ) said in a research note last month, citing Hedge Fund Research. \nThat increase tracked a surge of campaigns and index-beating investment returns for activists. But this year, U.S. returns have taken a hit, which may add to the incentive of going farther afield: since launching in April, the S&P Activist Interest Index has a negative 14.67 percent annual return. \n(Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:42:08.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
