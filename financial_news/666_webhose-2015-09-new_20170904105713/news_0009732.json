Hence, cognizant of this fact citizens must back up the implementation of the strategies mapped out in the conference! \nWeeding out malpractices, allowing good governance send deeper roots is what EPRDF intends to put under the spotlight. The front has meticulously assessed and properly identified both strengths and loopholes regarding good governance. In the brainstorming conference, it has passed a decision to better satisfy service-seeking citizens and as to what must be done towards that end. \n\"Though directions were set previously to pave ways for good governance they were not that successful in crystallizing sought-for results. Cognizant of this fact a system will be put in place to strengthen accountability. Follow up and support will be made a point to ward off opportunistic mind bent among administrative bodies at every echelon,\" said Demeke Mekonene,who was elected vice president of the Front for the second time. \nGood governance, to the required level, could ensue if and only if nurtured with conviction. Letting development oriented outlooks sink in, charting out strategies helpful in fighting out self-seeking mentality and building capacity are tasks that will enjoy focal attention by the Front. \nThe Growth and Transformation Plan two GTPII, due to be implemented in the course of the coming five years, could hit its target only if bolstered by good governance. \nRegarding the aforementioned issue the role of the mass media is indispensable. In the effort underway to put in place tighter accountability, the mass media people are charged with the responsibility of sensitizing and galvanizing the public. They as well are expected to drag out improprieties into light for public ridicule and corrective measures. Moreover they are duty bound to carry across accurate and clear information to the public. \nBusinessmen too are expected to discharge their citizenry role by tipping pertinent bodies upon facing clues that could create hotbeds for maladministration. \nThe conference had ascribed the loopholes in the GTP one ( GTPI) to the maladministration problem that was highly manifest in the service sector among others. Drawing lessons from GTPI, it has charted promising ways forward for GTPII. \nEPRDF that clearly indicated rent seeking as the undercurrent factor for several problems had also underlined the furtherance of the developmental democratic line that precipitated in the renaissance journey. It has set a direction to quickly change the rent-seeking political economy with developmental political economy. It has passed a decision to root out the rent-seeking psychological make up lurking in some sectors vulnerable to corruption. Organizations that handle land administration and tax collection as well as procurement on the government's behalf are the ones' that will fall under the government's inspection radar and follow up work.e conference had capitalized on the need to replicate, both in towns and far flung corners of the country, the astounding achievement portrayed i \nMindful of the fact that both the rapid development that is crystallizing and some hurdles that crop up in the process lean on the strength and weakness of the party, works must be done to fight out internal antidemocratic sentiments and to address factors for possible lack of popular support. Imbued with democratization in internal set up, upgrading the political and ideological maturity is also entailed in the task intended to be implemented. \nThe conference had capitalized on the need to replicate, both in towns and far flung corners of the country, the astounding achievement portrayed in natural resource and environment protection activities utilizing the development army created. Similar feat must be observed in livestock development, irrigation and urban development. A concord is also reached on stepping up works on the creation of a development army. \nThough during the past twelve years it was made possible to register a two digit economic growth the country has not yet fully unshackled itself from poverty and it can't ensure food self sufficiency at household level. \nA plan is envisaged to register a rapid,consecutive and across the board economic growth in GTPII. Emphasis will be given to the moves that bolster the economy in GTPII. Such as in saving,investment and fully utilizing generated economy. \nThere is also a call for filling gaps in foreign trade and giving a lasting solution to problems revolving around reform army. \nTo redress the unemployment problem manifest in towns and cities widening investment opportunities, encouraging the private sector, is an issue accorded due attention in the conference. Every stakeholder in this regard must play its due role. \nYes the country must always strive for a better tomorrow.
