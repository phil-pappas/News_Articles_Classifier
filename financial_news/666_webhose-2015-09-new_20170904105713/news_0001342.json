One suggestion is that he heads off to his friends among the oil emirates and raises a very, very serious amount of new and likely discounted equity. Andrey Rudakov by Matthew Stevens Suddenly Ivan Glasenberg is no longer a paper billionaire and Glencore, the shiny global product of his acumen and ambition, sits on the cusp of a crisis so deep that its very survival is now a matter of serious debate.\nGlencore closed at another record post-float low of 74p ($1.62) in Monday's trading .\nThe real worry about that is that there was no specific negative news flow that might justify the overweight belting delivered in another generally unhappy day for everyone making a living in the commodities cycle .\nGlencore was valued at $US60 billion ($86 billion) when it floated four years ago. When the London market closed on Monday its market capitalisation stood at $US16 billion. And at least one reputable UK advisory has warned clients that at current commodities prices Glencore's real value might be \"zero\" .\nGlencore's problem is the same today as it was when Glasenberg stunned the market in early September with a humiliating back-flip that involved an emergency $US2.5 billion equity raising and confirmation a $US10.2 billion savings program that started with immediate cutbacks in copper production.\nGlasenberg's people are sitting on $US50 billion of debt and the market has pretty much no confidence at all that the company can afford that pile of other people's money or that the initiatives announced to reduce it will generate any material improvement in the company's circumstances.\nGlencore's fate rests firmly with the hedge funds that have made such a lot of money shorting the stock for a year or so and so far Glasenberg has been unable to offer the market the quality of response that might loosen that death-grip. The result is a plummeting share price and news waves of rumours that some of Glencore's long-only investors are now looking to \"get out at any price\".\nGlencore's debt is traditionally divided into two large chunks. To reduce the complex to the brutally simple, Glencore carries $US30 billion of debt against the assets of the business and another $US20 billion that supports the legacy trading operations that once sat at the heart of Glasenberg's empire.\n Until very recently indeed, Glasenberg had convinced the market to assess this commodity trading position as liquidity rather than debt. But it is this forgotten pile that is now the real concern for Glencore.\nConfidence in Glencore collapsed after it missed its half year numbers in August. As a result there has been an increased effort across equity and debt markets to identify and understand the points of vulnerability on the company's balance sheet. But it has become apparent that the market does not really know how to value the commodities marketing, distribution and trading businesses. And that matters when investors are being asked to believe that the trading positions that support $US20 billion of debt are both liquid and in-the-money.\nFor the record, it is understood that there are no share price triggers for any of that debt and that Glencore debt covenants are based on net debt rather than the gross number. This proposition, of itself, speaks to how successful Glasenberg has been able to sell this idea that the trading debt is somehow different to any other debt.\nAnd there's the rub. Some of Australia's most senior miners worry that Glencore might be out of the money in very large commodity trading positions that have already matured or are about to.\nThe risk is that some subsidiaries within the trading business are already in default of the terms of their lending and that this could cascade through the business, triggering at best a serious credit squeeze and, at worst, a collapse that would leave Glencore in the hands of its bond holders.\nIt is not just the equity markets that are repricing the risk of Glencore. The debt markets are making similarly harsh assessment with Glencore's five year senior credit default surging to 550 basis points. This means the market it betting there is a better than one-in-four chance of default at some point over the next five years. And that is disastrous for a miner and trader that has arrived as a concerted low point of the commodities cycle carrying too much debt.\nThe markets plainly no longer believe that Glencore has done enough in raising equity, suspending dividends for 18 months or flagging assets sales that might now include marketing maybe half of its grains business.\nThere is talk Glencore might sell other crown jewels like its Latin American copper twins, Antamina and Collahuasi. They could make maybe $US4 billion each. But that doesn't look like it will enough either.\nSo how does Glasenberg get out of this? Well, one suggestion is that he heads off to his friends among the oil emirates and raises a very, very serious amount of new and likely discounted equity.\n\"He is made of extremely stern stuff,\" a very senior Australian miner suggested in the wake of Monday's share price spanking. \"He will take this right down to the wire. But if he is out of the money in his trading positions, and that is what the market is indicating it believes, then he is going to have to find a new shareholder and accept the risk of that control might slip to his owners.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:09:53.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
