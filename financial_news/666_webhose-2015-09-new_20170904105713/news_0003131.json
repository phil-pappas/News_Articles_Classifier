The clearance came after a review of the roofing conditions in cooperation with stadium builder Mortenson Construction and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, the company said. \nJeramie Gruber, a 35-year-old member of the Roofers & Waterproofers Local 96 and employee of North St. Paul-based Berwald, died Aug. 26 after a 50-foot fall while working on the stadium’s roof. \nAnother Berwald worker, who hasn’t been identified, “suffered a deep cut on his leg, requiring 48 stitches and staples” and has been released from Hennepin County Medical Center, Berwald said. \nA report from Minnesota OSHA said last week that the two roofers “fell and slid down the roof” while installing a solid roof and that one of the workers struck a post and was injured. The other “broke through a guardrail and fell onto an elevated platform below,” the report stated. OSHA continues to investigate. \n“We have continued to feel the loss of an exceptional employee and offer our sincerest condolences to Jeramie Gruber’s family and friends,” company president Eugene Berwald said in a statement Thursday. \n“Berwald Roofing Inc. remains committed to cooperating with investigators as they work to determine the incident’s cause. The safety of our employees will continue to be our highest priority,” the statement continued.
