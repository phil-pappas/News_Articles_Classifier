In six of the 30 postal districts, houses were £125,000 more expensive than the local county average. More Chart that tells a story — Rental growth \nLloyds highlighted the property premium around Beaconsfield High School, where homes were going for £636,132 — 186 per cent higher than the average in adjacent areas. \nOther hotspots include the streets around Henrietta Barnett School in Barnet, with a 76 per cent premium, St Olave’s and St Saviour’s Grammar School in Orpington (64 per cent) and the Tiffin schools in Kingston upon Thames (28 per cent). \nAndrew Mason, Lloyds Bank mortgages director, said: “The presence of a top-performing state school appears to help support property values in many of these locations as parents compete with other buyers to land the property that gives their child the best possible chance to attend their chosen school.” \nThe Lloyds Bank House Prices and Schools Review looked at prices in the districts around the 30 top-performing secondary state schools in England and the top 10 performing secondary state schools in each region, judged by last year’s GCSE results and data from Land Registry. \nHowever, not all top schools were surrounded by high-priced homes. Property around Aylesbury High School, Reading School and Kendrick School were lower than the county average. \nAcross all 30 postal districts of top-performing schools, the average house price was 9.2 times average gross annual earnings, compared to 7.7 times average gross annual earnings across England as a whole. \nHouses around Henrietta Barnett School in Barnet and Beaconsfield High School were the least affordable in the ranking, with average prices of £971,882 and £978,299 respectively. The most affordable were around the King Edward VI Five Ways School in West Midlands, with a house price to earnings ratio of 4.7 and an average price of £138,759.
