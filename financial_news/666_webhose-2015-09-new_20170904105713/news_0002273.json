We, therefore, expect them to work during that time,\" said Dr Kivilu. \nDr Kivilu added that teachers are not employees of their unions but of government. \nThe Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination assessment for oral and practical examinations is scheduled to begin on September 28. \nThe Standard Eight examination will start on November 10 and end on November 12, while theory papers start on October 12, nine days earlier than usual. The Form Four tests usually begin on the Tuesday after Mashujaa Day -- October 20. \nThe government delay in disbursement of about Sh3 billion to schools could also complicate the matter for practical examinations as school heads have complained that they have no money to buy specimens. \nDr Kivilu said the examination dates were adjusted in consultation with the ministry of Education earlier in the year and the matter is not as a result of the teachers' strike. \nHe said the examinations will not be postponed, a position that was reinforced by Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi earlier. \n\"Students who will be sitting the examination completed their syllabus in the second term. They were to use third term for revision,\" said Prof Kaimenyi. \nHowever, Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary-general Wilson Sossion said teachers have withdrawn their labour, including participating in marking national examinations. \n\"We have made it clear that we will not participate in the examination exercise,\" said Mr Sossion. \nHe said it was sad that the government was planning to administer an examination to students who have not been taught. \n\"The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education candidates needed to have been taught for a month and a half while primary school candidates needed two months. The curriculum is not complete and you want them to sit an exam yet they are not ready?\" asked Mr Sossion. \nHe went on: \"What will be the credibility of those exams? It will be against international standards and such certificates can be rejected.\" \nSimilar sentiments were echoed by Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers chairman Omboko Milemba. \nMr Milemba demanded that Knec suspends indefinitely all national examinations \"because no adequate preparations have been made for the students\". \n\"No teacher will supervise or mark the examinations, meaning examinations will be substandard in administration, supervision and marking,\" said Mr Milemba. \nOn Friday, the government closed down all public and private schools except Class Eight and Form Four students. \nThe Cabinet later directed the examinations copuncil to continue with preparations for the 2015 examinations as scheduled. \nThe council has already started briefing field officers to be involved in the administration of examinations. \n\"This will take place from October 5-10,\" said Dr Kivilu. \nHe added that county directors of education will communicate on appropriate venues for the sampled sub-counties. \nHe said that this year, Knec registered 937,467 candidates for KCPE compared to 889,163 in 2014, an increase of 48,304 candidates, representing a 5.43 per cent increase. \nFor KCSE, the council registered 525,802 candidates compared to 485,547 in 2014, an increase of 40,255 candidates, representing an 8.3 per cent increase. \nDr Kivilu said there will be 1,070 distribution centres for KCPE and 845 for KCSE. \nHe added that the programme for assessment of orals and practical examinations have been finalised and the respective sub-counties and institutions have been informed.
