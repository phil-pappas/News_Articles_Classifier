This Investor Strategy May Require Your Atonement Written by: Ellen Chang 09/14/15 - 11:21 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Amid the recent stock market correction and continued volatility which left many investors skittish, some are now pondering their current investment strategy. \nThis week could prove to be trickier as the Federal Reserve is set to meet and could decide to raise interest rates in nearly a decade. Other investors could fall prey to the belief that certain holidays can influence the outcome of the market with the arrival of Rosh Hashanah. \nOne saying for equities on Wall Street has historically been to “sell Rosh Hashanah, buy Yom Kippur.” Sometimes even a \"sell Passover\" gets added to the mix. As the Jewish High Holidays are set to start, the mantra is derived from the fact that with “many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum,” wrote Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac and Almanac Investor newsletter.
