As Femara of Novartis is priced two times higher than local products, its sales volume only accounted for less than 50% of the sum despite its market share of 73.62% in 2014. The gradual decrease in Novatis's market share, however, constitutes a great opportunity for local enterprises. Currently, there are only two kinds of letrozole available in the Chinese market, indicating a high entry barrier and a large market. \nStudies have shown the uniqueness of breast cancer in China: special fertility pattern due to family planning as well as modern lifestyle like high-fat diet and little exercise increases the risk of breast cancer. \nIt is expected that letrozole will enjoy a vast demand in China. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1 Related Concepts of Letrozole \n2 Market Profile of Letrozole in China \n3 Survey on Letrozole Sales in China, 2010-2014 \n4 Survey on Market Share of Major Letrozole Manufacturers in China, 2010-2014 \n5 Survey on Dosage Forms of Letrozole in China, 2010-2014 \n6 Reference Price of Letrozole in Chinese Hospitals in 2014 \n7 Major Manufacturers of Letrozole in Chinese Market, 2010-2014 \n8 Market Outlook of Letrozole in China, 2015-2019 \nCompanies Mentioned \n- Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd \n- Novartis AG \nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5dlcmp/investigation \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150908006147/en/ \nContact: Research and Markets\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com \nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nSector: Pharmaceuticals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T08:59:20.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
