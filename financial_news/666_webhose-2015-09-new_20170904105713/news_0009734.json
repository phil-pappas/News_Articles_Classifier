Earlier in the day, the currency fell as much 1.5 percent after newspapers Folha de S.Paulo and Valor Economico reported that Levy was isolated and frustrated by a budget bill submitted on Monday.\nThat budget bill was Brazil's first ever to forecast a primary deficit, highlighting Levy's failure to shore up federal accounts in an effort to save the country's investment-grade rating.\nPlanning Minister Nelson Barbosa, who has gained influence in economic policy as Levy's austerity agenda makes enemies in Congress and other ministries, has defended the deficit projection in recent days as a sign of transparency and realism.\nA finance ministry spokeswoman confirmed Levy's meeting with Rousseff on Thursday, but declined to say what the meeting was about. Levy is maintaining travel plans for Spain and France early next week, she added.
