Many notable manufacturers have announced new devices and some have showcased existing ones to a number of journalists and tech lovers. Sony was also present at the event and announced its new range of Xperia Z5 family of smartphones. The highlight announcement of the event was none other than the Xperia Z5 Premium, the most powerful smartphone from the company till date. Sponsored Links \nIt was rumored that the Z5 Premium was going to sport the world’s first 4K smartphone display. And this rumor came true yesterday as the company showcased the Z5 Premium with a massive resolution of 4K. Many would argue the advantages of having a 4K resolution display, but Sony says that it makes sense. According to the company, at present most flagships come with a maximum resolution of 2K. However, there isn’t 2K content in the market that users can enjoy. Instead, majority of the high resolution content are in 4K resolution which makes perfect sense to use such a high resolution on a 5.5-inch smartphone display. \nAnother highlight of the Xperia Premium is the 23MP shooter at the back. The company has made sure that users get the perfect picture with Hybrid Autofocus (0.03 sec). The Sony Exmor RS CMOS sensor makes sure that the pictures have high sensitivity and low noise. The rear camera can capture 4K videos with 8MP resolution still shots in between as well. This also makes the camera perfect for low light photos. Up front, there’s a 5.1MP camera ideal for selfies. It can take 1080p FHD videos as well. \nUnder the hood, the phone features the Snapdragon 810 octa-core chip with 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, further expandable up to 200GB. There’s a non-removable 3430mAh battery at the back, which the company claims is enough for more than a day’s usage. This is possible because of the various power saving techniques uses by the device. Also, the Xperia Premium supports fast charging QC 2.0, which means users can get up to 60% charge within 30 minutes. \nThe phone is pretty slim measuring just 7.8mm. As for the weight, it’s a bit on the heavy side, especially because of that mirror like body. The phone weighs about 180 grams. Naturally, being a flagship it supports 4G LTE networks but comes with just one Nano SIM card slot. Finally, like most Xperia series smartphones, the Xperia Premium will be IP68 certified, which means it will be water proof and dustproof. \nThe phone is expected to retail for a hefty price tag of $780 unlocked. Expect more availability and pricing details in the coming weeks.
