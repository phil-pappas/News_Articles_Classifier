To combat that, Rajan formally adopted inflation targeting earlier this year, in the biggest monetary policy overhaul in decades.\nBut his caution is frustrating Delhi and corporate India, which say the 7.25% rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks is too high for a recovering economy.\nTaking into account consumer inflation, India's real interest rates were 3.59% in August, the second highest month on record after the 3.79% in November 2014, according to Thomson Reuters calculations.\nAt the wholesale price inflation level, real interest rates are even higher, hitting a record 12.2% in August.\nHigh effective interest rates drag on GDP growth, which is seen at the lower end of an 8.1% to 8.5% target in the current financial year.\nThe government's chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, told Reuters on Wednesday the economy would hit target, even without extra fiscal stimulus.\n\"Monetary policy will ease in line with ... inflation,\" he added. \"We have had three cuts, the year is not over, so that still holds.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T21:51:34.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
