He, however, had not responded to the e-mailed questions at the time of going to press. \nMushohwe, according to sources, was also reportedly unhappy with what he perceived as interference from other ministers in the operations of his former ministry. \nInvestors have regularly voiced their worries over inconsistencies in the policy framework with various top government officials making contradictory public pronouncements and even clashing over the Act. Former indigenisation minister Francis Nhema's once complained that there were \"too many cooks\" managing the programme. \nRemarks made by Zhuwao in an interview that foreign direct investment (FDI) could co-exist with the current indigenisation laws have caused further confusion as it is in stark contrast to pronouncements by his colleagues in government. \n\"Why is it that there is a feeling that indigenisation and FDI are opposites? They are not necessarily opposites. I believe indigenisation can work quite well with FDI,\" said Zhuwao before accusing some ministers of being pro-white people. \n\"I think we just need to educate some of our ignorant colleagues some of whom actually occupy high-level positions. They need to go beyond accepting what a white man tells them,\" Zhuwao said. \n\"Some of these people are educated to the level of having PhDs; so they need to go beyond what somebody who has come in as a foreigner or somebody who has come in trying to negotiate the best possible deal for themselves is saying and look at the facts. \n\"It is really a shame that we have got people in high places who are really antagonistic to facts.\" \nSenior government officials from Mugabe to the bottom have expressed contradictory and clashing interpretations of the policy.
