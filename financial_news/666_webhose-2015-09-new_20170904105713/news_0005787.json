WSJ Logistics Report’s Loretta Chao writes that trucking companies need more computer-savvy technicians and mechanics to work on the increasingly sophisticated engines behind today’s vehicles. That sounds like a good fit for a generation of young workers brought up on technology, but it’s not working out that way. Industry experts say negative perceptions about trucking as a career option are sending potential hires to other professions. The industry’s changing needs reflect similar changes throughout supply chains, where there is a growing premium on the ability to work with developing digital technologies. There certainly are the jobs to fill: a trucking group estimates that companies will struggle to fill more than 100,000 technician jobs over the next seven years.\nThere’s little chance the U.S. Congress will come up with new money for highways, but the Obama administration is trying to speed along the spending that has been approved. The WSJ’s Amy Harding writes the White House unveiled a package of initiatives aimed at streamlining approval of infrastructure projects . The changes, which don’t require new money or approval from Congress, are aimed at ensuring that the various government agencies often involved in a single infrastructure review are coordinating better and faster. That will be good news to businesses and state governments involved in road projects that have not had much to cheer in Washington lately. Congress is facing an Oct. 29 deadline for the expiration of the law allowing infrastructure spending and there’s little to suggest a long-term measure will be on the table.\nInnovation may not be all that it’s cracked up to be , at least if supply chains aren’t in the mix. WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that a new report suggests that c onsumer goods companies aren’t considering the supply chain impact of the many changes they make to products to stir sales . Terra Technology, a retail forecasting software provider, reached the conclusion after a survey showed the number of new products on shelves has soared by 32% since 2010 while overall sales of surveyed companies has expanded only 4%. Chief Executive Robert Byrne says higher supply-chain costs are just one consideration when companies adjust packaging, introduce new flavors and otherwise tweak goods to get consumer interest. Those changes often add up to supply-chain complexity, which can undermine the goals of product innovation.\nTRANSPORTATION ENLARGE A trucking industry official says there are “a minimum of eight computer systems” on the latest heavy-duty tractors. Photo: Bloomberg News Was August just a shipping industry “breather?” WSJ Logistics Report’s Robbie Whelan writes that freight tonnage hauled by truck drivers cooled during the month, with the American Trucking Associations’ For-Hire Truck Tonnage Index slipping 0.9% after a robust gain in July . The group notes that inventories surged earlier in the summer and that many companies may be pausing in stocking up for the fall. There certainly appears to be confidence in the air. Transportation equipment research group FTR reported that orders for new truck trailers rose 15% in August. And in the near-term, strong volume numbers from ports in August suggest that the inventory buildup is already resuming.\nWork to build 16 giant, icebreaking carriers to move liquefied-natural-gas from the Arctic is picking up speed. The WSJ’s Costas Paris and Selina Williams report that Greece-based Dynagas Ltd. is teaming up with Chinese shipping giants China LNG Shipping Co. and Sinotrans Shipping Ltd. to order five tankers, pushing along the big international effort . The deal will ease concerns that the development of the plan to move the commodity from the massive Yamal LNG project in Siberia to Europe and Asia may be delayed by sanctions against Russia. The shipping portion of the project now takes in operators from Greece, China, Russia and Japan, and the result will be a big new supply of liquefied-natural-gas that will start moving through the ice in 2017.\nBoeing Co. is deepening its ties to China, including bringing part of its jet-manufacturing supply chain in the country. The WSJ’s Jon Ostrower reports that Boeing is preparing to announce during Chinese President Xi Jinping ’s U.S. visit that it will place a new factory for finishing 737 production in the country. The prospect has raised worries at Boeing’s unions, and the company is telling workers that the move won’t result in layoffs. Boeing is following Airbus Group SE in placing a big manufacturing site in China, where the market prospects are enormous. That was clear from reports in Chinese media on Wednesday that three Chinese aviation companies have struck a deal to buy 300 Boeing aircraft.\nConcerned about how Pope Francis’ visit will affect your parcel deliveries in the Northeast this week?
