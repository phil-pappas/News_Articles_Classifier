Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in New York.\n\"In the case of Venezuela we will be returning our ambassador immediately to the Co-operative Republic of Guyana,\" he said in comments broadcast over state television.\nExxon in May said it found oil in the Stabroek Block under a license granted by Guyana's government. The company has declined to comment on the dispute.\nThe Essequibo, a sparsely populated region of thick jungle, encompasses an area equivalent to around two-thirds of Guyanese territory. It functions in practice as part of Guyana and shows little discernible trace of Venezuelan cultural influence.\nGuyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the Essequibo following a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but that Venezuela later backtracked on that decision.\nVenezuela says the 1899 ruling was unfair and insists the territory is still in dispute. Maps in Venezuela usually describe the Essequibo as the \"reclamation zone.\" (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Eric Walsh )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:55:03.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
