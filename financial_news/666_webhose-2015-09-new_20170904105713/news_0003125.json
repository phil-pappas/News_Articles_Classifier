ASIC has found in some cases lease companies are levying effective interest rates of more than 800 per cent, with repayments commonly amounting to more than twice the retail price of the product.\nThe government released a consultation paper on Thursday asking whether existing restrictions on small amount credit contracts, commonly known as payday loans, should be tightened and whether the largely unregulated consumer rental market should be covered by payday loan caps.\nAdvertisement \"We will be recommending that where a client presents to a small amount lender or lease provider that has a Centrelink income there be an obligation to refer that client to a [no interest lender] if that item is essential to their survival, safety or resilience,\" Mr Mooney said.\nSmall essential loans Good Shepherd gets 70 per cent of its funds from government. It loans up to $1200 interest free for essential items and up to $3000 at 5.99 per cent.\nHe said comprehensive credit reporting (CCR) – which requires lenders to report loans and repayments, including credit cards, rather than just defaults to credit bureaus – should be mandatory for payday loans because the present restriction on borrowers having no more than two payday loans at a time is being flouted.\nBanks have been slow to contribute data under the legislation which came into effect in March 2014, however.\n\"None of the banks have embraced this capability. So we need to make it compulsory for these small amount credit contracts,\" he said.\nAt its annual results on August 31, the biggest payday lender Cash Converters said it expected minimal impact from the review.\nIts main rival Money3 is quickly moving out of short-term loans to \"medium-term loans\" with terms greater than a year. Acting chief executive, Scott Baldwin, said he wanted to keep the existing caps and restrictions, but doesn't agree with one suggestion in the paper for a database of people who have payday loans.\n\"Why should I be treated differently if I borrow $300 compared to someone who gets a mortgage?\" he said. He agrees it would be better to rely on the CCR rules.\nCall for more restrictions Thorn Group managing director James Marshall has said the lease company has been calling for more restrictions on leases to weed out smaller competitors that charge exorbitant fees and repayments.\nHowever, a note on the sector by Credit Suisse said Thorn would be the worst hit of the listed companies if caps on repayments and bans on welfare recipients were introduced.\nFlexigroup offers consumer leases and \"no interest\" loans as does GE Capital via big retailers. Once the interest free periods expire, rates are typically around 30 per cent.\nIn Australia no loans can be made for terms of less than 15 days. For loans under $2000 for terms between 16 days and 12 months, lenders cannot charge more than the equivalent of 68 per cent annual interest. This is made up of a maximum 20 per cent establishment fee and then a maximum of 4 per cent per month for ongoing fees and charges.\nPeople receiving 50 per cent of their income from welfare payments governed by the social security act cannot be forced to spend more than 20 per cent of their gross income on payday loan repayments.\nAll loans above the $2000, 12-month limit are subject to a cap of 48 per cent interest, but there are no restrictions on recipients.\nConsumer leases have no caps or restrictions on terms, interest rates or due to the fact they are receiving welfare.\nThe government paper said leases are typically taken out by people on low incomes, just as payday loans are, and many are on the dole. It referred to a study by ASIC released a study by RMIT last week that found the highest interest is paid by those with the lowest income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:22:29.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
