On an annual basis, corporate delinquencies surged 16.1 percent in August from a year earlier, Serasa said.\nOn a monthly basis, corporate defaults fell 5.7 percent in August versus July, Serasa said.\nBrazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, shrank over the past couple of quarter and is slated to contract this year and next, the first back-to-back annual contraction since the 1930s.\nHouseholds across the country are grappling with accelerating inflation and large job losses, testing the ability of companies and consumers to stay current on their financial obligations, economists said.
