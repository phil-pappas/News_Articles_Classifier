The new concentrations launched in September as part of the Business School’s emphasis on creating practical programs in growing areas of business that support students’ professional goals.\nThe MS in Finance program also has established an academic partnership with GARP, the Global Association of Risk Professionals.\nGARP conducted a thorough review of the Business School’s MS in Finance program and determined that its risk management courses are aligned with the industry’s needs and best practices. The cornerstone of GARP’s Partnership for Risk Education is the Financial Risk Manager (FRM®) program and certification examination.\nStudents taking risk management courses will be prepared to earn the elite Financial Risk Manager designation, which is valued by top employers across diverse businesses.\n“The Risk Management concentration teaches students how to manage financial risk—an obstacle that organizations face every day. Students will gain comprehensive knowledge and practical skills to address financial risk in a global industry,” said William J. O’Neill, Jr., dean of Suffolk University’s Sawyer Business School. “As future risk managers, students will learn how to help organizations respond to change and stay ahead of the competition.”\nThe Business School’s MS in Finance program, recognized by the Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) Institute, is closely tied to professional practice and covers the key concepts on the CFA Exam.\nThe Investments concentration is designed to help students earn the Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA) designation, which is widely considered the most respected investment designation in the world.\nAlumni go on to hold executive-level positions in all areas of investments, including equity, fixed income and derivatives, trading, mergers and acquisitions, structured financing and research.\nThe Corporate Finance concentration prepares students to work in all types of businesses. With an emphasis on practical skill-building, the courses teach students how to analyze and interpret large amounts of financial data, prepare financial reports, and set long-term expectations for companies. Students learn how to help businesses fund projects, manage working capital, make acquisitions, and plan for the company’s financial future.\n###\nSuffolk University, located in historic downtown Boston, with an international campus in Madrid, is a comprehensive global institution distinguished by the teaching and the intellectual contributions of its faculty.
