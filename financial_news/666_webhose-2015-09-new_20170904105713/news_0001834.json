To that end, it announced two brand-new finishes and a wide variety of new watch bands at its event yesterday, and it had all of them in the demo room for us to take a look at. \nThe biggest additions were probably the gold and rose gold versions of the Apple Watch Sport, which match the finishes on the iPhones 6S . They look about the same as the standard iPhone, iPad, and MacBook finishes do, but you’d never mistake them for the shinier, more vibrant finishes on the Apple Watch Editions. So much for tricking someone into thinking your $400 watch is a $10,000 watch. \nThere’s also a rainbow of new color options for the basic Apple Watch Sport band, from bright red and orange to more muted brown and gray. The bands bundled with the watches all have snaps that match the color and finish of the watch they come with, which is also true of the new Sport band for the black aluminum Apple Watch, though the new standalone bands all have silver pins that will match the silver watches better than the other finishes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:25:00.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
