This matches the best introductory deal previously available, offered by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank. \nThe First Direct 1st Account also includes a 15.9% APR overdraft, which is interest-free on the first £250. There's a £5 daily fee for unauthorised overdrafts. \nThe account doesn't pay interest on in-credit balances but customers are eligible for the First Direct Regular Saver, which pays a market-leading 6% AER for a year on monthly deposits of £25 to £300. \nFor those looking for interest on their current account deposits, the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank accounts pay 2% AER on the first £2,000 in the account, and for larger balances, the Santander 123 account (which has a £2 a month fee) pays up to 3% interest on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. \nPeter Harrison, head of money at MoneySupermarket, said: \"Ultimately, people need different things from their current account, some are always in credit so should look for big cash incentives and in-credit interest, but others will need to check how much they will be charged for using an overdraft. \n\"The First Direct deal is a corker as it offers both one of the biggest cash incentives we've seen for a long time, and is notoriously popular with customers wanting to be looked after.\" Watch out for charges After the first six months, 1st Account customers are charged a monthly £10 banking fee, unless they pay in £1,000 a month, or keep an average balance of more than £1,000. Additionally, people who hold some other products with First Direct can avoid the monthly charge. \nShould you switch to the 1st Account and decide you're not happy with the service, First Direct is unique in offering you another £100 if you leave within a year of joining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:01:43.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
