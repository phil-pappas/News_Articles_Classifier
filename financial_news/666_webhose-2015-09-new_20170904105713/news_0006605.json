(\"ATA\" or the \"Company\") ( NASDAQ : ATAI ), a leading provider of advanced testing technologies and testing-related services in China, today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary ATA Online (Beijing) Education Technology Co., Ltd. (\"ATA Online\") has submitted an application to the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (\"NEEQ\") in China to list on the New Third Board, the over-the-counter stock exchange in China.\nATA Online filed this application to list on the New Third Board in an effort to accelerate the growth of its core testing services business, which is primarily conducted with businesses in China. The Company also believes a New Third Board listing will allow for increased flexibility to raise capital from the Chinese capital markets in the future to fund its continued growth.\nEstablished by the State Council in late 2012, the New Third Board is a national over-the-counter stock exchange that supplements trading activities on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, including the related Growth Equity Market (GEM) exchanges. The New Third Board allows for trading of stock of growth companies that do not otherwise satisfy the requirements for listing on the main Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, allowing small- to medium-sized enterprises in China access to the capital markets and greater exposure to the investment community. Policies are currently expected to be introduced in the near future to enable NEEQ-registered companies to transfer to the GEM exchanges.\nThere can be no assurances that ATA Online will be registered on the New Third Board or that any IPO will occur. Any IPO and registration/listing of ATA Online in China is subject to, among other things, market and business conditions, adoption of appropriate rules by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the applicable stock exchanges, and ATA Online satisfying these rules and other registration/listing and offering requirements. \nAbout ATA Inc.\nATA is a leading provider of advanced testing technologies in China.
