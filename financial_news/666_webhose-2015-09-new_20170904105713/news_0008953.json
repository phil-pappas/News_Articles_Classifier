(NYSE: VOYA) announced today that Voya Foundation is awarding post-secondary education scholarships to teams of young girls who participated in the Voya-Girls Inc. Investment Challenge, a program that provides practical, hands-on investing experience to girls at Girls Inc. affiliates around the country. Teams of girls, in the final cycle of the challenge from Houston and Washington, D.C., spent the past three years building and managing a virtual $50,000 diversified, real-time portfolio as part of an integrated investment and economic literacy curriculum. Because of their successful money-management skills, the gains they realized from their investment portfolios translate into real dollars for their continued education. “We launched the Voya-Girls Inc. Investment Challenge to introduce girls to the basics of saving, investing and financial planning to empower a new generation of smart investors,” said Angela Harrell, head, Voya Foundation and Office of Corporate Responsibility. “At the end of the challenge, each team realized at least a 15 percent return on their portfolios. Given their outstanding results, the girls have clearly shown that they have acquired an understanding of stock markets and investing that they will have throughout their lives.”\nA study commissioned by Voya Financial underscores the need to engage girls early on with financial literacy. The study, Retirement Revealed , indicates that women on average are significantly less prepared for retirement than men.\nFinancial literacy is key to the Girls Inc. mission. “The Voya-Girls Inc. Investment Challenge teaches girls about the importance of understanding how money and our economy works,” said Judy Vredenburgh , President and CEO, Girls Inc. “The challenge exposes girls to the fundamentals of investing, and through the experience we see them mature as investors, gain the confidence to take control of their finances, and then reap the rewards of their hard work. We are grateful to our partners at Voya for helping girls set the foundation for a financially independent future.”\nVoya Foundation will award two-thirds of the investment gains in the portfolio to the girls with one-third going to the local Girls Inc. affiliate to support local programming.\nAbout Girls Inc.\nGirls Inc. inspires all girls to be strong, smart, and bold, providing more than 140,000 girls across the U.S. and Canada with life-changing experiences and solutions to the unique challenges girls face.\nThe Girls Inc. Experience consists of people, an environment, and programming that, together, empower girls to succeed.
