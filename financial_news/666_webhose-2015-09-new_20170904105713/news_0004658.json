Photo: Reuters\nThe return marks one of the most stunning comebacks in British public life. It comes after prosecutors said only last week that they were still looking at whether they could bring a corporate prosecution against the company.\nBrooks was found not guilty of conspiring to hack into phones, conspiring to bribe public officials for stories and conspiring to pervert the course of justice following an eight-month trial which itself became front-page news.\nBack in her old job, she will have to tackle the slide in sales of the Sun , Britain's biggest-selling newspaper. She will also have additional responsibilities for the acquisition of digital assets.\nRevealing a wider overhaul at the business, News Corp said it had also appointed Tony Gallagher, currently deputy editor at the Daily Mail , a rival to the Murdoch titles, as editor-in-chief of the Sun .\nAnalysts said Brooks would have to decide whether to retain the Sun 's online pay wall, after the Sun website fell far behind the Daily Mail .\nSteven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Brooks' return would be awkward for politicians who had previously acknowledged they had become too close to her when she was at the height of her powers.\n\"It's another reason for questioning the judgment of Murdoch himself, because he must surely appreciate the political embarrassment caused at the time by her and those close to her,\" he said.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:45:23.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
