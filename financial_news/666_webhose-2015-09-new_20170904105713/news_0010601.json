Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Australia will be the worst-hit advanced economy from slowing Chinese investment growth , according to International Monetary Fund research. Only Iran, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Zambia and Chile would suffer a bigger effects on their economies.\nAn indicative interpretation of the IMF's modelling based on Treasury budget numbers also suggests it expects Australia's annual growth growth rate will be 2.5 per cent from 2020 onwards, making it harder to return the budget to surplus early next decade.\nThe findings are a reminder for Australia's new Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull, and Treasurer Scott Morrison, who inherit a 10-year budget outlook that assumes the economy will grow 3.5 per cent for five years after 2017-18.\nSome economists, including at the Reserve Bank of Australia, have argued Australia's potential growth may now be less than 3 per cent , implying growth of less than 2 per cent if the IMF's predictions come true.\nThe research forms the analytical basis of a series of warnings delivered by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde in recent weeks that have put emerging economies on notice to watch for potential shocks out of China.\nWhile Ms Lagarde hasn't provided details of the findings in her speeches, deputy managing director Min Zhu told an audience in Dalian, China, this month that a near halving of investment growth in the second-biggest economy over the next five years would cut about1 percentage point from Australia's potential GDP growth rate by the end of that period.\nThe estimate indicates Australia's economy may miss out on no less than $16 billion a year of additional GDP by 2020.\nInvestment to fall further Critically, the estimates are built on the Chinese government's expectation that investment will fall steadily across the world's second largest economy from 46 per cent of GDP to around 35 per cent over the next five to 10 years.\nThe country's authorities – who are trying to engineer a shift away from a reliance on exports to more domestic-sources of economic growth – expect investment growth to fall to 4.6 per cent over the next half decade from an average of 9.5 per cent over the last five years.\nFor each percentage point decline in Chinese investment growth, Australia's potential GDP falls by 0.2 of a percentage point, Dr Zhu's modelling predicts.\nBy contrast, the fallout for Brazil, Australia's main iron ore competitor, would be abouthalf that amount per year, as would be the case for Germany. Countries likely to suffer the most from China's investment slowdown, according to the IMF, would be Zambia and Chile, where growth would fall by twice as much as Australia.\nIf Chinese investment growth slows even faster, as many China experts believe, the affect on Australia and key commodity-based emerging economies will be correspondingly larger.\n\"This is the good scenario,\" said Alphabeta economist Andrew Charlton, who attended the briefing just over a week ago. \"This is the IMF pumping up everyone's tyres and not offending the Chinese scenario where everything happens smoothly.\"\n\"Even if the Chinese government manages a smooth transition, the planned investment slowdown represents a 1 per cent drag on Australian GDP growth for the next decade.\"\nDr Charlton, a former adviser to Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and former senior Australian government official to Group of 20 economic summits, says the IMF research underscores the need for Australia to re-position itself to capture \"the China of the future, not the past\".\n\"There's not much we can do tearing our hair out about falling commodity prices, that's here to stay. This is about how quickly we adapt and seize new opportunities,\" he said.\nAlphabeta, a consultancy firm, has identified and analysed what it describes as the \"lucky eight\" sectors outside mining that businesses and investors should focus on, not least because of the recent trade deal signed by former prime minister Tony Abbott with his Chinese counterpart.\nThese are retail, agriculture, tourism, financial services, clean energy and environmental services, healthcare, advanced manufacturing and education.\n\"For 10 years, Australians drank the commodities Kool-Aid. We built our economy around the assumption that the China supercycle would extend as far as the eye could see,\" he said.\n\"Successive governments loaded up the budget, the miners poured shareholder funds into unrestrained expansion and households took on unprecedented debt.\"\nDr Charlton argues the next phase of China's growth won't be so straightforward for Australia to tap into. \"It will require much more active positioning to ensure we can benefit from China's growth,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:10:51.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
