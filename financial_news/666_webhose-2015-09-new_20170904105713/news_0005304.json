Rob Homer by Matthew Stevens Pre-emptive confirmation of an acquisitive interest in Oil Search from Woodside Petroleum announces that the calm prudence of chief executive Peter Coleman is more than matched by a very convincing persistence.\nPretty much from the moment Coleman was handed the keys to the chief executives suite at Woodside Petroleum in 2011, the former Exxon man has been under pressure to translate the growing bank of revenues from the new Pluto LNG project into transformational change for Australia's biggest gas company.\nThrough the subsequent four years, plenty of opportunities have been seized, but the cups of transfiguration have been left to pass by a boss and board determined to be as \"disciplined\" and \"consistent\" as they are \"nimble\" in the pursuit of growth.\nOver those occasionally frustrating years Coleman has been asked often enough whether Papua New Guinea was a gas horizon of interest to Woodside .\nThe question always seemed logical given the former Exxon lifer once sat central to the US super-major's nation-defining PNG liquid natural gas project that is founded on gas resources discovered and developed by Oil Search.\nBut Coleman's routine dismissal of the idea also made a good deal of sense, not least because it was pretty widely appreciated that his chairman was not exactly thrilled with the weighting of sovereign risk still implicit in PNG's investment profile.\nWoodside's chairman of long and good standing is Michael Chaney. From 1995 to 2005 he was a director of BHP. Through that time the Big Australian watched largely impotent as its reputation was torched by environmental and landowner contest over the management of the Ok Tedi copper mine in PNG's Star Mountains. The Ok Tedi issues, that dog BHP to this day, are said to shape yet Chaney's assessment of investment risk in PNG.\nRevitalised appetite for sovereign risk But encouraging a recovery of appetite for, and understanding of, sovereign risk has been one of Coleman's long missions at Woodside. He has driven the driller into new horizons in Asia and Africa in an attempt to broaden a commercial geography that had been trimmed to Australia and Timor by his predecessor.\nIn very obviously channelling the boss, a Woodside person noted on Tuesday: \"If the best gas in the world was found in the nicest places, what chance would we have of getting our hands on it?\"\nIn other words, if the reward mitigates the risk, then Coleman's Woodside is now up for the challenges of the emerging worlds of big gas. And the fact is that, for all the distractions, PNG LNG has been delivered with less fuss and more skill than any LNG project anywhere in the world, and its performance since first gas has been sector leading. It is running ahead of schedule and delivering at sector leading cost.\nFor all that, there can be no question that PNG is home to plenty of challenges. I mean, right now there is a petrol shortage in the country because one of the two suppliers has been unable to get enough foreign currency to acquire feed stock for its refinery. We hear there is a rice shortage for the same reason.\nMore relevantly, there are reports too of community protests at the Hides and Juha gas fields that send gas to the PNG LNG project. It is not clear why though one path of speculation has it that the government has been tardy in making landowner payments of gas royalties because the cash has been redirected to servicing the UBS debt. Another observer told us that it would be \"anybody's guess what the real truth is\".\nWoodside people have made it excessively clear that this deal does not proceed without positive embrace by the PNG government. As well as being a 10 per cent owner of Oil Search, the government holds a direct 19.6 per cent stake in the Exxon-operated PNG LNG and is the regulator of all that has and will happen around that project.\nEssentially, Woodside is asking the Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and his government to surrender a 10 per cent stake in a national oil and gas champion in preference for a 2.5 per cent position in a regional LNG business that has an increasing international footprint of opportunities that will be paid for by legacy operations up and down the north west coast of Western Australia.\nCrystallisation of loss requested For good measure, the government is being asked to crystallise a loss of better than $100 million on the deal given that O'Neill's people paid $8.20 a share for a 10 per cent of Oil Search back in February last year.\nThat deal was paid for by $1.2 billion of debt secured from UBS in an arrangement, which continues to be the subject to formal regulatory review in PNG. And the cash it generated for Oil Search was then deployed on acquiring a 23 per cent stake in arguably the biggest gas discovery in our region for the past 20 years, the Elk-Antelope fields discovered by US listed InterOil and now under the direct management of French super-major Total.\nThis is a proposition of many hidden complications. But one of them might be that the government's Oil Search shares sit as security to the UBS loan. So the bank might well have to offer its indulgence to the proposal. Mind you, it is hard to imagine that 2.5 per cent of an expanded Woodside would be currency unacceptable to the Swiss.\nIn introducing itself to the Elk-Antelope partnership, Oil Search chief executive Peter Botten has potentially secured the Exxon-led PNG LNG project with the resource security necessary to be able to commit to a third production train. This additional capacity will be cream on the pie for what is already the Asian region's lower cost LNG supplier.\nThat, of course, is why Oil Search has always looked like a regional crown jewel that might sit well in the Woodside portfolio.\nFor Botten, of course, Woodside's approach might end up being a particularly enriching a succession plan. Botten's shadow looms large over the PNG oil industry and larger still over Oil Search. At 60, he is one of the great survivors of Australian listed business. He has run this business for 21 years having been made managing director just two years after he joined the business to run its exploration business. But, as one insider noted on Tuesday, \"his future runway is now considerable shorter than his past one\".\nDoubtless, any merger plans hatched over the coming weeks will include options that might allow Botten to maintain some level of oversight of the project fathered by Oil Search's gas finds managed under his direction. Whether that be an invitation to consult or to join the Woodside board, well, time will tell.\nCertainly, we know that Coleman has worked with Botten in the past and we are told he boast an enduring respect for both the bloke and the achievements of his company.\nDefining issue All things being equal, of course, the defining issue for Botten, his board and the company's owners will be whether or not Woodside has come to the table with premium convincing enough for them to swap their PNG pioneer for an equivalent share of Australia's independent regional gas champion.\nThe 17 per cent rerate of Oil Search in the wake of confirmation of the Woodside approach suggests that the market is betting that there is a deal to be had. But the 3 per cent decline in Woodside's price left its shares trading at a value 3.75 times higher than the target. Prima facie then, the market is looking for a better deal.\nQuite fairly, the folk at Woodside would prefer that people look back beyond last week's first reports in The Australian Financial Review of a pending offer to better inform views of the underlying value and future pricing of its opening pitch.\nBased on a three month volume weighted average price (VWAP) deck, the implied consideration of the offer would be $8.51 a share and that represents a premium of 23 per cent. The one month numbers are slightly less flattering on price but stronger on premium. The implied price was $8.18 a share but the premium was 25.9 per cent. This paradox is further amplified when the values are assessed on the 1 week VWAP. The implied consideration comes in at $7.72 a share but the premium has grown to 28.4 per cent.\nThe point about all that is that Oil Search, for all its strengths, is that the quite real prospect of a lower for longer oil price has seen Oil Search rather more heavily discounted by investors through the past couple of months. And that as likely explains the timing of Woodside's approach as it does the calm quietly inviting logic that shaped Oil Search's response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:11:28.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
