U.S. commercial diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Ghana were on hand to provide market-specific counseling to attendees. \nThe delegation is in South Africa from Wednesday to Friday this week for business-to-business meetings and a business forum featuring speakers from U.S. and African companies including McKinsey, Sasol, and Ford Motor Company.
