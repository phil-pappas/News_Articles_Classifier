The WSJ’s Lucy Cramer writes that coffee consumption in China, now a small fraction of what’s downed in the U.S., is projected to expand 18% annually over the next five years . Gourmet coffee shops are opening quickly and java giant Starbucks Corp. SBUX 0.03 % plans to grow from 1,700 stores on the mainland to 3,400 by 2019. That’s great news for American travelers—and for global commodities markets. Coffee bean prices have been slumping, hitting Brazil particularly hard. But Barclays now says that coffee tops a list of commodities, including gold and silver, that could benefit as China shifts to a more consumption-oriented economy from one driven by exports and state investment. The brokerage forecasts coffee import growth in the period to 2020 at “more than three times the rate of the past five years” while imports of many other agricultural products contract.\nA few dry-bulk shippers are getting an assist from Harvard University . It turns out that Harvard Management Co., which oversees Harvard’s $36 billion endowment, owns 48% of Global Maritime Investments Cyprus Ltd., the ocean charter business that’s winding down operations after a string of losses and heavy debts. The WSJ’s Patrick Fitzgerald and Timothy Martin report that an affiliate of the endowment manager will lend $2 million to the company to safeguard Global Maritime’s ships around the globe from being seized by creditors . A bankruptcy judge in New York gave interim approval to the company on Thursday to keep its fleet of 16 vessels moving as the company moves toward liquidation. The big concern for shippers in such cases is whether cargo will get caught in the crossfire as unsecured creditors go after company assets. The ruling means bulk shipments should keep moving as long as the ships, and the loan, are still floating.\nTransplace isn’t buying into the idea that assets are critical for freight transport service. WSJ Logistics Report’s Loretta Chao writes that the Texas-based shipping services business completed its fifth acquisition in five years, a purchase of niche provider M33 Integrated . Tom Sanderson, Transplace’s chief executive, says the company plans to stay on that schedule as it builds business in new shipping market. But Sanderson says freight broker XPO Logistics Inc.’s recent acquisition of trucker Con-way Inc. won’t push Transplace off the non-asset-based path. Says Sanderson, We don’t buy trucks, trailers and hard assets. We’re buying revenue, earnings, and talent.”\nTRANSPORTATION ENLARGE The Barclays brokerage house forecasts coffee imports into China through 2020 will grow more than three times the rate of the past five years. Photo: Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press Maybe there’s enough U.S. import growth to go around . WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that import volumes at the West Coast ports of Seattle-Tacoma and Oakland jumped at a double-digit in August . The Northwest Seaport Alliance, which includes the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, received 113,972 loaded twenty-foot equivalent units—a 31% improvement over last year’s loaded imports. Oakland saw loaded-import container volume soared 15% over last August. Major Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports also reported improved import performance in August—a sign that this year’s peak shipping season is getting off to a strong start. That’s especially good news on the West Coast, where the latest port numbers along with gains reported in Southern California suggest the gateways are winning back shippers after labor strife tied up business earlier this year.\nExpect GE Transportation to expand its information services . The WSJ’s Kim S. Nash reports that Jamie Miller was promoted to chief executive of the unit of General Electric Co. , and her background suggests the direction the business will take. As chief information officer for two years, Ms. Miller has transformed GE’s global IT strategy. She’s likely to draw on that experience to offer more digital products and services to customers that include railroad and marine companies. Those businesses are increasingly using data analytics to drive operations The move from CIO to CEO is uncommon, but it’s driven by the kind of forces that are pushing for greater understanding of sophisticated technology in supply chains, and transforming jobs that have long been focused on operations management.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Interest rates are extremely low right now, that makes acquisitions even more attractive. ’\n—Tom Sanderson, CEO, Transplace\nIN OTHER NEWS The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged but a majority of Fed officials believe the central bank will raise rates before year-end.
