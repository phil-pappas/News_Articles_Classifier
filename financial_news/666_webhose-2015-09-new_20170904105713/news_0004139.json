That has triggered a collapse in its share price, which has sliced $15 billion from its market capitalisation in the past 12 months.\nDavid Rowe Mr O'Brien, whose departure was announced by Woolworths in June but is still with the company while new chairman Gordon Cairns and his board hunt for a new chief executive, will enjoy a comfortable retirement through his Woolworths defined benefit superannuation scheme payout, which will deliver him almost $10 million once he officially departs by November 2015 at the earliest.\nHe was paid a base salary of $2.16 million in 2014-15 and his total pay packet was bumped up by the addition of a previously deferred short-term incentive stemming from the 2013 year.\nThe Woolworths annual report issued on Friday gave part of the details of Mr O'Brien's superannuation arrangements, and outlined that he had contributed 5 per cent of his base salary during each year of his membership of the defined benefits scheme.\nAccrued annual leave The Woolworths board has allowed him to stay until November 2015 and he will then use accrued annual leave and long-service leave so that he qualifies for the defined benefits scheme payout when he turns 55 in July 2016.\nThe total superannuation payout, which is based on an accrued multiple of an average final base salary in his last two years at the helm, will reap him between $9 million and $10 million.\nMr O'Brien started at Woolworths 28 years ago. He has been chief executive since October 2011.\nMr Waters, who has been criticised over his stint as chairman, stepped down from the role two weeks ago. The annual report revealed that he was paid $722,991 in 2014-15, slightly higher than the $718,968 he was paid the year before.\nMr Cairns, a former chief executive of beer business Lion Nathan, which sells brands such as XXXX and Tooheys, and a former chairman of retailer David Jones, took the role of chairman of Woolworths on September 1. He outlined in the annual report that 2014-15 would be remembered as \"a year of significant change for Woolworths\".\nHe said the process of finding a new chief executive was progressing well and a range of internal and external candidates had already been identified.\nHe said it was a global search because it was crucial to find the right leader for the company.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-09-11T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:06:54.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
