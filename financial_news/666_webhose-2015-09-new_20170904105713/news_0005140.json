Louie Douvis Professor Garnaut suggested Canberra's political classes should have anticipated the slowdown.\nThe author of Dog Days foreshadowed two years ago much of the current downturn in the terms of trade and its impact on the budget and living standards.\n\"There is nothing special in [this week's] national accounts,\" Professor Garnaut told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"This is the 12th quarter of below-trend growth. It is time to recognise a new trend and respond intelligently to it.\"\n Scant opportunities Managing director of Australia's $117 billion Future Fund, David Neal, who cut the fund's local and global equities allocations and doubled its cash pile to $22.9 billion last financial year, suggested there was a widespread view among big-scale investors that new opportunities are increasingly difficult to find as growth falters. \"We are in a slow growth environment,\" he said.\nThe comments add to a growing chorus of warnings – most recently heard at last week's National Reform Summit – that the country is in danger of sleepwalking into a serious downturn .\nNational accounts data confirmed the end of the resources boom is accelerating, with not enough other drivers of growth filling the resulting shortfall.\nReserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens warned in an interview with the Financial Review in late 2012 that Australia could hit a growth gap if manufacturers and service industries were slow to fill the hole left by mining investment.\nThat has increasingly become a reality, say analysts, with Mr Stevens flagging last month the possibility that the economy's new \"normal\" may be around 0.5 of a percentage point below the 3.25 per cent rate that has long been assumed.\n\"The real story in these national accounts is that the economy faces an even longer transition phase than consensus has factored,\" said Daniel Blake and his team of economists at Morgan Stanley.\nThey warn that Australia's near-term challenge will be finding enough growth next year, with the economy's \"great growth engine of housing\" likely to be reined in by tighter regulatory controls because of fears of an investor driven price bubble.\nThey said the latest GDP figures \"strengthen our conviction that Australia faces a persistent demand deficit\".\nAcross the economy, the impact of worsening \"income shock\" shows signs of intensifying, curbing investor confidence and dragging on household sentiment, underscored by figures on Thursday showing retail sales fell in July for the first time in 14 months .\nProfessor Garnaut warned that Australia's big banks continue to depend \"imprudently on the wholesale debt markets\".\n\"Let's remember that the extreme dependence of our major banks in 2008 on borrowing from international wholesale markets would have brought them down were it not for the capacity of the Commonwealth government to guarantee $178 billion of their debt.\n\"The most welcome development at the [reform] summit was the widespread recognition that solving the budget problem would require increases in taxation as well as constraint on expenditure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:43:35.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
