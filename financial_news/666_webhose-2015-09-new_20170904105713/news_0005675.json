Result of FB's Thursday Outage By Zacks Equity Research 50 minutes ago  Content preferences Done “Hello to all the people millions of people that dusted off their twitter account to see what's happening when #facebookdown “ — John H.@johnweb We think this tweet sums up what happened yesterday when Facebook FB users experienced a brief outage — Twitter Inc.’s TWTR traffic picked up! And that’s because many turned to Twitter to vent their frustration or gag about the incident. Currently Down, the monitoring website, stated that Facebook was offline for approximately 14 minutes from about 1630 GMT. However, others websites gave varying estimates. Facebook did not comment on the outage. Let’s Turn to Twitter Similar to previous such incidents, this one also led to a series of “panicked -- and mock-panicked” tweets. The #facebookdown theme went on to become a “global trending item on the messaging platform” according to 9news.com. Don’t worry, it’s all cool now! “FB users r roaming the streets nn tears, showing pictures of themselves in other people's faces yelling 'Do you like this'? #FacebookDown” (sic) — Amir Sohail (@ItsAmirSohail) Don’t worry, though, Facebook is up and running now!. On a More Serious Note Apart from all the witty tweets and gags, it’s important to remember that outage affects revenues too because of the loss in advertising. According to The Street, “Facebook is missing out on the potential for a loss of slightly more than $1.7 million in advertising-centric revenue for every hour the website and app are not working.” This is based on the fact that the company generated $3.827 billion in advertising revenues in the second quarter, assuming flat revenue growth rate. Facebook currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Travelport Worldwide Ltd. TVPT sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
