In this article I'll ask whether Avanti now has the potential to outperform its larger rival Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT) and satellite television giant SKY (LSE: SKY). \nGood news and bad \nThe good news was that Avanti's fleet utilisation rose to 20-25%, up from 10-15% during the previous year. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose tenfold to $16.0m, up from just $1.7m the previous year. \nThe bad news is that these EBITDA and utilisation figures remain very low, and Avanti is losing serious amounts of money. \nLast year's post-tax loss was $73.1m and the firm's accounts show that Avanti experienced a net cash outflow of$164.5m during the year. Interest payments alone totalled $52.3m. \nAs a result, Avanti's net cash balance fell from $195m to $122m, despite a one-off $25.1m gain from the sale of some unwanted spectrum rights. \nInmarsat vs Avanti \nAvanti is planning to build a satellite fleet with the potential to generate EBITDA of $500m. To put this into context, Inmarsat, a much older rival with a more mature business, reported revenue of $1,285m and EBITDA of $701m last year. \nIf we assume that Avanti's reading of potential market demand is correct, Inmarsat's figures suggest that Avanti could deliver impressive growth once its network of satellites is complete. \nMy concern is that Avanti has already invested $1.2bn in its network. Further investment is needed. I suspect that it will take the firm much longer to generate a profit from this investment than the market is expecting. \nIn the meantime, more cash may be required. \nOn this basis, I'm not sure buying Avanti makes sense in today's market. \nWhat about Inmarsat and Sky? \nIn my view, Inmarsat is a high-quality business. Earnings grew by 8% last year and the firm maintained its long-term average operating margin of 31%. \nInmarsat shares currently offer a reasonable forecast yield of 3.3%, but they are expensive. Earnings per share are expected to fall this year before recovering next year. Today's 1,014p share price equates to a 2015 forecast P/E of 34, falling to 29 in 2016. \nI'm more tempted by satellite broadcaster Sky. The firm's shares currently trade on around 16 times forecast profits and offer a similar 3.5% yield. \nSky's ability to generate free cash flow and audience loyalty with exclusive content are impressive. The firm's recent acquisition of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland could generate further growth using the formula that's been so successful in the UK. \nSky remains a buy, in my view. \nBut if you're already invested in a satellite firm and are looking for a more down to earth profit opportunity, I'd urge you to take a look at \" 3 Hidden Factors Behind This Daring E-commerce Play \" . \nThe company in question has an unconventional boss with a history of beating profit forecasts .
