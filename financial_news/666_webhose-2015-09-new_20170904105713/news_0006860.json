Andrew Meares by Phillip Coorey Joanna Mather Malcolm Turnbull has put all options for tax reform back on the table and South Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill says the federal Labor Party should adopt the same attitude, including supporting an increased GST.\nBut federal shadow treasurer Chris Bowen will hit back on Tuesday at The Australian Financial Review Tax Summit in Sydney by arguing an increased the GST would not raise enough money to pay for all the measures it had been slated to fund, and extending the tax to health, education and fresh food would disproportionately increase cost of living pressures.\nMr Bowen will criticise Mr Weatherill's push to use all the proceeds of a GST increase to cover federal cuts in health funding, saying that would be a \"tax rise, not tax reform\".\nWhile he has no objection to Mr Weatherill's suggestion of extending the GST to financial services, he will say it would be a \"fiendishly difficult task\" and that's why such services were exempted in the first place.\nSouth Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has backed a broadening of the GST to cover financial services. Alex Ellinghausen \"And that's is why there is no value-added tax in the world which applies to financial services,\" he will say.\nMr Turnbull effectively put superannuation tax concessions , capital gains breaks for investors and negative gearing back into the tax reform mix on Monday after they were all ruled out by his predecessor, Tony Abbott.\nMore productive \"There are many levers in the tax system, many possible combinations of measures, and it's important that we look at all of them,\" he said. \"We've got to look at all of the levers and measures we can to improve incentives that make us more productive.\"\nShadow Treasurer Chris Bowen will criticise Mr Weatherill's push to use all the proceeds of a GST increase to cover federal cuts in health funding, saying that would be a \"tax rise, not tax reform\". Andrew Meares A letter from Treasury following a Freedom of Information request from shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh confirms the federal government had been looking at an increased GST rate.\nThe Treasury declined to give details but confirmed that this year there had been two separate pieces of modelling provided to then-treasurer Joe Hockey \"showing the distributional impact on Australian households of an increase in the GST\".\nIn a plan to be presented to the Financial Review Tax Summit, Mr Weatherill will call on his federal Labor colleagues to drop their outright opposition to any changes to the GST to make way for genuine debate on tax reform.\nEqually, he will urge Mr Turnbull to open up the government up to a rethink of generous tax concessions on superannuation. \"The tax debate has become narrowed on Labor's side by the refusal to look at the GST and on the Coalition side by not looking at super,\" he will say. \"It constrains the debate and keeps us from consensus.\"\nMr Weatherill will say that Mr Abbott's dumping \"potentially allows us to unfreeze existing positions and move forward\".\nGST rate of 15 per cent \"The point we make about that is the GST is not the great tax that it was promised to be and there needs to be consideration of lifting its rate or broadening its base and looking at other forms of revenue such as super and corporate tax evasion,\" he will say.\nIn July, Mr Weatherill and NSW Liberal Premier Mike Baird led debate at a leaders summit in which they called for the GST rate to be lifted from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. This would raise about $35 billion extra a year.\nMr Baird suggested half could be spent on public health and the other half on compensating people who $100,000 or less.\nMr Weatherill said all the money would be needed to cover the growing health funding gap and that the federal government should pay for the compensation separately.\nMr Abbott argued there would be not a GST increase unless it was offset by other tax cuts and the government was planning to use a GST increase to combat bracket creep.\nMr Bowen will tell the summit that Labor is not opposing a GST increase to be politically popular.\nHe will note that the party has supported an extension to international downloads and low-value goods bought overseas over the internet.\n\"Where we have been convinced of the need for change on the GST we have supported it, despite the political opportunities that arise from opposing any change,\" he will say.\nBut it was too simplistic to equate a GST increase with tax reform.\nHe will note Mr Baird has suggested it the GST be increased to cover health costs, the federal government wants it to pay for tax cuts, the Property Council wants it to fund the abolition of stamp duty and the Business Council of Australia says it should fund a corporate tax cut.\nCost of living up 30 per cent \"Let's be clear, after compensating low and middle income earners, there is not enough money left over from a GST rise to do more than one of the above things,\" he will say.\nAs for those calling to extend the GST base, Mr Bowen will cite data showing that since 2005, the general cost of living has risen by 30 per cent.\nBut education costs have risen by more than double (68 per cent), health at around double (59 per cent), and basic food items such as fruit and vegetables prices have risen by 41 per cent and 47 per cent respectively.\n\"Cost of living has been largely driven by areas where the GST does not apply, or more to the point on essential items people rely on for their wellbeing,\" he will say.\n\"Raising costs on health, education and fresh food would only exacerbate these price pressures.\"\nUntil the Liberal leadership change, the government was scheduled to release the draft tax white paper, known as the green paper, in October with the final version in the new year.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said on Sunday he would continue with the white paper process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:07:53.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
