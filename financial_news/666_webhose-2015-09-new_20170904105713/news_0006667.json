So there is room for a squeeze higher in euro.\"\nBy 1134 GMT, the euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.1161 and 134.19 yen respectively.\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars had sunk in Asian trading earlier after a business survey dealt another blow to investors' already fragile confidence in China, the chief driver of global sentiment in the past month.\nThe Aussie, developed currency markets' main proxy for China plays, fell as much as percent before recovering to stand half a percent lower at $0.7058, well off a near four-week high of $0.7280 set on Friday. The kiwi recovered ground in European trading to be marginally up on the day.\nElsewhere, the market's response to the Chinese data and more sales of stocks in Europe and Asia was a mixed bag.\nA number of major banks have returned to their mantra of calling for a weaker euro in the past week, arguing that an extension of the ECB's easing programme will coincide with a rise in official U.S. interest rates.\nAgainst that has been a tendency among investors to buy the euro when stock markets are falling, and the continuing doubts over the timing of a first move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which for some has retreated into next year. That leaves the picture on the dollar mixed, too.\n\"I think FX is positioned for additional signals from the ECB, that trade has been put on this week,\" said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX Strategy with BMO in London, speaking before Jazbec's comments on Wednesday.\n\"Risk appetite is fragile though, and the euro remains negatively correlated with risk appetite - that probably explains some of the euro's resilience this morning.\" (Additional reporting by Anirban Nag ; Editing by Hugh Lawson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:07:37.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
