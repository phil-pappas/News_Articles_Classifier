Justin McManus Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan New Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg has said Australia's industrial relations system is \"costing\" business and jobs and Sunday penalty rates need to be \"looked at\" - a sign the new Turnbull government is tilting at IR reform.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott and former Employment Minister Eric Abetz were seen as lacking the political capital to proceed with changes, and left decisions on wages to the Fair Work Commission .\nNow, in more strident comments, Mr Frydenberg said Sunday penalty rates were \"an area where we need to look at\".\nHe pointed to examples in the resources industry where the system was decreasing productivity and increasing cost.\n\"In the resources sector it costs 50 per cent more in Australia to have an energy project than if you were to have one on the US Gulf Coast,\" he said.\nWith Mr Turnbull leaving the door open to a broad range of policy adjustments, Mr Frydenberg further added to speculation the government was keen to move on IR.\n\"Malcolm Turnbull is absolutely right to point to industrial relations as one area where it does cost business and ultimately it does cost jobs,\" he said.\nMr Frydenberg also said he would \"love\" to see the defunct Australian Building and Construction Commission reinstated.\nRelated \"We've seen energy companies in Australia say without the Australian Building and Construction Commission we've seen five times as many industrial disputes and days lost to industrial disputation than if we had the ABCC.\n\"I would love to see that come back as well as other changes,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-27T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T06:47:13.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
