The first episodes of \" Dallas \" were shown in 1978 as oil prices were climbing to their 1980 peak at $100 per barrel in real terms, but most of the series were aired in the 1980s, in time for the spectacular bust of the Texas oil industry.\" \nAccording to a Deadline.com report from 2012 , the show was picked up but never aired. In January, however, Deadline.com reported that ABC had picked up the show, a move that came after oil prices crashed about 40% in the final quarter of 2014. \n\"Blood and Oil\" will debut on Sunday, September 27. \nHere's the collapse in oil prices over the last 4 years, which was apparently spectacular enough for a major network drama that will go up against the NFL during the fall. \n(FRED)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:34:41.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
