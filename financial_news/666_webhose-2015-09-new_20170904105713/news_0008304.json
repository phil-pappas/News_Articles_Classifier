The final access or the last mile access is by the state discoms,” he explained.\nJaitley said very few states have carried out reforms for state discoms. “There are four states which are in dire distress as far as their discoms are concerned and four others where the situation is reasonably challenging,” he said. He further said that the entire advantage of increased power generation, multiple sources of power generation, a grid across the country, all gets defeated by a narrow last mile where reforms have not been carried out.\nThe power ministry is in active discussion with these states and most of them have responded quite positively, he said. “A meeting was held at the level of the prime minister himself and some important changes and reforms in relation to these states where the discoms are distressed are being worked out,” he added.\nJaitley said that power ministry is in the final stages giving effect to its discussions with each one of these states which would have to enter into a discussion and probably an agreement with the ministry and its only then the kind of relief being worked out be available to them.\nThrough the Financial Restructuring Package (FRP), discoms’ short-term liabilities amounting to Rs 51,200 crore were restructured by the lenders in 2012 with the comfort of state government guarantees. Under the FRP, 50% of the accumulated debt of the discoms till March 2012 were converted into bonds. These bonds were be issued by the distribution companies to the participating lenders, backed by state government guarantees. The balance 50% loans were restructured by providing moratorium on principal and best possible terms for repayments.\n 28, 2015 7:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:20:41.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
