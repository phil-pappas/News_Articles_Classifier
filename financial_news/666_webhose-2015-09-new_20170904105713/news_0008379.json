Andrew Meares The sport, although booming in terms of junior participation, seemed to have been hamstrung forever by inept administration and warring factions that held football back, preventing it from fulfilling its potential. It might have been the world game, but in Australia football was in danger of becoming a joke, with governing body Soccer Australia virtually insolvent.\nBy the time the prime minister placed his call to Lowy, events had conspired to ensure Lowy would have the full backing of the sport and the highest office in the land. He would receive a mandate to overhaul the moribund federation in charge of the sport, and $15 million in government grants and loans so he could fulfill his vision.\n\"I resisted all the way until I realised I could tear up the rulebook and start with a new one,\" says Lowy. \"When the prime minister asks you to do something, you don't like to refuse.\"\nNo Plan B A smiling Frank Lowy, at the start of his journey with Australian football, in 2003. Tim Clayton So it was that Lowy was appointed chairman of Soccer Australia on Saturday, July 19, 2003, at an extraordinary general meeting in Sydney. He would have full control of the organisation, from the choice of board members down. Investing such power in one man was unprecedented. But in truth, football had no Plan B. Lowy had to be the saviour, the messiah who would deliver salvation to a football code desperately in need of leadership and vision, and support from the biggest names in politics, business and sport.\nFrank Lowy fell in love with football as a child growing up in Czechoslovakia and later Hungary, although he admits he was never really much good at playing the sport.\nIn 1969, he took the helm of eastern Sydney Jewish club Hakoah​ as president. His vision was to build a social club that would provide funds for the football team and for the Jewish community.\nLowy, who was already on his way to building a considerable fortune from shopping centres, even temporarily put his Point Piper mansion up as collateral when the club hit hard times. He learnt an important lesson about not personally investing in his passions in the future.\nFormer FFA chief John O'Neill – headhunted by Lowy from a shining career in rugby union – helped formulate plans for a radical new league in 2004. Wade Laube Lowy would find success with Hakoah, and would be integral to the formation of the National Soccer League in 1977. But by 1987, Lowy had had enough. After one round, he made the shock decision to withdraw Sydney City (as Hakoah became known as) from the league, throwing the competition into disarray.\nIt was a cold-blooded decision to cut his and the club's losses in a venture for which Lowy simply could not see a viable future, even though the club had been successful on the field, winning three NSL titles between 1980 and 1982.\n\"I don't think it diminished Frank's aura,\" recalls journalist Michael Cockerill​. \"Nobody ultimately held it against him. In fact, in some ways it just demonstrated his power, because everyone knew this was a man who could make very hard decisions for football, and while he was away, the other guys couldn't make hard decisions about changing the league.\"\nSA to FFA Lowy and the winners' trophy at the A-League grand final in February 2008 between Newcastle Jets and Central Coast Mariners at Sydney football stadium. The Jets won. Darren Pateman As football lurched from one crisis to the next, Lowy fielded constant approaches from many involved in the game. They appealed to him to return and fix the sport once and for all.\nOther saviours, such as former ABC boss David Hill, would be employed, but by 2002 governing body Soccer Australia was on its knees financially.\nThe Australian Sports Commission launched an inquiry into the sport, chaired by respected lawyer David Crawford – the national chairman of accounting firm KPMG and a director of blue-chip companies such as Lend Lease, Foster's Group and Westpac.\nCrawford sounded out Lowy to see if he was interested in returning to the game, but Lowy at first refused. Crawford persisted, speaking to the billionaire and his advisers on several more occasions, as Lowy remembers: \"Crawford did his job and did it properly and politely. He didn't push me very much, but I think that was his intention all the way through. He was very subtle about it, though.\"\nIt worked. Lowy eventually confirmed his interest and listed his demands: the power to select his own board, a moratorium on elections to give him time to implement the changes, and guarantees of ongoing government support and funds to restructure the sport.\nLowy enlisted respected Melbourne business identity Ron Walker and advertising guru John Singleton as his first directors of what was to be rebadged the Australian Soccer Association and later to its present name of Football Federation Australia.\nThe new board quickly turned its attention to the NSL, which was in its dying days. John O'Neill​, a stunning success as CEO of the Australian Rugby Union, was pried away from that sport after the 2003 Rugby World Cup, during which he was courted by Lowy as the event drew to a conclusion.\n\"He sat down next to me and said, 'The World Cup final is tomorrow,\"' O'Neill says. '\"When can we talk?' I said, 'Frank, can we wait until Monday?' Sure enough, Monday comes. 'Hello, what are you doing now?' says Frank down the phone. It was hysterical.\"\nRadical new league O'Neill and Lowy set about formulating plans for a radical new league. They were taking an enormous risk: virtually nowhere else around the world – save for some rare exceptions such as the United States – had a country shut down its league in order to start a new one.\nOn Monday, November 1, 2004 – about a week after it was initially planned, and a day before the nation's attention was captured by the Melbourne Cup – O'Neill, Lowy and representatives from each of the eight clubs gathered at the IMAX Theatre at Darling Harbour to unveil their plans for a league that was to be launched little more than 10 months later.\nThe teams were revealed: Adelaide United, Central Coast Mariners, Melbourne Victory, Newcastle Jets, Perth Glory, New Zealand Knights, Queensland Roar and Sydney FC. The competition was to be called the A-League, in line with other leagues around the world, including South Korea's K-League and Japan's J-League.\nSome notable names in business funded the teams, including Perth fast food and agriculture magnate Nick Tana, former Elders IXL executive Geoff Lord in Melbourne, noted South Australian property tycoon and philanthropist Gordon Pickard​, Con Constantine in Newcastle and Lowy himself, ignoring conflict-of-interest concerns and taking a stake in Sydney FC.\nOn the cusp of the A-League's first season in August 2005, Lowy admitted to some nerves as he implored fans from previous eras to come and see the shiny new league.\nHe remembers well the nerves he felt. \"At that time I said 'I'm begging the soccer-lovers to come.' I remember thinking we might get 5000 [spectators] per game. It would not have been enough, but it would have been a start.\"\nSpectacular debut The first year of the A-League would prove to be more spectacular than even Lowy had hoped. Sydney FC was led by star Trinidadian import Dwight Yorke, who lived up to his \"all night Dwight\" moniker off the field and constantly attracted the attention of the tabloids.\nYorke made an impression on his teammates, too. \"I still remember our first recovery session down at Bondi [Beach], and we are all ready with our shorts and thongs on and ready to jump in,\" goalkeeper Clint Bolton says. \"But he said, 'Nah,' and sat up along the pedestrian area. I swear he ended up with a few [women's] phone numbers by the time we got back.\"\nSydney FC won the first grand final in February 2006 as crowds flocked to the new league. While there were financial issues for many clubs, football was riding a wave of unprecedented interest in the sport.\nFuelling the boom was the success of the national Socceroos team. After many heartbreaking near misses, the team had qualified for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after an emotional play-off win against Uruguay in November the year before.\nStanding in front of the historic Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in late June 2006, Frank Lowy was swept up in the euphoria of Australia's first appearance at the World Cup in 32 years. The Socceroos had kept a nation spellbound by making the second-round knockout stage of the tournament, and the then 75-year-old billionaire was keen to see a similar event held in Australia as quickly as possible.\n\"Time is, you know, [a] very, very, very scarce commodity, particularly in my case,\" a relaxed and casually dressed Lowy told an ABC Television interviewer in the late afternoon of a beautiful European summer's day. \"So we will try and do it [in] as short [time] as possible. Dare to dream, but if you don't dream, you don't get there.\"\nAnd so the seeds were sown for a roller-coaster journey that would see Lowy and the FFA spend $45.6 million of Australian taxpayer money to chase the dream of hosting the world's biggest event, with a cast of colourful characters and never-ending amounts of publicity and controversy along the way.\nBidding tactics Prime minister Kevin Rudd showed football considerable support. As some other football codes – notably rugby union, to which John O'Neill had returned – had their funding promises slashed, Lowy was able to convince Rudd to keep Labor's promises to football intact. The new prime minister, who was also keen for Australia to win a position on the United Nations Security Council, clearly enjoyed siding with the world game.\nRudd, surfing the wave of record-high opinion polls, was effusive, saying that winning the bid would be a \"herculean task, but overcoming tough odds is what Australian football does best\".\nAt the FIFA Congress in May 2008, held at Sydney's famous Opera House, Rudd was a keynote speaker. He received a FIFA gold medal from FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who praised the Socceroos' efforts on the field in the World Cup two years earlier.\nBut another presentation raised some questions about Australia's bidding tactics.\nLowy hosted an intimate dinner for the FIFA executive committee at his Point Piper mansion, on Sydney Harbour. The FIFA executive committee members were presented with Paspaley pearl cufflinks, while their spouses were gifted pearl necklaces.\nThe main meal was served on beautiful white dinner plates individually embossed with the ExCo members' names. In all, the dinner is said to have cost about $100,000, though Lowy was delighted at how the evening had gone.\nLowy threw himself into the job of lobbying FIFA officials. \"All somebody would have to do is say, 'There is someone in Timbuktu, go and see him,' and I would go,\" he remembers.\nWarner controversy Part of Australia's strategy, as the Lowy mansion dinner indicated, was to play the game as hard as possible while knowing full well with whom they were dealing. They intended to go as close to the ethical line as possible – without actually crossing it.\nThat included employing colourful and controversial European consultants Peter Hargitay​ and Fedor Radmann​. Hargitay's résumé included public relations work for Union Carbide after its 1984 factory disaster, a charge of cocaine trafficking in Jamaica (he was reportedly later acquitted), and a stint working for US tax fraud criminal Marc Rich.\nRadmann, a German businessman supposedly fluent in four languages, was another who had a long list of accusations against him. Scottish investigative journalist Andrew Jennings, whose book, Foul! The Secret World of FIFA, was published in 2006, had dubbed Radmann \"the bagman\" and alleged he had helped bribe New Zealander Charlie Dempsey to change his vote during the bidding for the 2006 World Cup.\nThe Australian strategy went close to backfiring spectacularly in one infamous case.\nJack Warner, the FIFA vice-president from Trinidad and Tobago, was one ExCo member to whom Australia and other bidders were keen to get closer. Prime minister Rudd dropped in to see Warner in November 2009 in Port of Spain, and the lobbying of the long-time powerbroker of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association of Football (CONCACAF) was long and intense from all bidders.\nIn August 2010, FFA paid $US462,000 for an upgrade to a \"centre of excellence\" in Macoya, on the island of Trinidad. The facility already had a hotel, a swimming pool, a health centre and a stadium, but still the FFA judged that an upgrade was needed. The grant, the FFA claims, only came after it sent in quantity surveyors who said the upgrade was justified. The money was then transferred to what the FFA claimed was a CONCACAF bank account.\nBut in April 2013, the FFA was severely embarrassed when an investigation by the CONCACAF integrity committee found the funds had ended up in Warner's hands. The bank account into which the FFA had transferred the funds was in fact controlled by Warner, who later resigned from all his positions in football and was then arrested as part of a crackdown by US authorities against FIFA in mid-2015.\nThe FFA was unable to rid itself of the stigma of having tried to cosy up to Warner.\n\"There were no bribes paid [by Australia] in the process,\" a defiant Lowy said, while agreeing to co-operate with any inquiry or investigation. \"But I take full responsibility with what happened in the bid.\"\nHosting hopes Controversies had dogged Australia's World Cup bid, but by December 2010, Australia – a sports-loving nation that embraced events – was considered one of the favourites to win hosting rights for 2022.\nThere was a quiet confidence among the Australian delegation who travelled to Zurich for the vote on December 2. Joining Lowy and his now CEO Ben Buckley and their European consultants were almost all of the FFA's board members, sports minister Mark Arbib, Socceroos captain Lucas Neill and teammate Tim Cahill. Also present was supermodel Elle Macpherson, drafted in to help woo voters in a last-minute pitch to FIFA dignitaries. Prime minister Julia Gillard did not make the trip, represented by governor-general Quentin Bryce.\nMacpherson was in the room when a meeting took place between Lowy and Blatter and a smattering of other dignitaries two nights before the bid decision.\nLowy's confidence grew appreciably when the FIFA president appeared to give the Australian bid his seal of approval, telling Lowy \"It will all be OK\". If there was one person who knew where the cards would fall when the votes were tallied, it was surely Blatter.\n\"Not once, but twice, he told me that it would be OK,\" Lowy recalls of his discussions with the FIFA president. \"I think his game was really to break ground with Australia and Russia, which would have been two new worlds.\"\nBut Blatter would turn out to have misled Lowy – badly. Lowy and his bid team entered Zurich's Messezentrum auditorium the next day with a mixture of nervous excitement and anticipation, and a small spring in their step. They were on the verge of another Australian sporting victory against the odds, one that would cement Lowy's legacy as football's saviour in his country.\nIt was therefore alarming when, as Lowy walked to his seat, members of FIFA's ExCo – those he classed as friends or even \"brothers\" – would not look him in the eye. Suddenly they didn't want to know the billionaire who had spent the past four years cajoling, wooing and attempting to curry their favour. Lowy thought he had convinced them that Australia was the country to vote for in the race for the 2022 event. He was wrong.\nOne ExCo member walked up to Lowy and uttered words that would haunt him forever: \"No, you guys didn't win.\"\nDomestic dramas The colour drained from Lowy's face and the news quickly spread among the other Australian team members. Gallingly, the group had to sit through 20 minutes of ceremony, drum rolls and the like, knowing that their years of work had amounted to nothing. They sat stone-faced as a grinning Blatter stepped to the podium to announce that Russia had won the hosting rights for 2018, and then, shockingly, that Qatar had triumphed in the race for 2022.\nBy that time, the gloss had worn off the A-League as Lowy and Buckley battled issues on the home front, including the eventual closure of the Townsville-based North Queensland Fury.\n\"In the end, it was asking too much of too few people, and some of our focus and attention on domestic issues were not as sharp as they needed to be,\" Buckley says of the World Cup bid.\nOne particular issue involved the ebullient and verbose billionaire Clive Palmer, whose ownership of Gold Coast United had shown initial promise but was now on the verge of disaster.\nThe FFA had initially been pleased when Palmer stepped forward in May 2008 to become owner of what was a new team. To make sure of his bona fides, Buckley had requested to see Palmer's bank statement. Palmer cheekily met the request, as he recalls: \"They said, 'Can you cover the loss of a million bucks?' We sent them a bank statement with a couple of hundred million dollars on it, which was a bit facetious of us, I suppose. I said, 'Here's one. If you want another one, just contact the bank and they'll give you one from a different account.\"'\nPalmer lavished funds on his team, as former captain Jason Culina​ remembers: \"We had private jets, flying on his plane, they put us up in the best hotels. We had two physios at training, we were absolutely brilliantly looked after. We were on his yachts. We've got private jets, boats, everything. He would invite us to his place for barbecues. I'm telling you, it was unbelievable.\"\nPalmer v FFA But Palmer's team failed to connect with the local community and would only attract low crowds. The billionaire began losing interest and turned his attention to antagonising Lowy and the FFA.\nPalmer called football a \"hopeless game\" and dared the governing body to take action by turning up the heat. The following week, during a home match against Melbourne Victory, Palmer replaced his Hyatt Coolum Resort on the front of the team's shirts with the words \"Freedom of Speech\", in response to what he said were FFA threats to muzzle him.\nPalmer, perhaps with tongue in cheek, claims the move was because people may have been concerned about him putting one of his companies on the front of Gold Coast's shirts. \"So I said, 'Let's put something on the jersey that is not controversial – not a company or not promoting a product – so we'll just put on Freedom of Speech,' and straight away they went ape-shit. They thought we were having a go at them, but we weren't. We were just trying to be non-controversial.\"\nBuckley instructed Palmer not to use the slogan on the playing strip or on signage around the ground, and at one stage considered calling the match off. Palmer ignored Buckley's directive.\nThe following week, Buckley and the FFA had had enough. The organisation stripped Palmer of his ownership licence, citing three clear breaches of his participation agreement: a deliberate contravention of FFA policies, a defiance of the direction that was given by the FFA, and repeated public statements that brought the game into disrepute. The FFA took over the operations of the club for the remaining four games of the season.\nPalmer took the FFA to court in an attempt to keep the licence, courting publicity at the same time. \"Well, we beat him in the court after that, and he said at the time that he had never lost in court,\" remembers Buckley. \"That isn't true. He went to court and sought an injunction and couldn't get one because the court ruled that the FFA had total jurisdiction to make the decisions the way it had.\"\nExtraordinarily – and almost certainly with the sole intent of antagonising Lowy, Buckley and the FFA – Palmer then approached other A-League owners about setting up a breakaway competition.\nIt was another baffling move, given that any new league would effectively be a \"rebel\" organisation and would never be sanctioned by FIFA. But Palmer had deep pockets and promised to fund it.\nPalmer also set up his own federation, christening it Football Australia. A website was established and a logo drawn up, and the slogan \"We Kick Harder\" adopted. Football Australia launched its own inquiry into the administration of football across the country.\nIt gained little traction, however, and eventually Palmer gave up as a career in politics beckoned.\nTinkler's turn Yet at one stage, as Buckley attempted to negotiate Palmer's exit from Gold Coast United, he and respected FFA lawyer Jo Setright​ flew to Queensland. During the discussions, Palmer said he would like to stay involved in football and that his Mineralogy investment firm could become a Socceroos sponsor; it would pour millions of dollars into junior development, a particular passion of his and one that had ensured Gold Coast's youth league team was consistently one of the best.\nWalking back into the meeting after a break, Palmer told Buckley he had a few more conditions to add to his offer, which was written on a piece of paper. In return for his money, Palmer wanted to become Socceroos team manager and national technical director.\nBuckley was stunned. A six-hour meeting that had shown potential had suddenly turned farcical. Needless to say, Buckley turned the offer down.\nLowy and Buckley also had issues with the young one-time billionaire Nathan Tinkler, who would take over the Newcastle team in 2010.\nTinkler had been enraged when Palmer had told him he had paid nowhere near the $5 million for his team that Tinkler said he had for Newcastle. He threatened to terminate his licence and Lowy was forced to fly to Brisbane to meet Tinkler at a private plane hanger and cajole the young mining magnate back into the fold.\nAn uneasy peace would exist for several years before Tinkler's personal financial problems would eventually lead to the FFA stripping him of his licence to own the Jets (held by Hunter Sports Group) after the 2014-15 season had finished in May.\n\"HSG has behaved in a deplorable way towards the players and staff of the club in failing to meet basic obligations to pay wages,\" said now FFA CEO David Gallop. \"Anyone who takes control of a sporting club has an obligation to respect the people and the traditions of that club.\"\nWhile debts were reported as being $2.7 million when the FFA took Tinkler's licence on May 20, 2015, that number had ballooned to more than $22 million – including Tinkler's loans of more than $17 million to the club – when a creditor's report was lodged in June.\nThe report revealed that when Tinkler had placed the club into voluntary administration, the Jets had only $605 in the bank, $88 in office petty cash, gym equipment, some outdated merchandise and a 2009 Hyundai i30.\nBy the end, an owner who had once offered to double the wages of his coach, and who had shelled out $1 million to bring David Beckham to town, had fallen so far from grace that the list of his creditors included a local physiotherapist owed $13,750, Australia Post, owed $3570.11, Pixieland children's parties, $175, and a pharmacy, $232.50.\nEnd of an era That move had come just after a memorable 2015 grand final, the league's 10th in what had been a tumultuous decade.\nBut the match Grand Final was almost overshadowed by a moment of tragedy. Lowy, by now aged 84, was on stage to present Melbourne Victory captain Mark Milligan and his team with the A-League trophy, but slipped and somersaulted spectacularly off the platform, crashing heavily to the ground below.\nThe crowd held its breath as players and officials rushed to the FFA chairman's aid. After collecting himself, Lowy rose and climbed back onto the stage to present the trophy, and the jubilant celebrations on and off the field resumed, though the billionaire would undergo brain surgery two months later.\nLowy says he is satisfied with the decade under his watch, and with football's growth in that period as his time in the sport draws to an end as he steps down as FFA chairman in November – potentially to be replaced by his son, Steven, in a controversial move.\nThe elder Lowy is cautiously optimistic about the sport's future in Australia. \"The job of building the game is never done, but I'm hugely satisfied with our progress,\" he says. \"I said back in 2003 that this would be a 10-to-20-year project, just to build the foundations, and that prediction has proven accurate.\n\"But I knew on the night of our Asian Cup victory [in January against South Korea in Sydney, the first Socceroos international trophy in its history] that there was no turning back for the game. The nation embraced football and the Socceroos – you could feel it.\n\"Football was finally in the mainstream, and that was the night when all the hard work and effort came together. It made me very proud to be Australian to see what football can do for our country.\"\nThis is an extract from A-League: The Inside Story of the Tumultuous First Decade by John Stensholt and Shaun Mooney, published by Nero, $32.99.\nKate Ellis, then federal sports minister, visited Gauteng in South Africa in 2010, where she watched traditional dancers at Mohlakano Primary and Frank Lowy announced that the FFA would donate one million rand to the school for new desks.
