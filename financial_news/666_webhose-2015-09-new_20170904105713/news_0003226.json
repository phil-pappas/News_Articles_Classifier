This is Audi’s first full redesign of its three-row, seven-seat … \nDETROIT (AP) -- The 2016 model year has plenty of workhorses, including new versions of the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Titan pickups, Chevrolet Malibu and Kia Optima sedans and the Honda Civic small car. \nBut it also has some sparkling show horses. Ford, Audi, Ferrari and Acura all have new supercars. Cadillac is launching the racetrack-ready CTS-V. Dodge is unleashing its fastest Viper ever, and Lamborghini has amped up the power in its Aventador. Drivers with a smaller budget can also have a lot of fun in the new Ford GT350, Audi TT or Mazda MX-5 Miata. \nHyper luxury is in: Bentley is releasing its first SUV and Mercedes has a $189,350 Maybach version of its S-Class sedan with its own fragrance system. The new top-of-the-line Range Rover SVAutobiography starts at just under $200,000. \nCarmakers haven't completely forgotten about fuel economy. Many are using more aluminum and high-strength steel to drop weight and improve fuel economy. The new Audi Q7 SUV is 717 pounds lighter than the previous version, while the new Chevrolet Camaro is up to 300 pounds lighter. \nToyota is introducing a new Prius hybrid and a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai, which will be sold in California. Hyundai is releasing a hybrid version of the Sonata sedan. Chevrolet has a new Volt hybrid that goes for 53 miles on battery power alone, and Mercedes, Audi and BMW have new plug-in hybrids. \nHere are new or significantly refreshed cars and trucks coming in the 2016 model year, by brand: \n___ \nACURA \nILX: The small sports sedan gets a significant freshening with a new 2.4-liter direct-injected four-cylinder engine that puts out 201 horsepower. It's linked to an eight-speed dual clutch transmission. It also gets new front and rear styling with jeweled LED headlights, as well as better noise insulation and thicker door glass. Went on sale in February. Starts at $27,900 excluding shipping. \nRDX: Midsize lux SUV is refreshed with a new, more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine that puts out 279 horsepower. The RDX gets updated, rounder styling and jeweled LED headlights. Starts at $35,270 without shipping. Went on sale in April. \nMDX: Luxury people-hauler with three rows of seats gets a new nine-speed automatic transmission and a top-end luxury trim line. Went on sale in February starting at $42,865 excluding shipping. \nNSX: Acura's build-to-order supercar is all new with a 550-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 and a three-electric-motor sport hybrid system. The mid-mounted engine is mated to a new nine-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The NSX also comes with a multi-material frame that keeps it rigid but lightweight with crisp handling, Acura says. The all-wheel-drive supercar also gets a sleeker design with 10 air-cooled heat exchangers for the powertrain. Due out in the spring with a starting price of about $155,000. \n___ \nAUDI \nA3 SPORTBACK E-TRON: This is the first plug-in hybrid Audi to hit the market. The five-seat wagon combines a 1.4-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery hidden under the rear seats. It can be driven in electric mode for up to 19 miles; in hybrid mode, the car decides whether to use the motor, the gas engine or a combination of the two. Fuel economy numbers haven't yet been released. Recharging through a 120-volt outlet takes eight hours; recharging through a 240-volt outlet takes two hours and 15 minutes. Home installation of a 240-volt outlet and home charging station is optional. The Sportback e-tron goes on sale in October starting at $37,900. \nA6/A7: Audi's A6 midsize sedan, last redesigned in 2011, gets some significant updates. The front and rear have a taut new design and there are new LED headlights and a wider grille. The A6 has a new, more powerful base engine: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 252 horsepower, up from 220 horsepower in the previous model. The front-wheel-drive version is paired with a new, seven-speed transmission, while the all-wheel-drive quattro version has an eight-speed transmission. Both the A6 and its sibling, the coupe-like A7, also get a new 3.0-liter V6 engine option with 333 horsepower, up 23 horsepower from the previous model. Inside, there's a new wireless hotspot for up to eight devices in the car. There are also new safety features, including night vision with animal detection. The 2016 A6 and A7 went on sale this spring; the A6 starts at $46,200, the A7 at $68,300. \nTT: The third generation TT coupe has a sportier, more muscular design and new LED headlights. Audi used more high-strength steel and aluminum to make the new TT lighter and stiffer. The TT coupe and roadster have a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 220 horsepower; the sporty TTS coupe gets a turbocharged four-cylinder with 292 horsepower. Both are paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Inside, there's a fully digital instrument cluster and the most advanced version of Audi's infotainment system, which reads newspaper headlines and Twitter alerts and can access more than 7,000 Web radio stations. The 2016 TT went on sale this summer, starting at $42,900. \nQ7: This is Audi's first full redesign of its three-row, seven-seat SUV in nearly a decade. It has a shorter, leaner, more wagon-like look than its predecessor. Audi managed to shave 717 pounds off the Q7 by using more lightweight materials; the doors, engine hood and rear hatch are all made of aluminum. Audi says the weight savings help make the Q7 26 percent more fuel efficient. U.S. buyers have three engine choices: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder rated at 252 horsepower; a 3.0-liter turbodiesel with 272 horsepower; or a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 with 333 horsepower. Inside, the Q7 will be Audi's first vehicle that lets drivers access certain smartphone apps through Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto. The Q7 goes on sale early next year. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the current Q7 starts at $48,300. \nR8: The second generation of Audi's R8 supercar has a racier, more chiseled look and a top speed of 200.7 miles per hour. It can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds. Thanks to new construction with more extensive aluminum and carbon fiber, the R8 is 110 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. The V10 mid-engine comes in two variants: one with 540 horsepower and 398 pound-feet of torque and one with 610 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. The second is Audi's fastest and most powerful series-production Audi ever. An electric version, the R8 e-tron, is also available. It has a range of nearly 280 miles, up from 133 miles in the outgoing model. The R8 is already on sale in Europe, starting at $180,980. The U.S. sale date hasn't been announced. \n___ \nBENTLEY \nBENTAYGA: Bentley's first SUV — named for a rugged peak in the Canary Islands — goes on sale early next year. It has an aluminum body and a frame of aluminum and high-strength steel, a Bentley first. It's powered by a 12-cylinder engine, which Bentley says will make it the fastest production SUV in the world. Pricing hasn't been announced, but it's likely to be north of its nearest competitor, the $138,000 Range Rover Autobiography. \n___ \nBMW \n3 SERIES: The 340i high-performance variant of BMW's most popular line gets a new inline 3-Liter six-cylinder twin turbo that puts out 320 horsepower, 20 better than the current model. There's also the new 330e plug-in hybrid that can go 22 miles on battery power and puts out 250 horsepower. Otherwise, the small BMW sedans and sport wagons get a freshening with a retuned chassis, revamped electric power steering and sportier fronts. Sale date and pricing not announced yet. 340i goes on sale in the fall. Pricing hasn't been revealed. \n7 SERIES: The all-new flagship large sedan gets up to 190 pounds lighter and comes with an improved ride and better handling. BMW says it used a lot of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic in the passenger area to help shed the weight. In the U.S. it comes as a 740i and 750i xDrive. The 750i gets a revamped 4.4-liter V8 engine with 445 horsepower. 740i gets latest generation 3-liter inline turbocharged six with 320 hp. Plug-in hybrid 740e coming next year. Can go 23 miles on battery power alone. The 740i starts at $81,300 without shipping, while the 750i xDrive starts at $97,400. Both are available in the fall. \nX1: New for 2016, the small SUV gets a roomier interior, more space for cargo and a new 2-liter twin-turbo four-cylinder engine that puts out 228 horsepower. It's mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. BMW says a new chassis enhances handling and ride comfort over the current model. New version is 1.7 inches taller than the old one. Goes on sale in the fall. Price hasn't been released. \nX5: BMW's first plug-in hybrid SUV joins the lineup, the X5 xDrive40e. The midsize SUV can go 13 miles on battery power and zero to 60 in 6.5 seconds. It comes with a 2-liter twin-turbo four-cylinder gas engine plus an electric motor. Combined, they put out 308 horsepower. Available in the fall. Price not yet announced. \n___ \nBUICK \nCASCADA: Buick goes for a little ragtop bling with the Cascada, an American version of a stylish Opel convertible from Europe. The four-seater is the brand's first convertible in a quarter-century, and it comes with a turbocharged 200-horsepower engine, and a safety system that deploys rollover protection bars behind the rear seats if the car detects that a crash is possible. The insulated soft top can be opened in 17 seconds while traveling up to 31 miles per hour. Price hasn't been released yet. The convertible is due in showrooms early next year. \n___ \nCADILLAC \nATS-V: High-performance version of Caddy's small sports sedan and coupe. Comes with a 3.6-liter twin-turbo engine that puts out 464 horsepower and the choice of eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmissions. Sedan starts at $60,465, the coupe at $62,665, both excluding shipping. Already on sale. \nCTS-V: It's a new iteration of the racetrack-ready CTS based on the lighter and leaner new version of the midsize sports car. It's the most powerful car in Cadillac's 112-year history with a 640-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter V8 mated to an eight-speed automatic tranny. Starts at $83,995 without shipping. On sale now. \nCT6: Cadillac goes back to its roots with a new rear-drive luxury land yacht that isn't supposed to behave like one. The CT6 has an aluminum-intensive body with 11 different materials for strength, performance and efficiency. GM says it's lighter than the smaller BMW 5-Series. Buyers can choose from a new 3-liter twin-turbo V6 with 400 horsepower, plus two less-powerful engines from the previous generation. Night vision that helps identify people and large animals with heat signatures on a dashboard display. Pricing hasn't been announced. On sale early next year. \nXT5: The first of the new generation of GM sport utilities is a replacement for the aging SRX midsize SUV. GM will release details later this year. \n___ \nCHEVROLET \nCAMARO: The classic Chevy muscle car slims down to fit on the frame of a Cadillac ATS small sports sedan. And it gets something that's almost unheard of in a muscle car: a standard four-cylinder engine. The sixth-generation Camaro loses 200 to 300 pounds over the 2015 model, and it's also shorter. And the new turbocharged 2-liter four is nothing to be embarrassed about. It puts out 275 horsepower, more than many V8s from years ago. But buyers also can choose a 335-horsepower V6 or 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 engine. Starts at $26,695, excluding shipping. Due in showrooms in the fall. \nCRUZE: Chevy's now 5-year-old pedestrian-looking compact car is replaced with a more stylish, aerodynamic-looking sedan that's longer and 250 pounds lighter. GM engineers say the new Cruze addresses the faults of the old one, which had a noisy underpowered engine, a cramped back seat and bland styling. Gone are two older four-cylinder engines, both with 138 horsepower. They're replaced by an all-new 153-horsepower 1.4-liter turbo four. Six-speed manual is standard and a new six-speed automatic is available. It's due in showrooms in the spring. Price hasn't been announced. \nMALIBU: General Motors makes another run at the popular midsize car segment. But if the sleeker and lighter new Malibu runs and handles as well as it looks, Chevy might make a dent in the market now controlled mainly by Honda and Toyota. The new sedan has a wide stance and a coupe-like look that's lower than the old version for better aerodynamics. A longer wheelbase creates more room inside the redesigned model, including 1.3 inches of additional rear-seat legroom. Comes standard with a new 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 160 horsepower. It's smaller and lighter than the previous four-cylinder, helping to cut 300 pounds of weight. GM says highway mileage will rise 1 mpg to 37. There's also a turbocharged 2-liter four-cylinder with 250 horsepower and an eight-speed automatic transmission. A gas-electric hybrid version gets an estimated 48 mpg in combined city and highway driving. Gasoline versions available in December and hybrid in the spring. Pricing not announced. \nSPARK: The Korean-made inexpensive Chevy mini-car gets revamped with a more powerful 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 98 horsepower, 14 more than the current model. It also looks less bug-eyed and more modern, with a lower roof line, jeweled headlamps and a rounded front end. Choice of a continuously variable transmission or five-speed manual. Has 10 air bags for safety. Price hasn't been announced. Due in showrooms in the fall. \nVOLT: Chevy's gas-electric hybrid gets sleeker looks and increased battery range in a redesign for 2016. The new Volt can go 53 miles on battery power before a new 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine kicks in to generate electricity and keep the car going. The current version goes only 38 miles on electricity. The new gas-powered generator also is more efficient than the current model. When it's on, the Volt gets 42 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving, 5 mpg better than the current car. The more aerodynamic look of the new Volt comes with a price, though. Rear-seat headroom is shallow, as is legroom. The new Volt is due out in the fall, priced at $33,170 excluding shipping and a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric cars. \n___ \nDODGE \nVIPER ACR: It stands for American Club Racer, and it's the fastest street-legal Viper ever, according to the company. The ACR is designed to squeeze faster track lap times out of the venerable Dodge super car with a race-tuned suspension. It has high-performance Kumho racing tires and is powered by the Viper's hand-built 8.4-liter V-10 with 645 horsepower. Already on sale. Starts at $117,895, excluding shipping and a gas-guzzler tax. \n___ \nFERRARI \n488 GTB, 488 SPIDER: New V8-powered sports cars that replace the 458 Italia and Spider. Each are powered by a 3.9-liter turbocharged motor that puts out 641 horsepower and takes the cars from zero to 62 miles per hour in a screaming 3 seconds. GTB is more aerodynamic than their predecessors with a double front spoiler and a new rear spoiler. The Spider has a retractable hard top. GTB available later this fall for about $245,000. Spider hits showrooms next year at about $275,000. \n___ \nFIAT \n500X: Fiat gets a much-needed small crossover SUV to take advantage of the worldwide SUV craze. The bulked-up 500 keeps the brand's cute European styling but can seat five comfortably. Choice of two engines, a 1.4-liter, 160-horsepower turbo four mated to a six-speed manual transmission and a 2.4-liter, 180 horsepower four with a nine-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive version has a rear axle that disconnects when it's not needed, for better fuel economy. Already on sale. Starts at $20,000 excluding shipping. \n___ \nFORD \nGT: After a decade's absence, Ford's GT returns at the end of 2016. The chiseled supercar looks more like a Ferrari than a Ford. It will get more than 600 horsepower with its mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, which is mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission. It's Ford's most expensive vehicle ever, with a price tag around $400,000. The company plans to make just 250 GTs per year for the next several years. \nSHELBY GT350/GT350R: The GT350 is a performance version of the new Mustang, which went on sale last fall. It boasts a howling, 5.2-liter V8 engine with 526 horsepower. The aluminum hood is lower and more sloped than on the regular Mustang, for better aerodynamics. The inside is spare; chrome and bright finishes were removed to prevent sun glare from distracting the driver. If the GT350 isn't enough, enthusiasts can check out the GT350R, a pure racing car that's 130 pounds lighter than the GT350 thanks to the removal of anything extra, including air conditioning, rear seats and even carpet. There are carbon fiber wheels and a big rear spoiler for even faster cornering. Production will be limited. The GT350 starts at $49,995, which includes $1,300 for a gas-guzzler tax, which applies to cars with combined fuel economy under 22.5 mpg. The GT350R starts at $63,495. \n___ \nHONDA \nCIVIC: The current Civic compact car strayed from its roots with bland styling, a cheap interior and lackluster performance. An emergency refresh after a year on the market improved it, but still didn't offer much excitement. That should change with the 2016, or 10th generation, model. Honda claims it will be the sportiest Civic ever, and judging from the fastback look of the coupe, the company may be right. The new Civic gets two new engines: a normally aspirated direct-injected four-cylinder with an undisclosed size, and a 1.5-liter, direct-injection turbo four-cylinder. Specifications haven't been released. They're mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. Sedan debuts later this fall, while the coupe comes in the winter. Prices haven't been released yet. \nPILOT: Honda's biggest SUV gets re-engineered for 2016, shedding its worn-out boxy look for a more sculpted body that mimics its smaller cousin, the CR-V. It comes with an all-new 3.5-liter, direct-injected V6 with 280 horsepower, 30 more than the old version. It also gets two new automatic transmissions, either a six-speed or an optional nine-speed. The new power plant and transmission help the Pilot get up to 27 miles per gallon on the highway, two more than the 2015 model. For those who want luxury, the Pilot also gets a new Elite grade with a panoramic roof and second-row captain's chairs. Went on sale in June. Starts at $29,995 without shipping. \n___ \nHYUNDAI \nSONATA HYBRID: The gas-electric version of the Korean automaker's midsize car is new this year. The latest version gets a more powerful electric motor, a bigger battery pack and a revised transmission to boost fuel economy by about 10 percent. Car is powered mainly by a 2-liter direct-injected four-cylinder gas engine, with a more powerful 38-kilowatt electric motor. Combined they put out 193 horsepower. Hybrid is expected to get 39 miles per gallon in the city and 44 mpg on the highway. Front and rear fascias and new wheels help it look different than standard Sonatas. Already on sale. Starts at $26,000 excluding shipping. \nTUCSON: Hyundai's entry in the fast-growing small SUV market gets longer, wider, sleeker and more efficient. The automaker added 3 inches to the Tucson's length and made the SUV just over an inch wider. That increased passenger room and added more than 5 cubic feet to the cargo area. Suspension was bolstered to improve handling without hurting ride quality, Hyundai says. The old version's 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is gone. Base model has a 2-liter, 164 horsepower four, while upper-level models get a 1.6-liter turbocharged four with 175 horsepower. The turbo engine gets a seven-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. An Eco version is expected to get 33 mpg on the highway, while Sport and Limited front-wheel-drive versions get an estimated 30 mpg highway. That's 3 mpg better than the outgoing model. Already on sale. Starts at $22,700 excluding shipping. \n___ \nJAGUAR \nXF: All-new big luxury sedan goes on sale in October with a lightweight aluminum-intensive frame, a coupe-like look and more space inside. The second-generation car comes with a 3-liter supercharged V6, and buyers can chose between 340 and 380 horsepower versions in either rear or all-wheel-drive. The all-wheel-drive model is 265 pounds lighter than the previous version. All engines are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions. Price hasn't been announced. \n___ \nKIA \nOPTIMA: Kia's best-seller in the U.S., the Optima midsize car, gets its first full redesign since 2011. It's longer, wider and stiffer, and has a bigger interior. There are three engine choices, including a new 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 178 horsepower. Two other engines — a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 185 horsepower and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 247 horsepower — are carried over from the previous Optima. Inside, Kia will soon offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow drivers to access certain apps from their smartphones on the car's 8-inch touchscreen. The 2016 Optima goes on sale at the end of this year. Pricing and fuel economy haven't been announced, but the 2015 Optima started at $21,690 and got up to 27 mpg in combined city/highway driving. \nSORENTO: The Sorento crossover, last redesigned in 2010, gets a thicker, brawnier look for 2016. It's longer and slightly wider and has a more aggressive grille with narrowed headlights. The Sorento comes in five- or seven-passenger configurations; the five-passenger gets either a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower or a new 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 240 horsepower, while the seven-passenger gets a 290-horsepower V6. Inside, there's more headroom, legroom and cargo room than before. Kia is offering new safety technology, including a forward collision warnings system and blind-spot detection. The Sorento gets up to 24 mpg in combined city/highway driving with the base engine, and up to 21 mpg with the V6. The Sorento, which went on sale in January, starts at $24,900. \n___ \nLAMBORGHINI \nAVENTADOR 750-4 SUPERVELOCE: If you have a spare $500,000, the new performance version of the Aventador — dubbed the Superveloce — might be for you. The track-ready race car has a 740-horsepower V12 engine — up from 700 in the Aventador — and is 110 pounds lighter thanks to more use of carbon fiber. It's the fastest series-production Lamborghini ever, with a blisteringly fast 0-62 mph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 217 mph. It gets 14.7 mpg in combined city/highway driving if anyone cares. The Superveloce went on sale this summer, starting at $492,595. That includes a $3,700 gas-guzzler tax and a $3,495 shipping charge. A convertible version — the SV Roadster — goes on sale next spring for $530,075. \n___ \nLEXUS \nRX: Lexus' best-selling RX SUV gets its first major redesign since 2010. It has a polarizing design with a lot of sharp angles, including L-shaped LED front lights and a big spindle grille. The roof appears to float above the windows thanks to blacked-out pillars. Inside, there's more rear leg room and an available 12.3-inch dashboard monitor with a full-screen map. The RX is powered by an upgraded 3.5-liter V6 with 300 horsepower and a new eight-speed transmission. A hybrid version of the RX will also be available. Fuel economy and pricing will be released when the RX goes on sale later this year. \nGS 200t, GS F: The Lexus GS family of midsize cars gets two new members: the 200t and the GS F. The 200t is a rear-wheel-drive sedan with a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 241 horsepower; for comparison, the GS 350 gets 311 horsepower with its 3.5-liter V6, and the hybrid GS 450h gets 338 horsepower with its V6 and electric motor combination. Lexus says the 200t will get up to 33 mpg in highway driving, nearly beating the hybrid. The high-performance GS F has a 5.0-liter v8 with 467 horsepower. It also sits lower and wider than the other GS models, with big air vents and carbon fiber accents. All four versions of the GS get Lexus' signature spindle grille for 2016, along with new, standard LED headlights. New safety features include pre-collision warning with pedestrian detection. The new GS lineup goes on sale later this year. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the outgoing GS 350 started at $48,600. \nLX 570: Lexus says it changed everything but the door panels on the eight-passenger LX 570 SUV. The front gets Lexus' signature spindle grille and new LED headlights. The 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V8 engine is paired with a new eight-speed transmission to improve performance and efficiency. There's also a new driving mode selection system, which adjusts the powertrain and suspension depending on the driver's choice of eco, comfort or sport modes. New safety features include dynamic radar cruise control, which works at high and low speeds. Fuel economy and pricing haven't yet been released. \n___ \nLAND ROVER \nRANGE ROVER: A new, 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 engine is being offered for the first time in North America on the 2016 Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. It has 254 horsepower, which is less than the 340-horsepower supercharged V6 on the gasoline model, but it gets 25 mpg in city/highway driving, which is 32 percent better than the gas option. Other new options include a hands-free tailgate, which opens when the driver swipes a foot underneath. A diesel-powered Range Rover Sport starts at $66,450; a diesel Range Rover starts at $86,450. \nRANGE ROVER SVAutobiography: The SVAutobiography replaces the Autobiography Black at the top of the Range Rover lineup. It's the most powerful production Range Rover in the model's 45-year history, with a 550-horsepower, 5.0-liter supercharged V8 engine. The engine is shared with the Range Rover Sport SVR, but specially tuned for the SVAutobiography. New options include two-tone paint, with black on top and a choice of nine colors for the bottom, and a unique front grille. The SVAutobiography gets 15 mpg in city/highway driving. It goes on sale this fall starting at $199,495. \n___ \nLINCOLN \nMKX: Lincoln's mid-size crossover has a sleeker, less bulbous design and an updated grille to match other new Lincolns. Under the hood, there's a base 3.7-liter V6 engine with 303 horsepower or a new 335-horsepower, 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6. Both are mated to a six-speed, push-button transmission. The base engine gets up to 20 mpg in combined city/highway driving, while the EcoBoost gets 21. The MKX is the first Ford or Lincoln to offer pre-collision alert with pedestrian detection, which warns the driver of an impending collision and applies the brakes automatically.

At 168.3 inches long, it's a little more than 10 inches shorter than the CX-5 SUV, but it shares the same swooping, \"soul of motion\" design Mazda has adopted throughout its lineup. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 146 horsepower, paired to a six-speed transmission. It gets an estimated 31 mpg in combined city/highway driving.

Thanks to more extensive use of high-strength steel, the new Miata weighs 150 pounds less than the previous model, improving fuel economy and driving dynamics. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is rated at 155 horsepower. Paired with either the standard six-speed manual transmission or the optional six-speed automatic, it gets an estimated 30 mpg in combined city/highway driving, a 25 percent improvement over the most efficient previous model. The MX-5 starts at $24,915. \n___ \nMERCEDES-BENZ \nC350 Plug-In Hybrid: The midsize C-Class family gets a plug-in electric hybrid, one of 10 hybrids the brand plans to launch by 2017.

Under the hood is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 241 horsepower and a new nine-speed transmission. Fuel economy hasn't been announced, but the GLC is 176 pounds lighter than the outgoing model thanks to more extensive use of aluminum and high-strength steel. There is a full suite of safety features, including a system that detects an impending rear-end collision and alerts the traffic behind it by operating the hazard warning lights. The GLC goes on sale in November, starting at $38,950. \nGLE COUPE: The GLE Coupe is the newest member of the GLE-class (formerly M-Class) of midsize SUVs.

Under the hood is an updated version of the 300-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 engine from the outgoing Maxima. It's mated to a new continuously variable transmission. Those revisions helped increase the Maxima's highway fuel economy to 30 mpg; city fuel economy is 22 mpg.

The Mirai has an electric battery powered by hydrogen, and it emits nothing but water vapor from its tailpipe. It can go 312 miles between fill-ups and gets the equivalent of 67 miles per gallon. Like the gas-electric hybrid Prius, which it resembles, the Mirai is meant to be instantly recognizable as something different. Its pointy hood sits above huge, triangular air intakes, and the sides are swept back and deeply grooved. It could be tough to get your hands on one, since only a few hundred will be made in the first year.

It's the first full redesign for the Tacoma in 12 years. The frame and body have more high-strength steel, to make them lighter but more rigid and better for off-road driving. Toyota also gave the Tacoma a new chiseled face and hexagonal grille, to better match its bigger sibling, the Tundra. The Tacoma has a 159-horsepower, 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine and an optional 3.5-liter V6 with 278 horsepower. Both are paired with a new six-speed transmission; six-speed and five-speed manuals are also available.

Volvo also introducing a Cross Country version of the S60 with a higher ride height and standard all-wheel-drive. Inscription goes on sale in September and starts at $38,700 excluding shipping. \nXC90: Volvo's big seven-seat SUV is all new for 2016, and it's loaded with luxury and safety features.
