In the event of wrongdoing, such as futures manipulation, the CFTC will be able to bring charges against bad actors.\nIf a company wants to operate a trading platform for Bitcoin derivatives or futures, it will need to register as a swap execution facility or designated contract market, just like the CME Group. And Coinflip—the target of the CFTC action—is hardly the only company that provides a platform to trade Bitcoin derivatives or futures.\n“While there is a lot of excitement surrounding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets,\" said Aitan Goelman, the CFTC&apos;s director of enforcement, in a statement.\nA request for comment sent to Coinflip&apos;s chief executive via LinkedIn was not immediately returned. Coinflip consented to the order without admitting or denying any of its findings or conclusions.\nSince Coinflip is not alone in providing a platform to trade Bitcoin derivatives or futures, Goelman&apos;s words imply that other unregulated exchanges could soon attract the attention of the CFTC.\nAs such, the CFTC is bringing dealings in Bitcoin, long prized for its anonymity, into the light. While this could help clean up U.S. trading around the product, potentially helping to avoid a repeat of the Mt. Gox escapade , it is also likely to increase the cost of doing business.\nBitcoin has been trading sideways throughout 2015:\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7231-15\\", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b810157c-b651-11e2-93ba-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3lhzl9L6M\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iD7Q6nSPXRqc/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/12/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-is-not-a-currency/\\"], "published": "2015-09-18T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:02:27.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
