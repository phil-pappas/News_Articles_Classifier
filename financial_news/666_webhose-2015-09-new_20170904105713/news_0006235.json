The spread on Malaysia’s $1 billion 3.043 percent 2025 bonds declined 1.5 basis points.\n“A Fed no hike with dovish guidance is the most positive outcome that could have occurred for emerging-market assets,” said Gaurav Singhal, a credit analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong. “We expect a relief rally, with Indonesia and Malaysia sovereign credits to benefit the most from this outcome because of high foreign ownership of their securities.”\nThat would mark a turnaround for the nations’ debt after spreads rose to records last month as Southeast Asia’s slowing growth, China’s devaluation of the yuan and the outlook for higher U.S. interest rates sparked a selloff. The rout also sent the ringgit and the rupiah to their lowest levels since 1998 earlier this month. Addressing the turbulence, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said policy makers focused particularly on China and emerging markets.\nIssuance Impact Continuing speculation over the Fed’s next steps “ could keep a lid on overall issuance levels between now and year-end,” said Mark Reade, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Asian dollar supply will still come, but it may be in fits and starts as we have seen in the past couple of months.”\nSales of notes in the U.S. currency by corporates in Asia excluding Japan have dropped 7.4 percent this year to $126.1 billion as many firms including Chinese developers return to domestic financing markets to avoid foreign exchange risks and for lower funding costs, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.\n“You can either interpret the Fed decision as them signaling lower rates for longer which is good for credit, or the biggest central bank acknowledging rising risk in emerging markets, which is negative for risk assets,” said Leong Wai Hoong, a senior money manager in Singapore at Nikko Asset Management Co. “For now, credit spreads appear to tighten a little bit, so it should be a brief rally.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:55:17.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
