That chimes with the policy makers’ view that it would be premature to adjust their outlook when the U.K.’s expansion remains on track.\nWhile the BOE kept its key rate at a record-low 0.5 percent last week, Ian McCafferty voted for an increase.

Still, markets aren’t so sure, with futures contracts only fully pricing in an increase by the second half of the year.\n“I don’t believe events in China today are sufficiently worrisome to cause a change of thinking,” said Peter Dixon, a global economist at Commerzbank AG in London. “For one thing, the market concerns overstate the extent of the Chinese economic slowdown.”\nBank of England Benchmark Rate\nMcCafferty will continue to push for an increase through the end of the year, according to 88 percent of the economists surveyed, with one other member forecast to join his side of the argument by December.
