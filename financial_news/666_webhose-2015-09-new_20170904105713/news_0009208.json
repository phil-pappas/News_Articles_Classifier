Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Two Saturdays ago, buyers' agent David Morrell attended an auction in the upmarket Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris.\nHe wasn't expecting the renovated Californian bungalow to shoot the lights out, but on that first Saturday after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott as prime minister, Mr Morrell was surprised.\n\"I was expecting they would struggle to get to $2.5 million,\" he said. \"I haven't seen an auction like that for the best part of three years. There were 12 people bidding. They got their confidence from somewhere.\"\nThe house sold for $3 million.\nMuch has been made of the boost given to business and consumer confidence by Mr Turnbull's successful wresting of the Liberal Party leadership and prime ministership from Mr Abbott.\nIn the top end of residential real estate where business confidence underpins the sentiment of buyers and vendors, it is likely that the sector will also get a lift.\nFlow-through effect On Sydney's prestigious Lower North Shore, the industry is counting on it.\n \"I think the change of prime minister will provide a boost to business confidence and this is very important for the prestige real estate sector,\" said Tim Foote, the principal of real estate agency Belle Property Mosman.\n\"When business is doing well and investing for future growth, there is a flow-through effect to prestige property prices.\"\nOf course, the weaker Australian dollar is likely to provide a lift to a prestige property sector that in Sydney has under-performed the sub-$2-million range, as expat and offshore buyers respond to relatively cheaper prices. But with the mid-high market now slowing , the tide could be turning.\nAnd while Mr Turnbull's political political timing was successful in engineering a party-room coup, he hadn't yet given the residential market a demonstrable boost, Mr Morrell said.\n\"The top end of the residential market has been dead since Malcolm got in because of school holidays,\" he said.\n\"There's hardly been a transaction that's happened. We won't see that for probably another three to four weeks when the market opens up, post-school holidays.\"\nFigures from Domain – owned by Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review – bear that out. Auction clearance rates on Sydney's Lower North Shore and Melbourne's inner east (including suburbs such as Toorak and South Yarra) have fallen since the weekend before the Liberal change of leadership.\nThe clearance rate in Sydney's eastern suburbs, which includes the Wentworth electorate of the Prime Minister and former Goldman Sachs banker, has risen significantly since August, but it posted its biggest single boost the weekend before Mr Turnbull's challenge. So unless Mr Turnbull was telling neighbours his political plans over the garden fence in the eastern suburbs where he also owns a number of properties, the rise is coincidental.\nStill, those neighbours will respond to a reviving sentiment, said Domain senior economist Andrew Wilson.\n\"Confidence is the key to all our markets,\" Dr Wilson said. \"There's no doubt that that eastern suburbs poster boy has put a spring in the step of some of his ilk.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-28T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:09:37.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
