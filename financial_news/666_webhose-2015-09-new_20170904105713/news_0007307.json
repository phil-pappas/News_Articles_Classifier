Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Debra Cleveland If you're booking travel insurance for your next holiday, remember what happened to all those tourists stuck in Bali intermittently over the past few months thanks to volcanic ash? Imagine many of them making a claim on their holiday insurance only to find their out-of-pocket expenses for more than a week's worth of accommodation and meals were barely covered.\nThat's because comprehensive travel policies vary widely in payouts for delays. Some pay as little as $1000 and others as much as $50,000.\nWhen buying holiday insurance most of us focus on the cost of the cover, how much the excess is and what the caps are for claims on cameras and phones. But industry insiders say it should all be about delay cover because that's what differentiates policies.\nCraig Morrison, CEO of Southern Cross Travel Insurance (SCTI) , says most policies offer unlimited medical cover and high cancellation limits. But while they may all look similar, it's worth digging down particularly on delay benefits because that's where the biggest differences are. Since SCTI's delay benefit is $30,000 – much higher than many other other insurers who commonly pay between $1000 and $5000 – it's obviously to his advantage to point this out.\nBut holidaymaker Colin*, whose family of seven was stranded in Bali for eight extra days, will pay much more attention to the small print in travel policies next time he travels.\nHe was out of pocket by $7000 on flights and $3000 on accommodation. The family had to book flights out on Virgin as Jetstar couldn't get them back to Sydney for three or four weeks. The cost of these flights has been refunded by Jetstar.\nColin has just submitted the accommodation claim and says he was not covered for meals. In terms of accommodation his policy would not have covered him beyond 10 days.\nCut the excess So how else do travel policies differ? I've long been a fan of Travel Insurance Direct (TID) because for a slightly higher premium you can reduce the excess to nil. That means when I make a claim, I'm not out of pocket straight away.\nI'm off to South Africa soon and this week took out a policy with TID, paying $193.76 for cover for myself and my daughter for just under five weeks. I then remembered that because I'm over 50, I could have bought insurance from the recently started Boomers Travel Insurance .\nAs it happens, on price alone the TID cover is better. But were I much older and unable to get travel insurance elsewhere, Boomers is where I would go as there is no age limit.\nFurther, the Boomers delay cover is capped at a generous $50,000 per person. Also, if you face delays and you have left your pet at a boarder's, the policy will reimburse you up to $25 a day for extra pet-boarding fees. Boomers also has \"lifestyle\" packs – for example a golf deal that covers you for prepaid green fees in bad weather – and even pays you $250 for a hole in one!\nWhen it comes to travel insurance, says Peter Arnold of comparison website www.ratecity.com.au , the rule is to look for the exceptions. \"Details like how many hours your luggage needs to be delayed before the insurer will pay out on your claim, of just how much your policy with 'unlimited medical' is willing to pay for that chipped tooth can mean the difference between a comfortable claim and stacking some bitter disappointment on top of an already bad situation,\" he says.\n*Not his real name.\ndcleveland@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["https://www.scti.com.au/?gclid=CL-c1ZrB3McCFVIDvAodpVoIyQ", "http://www.travelinsurancedirect.com.au/", "http://boomerstravelinsurance.com.au/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DEBRACLEVELANDmoney/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/ClevelandAFR"], "published": "2015-09-04T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:10:20.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
