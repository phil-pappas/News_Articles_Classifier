Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg snapped up just over 110 million shares, taking his holding to 8.42pc. \nMyles Allsop, of UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , said: “Management now need to rebuild trust with investors and over-deliver on promises to unwind the de-rating.” \nThe risk-reward for copper is improving with supply closing and Mr Allsop said Glencore’s BBB crediting rating and balance sheet “look robust”, provided copper does not fall below $2/lb for a sustained period. \nLast week, the Switzerland-based company announced it would carry out the share placing as part of its debt reduction measures to bolster its balance sheet. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also said it would suspend its dividend and sell off assets. \nOn Tuesday, shares hit a fresh intraday low of 118.1p as the beleaguered miner came under further pressure from concerns over commodity prices. Three leading global thermal coal price benchmarks showed prices have fallen to levels last seen during the global financial crisis seven years ago. \nMeanwhile, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) issued a bearish note on the miner earlier in the week, warning its debt reduction measures may not be enough. However, the bank highlighted Glencore had tailored its balance sheet to withstand “a harsher commodity winter”. \nDavid Butler, of Barclays, said: “The company might have to take further action, but even then it doesn’t automatically go sub-investment grade, nor is it the end of the marketing business if it does.” \nThe stock was among the top FTSE risers in early trade, up 2.4pc to 131.2p. However, before 9am shares retreated, trading a mere 0.6pc higher. \nRivals BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) were off by 1.8pc and 2.1pc, as funds reduced their weightings in other miners, following the Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) share placing. \nOn the broader market, Britain’s benchmark index continued to climb higher, edging up 0.6pc to 6,175.08, buoyed by gains on Wall Street and in Asia overnight. \nRebecca O’Keeffe, of Interactive Investor, said: “With relentless debate about whether the Federal Reserve will finally start to raise rates, one might have anticipated that investor uncertainty would see equities drift lower - but markets have defied logic and are moving higher, as the most anticipated meeting of the year finally gets underway.” \nEuropean bourses also rose with the CAC in Paris 1.2pc higher, the German DAX also up 1.2pc and the Spanish IBEX climbing 0.9pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:27:56.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
