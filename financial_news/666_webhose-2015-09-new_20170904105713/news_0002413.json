Southern California Edison said its contracts with Infosys and Tata require both firms to follow all \"applicable laws.\"\nDisney declined to comment on the U.S. government reviews. A spokesman said the company's IT restructuring has led to a net increase of about 70 new in-house jobs. HCL declined to comment.\nThe lay-offs have prompted an outcry from some U.S. senators, several of whom also called for probes into abuses.\nCompanies such as Infosys that have a workforce composed of 15 percent or more H-1B workers are required to try recruiting U.S. workers first and attest they are not displacing Americans.\nBut they are exempt from these requirements if they pay H-1 B workers more than $60,000 or hire those with a graduate degree.\nExperts who have studied federal H-1B pay data say that in the vast majority of cases H-1B workers are paid more than $60,000, complicating enforcement of discrimination claims by the Justice Department or wrongful displacement at the Labor Department.\nFurther, the Labor Department cannot launch an investigation into alleged H-1B visa abuses unless it receives a complaint from a worker or credible third party.\n\"Qualified American workers are going to keep getting replaced by less expensive foreign workers,\" said Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley, one of several lawmakers planning to introduce a bill this year to bolster the Labor Department's powers.\n\"Current law hamstrings the Labor Department so bad actors go unchecked.\" (Reporting by Sarah N.
