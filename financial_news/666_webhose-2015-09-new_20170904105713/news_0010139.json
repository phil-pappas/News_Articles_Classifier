The phones will start shipping on Sept. 25.\nApple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is “on pace” to surpass the initial weekend sales from last year when Apple released its first set of large-screen iPhones. At the time, Apple said it sold 10 million iPhones in the first weekend of availability.\n“Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive and preorders this weekend were very strong around the world,” Muller said in a statement, noting that demand for the larger iPhone 6s Plus was “exceptionally strong.”\nApple is riding a wave of momentum from booming sales of last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The question hanging over the company is whether it can sustain that strong demand with its latest phones.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-preorders-strong-for-new-iphones-1442235019?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:23:22.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
