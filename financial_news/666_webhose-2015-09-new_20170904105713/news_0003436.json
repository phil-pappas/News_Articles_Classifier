For U.S. large-cap banks and specialty finance stocks, we recommend the latter: buy this dip,\" the Sept. 15 note said. BMO Capital Markets is a division of Bank of Montreal . \n\"Across the U.S. financial system, fundamental credit quality should continue to improve over the next year and flatten out thereafter, while bank capital strength remains more than adequate. Therefore, we use the Value versus Growth analysts to generate investment ideas among financial stocks,\" the note said. More Headlines 13 A+ Stocks to Buy with High Growth, Return on Invested Capital \nHere are BMO Capital Markets' top financial services stock picks for the rest of the year paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for additional perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nYTD Return: 6.9% BMO Capital Markets Price Target: $128 BMO Capital Markets Said: We recommend buying MasterCard as a long-term investment idea for investors capable of holding positions for at least two years. \nKey to our bullish long-term thesis is MA's growing capacity to return capital to shareholders. We believe MA could surprise positively with respect to the magnitude of share repurchases announced over the next two years, driven by strong growth in what we refer to as \"excess\" free cash flow. \nGlobal payments networks offer the best long-term secular growth opportunity among North American financial stocks, in our view, as global financial transactions continue to migrate from cash/check form onto electronic platforms. \nMA shares have fallen recently, due in part to investor concern regarding exposure to emerging markets; however, MA's growth has remained robust, with volume growth of more than 15% (constant - currency basis) throughout the emerging markets (as reported in 2Q15), and we remain more excited about growth in electronic payments in emerging markets (where penetration is low) than in developed markets (where penetration is high). \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates MASTERCARD INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate MASTERCARD INC (MA) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations and growth in earnings per share. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results. \" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 21.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 0.9%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. MA's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.23 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.24, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems. Current return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. When compared to other companies in the IT Services industry and the overall market, MASTERCARD INC's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has increased to $821.00 million or 12.62% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of -2.01%. MASTERCARD INC's earnings per share improvement from the most recent quarter was slightly positive. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, MASTERCARD INC increased its bottom line by earning $3.09 versus $2.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.36 versus $3.09).
