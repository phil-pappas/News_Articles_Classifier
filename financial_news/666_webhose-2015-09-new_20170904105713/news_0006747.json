Fulfilling our endeavour of creating a robust real estate ecosystem, the new tool is slated to be a game changer in the agent market both in terms of efficiency and quality of service,” Gupta said.\nWith Plat, Housing.com strengthens its technology know-how to better cater to the needs of the agent community. “This will help drive efficiencies in communications and operations such as posting leads and enhancing property showcase experience, thereby closing deals faster,” he said.\nBigBHK will empower its partners to manage their property portfolios with a comprehensive web-based property management solution.\n“Using BigBHKs robust technology software, partners can streamline their realty lifecycle encompassing rental accounting, e-invoicing, record management, complaint tracking, reports, inventory management, etc,” he said.\nBigBHK provides tenants access to a free platform to raise complaints, track rent dues and maintenance amount on a monthly basis.
