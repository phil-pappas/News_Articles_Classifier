The price was not disclosed but it was part of a broader portfolio sold off by GPT Group for $85 million representing a 40 per cent discount to the values held the year before.\nDelaware has spent about $50 million on the award-winning Lizard Island Resort with a comprehensive redevelopment program, including the upgrade of all 40 rooms and suites. The Resort is accessed via a flight from Cairns connecting 30 domestic and 18 international destinations.\nJLL Hotels and Hospitality Group's managing director for investment sales Mark Durran and vice-president for investment sales Andrew Langsford​ have been appointed to sell the assets.\n\"The Great Barrier Reef is the subject of renewed international investor interest due to strong trading results over the past 12 months and an excellent outlook as a result of numerous positive market influences,\" said Mr Langsford.\nDelaware North, which turns over $US2.9 billion ($4.2 billion) a year, is a private company, controlled by the Jacobs family for almost 100 years, and a successful manager of resorts in places such as Yosemite National Park and the Grand Canyon.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-09-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:09:32.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
