Written by: Jeremy Josse 09/04/15 - 8:44 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Today's jobs numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics were likely in the \"Goldilocks\" zone -- just right for the market. \nThe August data, which showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 173,000, were likely within just the right zone -- not too high and not too low -- to give the markets a tailwind heading into trading today. It's a curious situation for one of the most important readings on the health of the U.S. economy, about as close an indicator as we can get for up-to-date, accurate information on the macro-economic picture. \nThese days, when the data are positive -- when nonfarm payrolls rise significantly -- the Federal Reserve is more likely to increase interest rates , the thought of which could send markets lower. (While this hasn't happened in recent memory, if the data are poor, this could spook the market about U.S. economic fundamentals, even as it may not inspire a rate increase.) But, when the numbers are within the \"Goldilocks\" zone (so named for the fairy tale where the hero will only eat porridge that is just the right temperature), the markets experience a tailwind.
