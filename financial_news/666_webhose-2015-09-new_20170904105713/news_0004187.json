There are still several roads inside the villages that are blocked, but the main roads are open.\" \nShe said residents had been blockading the roads leading to the mines since last week for a number of reasons. \nOn Monday afternoon, dozens of villagers who live near the mine agreed to disrupt mining activity until the mine's management agreed to meet with them. \nVillagers near the company's open cast mine at Mapela, a village north-west of Polokwane, were protesting against the resolution that saw their children, who were attending school at Seritarita Secondary school, moved to another school in a neighbouring village. \nThey were moved from the school because of the effects the mine's blasting activities would have on them. Seritarita was operating close to the mine. The pupils were now being transported to a state-of-the-art school built by the company in Leruleng. \n'Children were being used as pawns' \nThe protesters were also demanding that the mine and construction company consider hiring locals. They accused Anglo American of neglecting their children and failing to provide transport. \nCommunity leader Charles Phaahla said they wanted a meeting with the company. He said the community was also angry that some companies contracted to the mine brought their own workers from elsewhere. \nSince the protest started, a local clinic built by the mine and Langa Traditional Council Offices have been set alight. \nIn addition to the damage, a truck was set a light along the N11 while transporting potatoes from local farms. \nThe protest also stalled schooling in the area, a process the education department said was worrying and costly. \nProvincial education spokesperson Naledzani Rasila said the children were being used as pawns in the battle between the mine and the community. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:38:22.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
