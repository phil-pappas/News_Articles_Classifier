More EM slump raises fears of capital controls \nMr Levy told journalists that the downgrade would serve to raise “awareness” in Congress — which has been battling the administration of President Dilma Rousseff over a proposed fiscal austerity programme — about the need to meet more ambitious budget targets, partly through raising taxes. \n“We think we have increasing awareness in Congress about the need for that, especially after yesterday’s events [the downgrade],” Mr Levy said. \nHis comments are unlikely to reassure markets, which have become increasingly sceptical about the ability of Ms Rousseff’s centre-left administration to deliver a promised fiscal austerity package. \nThe downgrade from triple B minus to double B plus with a negative outlook comes as Ms Rousseff is wrestling with a recession, record low approval ratings, the threat of impeachment by Congress and a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras in which senior congressional figures are implicated. \nBrazil was downgraded after last week backpedalling on an earlier commitment for a primary fiscal surplus — the budget balance before interest payments — of 0.7 per cent for 2016, instead projecting a consolidated deficit of 0.34 per cent. The weaker target was seen as a victory by fiscal doves in Ms Rousseff’s cabinet over the more hawkish Mr Levy, who has pledged to rebalance Brazil’s finances. \nOn Thursday Mr Levy insisted that the government was still aiming for the earlier target, which he said was necessary for arresting the growth of public debt, a position that was backed up by Ms Rousseff in an interview with business news group Valor Econômico. \n“We want to have all of the resources and spending compatible with achieving the 0.7 per cent, that’s the strategy,” he said. \nMoody’s and Fitch, the other major rating agencies, still have Brazil on investment grade. More video \n“This [the downgrade] is going to reinforce a trend that started to develop since July which was a gradual reduction of the footprint of exposure to Brazilian risk,” said Alberto Ramos, economist with Goldman Sachs in New York. \nThe immediate concern for the government from the rating downgrade is capital flight. About 20 per cent of government debt is held by foreigners. \nMany global institutional investors face restrictions on how much of their portfolios can be held in subinvestment grade credits. \nWhile only one of the major rating agencies has cut Brazil’s debt, if another follows the exodus could pick up steam and be matched by local investors. \nPrices for Brazilian government debt issued in dollars fell, pushing the yield on a $4.3bn bond due in 2025 up to 5.88 per cent, the highest since it was issued two years ago. The bond is held by a number of global asset managers including BlackRock , which reduced its position on Wednesday, along with Verde Asset Management, Brazil’s largest hedge fund. \n“Few EM-specific investors will be constrained to investment grade assets but there will be institutional investors who have to change their portfolios,” said Claudia Calich, emerging markets debt manager at M&G. \nOf more immediate concern for Ms Rousseff, however, is what the downgrade means for the future of Mr Levy. \nWhile respected as a competent finance minister, his austerity measures are facing resistance from influential cabinet colleagues Nelson Barbosa, planning minister, and Aloizio Mercadante, the president’s influential chief of staff, said Eurasia Group in a note. \nThe disagreements were shown by dramatic events last Thursday when Mr Levy suddenly cancelled a trip to Turkey for the G20 summit to attend a meeting with Ms Rousseff, stoking rumours he was about to resign. \nMs Rousseff and Mr Mercadante later announced their support for the finance minister. But some analysts believe the loss of investment grade will weaken him further. \n“Events over the past two weeks clearly increase the risks for the administration. Not only has Joaquim Levy’s permanence in government become more uncertain, but with it, Rousseff’s political standing,” said Eurasia Group head of country analysis Chris Garman on Thursday. \nWith additional reporting by Elaine Moore in London Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
