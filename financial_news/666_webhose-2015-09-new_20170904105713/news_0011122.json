In recent years there has also been extra spending needed due to technological change.\nAdvertisement \"There has been a high level of innovation in the credit cards market including the introduction of contactless payments, mobile payments, chip and PIN authorisation, anti-fraud measures and digitisation of services,\" Westpac said. The New Payments Platform, which will be in place by 2017, is costing banks about $1 billion.\nHowever, around $2 billion paid annually in interchange fees to banks by merchants pays for the cost of issuing cards, rewards programs, interest-free periods and the cost of fraud.\nWestpac said the decline in so called \"revolve\" rates – the percentage of card holders who pay interest – from 73.7 per cent to 64.1 per cent since January 2013 has had a \"far bigger impact on margins than the official cash rate reductions\", which were 0.75 per cent in the same period.\nEstimates by the Reserve Bank put the average \"spread\" banks make on cards above their cost of funds at around 9 per cent for all cards at average \"effective rates\" of 11.6 per cent for the March quarter. This is up from about 6 per cent in 2007. The spread is 14.75 per cent where interest is paid, which is now at effective rates of 17 per cent.\nSince 2011, it said effective rates had declined by between 1 and 2 per cent since the cash rate had declined by 2.75 per cent to 2 per cent\nANZ bank said higher spreads above funding on effective interest rates are justified because there is more risk in the economy than prior to the financial crisis.\n\"A fall in interest rates, by definition, is symptomatic of an economy that is or is likely to be performing below capacity,\" it said in its submission to a Senate credit card inquiry. \"The change in spread in recent years is consistent with these trends.\"\nAll banks say credit card competition is high and both ANZ and Westpac said credit cards are \"the most switched\" of their banking products.\nWestpac said a lot more of its customers are also now taking up low-rate cards, in part due to tougher rules introduced in 2011 which has forced banks to tell consumers the full cost of their cards and the need for them to opt in to receiving unsolicited card offers.\n\"Over 30 per cent of total customer credit card balances across the Westpac Group are held in low-rate accounts,\" it said. \"This has increased from 23 per cent in 2010. In the last two years, low-rate cards have accounted for over 50 per cent of all new sales.\"\nMutual lender Bank Australia (formerly Bank Mecu) and the Customer Owner Banking Association say all their cards are low-rate, ranging between 8 and 12 per cent. But cuts to interchange fees they receive from merchants being considered by the RBA may mean they have to raise their rates, reducing the number of lower-rate options for consumers.\n\"If you do reduce the average interchange fee that will reduce the capacity to issue low-rate cards,\" COBA's head of public affairs, Luke Lawler ,told the inquiry in Melbourne on Thursday.\n\"[But] the RBA has identified a problem – on certain cards there is very high rates. We are quite open to capping the very high [interchange fee] cards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:05:00.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
