By Piper Terrett | Yahoo Finance UK – 2 hours 10 minutes ago Print If you are considering saving for your retirement for the first time, the world of pensions can seem complex and confusing. There are many different types of pensions and options of what to do with your nest egg in your golden years and it can be hard to decide which will best suit your circumstances in the years ahead. What’s more, the new pension freedoms introduced by Chancellor George Osborne have changed the retirement landscape and opened up more possibilities for savers, giving them greater control over their money. So, how should you set about planning for your retirement and how will the Government’s changes affect you? When do you want to retire? When you start pension planning it’s a good idea to think about when you would like to retire. If you see yourself giving up work at 55 and going travelling, then you’ll need to save more than if you were to retire later at 65 or 70. This is because your pension income will need to last you an extra 10 to 15 years that it would if you retired later. It’s also worth remembering that now people are living longer, the Government has raised the state pension age for workers retiring between 2026 and 2028 to 67. With further changes due, people currently in their twenties aren’t likely to receive the state pension until they are 70. So if you do plan to retire earlier, you’ll need to plan for it financially. How much money will you need? Work out roughly how much income you think you will need in your golden years. Consider possible outgoings and whether you would still be paying a mortgage or rent. Do you plan to work part-time or see yourself relaxing on a beach?If you already have some pension provision in place, such as an occupational scheme or a personal pension, then review it. Contact the providers and ask for an estimate of what your retirement income might be. You can then use this information, along with an estimate of your state pension income, which you can get from the Government to find out if you are on course to have enough money in retirement. If you discover a savings gap then you need to think about how to plug it, whether by increasing current contributions to existing pension schemes, and cutting back to enable you to do so, or starting a new pension altogether. What are my pension options? If you don’t yet have a pension then you will need to start one. Does your employer offer a scheme? If so, then it makes sense to join. Although there are few final salary schemes left, many companies will match your pension contributions, so if you don’t take advantage of it you are missing out on free money. If you are a taxpayer then the Government will also top up your payments through pension tax relief. Self-employed workers could start a personal pension through a financial advisor. Those who feel confident enough can also open a self-invested personal pension or SIPP through which they can make their own investment choices. What can I do with my pension pot once I retire? Until recently, pension savers were fairly limited in what they could do with their nest eggs in retirement. But new rules brought in by Chancellor George Osborne have changed all that. Previously, from the age of 55 savers could take a 25% lump sum from their pension pot and pay no tax on it, but by the age of 75, they had to use the remaining money to buy an annuity, guaranteeing them a fixed income in retirement. But new rules mean you no longer have to purchase one and you can drawdown your entire nest egg if you wish. However, there are tax implications, which we explain below. Should I buy annuity? Traditionally when people retired they used most of their personal pension pot to purchase an annuity. An annuity is an insurance product that provides you with a fixed level of income each year in retirement for life. You can buy it from your pension provider or – as experts often advise – when you come to retire, you can shop around for the best rate. Rates can vary wildly and some annuities can be passed onto your spouse when you die, while others can’t. You don’t have to buy it from your pension company. The benefit of an annuity is that you know exactly how much income you will receive for the rest of your life, but some pensioners have been unhappy with recent rates and have welcomed the Government’s new freedoms. What are the new pensions freedoms? Under George Osborne’s changes, from the age of 55 savers can still withdraw a 25% lump sum from their nest egg but they no longer have to use the rest to purchase an annuity by the time they reach 75. If they wish to, they can withdraw all of their pension pot. But, if you choose to do so, you will have to pay tax on your withdrawal – at your current income tax rate. So if the withdrawal takes you up to the higher rate tax bracket, you could find yourself paying a painful 40% tax on your pension money, for example. So what can I do? If you’re determined to draw down your nest egg cash, you can make a number of withdrawals over years to avoid incurring higher tax payments. But be aware that if you do take all of your cash it’s possible you could run out of money in retirement, as well as pay a hefty tax bill. You could take the 25% tax-free lump sum from your pension at any time from the age of 55 and then leave the rest of the money untouched for a few years. This would give it more time to be invested and generate compound interest (interest you earn on top of the interest), which can help boost the size of your nest egg. Alternatively, you could take your lump sum and use the rest to buy an annuity or purchase a flexible income drawdown product. This moves the remainder of your pot into an investment fund, from which you draw down a regular income. Be aware that this income is taxable. At a later date you can always use the cash in your income drawdown fund to purchase an annuity. But income drawdown products are complex, so make sure you take independent financial advice first. How do I decide? Choosing what to do with your pension pot once you retire is a huge decision, which will affect the amount of income you end up having in your golden years. Make sure you seek independent financial advice from an advisor registered with the Financial Conduct Authority before you purchase any products or withdraw money from your pension pot. Never allow anyone to rush you into a decision. Weigh up all the possibilities and use the Government’s new Pension Wise service to help you understand the options and ensure your nest egg funds a long and comfortable retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:27:25.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
