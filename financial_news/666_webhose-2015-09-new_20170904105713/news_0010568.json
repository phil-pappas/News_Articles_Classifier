That was the push I needed to start looking elsewhere. Thanks for the heads up for getting out your RESP money. That sounds like a very frustrating visit! Reply bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 1:00 PM \nWell, I have given up getting too upset with the folks in the branch (most of the time) it is not their fault. Reply John Robertson January 19, 2015, 11:20 AM \nWith TDDI it’s more intuitive because you can hold cash, and selling your investments to get cash to withdraw is a natural, logical step to take before trying to take money out. With TDMF it’s not, because you can’t hold cash and converting to a money market fund to then sell and withdraw in one step is not remotely intuitive (you’d have to read the TD e-series guide or something to know that’s what you have to do). At least your rep seemed to figure it out after a while — some never do and just send you home to try again another day with someone else or search for it on the internet. Reply bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 11:39 AM \nYes, I should have said, my guess is one of the many boxes I ticked when I went to TD E-series funds said this might happen, but yes, TD Waterhouse you can hold “cash” so it is a little simpler too (that way). Schultzter January 19, 2015, 12:19 PM \nYou so funny! \nI stared with TD e-Series RESP because of the low MER but it just isn’t worth it! It’s such a hassle, it seems like really don’t want people to actually buy the e-Series funds, they just want to advertise the lowest MER. Reply bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 12:27 PM \nI think they’d work just fine, in a TD Waterhouse (or Questrade for that matter) account, I think most of my issues are with the TD Mutual Funds folks and their ways of doing business. I think they’d be happy if I went away… Reply Russ January 19, 2015, 12:51 PM \nNot Questrade. You can only buy the e-series through an account with TD Mutual Funds or TD Direct Investing (Waterhouse). They are “in-house” only, one might say. bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 12:59 PM \nOK Good to know that one, thanks! Schultzter January 19, 2015, 3:00 PM \nHmm, my reply was supposed to be in Robb Engen’s thread. Reply Greg January 19, 2015, 11:17 AM \nWow, such hassles with the big banks, I don’t know why they have some many customers. I had my kids RESPs at MD Financial (anyone with a relative who is a physician can get an account). All withdrawals were asynchronously handled with email. No appointments, no visits to branches, no FAXing (scanned documents by email is almost the same thing I guess), no wasted time :). bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 11:38 AM \nYou are lucky! Reply Robb Engen January 19, 2015, 9:35 AM \nAfter hearing all of your stories I’m glad this phase of the RESP process is still 12-15 years away. I’m sure TD (and the Universities) will have everything sorted out by then…right? bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 9:38 AM \nSure, Robb, sure. Have I mentioned I have this bridge for sale too? Reply Alexis Smith January 19, 2015, 8:43 AM \nGreat roundup as usual, really enjoyed your article. Thanks for sharing your post. Looking forward for your best articles this year. Reply Russ January 19, 2015, 8:05 AM \nI’ve had a TD Waterhouse (now TD Direct Investing) RESP for several years. In fact, I just wound it up in the last few months as the youngest of my four children is in his final year of university. It does take a little planning to withdraw funds from a TDDI RESP, but nothing terribly onerous in my view. No need for a money market fund to hold the cash proceeds before you withdraw the funds. One thing I wonder about is your asset allocation. As my children got older, I eventually got entirely out of equity mutual funds and transitioned to GICs and a high-interest savings account. We went through the dot-com crash of 2000 and the 2008 recession and while we kept going with equities in our RRSPs and taxable accounts, the RESP had an earlier wind-up date. Reply bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 8:08 AM \nWith Waterhouse, you still have to go to the Bank to show your child is at a school, and I am pretty sure you have to have your “money” in something that the bank person can “see”, but again, can’t comment for sure, as I have only dealt with the TD Mutual Fund folks. Reply Russ January 19, 2015, 8:29 AM \nYou don’t necessarily have to go to a branch for TDDI RESP accounts. I faxed the proof of enrolment, the RESP withdrawal form and a cover letter (just to make sure they knew what I was asking for) to a number on the RESP withdrawal form. Before I did that, I made sure that I had liquidated the investments to release the necessary cash and that the trades had settled. The money just sits as uninvested cash inside the account. The money was then direct deposited into my account (the portion of the withdrawal made up of contributed capital, non-taxable) and into my child’s account (the portion consisting of growth and grant money, taxable to the child), or alternatively, cheques can be mailed. All that took a few days, but proceeded without a hitch. Reply bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 8:45 AM \nThanks Russ, actually that sounds MUCH easier, just takes a little patience. OK, I most definitely should have changed to a TD Waterhouse RESP, might do that for my son’s account… Russ January 19, 2015, 9:19 AM \nJust one more comment on TDDI (TD Waterhouse) RESP accounts: if you choose to open one for your son, watch out for the $50 annual administration fee and inquire with them about ways to waive the fee. bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 9:38 AM \nIs there a minimum balance (that is the trick they tried to hit me with on my RRSP, and that was $25K minimum) and the fee was like $150! Russ January 19, 2015, 9:50 AM \n$25,000 min. to waive for RESPs. But, in the last couple of years our RESP was well below that figure and we weren’t charged. I asked once why we weren’t and I don’t recall the exact answer but I think it was because we had substantial investments in RRSPs and taxable accounts. I think electing for e-statements rather than paper statements is also a factor, but I may be mixing up registered vs. non-registered accounts. bigcajunman January 19, 2015, 10:02 AM \nOK, something else to keep in mind. Bet Crooks January 19, 2015, 7:51 AM \nWow! The “Hotel California” of investment plans! \nI wouldn’t want the proof of enrollment mailed directly to TD or any other bank, though. The chances of them misfiling it vs me losing it are huge. When a document went astray at BMO once and I was roaring since it had my name, address, SIN etc on it, they blithely said “oh, if it lands on the wrong desk they just SHRED it!” That’s right, no attempt to get it back to the right dept. They just shred anything mis-sent to protect from identity theft. \nGood luck later this week!
