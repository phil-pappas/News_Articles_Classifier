PAUL ROVERE Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Singapore's Ascendas has become one of the biggest owners of logistics real estate in Australia, buying a portfolio of 26 huge warehouses from Singapore's sovereign fund, GIC, for $1.073 billion.\nThe deal is the second largest industrial property deal to date in the Asia Pacific and the second largest property transaction in Australia this year.\nWith a yield of 6 per cent after acquisition costs, it also shows that pricing for core logistics assets has returned to pre-global financial crisis levels.\nNot one local Australian group made the shortlist, which included Warburg Pincus with the Redwood Group, Blackstone, Logos Property backed by Ivanhoe Cambridge and ARA Asset Management.\nThe portfolio comprises more than 630,000 square metres of logistics, predominantly located along the east coast cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Melbourne. More than 80 per cent of the portfolio is leased to blue-chip tenants such as Coles, Toll, Kmart and Nestle.\nJLL and Colliers International advised Singapore's GIC and Australand Property Group on the sale of the portfolio.\n\"The competitive nature of the EOI process was a clear demonstration of the weight of capital vying for Australian industrial assets,\" JLL's Head of Industrial â€“ Australia, Michael Fenton said.\n\"The industrial sector continues to offer a yield premium to the office and retail sectors and lower volatility of returns relative to office markets. Australia's industrial market presents attractive investment characteristics including strong tenant covenants and long weighted average lease expiries (WALE).\"\n The 26 properties will be placed into the Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust and the acquisition will be funded by $600 million in debt and the issuance of securities.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-09-18T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:07:16.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
