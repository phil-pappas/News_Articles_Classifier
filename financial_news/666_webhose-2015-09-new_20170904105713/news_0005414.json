There is no indication of wrongdoing on the part of either company and some analysts said the wider impact would be limited.\nThe German government said on Wednesday that the auto industry would remain an \"important pillar\" for the economy despite the deepening crisis surrounding Volkswagen.\n\"It is a highly innovative and very successful industry for Germany, with lots of jobs,\" a spokeswoman for the economy ministry said.\nBut analysts warn that it is exactly this dependency on the automobile sector that could become a threat to an economy forecast to grow at 1.8 percent this year. Germany is already having to face up to the slowdown in the Chinese economy.\n\"Should automobile sales go down, this could also hit suppliers and with them the whole economy,\" industry expert Martin Gornig from the Berlin-based DIW think tank told Reuters.\nIn 2014, roughly 775,000 people worked in the German automobile sector. This is nearly two percent of the whole workforce.\nIn addition, automobiles and car parts are Germany's most successful export -- the sector sold goods worth more than 200 billion euros ($225 billion) to customers abroad in 2014, accounting for nearly a fifth of total German exports.\n\"That's why this scandal is not a trifle. The German economy has been hit at its core,\" said Michael Huether, head of Germany's IW economic institute.\n\"MADE IN GERMANY\"\nThere are also voices, however, that say the impact on the economy as a whole should not be exaggerated.\n\"I don't think that the German automobile industry will be lumped altogether,\" Commerzbank chief economist Joerg Kraemer told Reuters.\n\"There won't be a recession just because of a single company,\" Kraemer added.\nThe German BGA trade association also tried to calm the public by saying there were no signs that customers abroad were starting to doubt quality and reliability of German companies.\n\"There isn't a general suspicion against goods labelled 'Made in Germany',\" BGA managing director Andre Schwarz told Reuters.\nBut he acknowledges there is a degree of concern among German companies that the scandal over cheating on U.S. diesel emission could have a domino effect on their businesses, eroding the cherished 'Made in Germany' label.\nSome observers also see some irony in the scandal.\nWhile the German economy defied the euro zone debt crisis and, so far, the economic slowdown in China, it could now be facing the biggest downside risk in a long while from one of its companies.\n\"The irony of all of this is that the threat could now come from the inside, rather than from the outside,\" Brzeski said.
