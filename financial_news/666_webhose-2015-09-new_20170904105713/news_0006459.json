The five biggest changes coming to your iPhone in today’s iOS 9 update \nTo change that, Walmart figured out how to tap into its shoppers’ offline habits to drive more engagement online, Andrew Lipsman, vice president of marketing and insights at comScore, tells Quartz. \nWith 22 million users as of June 2015, Walmart’s app is now the most popular among retailers after e-commerce heavyweights Amazon and eBay, according to an upcoming report from comScore. And at more than 400% year-over-year growth, it’s on pace to surpass eBay.

With the app’s price comparison tool, i f a competitor’s price is lower than what shoppers paid at Walmart, customers get an eGift card for the difference. \n“Customers would come to the stores with the 15 flyers they look through every week to find the best prices on toilet paper,” Helen Vaid, vice president of customer experience at Walmart.com, tells Quartz. “We thought, what if Walmart could take away that need to scour the market every time you walked into a store?” \nThe result is a few pennies here and there, but the psychological benefit is huge. Now, instead of checking other retailer’s prices every week, shoppers get in the habit of visiting the Walmart app after each trip to see how much money they saved. \nThe retailer is using that mindset to design other features. For example, it’s testing one that allows customers to push a button in the app to alert Walmart employees when they enter a store’s parking lot to pick up an online purchase. This gives employees a head start on getting an order ready by the time the customer arrives. View gallery . \nStill, the runaway growth is already slowing. Users actually declined on a month over month basis between May and June. R etailers will have to keep improving their apps in order to keep earning a spot on shoppers’ phones. \n“Customers aren’t going to download multiple retail apps unless there’s some real need to use it,” Ratnakar Lavu, executive vice president of digital technology at Kohl’s, tells Quartz. Kohl’s first version of its app was designed solely around shopping and failed to draw in droves of shoppers. \nWhen Kohl’s redesigned its app last year it focused on making the app habit-forming by designing it around what drives many Kohl’s shoppers into the store in the first place: coupons. \nThe new version includes a wallet that stores all three types of coupons its heavy shoppers are known to hoard: Kohl’s cash (rewards earned per purchase), offers that pop up around back-to-school or other sale times, and loyalty points consumers earn for actions like sharing products on Pinterest. \nPush notifications now pop up to alert shoppers each time their personalized, short-term offers are about to expire, reminding them to shop before their coupons run out and landing customers back into the Kohl’s app–and in its stores–on a regular basis. \n“It’s all about creating a notion of urgency,” Lavu says. \n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief , our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news. \nMore stories from Quartz:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T21:07:40.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
