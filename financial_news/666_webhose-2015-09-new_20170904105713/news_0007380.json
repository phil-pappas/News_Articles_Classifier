ADVERTISEMENT Shortly after she aired that complaint, major biotechnology investment vehicles took a fairly large dive. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index fell steadily ever since Clinton made the comment, and was down more than 4.5 percent a few hours later.\nHer comment was linked to a New York Times story detailing how an infection-fighting drug, Daraprim, jumped from $13.50 a pill to $750 a tablet overnight, after it was acquired by a new company. \n“Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on,” Clinton tweeted. \nOn Sunday, Clinton said she would be rolling out a new plan aimed at controlling prescription drug prices. On CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Clinton said she was constantly hearing gripes about drug costs while on the campaign trail.
