Why would one prefer to be called dishonest and a thief? You should have said that any Indian having money abroad should bring it back and deposit 35 per cent of it with the government and he can keep the rest.\n“The government would have received lakhs of crores of rupees. And if this money turns white, it will also become taxable. So, your tax revenue would increase manifold. Such people should be declared as honest citizens of India,” he said.\nTerming the existing tax-slab too high and a “slavery” for tax-payers, he said it should be brought down as such a move will encourage people to pay their taxes and increase revenue.\nMeanwhile, a book titled ‘Gaay aur Islam’ (cow and Islam), which stresses on “ill effects” of eating meat and other issues, was also released at the meeting.\nThe book is penned by Muslim writers and published by Goraksha Prakosth of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, headed by Indresh.\nDuring his speech, he also stressed upon the works by DSS organisation, saying that DSS will work with a motto ‘nation first, nation last’, will work for a conflict-free, poverty-free, castiesm-free India and increase harmony amongst people of the “mother land”.\nThe gathering was also addressed by national president of DSS Sarvadanand Arya, Mahipal Singh, Sukhvir Bauddh, Suraj Bhan Kataria among others.\n 22, 2015 9:36 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:46:35.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
