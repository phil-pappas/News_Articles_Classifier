KFC UKI also uses APT’s Test & Learn® for Customers software to optimise their customer-targeted initiatives. With this agreement, KFC UK and Ireland joins other leading restaurants–including Pizza Hut Restaurants UK, Costa, SUBWAY, Starbucks, Wendy’s and Dunkin’ Donuts–that use APT’s cloud-based software to improve guest experience and profitability. KFC has been using APT’s software to understand how customers respond to the restaurant remodel programme, fine tune operational initiatives, and identify how customers will respond to new products.\n“APT enables us clearly to understand the cause-and-effect relationship between our business initiatives and outcomes,” said Paula MacKenzie, Chief Finance and Development Officer at KFC. “We now have a deep understanding of how remodelling a restaurant affects our customers and helps to grow our sales.”\n“APT helped us take our culture of innovating through conducting ‘business experiments’ to the next level, making it more accurate, efficient and process-driven,” MacKenzie added. “We are already in the process of designing new tests using APT’s software and are looking forward to analysing many other high-value initiatives.”\nChris Holmes, KFC’s Commercial Director, added: “Bringing new products to our customers for new occasions is a key part of KFC’s strategy, and previously it was difficult to isolate what was happening because of the product, and what was due to other factors such as asset type, weather and competition. APT enables us accurately to measure the halo and cannibalisation effect of new product introductions, manage menu complexity, and by doing so, ensure that the items we introduce not only drive profitability but also increase guest satisfaction.”\nOn the relationship, Rupert Naylor, Senior Vice President at APT, commented: “We are very excited that KFC has chosen APT’s software to improve its decision-making capability and testing culture. We look forward to continue to support KFC in using APT’s software to make critical decisions.”\nAbout KFC\nYum!
