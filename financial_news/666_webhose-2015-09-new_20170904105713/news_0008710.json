Wealthy Japanese hold the world's highest proportion of cash in their financial assets, although the ratio was trimmed to 37.1 per cent from last year's 43.8 per cent.\nBarend Janssens, the head of RBC Wealth Management, said the rich were building up cash reserves to either support new investment opportunities or guard against possible liquidity risks.\nThe survey interviewed more than 5,100 people with at least US$1 million in investable assets across the world, including more than 1,600 from mainland China, Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore,\nIn Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, equities made up 22.8 per cent of high-net-worth individuals' investible assets, enabling them to be more resilient than expected in the face of the recent stock market rout.\nReal estate, excluding their primary residence, was knocked down to third place from top position last year.\nThe report said the wealth of high-net-worth individuals in the region was expected to grow more strongly than in the rest of the world - at an annual rate of 10.3 per cent to US$21.2 trillion by 2017. The region overtook North America to have the world's largest rich population last year and is on track to surpass it in total wealth this year. The expansion will mainly be powered by China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.\nOf the US$7.4 trillion of high-net-worth individuals' wealth added in Asia-Pacific since 2006, India and China contributed 43 per cent.\nWhile cash prevailed over equities and real estate in the region, 25.5 per cent of rich people's assets in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan were financed through credit, versus only 18.2 per cent in the rest of the world. Japan has the world's lowest use of credit.\nThat made it crucial for wealth management firms to provide credit, particularly if they wanted to attract clients from mainland China and India, the report said, but that was less important in Hong Kong and Japan.\n\"Balancing credit demand against the risks associated with providing credit in the region may be difficult for some firms,\" the report said.\nWith opportunities come challenges. \"Asia-Pacific wealth managers are not fully attuned to the importance and their understanding of the unique needs of the region's high-net-worth individuals,\" said David Wilson, head of the strategic analysis group at Capgemini's financial services.\nWealth managers in the region largely overestimated the accuracy of their perception of clients' needs, with 87.6 per cent saying they had a good understanding, while only 73.4 per cent of clients agreed.\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as Asia's rich building up cash holdings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T23:20:11.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
