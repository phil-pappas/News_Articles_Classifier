The EIA will issue official stockpiles data on Wednesday. \nBrent settled down $1.77, or 3.7 percent, at $46.37 a barrel, the lowest settlement in two weeks. \nU.S. crude, also known as WTI, closed down 63 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $44 a barrel. \nThe spread between the two (CL-LCO1=R), one of the most popular trades in oil, fell to as low as $2.32, its smallest difference since Jan. 23. It hit a 14-month high above $13 in March when U.S. crude fell to six-year lows. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said it expected an even tighter spread. \n\"While the flat price in WTI crude oil has become more choppy, marked by alternating up-and-down days over the past week, relative performance versus Brent continues to improve,\" Barclays technical strategist Lynnden Branigan said in a note. \nBrent has plunged from a June 2014 high above $115 a barrel to under $47 due to a global oil glut and worries about China's economy. \n\"We think we are near the floor, but nothing precludes that we temporarily move lower,\" Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity strategy for BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) , told the Reuters Global Oil Forum on Monday. \nOil also fell on Monday after growth in China's investment and factory output missed forecasts in August, reinforcing the possibility that the country's third-quarter growth could be below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis.
