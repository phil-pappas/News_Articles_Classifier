Overall investor sentiment remained somewhat grim, with global stocks sliding to their lowest in more than two years as commodity prices and emerging markets like China, a major commodities consumer, remained under pressure. * At 10:04 a.m. EDT (1404 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3400 to the greenback, or 74.63 U.S. cents, marginally weaker than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3394, or 74.66 U.S. cents. * The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3385, while its weakest level was C$1.3434, the softest it's been since June, 2004. * In Canada, producer prices for August fell slightly more than expected following three straight months of gains due to the lower cost of energy and petroleum products. * In the United States, home prices rose in July to match the June pace, but fell shy of expectations, according to the S&P/Case Shiller composite index. * Canada's gross domestic product for July is expected at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday. * U.S. crude prices were up 1.37 percent to $45.04, while Brent crude added 1.50 percent to $48.05. * Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price flat to yield 0.506 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 8 Canadian cents to yield 1.436 percent. * The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -15.1 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -64.3 basis points.
