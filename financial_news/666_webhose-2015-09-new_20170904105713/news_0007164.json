One page might suggest the look of a kitchen, another how a bedroom could be suitably appointed. So for an interior designer to throw caution to the wind and go with \"what feels completely natural\" must be considered extremely satisfying.\n\"I love coming home at the end of each day. It's an ambience that has evolved over many years,\" interior designer Meryl Hare, principal of Hare + Klein, says.\nHare + Klein has created a number of fine interiors for many of its Sydney clients. But it has also worked with clients in Adelaide, Melbourne and London. While many of these designs have been produced in a fixed period of time, Hare's home, in Seaforth, Sydney, has been a \"work in progress\" over many years.\nBuilt in the 1950s, the Seaforth house has been renovated and extended over time, including a more recent addition to the top level that provides unimpeded views over Middle Harbour. \"The house was built as a fishing shack but it's almost impossible to see this, given the work on the place over the years,\" says Hare, who did significant renovation in the early noughties.\nPainting by Robyn Burgess, Table and two bench seats by Chris Rak, and a Corbusier chair by Thonet in Rak's East St Kilda house. stephencrafti@bigpond.com Because the house is on a steep incline of about 10 metres, access to it is via an inclinator. At the top and entry level are the open-plan kitchen and living areas leading to a generous, protected west-facing terrace, and a guest bedroom suite and study. On the levels below are the bedrooms and at the lowest level is a workshop.\nBeautifully layered Like Hare + Klein's signature interiors, the house is beautifully layered with masks, antique hats, pottery and woven baskets. \"I love collecting old artifacts from primitive cultures,\" says Hare, pointing out an unusual mask found in southern India on one of her cycling trips. Natural material also features strongly in the Seaforth house, including concrete benches, timber floors and built-in timber joinery. \"Texture is something I never tire of,\" Hare says.\nInterior designer Chris Rak, co-director of Robson Rak Architects + Interior Design, receives enormous pleasure from moving things around in his 1950s home in East St Kilda, Melbourne. The house is in mostly original condition, with the exception of a few internal walls that have been removed to open up the living spaces.\nChris Rak's living room includes Strip Chair by Chris Connell, paintings by Chris Connell, Lean Lamp by Tom Dixon and Wire sculpture by Chris Rak. stephencrafti@bigpond.com Most of the furniture has been designed by Rak, including some simple tubular chairs, a dining table and some shelves. However, included in the mix is a chair designed by Chris Connell and lights by Tom Dixon, Michelle Delucchi and Joe Colombo. There are also paintings by Robyn Burgess and Chris Connell in the home Rak shares with his partner, architect Kathryn Robson. \"Each room has its own character. The living room, in particular, lends itself to 'layering' with furniture and objects,\" he says.\nRak isn't a purist from any one design period, finding beauty in everything from the 1950s to the Memphis period of the early 1980s and beyond. \"I'm always drawn to the craftsmanship of a piece and whether it has a sense of longevity,\" he says.\nStripped out Interior designer Amanda Lynn worked closely with The Rexroth Mannasmann Collective in creating her house in North Melbourne. The unusual home, originally a warehouse, was stripped out and subdivided to create four townhouses. From the street, the ambience is typical inner-city Melbourne. However, from the rear, with the view of the historic North Melbourne Town Hall, the aspect is strongly European.\nThe vertical library in the home designed by The RexRoth Mannasmann Collective architects for interior designer Amanda Lynn and her husband Leon Levine. stephencrafti@bigpond.com At ground level are the open-plan kitchen and living area, leading to a leafy, protected terrace. There's also a study and bathroom. And on the first floor are two bedrooms and a bathroom, with a library/built-in bookshelves in the stairwell linking the two levels.\nOne of the most striking features of Lynn's home are the black painted walls and black rubber floors throughout. \"I wanted a backdrop for my paintings and artifacts. The 'container' becomes recessive,\" she says. A skylight above the dining area made from recycled 1970s glass creates a golden hue over the space. One of the other features is a mural covering the pantry door, created by Ray Carter. The black-and-white work that extends over two levels appears as delicate fabric.\n\"When you're designing a place for yourself you don't have to hold back. You can test ideas and be as adventurous as you like. You don't have to respond to tear sheets or a client's brief,\" Lynn says.\nInterior designer Meryl Hare's home in Meryl Hare's home in Seaforth includes objects and artefacts found on her travels.
