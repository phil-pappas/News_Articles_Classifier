Uldrich continues, \"There's no great surprise there. But the “gotcha” will come in how consumers and innovative companies will leverage these same new technologies to delay gratification.\"\nUldrich sites developments with the iWatch, Oculus Rift, advances in neuroscience and sharing economy companies such as Airbnb and Uber as examples of what the future of marketing will hold. He also says, \"As mobile technology and worldwide high-speed Internet access continue to proliferate, the differences between global and local marketplaces will blur.\"\nThe bottom-line according to Uldrich is this: \"Consumers will begin harnessing the power of these new tools and technologies to do what is in their best long-term interest and not the marketers best interest.\"\nA highly acclaimed public speaker and noted as one of the world's leading futurists, Uldrich delivers keynotes and workshops on future trends, change management and questioning the future. Recent engagements have included ICMF and Banamex in Mexico, Bayer CropScience in Germany, South Dakota Wheat Growers in Minneapolis and private clients in the finical sector in Minneapolis and Philadelphia. Upcoming client talks include True Value in Chicago, IL, Coulee Bank in LaCrosse, WI and St. Paul, MN, and Future Vision in Sonoma, CA.\nParties interested in Uldrich's speaking, writing and workshops are encouraged to visit his website.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2phY2t1bGRyaWNoLmNvbS9ibG9nL2Z1dHVyZS8xMC10cmVuZHMtdGhhdC13aWxsLXRyYW5zZm9ybS10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLW1hcmtldGluZy8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qYWNrdWxkcmljaC5jb20vY29udGFjdA=="], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:14:38.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
