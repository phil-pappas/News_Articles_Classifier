Louie Douvis by Vesna Poljak Expectations about the direction of interest rates for the Australian economy are still mixed and not all economists agree that the mounting threat of recession will send the Reserve Bank of Australia into action.\nOn Friday, Goldman Sachs stepped up its conviction that the central bank has more work to do . Its chief economist in Australia, Tim Toohey, argued the nation faces a one-in-three chance of recession before the next federal election if business investment fails to improve and housing momentum fades.\nMr Toohey forecast the cash rate would be cut to 1.75 per cent from 2 per cent in November.\nThursday's labour force data delivered some positive news, as the economy added 17,400 jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent. Confidence levels are still troubling, but can be partly attributed to the equity market correction.\nBut many economists still share a view that Australia is headed for worsening conditions that will demand the cushion of more accommodative monetary policy. Consensus forecasts suggest the RBA will stay on hold into 2016.\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates this past week to 2.75 per cent, and signalled a willingness to ease further, as the economy battles similar challenges as Australia, but with greater severity.\nExperts agree that there is no case for tightening any time soon in Australia.\nNomura has pushed out its forecast for a rate cut to February from November. Economist Andrew Ticehurst said the narrative from the RBA had improved lately, thanks to currency relief, and that the more comfortable tone and currency depreciation removes the urgency to act. He added that by 2016 further rate cuts from New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Singapore and China would be implemented.\n The biggest event on the global economic calendar is the Federal Reserve's meeting September 16-17, the first window considered a realistic opportunity for the influential central bank to raise interest rates.\nFinancial markets volatility has increased in the lead-up to the Fed's decision, as global activity slows and China's sharemarket collapses. Prominent economists at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have urged the Fed to keep rates at zero.\n\"Everybody's just focused one on thing, will they or won't they?\" said Stephen Halmarick, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management.\n\"The economic data is telling them they should hike, particularly the labour market numbers. I think it would send the wrong signal if they didn't hike because of financial markets.\"\nNo further easing picked Mr Halmarick argued for a hike, but accompanied with highly dovish commentary. He does not anticipate any easing by the RBA for the remainder of this year.\nFor the RBA, a Fed hike would be a favourable outcome. If the Fed does not hike, the risk is the Australian dollar reverses some of the currency depreciation the economy has come to enjoy if the US dollar falls. Australian dollar forecasts in the past week were lowered by Westpac (to US66Â¢).\nMorgan Stanley has forecast two further rate cuts by the RBA in 2016 as the housing boom fades and unemployment rises to 6.8 per cent.\n\"The implication is that if the 'housing card' has indeed been played, GDP growth for 2016 is at least disappointing,\" Daniel Blake said in a report to clients. He suggested macro-prudential policy targeting investor activity in the Sydney housing market could freeze momentum.\nCredit ratings agency Moody's said that resources dependent Western Australia \"will face greater challenges as they make the transition from mining investment to exports\", in new analysis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:09:58.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
