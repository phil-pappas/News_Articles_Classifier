Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro It's one of the biggest-ever capital raisings by one of Australia's biggest companies but it seems not everyone is being welcomed with open arms.\nNext week, Commonwealth Bank is scheduled to sell entitlements not taken up by retail investors to institutions and other sophisticated investors as part of its $5.1 billion rights offer. But the bank has taken the unusual step of asking bidders into the process to disclose whether or not they own shares and whether they're shorting the stock.\nThe provision of this information is \"not a pre-condition\", the bank says, and it has an obligation to accept bids required to get the best price for the entitlements. But whether or not investors are willing to volunteer this information remains to be seen.\nThe bank says it just wants to better understand the process given this is one of the largest placements of shares to retail investors by Australia's biggest bank. Understanding the role of short sellers in a capital raising may give the bank, and others, a better sense of how to conduct raisings in future.\nThe move by CBA led to speculation amongst some desks that the short-fall from the $3 billion retail offer might be larger than anticipated and may have contributed to a decline in SPI stock market futures.\nMeanwhile, ANZ announced after market trading that it had raised $720 million from its retail share purchase plan, well above the $500 million it targeted. The shares were priced at $26.50, below the $30.95 price paid by institutions which took up $2.5 billion through a placement.\nThe request comes as short interest in Commonwealth Bank shares has climbed from the time of the offering in mid-August from 23 million shares to almost 30 million shares – a 25 per cent increase. Volumes too have increased with the five-day, average short-selling activity rising well above two million shares. That's similar to the increase in short interest in Westpac shares over the period and most banks have seen rises, off small bases.\nThe share price, meantime, has traded in an 8 per cent range above the discount of $71.50. Trying to explain the forces behind CBA's share price volatility is complex. The $5.1 billion raising has coincided with one of the most-volatile periods in global markets, which has hit all banks. Whether there are other factors at play is tough to determine.\n The role of short sellers in the market is opaque at the best of times. Their involvement during capital raising processes is even harder to understand, perplexing issuers, as evidenced by the request for information.\nCBA has also left open the possibility that the retail book-build may not take place on Monday, September 14 as scheduled. If market conditions are unfavourable it may choose to conduct the book-build when conditions improve. The last two trading sessions show that at present, a day can make a difference.\nOn Wednesday, CBA shares traded almost 3.5 per cent higher, but Thursday traded down by more than 2 per cent as markets gyrate.\nValue is the difference The higher the share price, the greater the value of the unsold retail investor entitlements, sold to institutions. The value is effectively the difference between the trading price of CBA shares and the discounted offer price of $71.50.\nThe steps taken by CBA show it is conscious about the role of short sellers in driving its share price – and therefore the value of the unsold retail rights – and in trying to understand it, manage its adverse effect in future.\nThe bank's concern doesn't appear to relate to short selling in general, which has been acknowledged as an important source of market liquidity. Rather it's the practice of strategic short selling that it might believe adversely affects some shareholders.\nIn the US, a number of institutions and hedge funds, including New York-based Australian fund Manikay, tripped up after shorting Citigroup shares and then participating in a capital raising.\nRules in the US prohibit this with the logic that shorting shares of the company and then buying the stock in a capital raising, acts to cheapen the entry price of a security. No such rules exist in Australia.\nShort selling the banks is modest, in relative terms. About 1.74 per cent of the free float is loaned out to short sellers. That compares with Myer and Metcash short interest of 20 per cent and Woolworths at 8 per cent.\nWhile CBA might be bothered by the actions of short sellers, it can take comfort in the fact that even the most esteemed names in the hedge fund industry have lost billions betting against the bank, and its 850,000 retail investors, over the past five years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-10T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:10:16.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
