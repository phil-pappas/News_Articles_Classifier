ORCL, -0.71% is set to report first-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday. The company is coming off a rough fourth quarter, and analysts are calling for year-over-year declines in earnings and sales.\nBut a group of analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating and $50 target on the stock this week, citing the potential for cloud revenue to outperform. Analysts at Wedbush said Oracle is pricing its cloud offerings aggressively and heavily tilting its sales force incentives toward cloud deals.\nHere’s what to expect:\nEarnings: Analysts expect Oracle to report earnings per share of 52 cents, down from 62 cents in the year-earlier period. Oracle has missed consensus earnings per share expectations in five of the past six quarters, according to FactSet.\nEstimize, a platform that uses crowdsourcing among hedge fund executives, brokerages, sell-side and buy-side analysts to produce earnings estimates, has Oracle earning 53 cents a share. Last quarter, Oracle underperformed the Estimize consensus by 15%.\nRevenue: Sell-side analysts expect Oracle to report revenue of $8.53 billion, compared with $8.6 billion in the same period last year, according to FactSet. Oracle has missed consensus sales expectations in five of the past six quarters, according to FactSet.\nContributors on Estimize are forecasting revenue of $8.5 billion. While Oracle missed the Estimize revenue number by 5% last quarter, it has either met or topped expectations in every other quarter since Estimize began tracking them in the beginning of fiscal-year 2014.\nStock reaction: Shares of Oracle have declined by 15.5% over the past three months. Much of the decline occurred after the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results at the end of June, which it blamed on foreign exchange rates.\nWhat to watch for: Oracle has been struggling to gain earnings power despite its ongoing transition to the cloud. However, the cloud shift continues to be an important business strategy for Oracle, and it remains a bright spot in the company’s quarterly earnings report.\nWhile overall software and cloud revenues fell 6% to $8.4 billion last quarter, cloud software as a service and platform and cloud software as a service revenue climbed 29%. In a note to clients this week, analysts at Jefferies said cloud revenue could outperform this quarter as well on the heels of strong fourth-quarter bookings. Cloud bookings were more than $425 million last quarter, which trumped the company’s internal goal of $300 million.\nOther banks aren’t sure that’s enough, however. Wedbush analysts reiterated a neutral rating and $40 target on the stock this week, saying the positive impact from Oracle’s transition to the cloud may be “less severe” in the first quarter due to an expected deceleration in license deals. Their checks indicate Oracle is tilting its sales force incentives heavily toward cloud deals and working to price its cloud offerings aggressively.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:20:50.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
