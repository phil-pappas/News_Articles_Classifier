It’s going to be very tough.”\nSales at his three stores in Tamil Nadu state are down a quarter and southern India’s sales would drop to 80-85 percent of last year’s levels, he said, although other parts of the country could show some resilience.\nAs well as jewellery, some farmers also invest in gold bars or coins.\nBut KB Jadeja, a cotton grower in the western state of Gujarat, where rains have been 32 percent below average in some areas, said he and his fellow farmers were not looking to buy any gold this year.\n“Only half of my 200 acres is irrigated,” Jadeja said by phone as he travelled to buy a water pump for the other half.\n“We’re spending so much on diesel and other things to pump up water. In any case, I like to buy land instead of volatile gold.”\nThe other threat to gold imports is India’s move to mobilise idle metal stored in households. A government official said banks could pay higher-than-expected interest of 2.5 percent on gold deposited in the scheme.\nThe deposited gold would be auctioned, used to replenish the central bank’s reserves or be lent to jewellers, and could cut imports by 20 tonnes annually.\n 11, 2015 12:19 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:08:19.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
