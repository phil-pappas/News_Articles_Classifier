We are adapting to a world where economic growth is going to be slower than believed in recent months, because of the hit from China and the emerging economies,\" said Gregori Volokhine of Meeschaert Financial Services. \nThe Chinese data spilled over into oil markets, which reversed course and saw prices fall in London by 8.5 percent after three straight gains. \n\"The (Chinese) manufacturing index still shows that the economy is in the process of seeking a bottom,\" said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at JK Life Insurance. \n- Hit on German industry - \nClaus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said China's problems would impact Germany, Europe's largest and strongest economy. \n\"The slowdown in China will weigh on German manufacturers, despite strong domestic growth and solid demand in the US and the UK,\" he said in a client note. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is unrealistic to expect a complete decoupling, given the strong Chinese contribution to global GDP growth.\" \nSome analysts were not so pessimistic. \n\"We don?t think the readings are cause for alarm. For a start, China?s economy is increasingly driven by service sector activity, which still appears healthy. As such, signs of weakness in manufacturing are less of a concern than they used to be,\" said Chang Liu at research firm Capital Economics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:48:46.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
