Twitter Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Before Monday night's leadership coup against Tony Abbott, Queensland Senator James McGrath revelled in his low-key status.\nDespite his impressive CV as Liberal National Party campaign director in Queensland – which delivered a landslide to Campbell Newman in 2012 – and stints working as a gun for hire overseas including for London Mayor Boris Johnson, the extremely private Senator McGrath flew below the radar in his first 12 months in Canberra.\nIf you wanted to talk to him about an outbreak of crazy ants in North Queensland, business transparency portals, the bias of the ABC, or increasing the GST he would chew your ear off. But that's about it.\nBut as part of the group of \"faceless men\" who helped deliver Malcolm Turnbull's successful challenge earlier this week, Senator McGrath has been thrust into the spotlight.\nThe 41-year-old Senator McGrath – who made an unsuccessful tilt for a lower house seat when he challenged fellow Queenslander Mal Brough for the Sunshine Coast seat of Fisher in 2012 – has always preferred the role as backroom strategist.\nHe snared a Senate position for Queensland in the 2013 federal election, but did not take his place in the Upper House until mid-2014.\nAs an experienced campaigner, Senator McGrath was worried about the outcome which befell Newman in January this year. Within the space of three years, the LNP government had blown the biggest parliamentary majority in Australia's history.\nTony Abbott's decision to award Prince Phillip a knighthood in the final week of the state election campaign probably wouldn't have changed the final result, but it certainly wouldn't have helped.\n There was a genuine fear amongst Senator McGrath and his Queensland colleagues the state result could be replicated on a federal level, with Opposition leader Bill Shorten walking into The Lodge after only one term.\nAs revealed in The Financial Review on Friday, the Queensland conservative MPs – including Senator McGrath, Mr Brough, Steve Ciobo, Jane Prentice, Wyatt Roy – moved almost en masse behind Turnbull as the man to save their mostly marginal seats.\nIt is understood Senator McGrath was still widely traumatised by the Newman result – which for many political insiders re-wrote the rule book on the expected longevity of governments – even though he was not directly involved in the campaign.\nWhen contacted by AFR Weekend , Senator McGrath refused to comment on the events leading up to Monday night's swift leadership coup.\nBut there is growing speculation he could be rewarded for this role in the coup, if Mr Turnbull undertakes a wide-ranging Cabinet reshuffle.\nBut some critics say he has not done enough policy work to justify a promotion to the ministry and is still making the transition from party room operator to politician.\nA seasoned Labor strategist had begrudging respect for Senator McGrath, who worked as lawyer in Brisbane, before becoming a ministerial adviser and party official.\n\"He ran campaigns at the right place and the right time. Timing is everything in politics and he's got good timing,\" the ALP strategist said.\nSenator McGrath has had a long friendship with Mr Turnbull which lead to the then Opposition leader backing the Queenslander in a bid to unseat long-serving federal Liberal Party director Brian Loughnane.\nThe awkward position of Mr Loughnane running next year's election campaign – after his wife Peta Credlin lost her job as Tony Abbott's chief of staff – has yet to be resolved. But some MPs are hoping Senator McGrath will have an active role, at least in Queensland to shore up the LNP's support.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-18T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:39:04.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
