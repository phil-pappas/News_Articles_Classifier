Additionally, special roundtable sessions led by master teachers offer an opportunity to share best practices at the elementary, middle and high school levels. Attendees will also have the chance to hear insights from guest speakers including Michael Bryan, Vice President and Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and notable guests from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Working in Support of Education (W!SE).\nAt the Opening Plenary session on Friday, October 9, CEE will pay tribute to philanthropist and St. Petersburg resident Gus A.

We do this by educating the educators: providing the curriculum tools, the pedagogical support, and the community of peers that instruct, inspire, and guide. All resources and programs are developed by educators and delivered by CEE’s national network of affiliates—over 240 across the country. Last year, CEE reached 55,000 teachers in person, and over 1.3 million unique visitors accessed EconEdLink.org— the go-to place for free online teaching resources.
