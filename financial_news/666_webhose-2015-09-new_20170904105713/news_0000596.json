Rob Homer Share on twitter by Joanna Mather A two-tier super contribution regime – with women at 12 per cent and men at 9 per cent – would begin to close the gender-related retirement savings gap.\nBut it would take a leap to 16 per cent for women in their mid to late 30s, to make up for time spent out of the workforce to raise children, finance professors have told a parliamentary inquiry.\nAnother option, although not supported by the researchers, would be to stack the super portfolios of women with equities, which could significantly boost balances even in the face of sharemarket volatility.\nA paper submitted to the Senate economics committee examining the \"economic security\" of women in retirement says a combination of higher contribution rates and aggressive investment strategies could work.\nFor example, a woman who at age 25 takes five years out for children, could narrow the gap with her male counterpart to less than $20,000 if she had a 12 per cent contribution rate and 80 per cent of her portfolio was invested in equities.\nIn August, Labor Senator Jenny McAllister successfully moved that the Senate standing committee on economics investigate the retirement income gender gap. The issue is gaining traction, with the ANZ recently announcing an extra $500 a year for each of its 12,700 female staff in Australia.\nThe research paper, co-authored by Griffith University finance professor Michael Drew, says raising the superannuation contribution rate for women to 12 per cent would reduce to $33,638 the gap in average wealth between male and female workers (based on joining the workforce at age 20 and retiring at 63).\nThe high cost of career breaks But the gap is only narrowed if woman do not take any time out of the workforce to care for children.\n\"Retirement systems around the world are based on the heroic assumption that members have long and continuous period of employment over which contributions are made,\" Drew says.\nYet this is not the reality for many women.\n\"Tragically, the risk of fiscal death for many women in Australia is outweighing the risk of physical death,\" Drew says.\nA 9 per cent super contribution rate for both men and women produces a gap \"accumulation outcome\" of an average of $186,000, and median of $156,000.\nAt this rate the \"average wealth differential\", which is the amount by which the female worker's balance at retirement can expect to fall short of a male counterpart, is $184,000.\nA five-year break at the age of 25 widens the wealth differential to $288,485. If the woman defers the break until age 30 then the wealth differential is smaller at $263,981.\nRaising the female contribution rate to 12.5 per cent turns the odds slightly in favour of women. That is, they would have a 51 per cent, or one in two, chance of retiring with a higher superannuation balance than an equivalent male.\nBut, again, this is only as long as she does not take any time out of the workforce.\nIt would take a contribution rate of 16 per cent for a woman who takes a break at 25 (and 15 per cent if the break occurs at 30) to give her a 50 per cent shot at retiring with the same amount as her male counterpart.\nMore investment in shares To further illustrate the scale of the problem, the authors looked at how aggressive investment strategies would need to be to close the gap.\nThe authors of the report, which was first published in 2009 in the Australian Economic Review journal, assumed a 9 per cent contribution rate and investments in equities, bonds and bills only.\nFor women who do not take a career break, increasing the allocation of equities to 70 per cent results in the chances of underperforming the male average drop slightly to 94 per cent.\nBut it leads to a \"remarkable decline\" of 40 per cent in the average size of the wealth differential, from $184,087 to $71,427.\n\"If the allocation to shares is increased by another 5 per cent to 75 per cent, the impact is a dramatic drop in the probability of a shortfall to 69 per cent,\" the report says. \"In other words, there is almost a one in three chance now that the female would outperform the baseline.\"\nUp the allocation to 80 per cent, and she has a one in two chance of ending up with a higher super balance in retirement than a man with a balanced investment strategy.\nAgain, career breaks erode most of these gains, although aggressive asset allocation did trim the magnitude of underperformance.\n\"For example, by employing an asset allocation rule that invests 90 per cent of assets in shares, the female worker with a five-year employment break at the age of 25 has an expected shortfall of $61,792, which is a quarter less than had she stuck with the balanced portfolio,\" the report says.\nOf course, having such a heavy bias to equities exposes an investor to the volatility experienced in the 2008 downturn, for example. The researchers looked at this too.\n\"Contrary to expectations, the risk of encountering extremely adverse outcomes by pursuing a more aggressive strategy is not much different from following a less aggressive one,\" the report says.\nHowever, the researchers did not recommend moving to high-risk investment strategies because the outcomes would be so variable as to perhaps make the gap even worse.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-09-29T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:50:24.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
