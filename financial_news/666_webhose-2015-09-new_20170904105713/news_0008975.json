He also added that in Germany, that ratio is about 58 percent; in the United Kingdom, it’s 60 percent for workers over 25. “The ratio is generally lower in less affluent countries,” he said. When Will the U.S. Federal Minimum Wage Increase? \nIn the 2014 State of the Union address , President Barack Obama urged Congress to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and signed an executive order to raise it to $10.10 for those working on new federal service contracts. Although the likelihood of a change in the federal minimum wage appears low in the near-term, momentum to make changes at a local level and by corporate America is continuing to gain traction. \nAnd there’s no shortage of people who support raising the minimum wage. In a 2013 Gallup poll, 76 percent of Americana said they would vote for raising the minimum wage to $9 per hour. \n“Raising the minimum wage is extremely politically popular,” said Jared Meyer, a fellow at Economics21 , a non-profit dedicated to economic research at the Manhattan Institute for Public Policy Research. “It’s passed in red states and blue states. It rarely gets defeated when it’s on the ballot. Who doesn’t want to give their neighbor a wage increase?” \nWhile some would like to do away with the minimum wage entirely, advocates of increasing it disagree on how high it should go. Many Republican candidates want the minimum wage to stay at $7.25, and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton voiced support of a $12 minimum wage, reports the Huffington Post. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, however, is backing an increase to $15 per hour by 2020. \nSeveral cities, including Seattle and San Francisco, have already passed initiatives that will raise the local minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next few years. While that might work in those cities where the workforce is highly educated, it could be riskier in places with less-skilled laborers. “In some parts of the country, many employers will be very reluctant to pay high wages to workers with modest skills,” writes Harry Holzer, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. Possible Effects of Raising the Minimum Wage \nAccording to Meyer, “there can be unintended negative consequences” of raising the federal minimum wage. He said raising the minimum wage could hurt young people since business owners will have less incentive to take a chance on someone with no work history if they would have to pay that employee a lot. More than half of American workers started their careers making within a dollar of the minimum wage, according to the Heritage Foundation. \nOn the other hand, Reich maintains that raising the minimum wage would help workers by making them more able to cover their regular bills. \nIn terms of overall employment, it appears that an increase in minimum wage would have little impact, according to a study by the Center for Economic and Police Research. Companies can offset the cost by cutting back in other places, such as what they pay higher workers, increasing prices and cutting back on other benefits. The increase could also reduce company costs by lowering the rate of labor turnover. \nKeep reading: How I Managed to Save Money While Earning Minimum Wage \nEven as the debate continues, the number of workers who actually earn the federal minimum wage has been declining in recent years. In 2013, 3.3 million employees — or 2.6 percent of all wage and salary workers — worked for wages at or below the federal minimum, according to the Pew Research Center data. That’s less than a third of the 7.9 percent of all wage and salary workers who received the minimum wage in 1979. \nPhoto Credit: a katz / Shutterstock.com \nShare This Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:38:41.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
