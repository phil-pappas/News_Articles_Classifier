Photo: Bloomberg\nIf any nation can sympathise with the pain that collapsing iron ore prices have inflicted on Australia in recent years, perhaps Chile can.\nBlessed with the world's largest-known copper resources, the South American nation has produced about one-third of the world's copper in recent years, and has duly developed an economy with a very large dependence on the red metal.\nLike iron ore did for Australia, copper delivered great wealth to Chile during the resources boom, but sliding prices over the past year have created some economic challenges.\nLike iron ore did for Australia, copper delivered great wealth to Chile.\nThe conductive metal is now 30 per cent cheaper than it was in January 2014, and the downturn has hit Chilean government revenues, private sector investment, employment levels and even real estate prices in swanky Santiago.\nAdvertisement Like Australia, Chile is now rapidly trying to diversify its economy, but speaking on a recent trip to Melbourne, Chile's economy minister, Luis Felipe Cespedes, said he believed a strong natural resources sector was still an advantage when seeking to diversify an economy.\n\"The resources are not a curse, but an opportunity to diversify your economy,\" he said.\n\"I don't think the diversification has to start away from the natural resources, i think you can use natural resources to diversify your economy, one example is if you produce software for the mining industry you can produce also software for financial services or other sectors in the economy.\n\"The key issue here is how your natural resources can help you to transform your economy by having knowledge.\"\nChile takes a longer-term approach While Australian governments have chopped and changed their iron ore price forecasts several times each year during the recent commodity price downturn, Chile has taken a longer-term approach.\nThe \"structural balance\" rule that Chile enacted in 2001 sees long-term copper price estimates calculated by independent advisers, while elected politicians can only adjust spending in response to the commodity price forecasts they are given.\n\"We ask a group of independent experts to provide us with a forecast of the average price they expect for the next 10 years, that is the way we generate fiscal policy,\" said Mr Cespedes.\nThe longer-term approach is designed to protect against fluctuations in the commodity industry, and the proof of the pudding lies in Chile's low debt (by global standards at least).\n\"For example between 2004 and 2008 we accumulated close to 25 per cent of GDP in fiscal surpluses, so today Chile doesn't have any public debt in net terms,\" said Mr Cespedes.\n\"But when the commodity prices go below the long term price you basically use the resources that you accumulated in the good times, so that structural balance rule has been extremely successful in helping us to stabilise the effect of the business cycle on fiscal revenues.\"\nWhile the comparison to Australia's management of commodity revenues is interesting, Mr Cespedes stressed that he had not come to Australia to lecture his host about fiscal management.\nOn the contrary he had come to learn about Australia's Productivity Commission, an institution for which there is no peer in Chile, and to visit the University of Melbourne, where more than 150 Chilean students have come to complete their higher education.\nHe toured the research and development work underway at the CSIRO and there was even time to catch up with the executives of BHP Billiton, who mine copper in the high deserts of the Chilean Andes.\nMr Cespedes said Chile and Australia were facing very similar challenges, and could benefit from working together more often to resolve them.\n\"Water use is a challenge that we both face as economies in terms of producing new technology in order to be much more water efficient,\" he said.\n\"Water is also critical for mining and agriculture and if you look at the opportunities of the agricultural sector it is huge for both economies so I think there is plenty of space to continue collaborating and also to bring more investment into Australia.\"\nWhile numerous Australian mining and energy companies already have a presence in Chile, very few Chilean companies have invested into Australia, with Chilean construction conglomerate Sigdo Koppers' recent interest in ASX-listed Bradken a rare exception.\nSigdo Koppers has since given up its bid to merge with Bradken, but Mr Cespedes said he hoped Sigdo would not be the last to consider investments in Australia.\n\"One of the things we want to do is continue increasing trade. Trade is very important because it is the first stage, you go from trade to investments, and I think both economies should benefit from increased economic relations,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:06:56.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
