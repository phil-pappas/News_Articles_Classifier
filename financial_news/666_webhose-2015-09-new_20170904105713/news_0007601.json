Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, in Washington. The Federal Reserve is getting close to raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe A former US Federal Reserve economist says the central bank will pay \"very little\" attention to a World Bank warning that a US interest rate rise next week risks unleashing turmoil in international markets.\nBut he believes Australia is well placed to ride out any market ructions whenever the Fed does tighten policy.\nJoseph Gagnon, who worked for more than a decade in the Fed's monetary affairs and international finance divisions, said the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had virtually no influence on Fed interest rate decisions.\n\"The Fed doesn't care what happens in other countries, except to the extent it flows back onto the US,\" said Mr Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\"It would be a violation of their mandate to not do the right policy for the US because of some other countries' concerns, except for any feedback loop to the US.\"\nThe World Bank's chief economist warned in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday that an imminent US rate rise risked sparking \"panic and turmoil\" in emerging markets.\nThe International Monetary Fund, which is responsible for global financial stability, has repeatedly voiced similar concerns .\nWhen the Fed does raise rates some time this year, Mr Gagnon said the Australian economy should handle any international market volatility well.\n \"I think you've had the best macro policy in the world for the past 20 years,\" Mr Gagnon said.\n\"So what if there is volatility coming from the US and other places.\"\n\"You just deal with it, get on it with and can have good results no matter what.\"\nTreasurer Joe Hockey said this week that a looming Us rate rise was a \"positive signal\" about improvement in the US economy .\nFinancial markets are betting there is about a one in three chance of a rate rise at the Fed's September 16-17 meeting. Deutsche Bank on Wednesday deferred its tip for a rate rise to October, from its previous call of September.\nThe Fed has a domestic centric mandate dictated by Congress. The objectives for the Fed are stable prices, full employment and moderate long term interest rates.\nThe US economy grew at a robust annual pace of 3.7 per cent in the June quarter and unemployment dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 per cent last month. Inflation remains persistently weak.\nThe Fed's mandate does not mentioned international financial stability.\nMoney has poured out of slowing emerging market economy bonds, equities and currencies in recent weeks, in anticipation of a Fed rate rise and due to China's economic headwinds.\nNon-resident portfolio flows in emerging markets turned negative last month for the first time in 2015, according to the Institute of International Finance reported.\nEmerging market currencies including the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, South African rand, Mexican peso, Turkish lira, South Korean won and Vietnamese dong have been hammered in the past couple of months.\nSome international observers worry the confluence of negative forces could inflict ructions similar to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when hot money was yanked out of developing economies like Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. Their currencies collapsed and foreign debts ballooned, impaling economies across east Asia.\nIMF chief Christine Lagarde said at a Group of 20 meeting in Turkey on the weekend the IMF \"thinks that it is better to make sure that data are absolutely confirmed, that there is no uncertainty, neither on the front of price stability nor on the employment and unemployment front, before it actually makes that move.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-10T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:03:46.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
