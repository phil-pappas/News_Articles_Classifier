Employers added jobs in a variety of industries, including government, professional and business services. That helped to offset losses in the leisure and hospitality, construction and trade, transportation, and utilities sectors. Montana Unemployment: 4% (tied with Minnesota) \nThe job market is heating up in Big Sky Country. Hiring has been robust, luring more Montana residents into the labor force. That has helped keep the jobless rate in a narrow 3.9% to 4% range for the past few months. The state's largest employment sector, health care, continues to grow at a steady pace, as do jobs in the business services and leisure areas. Iowa Unemployment: 3.8% (tied with South Dakota) \nThe jobless rate in the Hawkeye State has fallen half a percentage point over the past year, keeping it well below the national rate. Growth in what had already been the largest employment sector -- trade, transportation and utilities -- has been strong, as have the education and health services and government sectors. South Dakota Unemployment: 3.8% (tied with Iowa) \nThere's more to South Dakota than Mount Rushmore; namely jobs, and lots of them. Every major sector of the state's diverse economy has expanded over the past year, led by manufacturing; logging, mining and construction; and leisure and hospitality. So many job seekers have entered the labor market in the past year, however, that the jobless rate rose by half a percentage point in South Dakota. But the state remains one of the best in the country for jobs. Hawaii Unemployment: 3.7% (tied with New Hampshire) \nAs if living in paradise isn't enough, the Aloha State sports a sunny 3.7% jobless rate, down from 4.3% a year ago. Just about everything in the Hawaiian Islands must be shipped in from the mainland, and that includes vacationers, who are arriving in greater numbers as the U.S. economy continues to improve. Tourism is booming in Hawaii, and that's expected to continue in the coming years. New Hampshire Unemployment: 3.7% (tied with Hawaii) \nEven as the national unemployment rate hit 10% during the recession, the Granite State never rose above 6.6%. So it's no surprise that its current rate is also quite low, thanks to robust growth in the trade, transportation and utilities sector. One particularly soft spot, though, has been in local government jobs, which have declined over the past year. Utah Unemployment: 3.6% (tied with Vermont) \nThere's plenty of buzz about the Beehive State, where the jobless rate has consistently remained well below the national average. Nine of 10 private sector industry groups have grown over the past year, led by leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and education and health services. The state's jobless rate has ticked higher in 2015, however, though state officials attribute that to the \"churn\" of workers who have quit jobs in search of better ones. Vermont Unemployment: 3.6% (tied with Utah) \nTied with Utah for the 3rd-lowest jobless rate in the nation, tiny Vermont has a job for just about anyone who wants one. State officials report solid demand for workers across much of the Green Mountain State, with health care employees in particular demand. But there have been soft spots of late: Jobs in financial and business, state government and professional services have declined in recent months. North Dakota Unemployment: 3% \nIn recent years, jobs in North Dakota have been spelled \"o-i-l.\" But the plunge in crude prices over the past year has put the brakes on the state's energy boom, with North Dakota registering the nation's largest over-the-month decline in employment (-0.5%) in July. Layoffs in the oil patch have occurred, and analysts warn that if prices remain low, there could be additional cutbacks. Nebraska Unemployment: 2.7%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:03:20.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
