Given the turmoil that has afflicted emerging markets in recent weeks—and a useful tax break from the British government—few now expect the duo to decamp. Having been celebrated by investors for global networks spanning the likes of China, India and Brazil, banks are now being punished for them.\nEmerging markets boomed partly on the back of cheap funds that Citigroup, HSBC, StanChart and others helped shovel their way—a flow now operating in reverse. Bankers battled to lend money to firms digging mines, erecting skyscrapers and building factories on the assumption that growth in China would never falter.\nIn this section Still in business With great power Emerging troubles Like manna from heaven A tax on the poor Inflated claims Industries Banking Financial services Commercial banking Asia\nThose loans look less canny now that China’s slowing economy and tumbling commodity prices have dimmed the currencies and prospects of many emerging markets. A few customers will undoubtedly default, starting with firms which borrowed in dollars but relied on income in ringgit, rand or rupiah to meet repayments.\nLoan losses are starting to creep up. StanChart, whose biggest line of corporate business is lending to the energy sector, announced a near-doubling of impairments for bad debts at its latest quarterly results. Bill Winters, a boss parachuted in earlier this year amid suspicions that money had gone out the door uncontrollably, said it was not at the end of the bad-debt cycle. Worse, it has no rich-world unit to cushion the shortfall from emerging markets.\nLike StanChart, HSBC makes around three-quarters of its profits in Asia. It is thought to have been more disciplined in the loans it has made. But trade finance, a reliable engine of growth, now looks to be sputtering. Global trade suffered its biggest fall in six years in the first half of 2015. And the business is heavily linked to commodities: given price falls, even financing the same volumes of metals or pork bellies will mean smaller loans.\nIn line with local peers, HSBC’s loan book in Asia grew at 15% a year between 2010 and 2014. Such increases are now unthinkable, if only because lending levels have to bear some sort of resemblance to available collateral—the value of which is sinking. And banks have to run just to stand still: even a stable loan book would mean smaller profits once gains are converted from sagging local currencies to dollars, the unit of account for most big banks. A fifth of StanChart’s and a quarter of HSBC’s profits are in “potentially weak” currencies, according to analysts at Citi.\nShare prices have been hammered (see chart). For the first time in years, HSBC is trading below the value of its tangible net assets, a fate it avoided throughout the financial crisis. StanChart is valued by investors at just 64% of tangible net assets, down from nearly 300% after the financial crisis. The emerging-market rout derailed a steady recovery in Citi’s share price, too.\nAll this is unpleasant but still some distance from the chaos of 1997 or 2008. That could change if local banks start toppling: StanChart, for example, has $87.5 billion of loans and advances to banks, a third of them in China. A deterioration in the property market there would send banks scrambling to cut lending lines, or force them to foreclose on iffy assets.\nBanks are far from the only industry rethinking their positioning. But emerging markets have provided a struggling sector with two scarce resources: growth and profits. HSBC’s Hong Kong unit made returns on equity of 35% last year, for example, compared with 8% outside Asia. That sort of oomph is not easily replaced.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150905_FNC612.png"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:45:34.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
