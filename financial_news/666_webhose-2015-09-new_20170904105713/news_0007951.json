The series takes place in a fictional Tokyo, which is plagued by human-looking monsters named Ghouls. Humanity lives in fear of Ghouls, which survive by feasting on human flesh. The Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG) forces are the only thing that stands between humanity and the fearsome Ghouls who hunt them.\n\"Ever since we began simulcasting the anime series last year, fans of the Tokyo Ghoul have been clamoring for a mobile game,\" said Gen Fukunaga, CEO and President of FUNimation Entertainment. \"With Season 2 now finished and Season 3 set for 2016, the anticipation for the mobile game has only grown higher.\"\nThe new \"Tokyo Ghoul\" game will focus on the conflict between humans and the CCG. By selecting a side, players will be able to help determine the path that the conflict takes. With elements of RPGs and action games, the \"Tokyo Ghoul\" game will remain faithful to the source material’s style, as players choose to hunt humans, or protect them.\nThe game will be available in English worldwide on Android and Apple devices. It is currently scheduled for release in 2016. The home video release and the digital HD dub version of \"Tokyo Ghoul\" Season 1 will be available starting September 22, 2015. The digital subtitled version has already been released.\nMore details about the game will be revealed throughout the coming months. To stay up to date on the development of the game, fans can stay tuned to the GameSamba website and Facebook page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:05:48.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
