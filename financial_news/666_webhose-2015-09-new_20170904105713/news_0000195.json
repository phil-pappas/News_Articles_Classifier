Mr Harrison said someone accessing Help to Buy funds could buy one of the company’s entry-level homes at a cost of £56 a week. “We don’t have any real competitors for what we are doing,” he said. \nThe company increased the number of homes it built during the year by 190 to 751, and the average price across all its homes was £123,750, just 2pc up from £121,500 last year. For comparison, Barratt, one of the UK’s largest housebuilders, has an average selling price of £235,000. \nGleeson reported revenue up 44pc to £118m and pre-tax profit up 42pc at £17.3m for the year ended June. The majority of the performance came from the Gleeson housing division, which reported operating profit up from £9.4m to £17.4m. This was largely due to selling those 190 more homes. \nThe Gleeson strategic land division, which buys greenfield sites in the south of England for development, reported a strong improvement in trading, with profits almost doubling to £8.1m, from £4.8m last year. \nGleeson rewarded investors with a 67pc increase in the dividend to 10p for the year. The shares go ex-dividend on November 18 and the dividend will be paid on December 17. \nThe company suffered in 2008 when its southern-focused housebuilding was hit, sending shares down from about 400p, to 52p. Gleeson has now completed its recovery, and it moved to the main market at the end of last year, where its shares have gained more than 30pc so far this year. \nMarket consensus is for pre-tax profits of £24m, giving earnings per share of 36p, next year. \nGiven the lack of affordable housing, the shares look good over the long term, and we retain our “hold” recommendation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:04:38.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
