(PRWEB) September 16, 2015\nSteve Suchil, Western region assistant vice president for state affairs for American Insurance Association (AIA), issued the statement below following the adjournment of the California Legislature. The 2015 California legislative session ran from January 1 thru September 11. AIA hailed the passage of Assembly Bill 1124 which requires the adoption of a workers’ compensation drug formulary by July 1, 2017. AB 1124 passed on the final day of session and now heads to Governor Jerry Brown (D) for his signature.\nMr. Suchil’s statement follows:\n“A major highlight of California’s 2015 legislative session was the passage of AB 1124. This bill is takes a significant step forward in improving the state workers’ compensation system as it will assist in injured workers' medical outcomes, decrease system bureaucracy and provide for savings. Formularies have been adopted in other states, and have proven to be effective in the managed care setting.\n“AIA supported the legislation and commends Assembly Member Henry Perea for his leadership on the matter. He and his staff worked hard to convene meetings with affected parties and consider various points of view during the legislative process. We urge Governor Brown to sign it.”\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12966156.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12966156.htm"], "published": "2015-09-17T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:22:27.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
