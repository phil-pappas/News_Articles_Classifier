Jessica Shapiro by Sally Rose More superannuation funds are looking to implement automated \"robo-advice\" for members as a way of satisfying the competing demands of bringing down fees, while also improving their members' access to financial advice.\nThe pressure on funds to improve advice is coming from both regulators and a growing band of tech-savvy, bank-owned competitors.At the same time fees are in the firing line, and some super funds cannot afford large teams of financial advisers.\n\"Robo-advice\" is basic financial advice that a super fund can provide to members via online tools.\nNormally, it takes into account personal details such as the individual's age, balance and retirement savings goals. It is increasingly viewed as a good alternative for people who otherwise would not get any advice at all due to the cost.\nLowering fees was a focus of David Murray's financial system inquiry, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has also flagged plans to increase its scrutiny of how funds are delivering economies of scale to members.\n\"Non-profit super funds have traditionally had an edge with low fees, but now that a number of the banks are offering low-cost super options the super funds really need to take their online services to the next level,\" Canstar executive Steve Mickenbecker​ said.\n\"More and more small funds will look to robo-advice solutions to help solve the problem of how to help more of their members access advice\".\nEquip Super, a $7 billion industry fund, announced on Monday that it had paid an undisclosed sum to take a 27 per cent stake in local technology start-up Clover with plans to launch a \"robo-advice\" platform in early 2016 aimed at improving engagement with younger fund members .\n After Equip's \"robo-advice\" platform is rolled out early in 2016, it is anticipated Clover will start selling solutions based on the technology to other funds.\nDemand for advice Consumers are beginning to show a growing appetite for financial advice from their super funds and how those funds respond will probably depend on their member make-up.\nVision Super, a $7.5 billion public sector fund for local government and water authority employees, recorded an almost 70 per cent jump in the number of members taking financial advice in the year ended June 30, 2015. Last financial year the fund advised 2422 of its nearly 100,000 members, up from 1431 people the previous year, following an engagement campaign.\n\"Over the past year we've deliberately set about going out into the community and engaging with our members to make sure they don't reach the retirement date having never spoken to their super fund to find out what we can do for them,\" Vision Super chief executive Stephen Rowe said.\nA number of the largest industry super funds, such as $91 billion AustralianSuper and $50 billion UniSuper, have already boosted their in-house advice teams over recent years, as well as investing heavily iin technology.\nFew small funds can replicate that strategy.\nCareSuper chairwoman Cate Wood said the $9 billion industry fund for administration workers with typically modest balances was investigating better ways to provide advice – online, over the phone, and face-to face – for its members, including looking at new partnerships with outsourced providers.\n\"It is a difficult balancing act. We have always operated on the basis of keeping costs down so we can pass on the savings via low fees, but regulation and the changing needs of our members as their savings grow mean that we have to find a cost-effective way to deliver the education and advice they need\".\nMs Wood said CareSuper would also consider collaborating with other small funds on initiatives to bring down the fees paid to investment managers, a major component of the total fees passed on to members .\n\"One possibility is developing an investment platform with other funds, while another is coming together to negotiate with fund managers on their fees\".\nMr Mickenbecker, who oversees Canstar's super-fund rating system, said it was important funds find new ways to make sure their members are getting the education and advice needed to ensure they are in the most appropriate investment option for their age and balance profile.\n\"Selecting the right investment option is probably the most important thing the average person aged in their 20s or 30s can do to improve the long term performance of their super, followed closely by making sure they are in a low-fee fund,\" he said.\n\"And as people get closer to retirement access to advice becomes even more important\".", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/fund-manager-profit-party-is-over-warns-super-sector-20150904-gjf7ne.html"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:05:17.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
