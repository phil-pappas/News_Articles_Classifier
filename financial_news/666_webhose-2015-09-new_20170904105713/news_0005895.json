Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, plans to issue $1.5 billion of notes in two-parts to pay for its acquisition of Interline Brands Inc. and to repurchase stock.\nBond sales by U.S. investment-grade companies are cranking up after global growth concerns stemming from news of an economic slowdown in China kept issuance at bay in the worst late-summer drought since 2005.
