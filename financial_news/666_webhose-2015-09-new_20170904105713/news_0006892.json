Nevertheless, that's generally not a winning strategy, according to Adam Galinsky, author of Friend & Foe . \n\"We found in our research for the book that when team members have to work together, they have to collaborate and they are interdependent,\" said Galinsky. \"Yet, when you get too much talent, performance no longer goes up but it actually starts to go down because now you are getting status conflicts.\" \nGalinsky said the best way to organize teams is to have a mix of people in different roles to avoid these conflicts even if it sounds counterintuitive. In the end, it will encourage collaboration among the team members, as opposed to competition.

He recounted how Google at one point tried to eliminate managers because it wanted to empower engineers and highlighted the disastrous results when Amazon's Zappo's division tried to flatten its management structure. \"Hierarchy provides order. It helps patterns of deference. It helps cooperation and coordination,\" said Galinsky, adding that low-powered people need the opportunity to speak up. If one of those low-powered people want a raise, Galinsky said the best way to do it is to have a strong outside offer. The second most important factor is having good information as to what other people are being paid for the same or similar role. \"When you go in with that information, you want to put a strong anchor down on the table,\" said Galinsky. \"You want to have as ambitious an offer as you can without going to the wrong side of crazy.\" Finally, Galinsky said women face a \"double bind\" because they cannot always act the same way as men with power do. That said, they do have the power to negotiate ambitiously and aggressively if they frame it in a larger context. For example, they are better off when they say that they are not just negotiating for themselves but for others as well. \"Once women understand the double bind they face, they can start to construct ways to overcome that double bind,\" said Galinsky.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:10:24.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
