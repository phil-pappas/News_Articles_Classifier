With the labour force steadily increasing at 4.4 per cent annually, an enormous effort to create employment opportunity complying with the trend is called for. \nCognizant of this, the Ethiopian government has adopted a number of policies and programmes and recently launched the Second Growth and Transformation Plan which focuses, among others, on job creation and poverty reduction. \nThe Ethiopian Employers Federation (EEF)Vice President Tadesse Iyasu recently said that despite some reversal of the trend, unemployment rate remains high in urban areas especially for women and youth. Urban employment has been high because of a number of factors such as the limited size and structure of manufacturing sector, increasing labour force from population pressure, mismatch of labour demand and supply, limited institutional capacity of those who are concerned with labour market issues and lack of accurate and comprehensive data of labour market information, he added. \nHe also said that as a tripartite partner, the federation is involved in crafting and implementing policies and programmes as regards the employer, employee and the society at large. \nThe mission of the EEF is to safeguard the rights and benefits of employers and promote job creation and decent work in Ethiopia. To accomplish this mission, EEF is assisting its members and potential members to have good industrial relation and boost production and productivity at firm level by offering training and providing legal services and advocacy, Tadesse said. \nAccording to him, to effectively address unemployment problem and create more jobs and promote descent work in the country, the tripartite partners should stress on implementing programmes that encourage urban entrepreneurship and job creation. They have to support programmes that focus on rural employment. They as well have to support the emerging green economy, the designing and scaling up labour intensive public works and strengthening labour market institutions. \nThey are expected to strengthen support to higher learning institutions thereby establishing firm link between vocational skills and education and the need for labour market particularly the needs of enterprises operating in the private sector.
