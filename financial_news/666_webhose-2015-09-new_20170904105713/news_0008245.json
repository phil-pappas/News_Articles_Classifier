Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed:\n\nBlackstone Group : \"A lot of people worry about Blackstone because the stock has acted poorly. I come back and say wait a second, the yield is fine and I want to be a buyer not a seller.\" \nKKR & Co LP : \"People feel that there is not a lot of room to be able to exit certain stocks and they want to come public. There is also a sense that they need high yield debt and the high yield market is closing. I have conviction that this stock over the long-term has been a winner and I'm not backing away.\" \nPlatform Specialty Products: \"Platform Specialty is a company that needs high yield debt to continue to make the acquisitions that would make it so that the company is a growth company. That window for that high yield debt seems to be closing and that is why people are selling that stock.\" \nWal-Mart : \"Longer term someone might be attracted to Doug Mcmillon's [CEO] turn at Wal-Mart with a 3 percent yield. I think the turn is a couple of quarters away. In the interim I would suggest why not buy Costco. It reports next week and it could have a really good quarter.\" \nAnnaly Capital Management: \"I'm not a fan of Annaly. I think that the 11 percent yield will not necessarily make it up. People think it's a bond, it's not. I'd rather own something that has growth and dividend which would be General Mills.\"\nRead more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer \nCramer Remix: Here is your Volkswagen trade \nCramer: Caterpillar pain is just beginning \nCramer's tale of horrorâ€”activism ruined this stock \nGW Pharma : \"Right now these kinds of stocks, the biotech stocks, have fallen very out of favor...At the same time we've got a lot a problems with companies that don't have dividends, don't have buybacks. Unfortunately GW Pharma has neither of those. So therefore you have to be careful even though I like it long-term.\"\nPotash Corp: \"We have seen some bad numbers out of the agriculture companies this year. We have seen really bad numbers out of the fertilizer companies. That has a 7 percent yield but I am not attracted to it because as we have been seeing, those big yields are not protecting people anymore because people feel the stocks have more room down.\"\nCelgene Corp : \"Celgene is a very difficult situation, I'll tell you why. Because the stock is up huge from last year and because all of these stocks are in for sale right now I think if we look back at Celgene, if you get it under $100 you are going to be very proud. But let's wait until it gets there.\"\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC \nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
