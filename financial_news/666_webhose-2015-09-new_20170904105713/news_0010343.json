Of particular interest to the Centre is the strategic directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Federal Government to start using Treasury Single Account (TSA). \n“The Centre believes strongly that this is a step in the right direction capable of ending leakages of revenues meant for the federation account.”Anas said government must as a matter of urgency strengthen all institutions and especially the anti-corruption agencies. \nThese include Economic and Financial Crime Commission, Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) and Code of Conduct Bureau.Anas said while they supported the current fight against corruption, the centre wanted to caution that due process must be followed to ensure that no one elude the justice system. He acknowledged the support of several countries, especially United States, Britain and China, in the current drive against corruption and corrupt practices in Nigeria. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7942   3 2015.
