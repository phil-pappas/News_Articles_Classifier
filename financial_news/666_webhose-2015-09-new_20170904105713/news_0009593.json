Only few private cars and two wheelers were seen on the roads.\nShops, hotels and even small tea stalls were closed in the state.\nThe government had yesterday appealed trade unions call off the agitation in the interest of workers and nation.\nThe unions however decided to go ahead with strike as their talks with a ministerial panel headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley last month did not make any headway on their 12-point charter of demands.\nTrade unionsâ€™ 12-point charter of demands includes urgent measures to contain price rise, contain unemployment, strict enforcement of basic labour laws, universal social security cover for all workers and minimum wage of Rs 15,000 per month.\nThey are also demanding enhanced pension for workers, stoppage of disinvestment in PSUs, stoppage of contractorisation, removal of ceiling on bonus and provident fund, compulsory registration of trade unions within 45 days, no amendment to labour laws unilaterally, stopping of FDI in Railways, Defence etc.\n 02, 2015 8:36 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:58:19.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
