Heidi Gutman Share on twitter by Philip Baker It's volatile all right. And any investor thinking the start of a new month will bring some much-needed calm should remember that Thursday is the first day of October, often called the \"witching month\" for the sharemarket.\nThe 1929 and 1987 sharemarket crash occurred in October, as did the long-term capital management crisis in 1998, giving the month a certain but unwanted reputation.\nMore recently, there was panic selling of shares on October 10, 2008, when the local sharemarket fell 8 per cent.\nOver the past 30 years, local stocks on average have fallen about half of 1 per cent, while the month of September normally ends up being close to break even.\nThis September, however, wasn't a good one for investors.\nThe major S&P ASX 200 index fell 3.56 per cent and nine months into the 2015 calendar year, six of them have now been in the red following a bright start.\nBut a decent bounce amid some window-dressing of stocks on Wednesday did help to improve the monthly and quarterly performance of the major S&P ASX 200 index, although the issues over China, commodity prices and interest rates in the United States haven't gone away.\nWorst quarter in four years The spike higher, however, wasn't enough to avoid the index putting in its worst quarter in four years when it dipped 8 per cent.\nIt was the worst three-month performance since shares fell 13 per cent in the third quarter of 2011.\nThe major index is now hovering just above the 5000 level, but for any investor who jumped on board when it first went through that level, in March, 2006, it's been almost a lost decade.\nThere's been no capital growth, but dividends have kicked in to deliver a return of 4.6 per cent a year.\nIt's also worth noting that although shares are down 15 per cent since the sell-off, that started in April, it still hasn't made them that cheap.\nIn February when the index was getting ready to launch an assault on 6000, the forward price earnings ratio of the market was as high as 16.2 times.\nIt's closer to just over 14 times earnings now but that's just in line with longer-term averages.\nCompare that to the middle of 2012 when stocks started to really rally, the forward PE was closer to 10.5 times, while in March 2009, when investors had totally capitulated due to the financial crisis, the market was trading on a forward multiple of just under 9 times earnings.\nExpect to see the c-word Given the savage sell-off over the past two quarters, expect to see the c-word tossed around a lot more by fund managers and analysts.\nCapitulation is a key signal for many professional investors to start buying.\nIt's when the real panic selling comes in.\nEquity strategists will argue that the sharemarket always thinks ahead of actual events, and that if we see a \"capitulation\" type sell-off in the markets, this could signal the bottom.\nCapitulation takes over when nervous investors just want to get their money back, fearful that shares will fall further than they have and despite the heavy falls that have already played out.\nCapitulation also means those investors are willing to give up any previous gains they might have had and are almost happy to take the financial loss, just to get out of the sharemarket.\nReal capitulation occurs when there is extremely high volume – or high numbers of traded shares – and sharp declines in stock prices.\nVolumes were higher in late August than what they have been in September when the selling was extended, implying investors haven't capitulated just yet.\nOne well-known investor who thinks there could be some more selling in the months ahead is Carl Icahn .\nIn a video he released himself , the 79-year-old activist investor said he has taken out more hedges over his portfolio than ever before and warns there could be another major financial collapse in the United States.\nIn no real order he said that record low interest rates in the US, \"are almost by definition building bubbles\", while companies are really making their balance sheets more brittle by announcing so many buybacks.\nIcahn also has a go at the way firms engineer their earnings through mergers and acquisitions and worries that junk bonds with their alluring yields are being sold through ETFs to mum-and-dad investors who don't really understand them", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://carlicahn.com/"], "published": "2015-09-30T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:04:44.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
