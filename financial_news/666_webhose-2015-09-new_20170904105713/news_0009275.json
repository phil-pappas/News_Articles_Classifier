Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The $18,200 tax-free threshold would be dumped, four new tax brackets linked to average earnings, and a top rate of 45 per cent would be created, under a KPMG plan to fix bracket creep .\nLow-income earners would get a low-income tax offset and work incentive offset would encourage people to derive income from paid employment rather than welfare.\n\"The work incentive tax offset would be focused on increasing labour participation among the low incomes, generally second incomes, in a family,\" KPMG said. \"This should assist in increasing female participation.\"\nKPMG uses average full-time weekly earnings - now $80,000 a year - to establish four tax brackets. The bottom bracket would tax those earning up to a third of average full-time weekly earnings, or up to $27,000, at 15 cents in the dollar.\nAt the upper end, people earning more than twice average weekly earnings, or $160,000, would be taxed at 45 cents in the dollar.\nTax partner Grant Wardell-Johnson said the standard solution to bracket creep was to link thresholds to either inflation or wage growth.\nBut the public would view the system as fairer if tax brackets were set as a proportion of average weekly earnings, he said.\nBracket creep occurs because tax thresholds are fixed but wages keep rising. Without tax cuts, most of the budget repair that will occur in coming years will be the result of bracket creep.\n \"We must address bracket creep\", Treasurer Joe Hockey says. Gabriele Charotte The Grattan Institute has estimated bracket creep will contribute an extra $25 billion by 2018-19.\nIncentives reduced\nThe downside is that as greater shares of the workforce are subject to higher marginal rates of tax, incentives to work and to earn are eroded.\nAn estimated 1.7 million people, or 18 per cent of all taxpayers, will enter higher tax brackets over the next four years.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey has flagged a desire to so something about the problem and there is speculation he could try to use extra revenue generated by a GST rise to ease bracket creep.\nUnder the KPMG plan, prepared as part of the government's tax white paper process, the existing tax free threshold of $18,200 would be dumped.\nMany workers face what are known as high effective marginal tax rates. According to the Australian National University's Tax and Transfer Policy Unit, a woman on an average income can end up with an effective marginal tax rate of more than 100 per cent if she goes back to work for four days after caring for children.\nThis happens because as her income level rises, family tax benefits and childcare assistance drops.\nSimilarly, someone on a low income can be disinclined to take extra shifts because it eats into their welfare payments.\nMr Wardell-Johnson said the ideal scenario would be for childcare and other family assistance payments to be made per child.\nFurthermore, eligibility for such assistance should be calculated not according to the family's overall income but a primary carer's wages.\nUniversity of Sydney public economics professor Patricia Apps agreed the switch during the Howard years to payments linked to joint income had been detrimental for women in particular.\nThe result was a \"quasi-joint family taxation system\" in which high marginal tax rates apply across a range of incomes and to the income of second-wage earners, usually women. Female participation in the workforce therefore remained unacceptably low.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:13:53.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
