The firm, founded in the Belgian city of Ghent in 2011, provides an innovative software platform that allows companies to keep in touch with their salesforces through a variety of mobile devices, enabling them to see what pitches work and thus improving their marketing. In 2013 it got $2m of funding from Hummingbird Ventures, a venture-capital fund also operating out of Ghent; last year it attracted a further $8.5m from Hummingbird and Dawn Capital, a London-based fund. That support has allowed Showpad to set up offices in San Francisco and London, scaling up its operations to employ around 100 staff. Some 750 firms are now using the service; the firm expects its recurring revenues to reach $10m this year. \nThis happy pairing of European investors and European entrepreneurs is far from unique. As startup industries have bloomed in several cities in the European Union, including Berlin, London and Stockholm, the amount of money raised by European venture-capital funds has surged. Even so, they have a long way to go to catch up with their American counterparts, which raised $30.7 billion in 2014, over five times as much as the €4.1 billion ($5.4 billion) collected in the EU. In this section Reprints \nAlthough European startups can generally raise early-stage funding, often bolstered by public money, they commonly have to turn to American funds when they subsequently expand their activities and so need bigger dollops of investment. One reason is that there are too few big funds in Europe, with only a fifth reaching over €100m in size, says Dörte Höppner of the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. \nThe relative puniness of venture-capital provision forms part of a larger failing in European capital markets (see chart). Although the economies of America and the EU are similar in size, Europe’s corporate-bond market is about a third of the size of America’s. Private placements, where firms borrow directly from institutional investors such as insurers, are also much smaller. Equity finance is far more limited, too. The EU’s stockmarkets were worth 64.5% of GDP in 2013—half America’s 138%. Among Europe’s big economies, market capitalisations that year varied from over 120% of GDP in Britain to just 35% in Italy. \nAs a result European companies as well as households rely heavily upon banks. European banks, in turn, make much less use than American ones of securitisation—the repackaging of bank loans into securities that can be sold to investors. The market for securitised assets in Europe is a mere fifth the size of America’s. \nThe overreliance on banks has been an Achilles’ heel for European economies, especially on the periphery of the euro area. Since the financial crisis, as banks have attempted to repair their balance-sheets by curbing lending, businesses have been starved of credit. Although lending is beginning to grow again, Europe’s capital markets will have to become more like those of America if it is to make a sustained recovery. Firms need to find alternatives to banks, and banks themselves need to attract more funding via securitisation. \nThe disparity between European and American capital markets reflects long-standing institutional and cultural differences. Pools of private pension money are less plentiful in Europe than in America. Instead, state-financed pay-as-you-go pensions are the norm (Britain and the Netherlands are big exceptions). This is changing as countries like Germany encourage a bigger private component, but it will take a long time for the shift to generate a big boost to retirement savings available for capital markets. With some exceptions, such as Oxford and Cambridge, Europe also lacks the huge university endowments that contribute to the money going into America’s venture-capital funds. \nSavers in Europe have also tended to be less adventurous than in America, preferring to leave their money safely (as they have regarded it) in banks, even when interest rates are derisory. Europeans are reluctant to venture abroad when they invest too: 94% say they have never bought a financial product outside their country and 80% say they would not consider doing so. Furthermore, even when investors make funds available, businesses are sometimes reluctant to turn to capital markets rather than banks. Particularly in southern Europe but also in Germany, family-based firms are loth to cede control. \nMany of the shortcomings of European capital markets could be alleviated if capital flowed more readily across borders within the EU, creating a capital-markets union—an aim of the European Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker. However, proclaiming that goal is easier than accomplishing it because of deeply entrenched barriers. One that particularly bothers investors is the variation in Europe’s insolvency rules. The legal status of creditors varies from country to country, making it hard for investors to assess the risks they are taking on. Yet harmonising the rules would be an uphill struggle for the commission, because it involves an area of policy-making in which national governments have not ceded power to Brussels. \nJonathan Hill, the commissioner in charge of the drive for capital-markets union, cautions that progress will be gradual. He will focus on two initiatives when he presents an “action plan” at the end of this month. One aims to revive securitisations in Europe by creating a standard template for them, making them simpler and more transparent than those that prevailed before the financial crisis. The other will be a slimmed-down prospectus that smaller firms can use when raising equity, making the process less laborious and costly. \nAmong a wide range of further measures that the commission has been contemplating, the most useful thing it can do is to ease the effects of new capital requirements for insurers, called Solvency II. These are a particular concern because although the pool of capital available from private pensions is smaller in Europe than in America, that from the insurance industry is larger. Insurers are a natural source of long-term funds, but by increasing capital charges, Solvency II discourages them from investing in certain assets, including infrastructure, venture-capital funds and securitised products. \nThe commission will seek to address some of these concerns. But the underlying moral—that unnecessary regulation is impairing European capital markets—seems lost on many governments. Eleven EU members still plan to introduce a financial-transactions tax, for example—not the sort of measure that helps money flow. Europe’s capital markets can only hope to vie with America’s if they are left as unfettered as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:01:24.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
