Analysts said the trend was likely due to the downturn in China—the origin and destination for much of the West Coast trade.\nA slowdown in China “has a disproportionate impact on traffic through the West Coast ports,” said Jock O’Connell, an international economic analyst with Beacon Economics.\nrelated stories\nLong Beach Sets Record Container Volume U.S. Trade Gap Narrows in July Warning Signs at Ports Presaged China Woes West Coast port officials have hailed July as a banner month—with the Port of Long Beach setting a record for container volume, suggesting big shippers were moving their business back to the West Coast permanently as their memories of epic labor-related springtime delays faded.\nPort of Long Beach Chief Executive Jon Slangerup said in an interview Thursday that the port is solidifying a comeback after a protracted and bitter labor negotiation that began last year and culminated in severe backlogs. Many shippers decided to move cargo through alternative gateways as delays grew and ships were stalled off the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nTotal container volume at Long Beach for the first eight months of the year is about 3% higher than the same period in 2014, Mr. Slangerup said. He estimates that growth will continue in the coming months, and that the port will end the year with a 5% increase in volume, a turnaround from the first two months of the year when container volume was down 10%.\n“All the business we lost to the East Coast has come roaring back,” Mr. Slangerup said.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

But container volumes and the value of the goods they contain are different metrics, Mr. O’Connell said. “Here’s a case of, ‘What’s in the box?’” he said.\nThe figures from Beacon, which have shown the West Coast below a 50% share for several months, suggest shippers may have decided to move more higher-value goods to East and Gulf Coast ports over the long term.\nShippers and logistics companies for several years have used rail and trucking services to move higher-value imported shipments relatively quickly from the U.S. West Coast to points across the country. Logistics industry experts say that as manufacturing moves away from China into lower-cost Southeast Asian countries and parts of Africa, however, it could become more common for those products to ship through the Suez Canal and to the U.S. East Coast.\n“The rise of foreign car manufacturing in the Southeast and its steady expansion is certainly going to drive a lot more automotive component trade through ports in the Southeast,” Mr. O’Connell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:54:06.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
