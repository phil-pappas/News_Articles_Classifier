Luis Enrique Ascui by Duncan Hughes Plans to close Sandown race track and undertake a major expansion of the Caulfield Course are being considered by the Victorian state government.\nThe multi-billion redevelopment is expected to include residential, commercial and retail property projects, according to racing sources.\nA master plan, which has been commissioned by the Melbourne Racing Club (MRC) and being considered by the Racing Minister Martin Pakula, is also believed to include developing a second race track at the Caulfield course, they claim.\nBut the plans are likely to inflame Glen Eira Council where Caulfield Race Track is situated, which is battling to increase public use of the 54-hectare Crown site that is meant to be a park, community space and track. The council fears an additional track would absorb the public spaces, particularly on race days.\nSenior sources said redevelopment of Sandown Park, which is about 30 kilometres south east of Melbourne, could involve part, or all, of the of the 112 hectare horse and car racing site, which is located on a major growth and transport hub.\nThe master plan has been developed to consider alternatives for the land, possible upgrades and developments over the next 15 to 20 years. No decisions have been taken and a range of options are being considered.\nUncompleted land swap Glen Eira Council claims Victorian taxpayers paid the MRC for a carpark on Crown Land that borders a $1 billion development on former Crown Land recently gifted to the club, in an uncompleted land swap.\n MRC said it has offered replacement land and blames the state government for failing to complete the swap.\nThe two month car park deal paid the MRC $90,000, more than $1400 a day, or more than 4000 times what the club proposes to pay a day for the annual lease on the 54-hectare race course site that is currently under negotiation.\nThe car park is another flashpoint between the MRC, state government and local officials about how the 155-year-old site can be most equitably divided between racing, parkland and a public recreation area.\n\"The community is being charged to park on land they already own,\" Mayor of Glen Eira Jim Magee said. \"In two months the MRC will earn from the car park what it annually pays for the race track lease,\" Cr Magee said.\nVictoria's Environment Minister Lisa Neville refused to comment on why the government was paying the rent and what additional steps were underway to complete the land swap.\nOfficials claim the minister is refusing to talk to senior local government officials, despite several requests. But sources say the council is angry because it is losing potential parking revenue.\nState Labor members of parliament were members of the Caulfield Racecourse Reserve Trust, which is the course's governing body and effectively MRC's landlord â€“ which voted in favour of the land swap.\nLocal residents and councillors allege the powerful racing club is using its political muscle, and numbers on the racecourse's governing trust, for its own interests.\nThe state government rented the car park for rail patrons during refurbishment of nearby stations.\nA spokesman for MRC said the car park area was being used as a commercial car park before the deal for a short-term lease with the government.\nA recent report by the state's auditor-general recommends improved disclosure of finances, performance and management of \"perceived conflicts of interest\" in the course's management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T14:53:03.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
