Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the lawmakers sent a letter on Tuesday to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requesting an update as to where the currency issue stands in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks. ADVERTISEMENT “Recent comments by foreign TPP negotiators to Senate staff members suggest very little progress has been made on this issue,” the seven senators wrote. \n“We would appreciate your perspective as to the impact these devaluations are having on U.S. workers and your efforts to address them in the continuing TPP negotiations,” they wrote. \nBrown and Portman, among others, have repeatedly called for TPP negotiations to include strong provisions that address currency manipulation, which they argue hurts U.S. auto exports and workers. \nThey reiterated concerns about foreign countries devaluing their currency, including China, Vietnam and Korea, saying it “could lead to a pattern of competitive devaluation within the Asia-Pacific that could hurt U.S. workers and exports for years to come.” \n“Thus, currency issues must be addressed seriously, aggressively and promptly.” \nAlong with Brown and Portman, the letter was also signed by Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). \nPast: 1 day Colbert presses Justice Breyer to...
