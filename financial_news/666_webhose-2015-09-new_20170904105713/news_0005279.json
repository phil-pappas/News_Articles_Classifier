This remains a burning issue and is at the top of this Commission's agenda,\" he said. \nThe losses in pure money terms were worst among the biggest and richer economies -- 47.5 billion euros for Italy, 14 billion euros for France and 24.8 billion euros for Germany. \nBut as a percentage of potential VAT lost, lower-income countries were way ahead, with Romania showing a 41 percent loss, Slovakia 34.9 percent and Greece 34 percent. \nIn comparison, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden excelled with only a 4-percent VAT gap. \nPowerhouse Germany saw 11 percent less VAT than expected and France even lower at 9 percent. \nThe topic is a sensitive one for many tax-starved countries and the European Union as an institution in particular. Plagued by debt problems, strapped governments have latched on to boosting VAT as a way to bolster their strained public finances. \nThe EU bureaucracy itself is financed in part by a sizeable share of VAT collected on the national level. Missing revenue in member countries means less cash for Brussels as well. \nOther than fraud, late payments, bankruptcies and administrative errors also play an important role, the report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:30:50.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
