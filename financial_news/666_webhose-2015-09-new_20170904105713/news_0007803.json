There are also severe penalties for not reporting.Given the additional FinCen 114 and IRS Form 8938 filing obligations. Many people in the USA are now looking at their UK pensions as a liability rather than an asset.\nWhether you are a British expat USA green card holder, or a USA national who has worked in the UK. If you have a UK pension plan, you need to take advice. If you are not reporting your UK pension you need to act now.\nAs far as the IRS is concerned UK pension schemes simply do not fit into US tax reporting. However they do need to be reported. The penalties for not reporting are sever. It is also worth noting that under IRS reporting the annual gain on your UK pension plan must be reported in the US, and may be taxable, dependent on the type of UK pension you have. Their treatment by the IRS is governed by the DTA between the UK and the USA, which is not that favourable.\nUK pensions are taxed in the UK under a scheme known as PAYE (Pay As You Earn) and the tax is paid by the income provider. So it is taken at source. This income is also reportable, and taxable in the USA. Under the UK/USA DTA (Double Tax Agreement) you can offset this tax in your IRS return. Unfortunately this is easier said than done, and the process can be very complicated and expensive, requiring specialist tax advisers to submit your return each year. In Addition UK pension providers will only send your pension to a UK bank account. If you have not got a UK bank account, you will need to open one. Unfortunately if you no longer have a UK address it is near impossible to open one. Also if you did manage to have your UK pension income paid to a UK bank account you will also need to file two additional forms to the IRS each year, even if the account produces no taxable income.\nYou also face tax problems on the UK side. Creating a higher tax liability in the UK than you would have in the USA. Currently the UK tax system allows you to earn £10,600pa ($16,662pa) tax free. This is known as your personal allowance. The income tax on income above this amount starts at 20%, with the high rate set at 40%. However this income is also taxable in the USA, on the whole amount. But importantly in the USA this income is taxed at a starting rate of only 10%. With the next bracket at a rate of only 15%. Meaning the majority of people will be better off being taxed directly in the US rather than paying 20% in the UK. Then attempting to offset this against US tax due.\nThings are also about to get a whole lot worse. It is also highly likely, given the austerity measures being introduced by every government in Europe. That along with the £12bn in benefit cuts earmarked to take place in the UK, which include taxing disability benefits. The UK government is looking to remove personal tax allowances for non-residents’. This will see your UK pension taxed on every pound at source. However with the starting rate of income tax in the US at half that of the UK. Meaning you will be better off being taxed directly in the US rather than the UK. If you are in a UK pension scheme you will not have the option. If you end up paying tax on the whole of your UK pension income at source in the UK, you will be substantially worse off.\nWith the complications of IRS tax reporting. The additional tax payable on the income at source in the UK, and the possibility of falling into the “Catch 22”of not being able to open a UK bank account, to receive your pension payments. There has to be a simpler way to receive this income. The good news is, there is an alternative. Since 2006 UK pensions can be transferred out of the UK to a Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme, or QROPS.\nThis is an overseas pension scheme that meets certain requirements set by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A QROPS can receive the transfer of a UK Pension without incurring an unauthorised payment and scheme sanction charge. The QROPS program was launched on 6 April 2006 as a part of new legislation with the objective of simplifying pensions. This allows you to transfer your UK pensions to a jurisdiction that allows for benefits that you could only dream of in the UK.\nFrom 2006 on, a growing number of people in the USA started to realise that their UK pension could be transferred out of the UK. Many started the process to transfer their UK pension to their IRA or 401(k) plan. Over the next seven years fourteen US pension plans were added to the HMRC registered QROPS list. However transfers to these plans were blocked by the IRS. As the IRS have deemed UK pension transfers to any US pension arrangement incompatible given the different structure of tax and benefits. There is little chance that this will change. There has been one change, this year the number of registered QROPS in the US has been reduced to only two. Neither can accept a UK pension transfer. As can any US-based financial structure at all for that matter.\nOutside the US no QROPS Trust was in a position to meet the strict IRS tax reporting requirements. Understanding the problems involved we have worked closely with QROPS providers and investment vehicle providers and have been able to construct QROPS solutions specifically for USA residents. We understand that a UK pension scheme transfer undertaken for a USA resident has to meet IRS tax reporting and be acceptable as a foreign trust. The solutions we offer are fully recognised by the IRS as Qualifying Pension Schemes under a DTA (Double Tax Agreement) and as such meet all IRS reporting requirements, as included in FATCA amendment IRB 2010-60.\nIt is worth noting that of the hundreds of QROPS now registered with HMRC only six are suitable for a USA resident, or national. The rest of the trusts will never be acceptable to the IRS, as they are unable to meet the strict reporting requirements, given the way they are constructed.\nIn 2010 we were the first company to be able to offer US compatible QROPS solutions.\nWe continue to work with QROPS Trustees to bring new solutions to the market, and are able to offer the lowest costing options. Offering our clients access to the top QROPS providers but at discounted rates far below the providers published rates.\nWaterstone are able to offer a Zero initial charge for all QROPS providers in all jurisdictions. We are also able to offer QROPS Trust fees with up to a 50% discount.\nThis means if you have been Quote: d a fee structure for your QROPS\n transfer Waterstone will be able to offer you the same package on a lower fee.\nMoving your UK pension arrangements to a QROPS if suitable given your own particular circumstances, can only improve your position.\nMost importantly, once moved to a QROPS you have control over your money. If left in your UK pension arrangement it is highly likely that additional constraints will be put in place which will adversely affect you.\nIf you have a UK pension and have left the UK, or are considering a QROPS transfer, contact Waterstone Investment Associates, and transfer your UK pension at the lowest possible cost.\nFor further details contact: This email address is being protected from spambots.
