Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nOUR BUSINESS We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, and beginning in March 2014, Taiwan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services include order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand. \nOVERVIEW Our results for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2015 were negatively impacted by: � foreign exchange rate fluctuations; \n� delayed or canceled receipts of merchandise due to U.S. West Coast port congestion; and \n� certain charges incurred in connection with the Company's strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. \nFinancial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 are as follows: � Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased 2 percent compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our net sales were flat for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014. See Net Sales discussion for impact of foreign exchange. \n� Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased 2 percent compared with flat for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. � Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was 9.5 percent compared with 14.2 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by foreign exchange, U.S. West Coast port congestion, and certain charges related to strategic actions as noted above. � Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was $219 million compared with $332 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014, and diluted earnings per share was $0.52 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $0.75 for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. � During the first half of fiscal 2015, we distributed $814 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \nFor fiscal 2015, turning around Gap brand remains a top priority as we focus on improving the brand's business performance. Further, we expect to continue our investment in digital capabilities and to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. We also plan to continue our global growth, including opening additional stores in Asia with a focus on Gap China, Old Navy China, and Old Navy Japan. In addition, we also expect to open additional Athleta stores in the United States. In fiscal 2015, we expect that foreign exchange rate fluctuations will continue to have a meaningful negative impact on our results, particularly in our largest foreign subsidiaries in Canada and Japan. With the depreciation of the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and other foreign currencies, we expect net sales translated into U.S. dollars will negatively impact our total Company net sales growth. In addition, we expect gross margins for our foreign subsidiaries to be negatively impacted as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars. We expect this negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be partially offset by the favorable impact of translation of expenses in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. In June 2015, we announced a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance in the future, including our decision to right-size the Gap brand store fleet and streamline the brand's headquarter workforce. The Company expects to close approximately 175 specialty stores in North America and a limited number of European stores over the next few years, with about 140 closures occurring in fiscal 2015. The brand's headquarter workforce is expected to be reduced by approximately 250 roles during fiscal 2015. In connection with the store closures and workforce reduction, the Company incurred certain charges during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, primarily consisting of lease termination fees, lease losses, and employee related expenses, as well as impairment of store assets related to closing stores. We are also developing a clear, on-brand product aesthetic framework that will help strengthen the Gap brand to compete more successfully on the global stage. As part of the effort to turn around the brand business performance, the Company also incurred additional charges during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, primarily consisting of impairment of store assets related to underperforming stores and impairment of inventory that did not meet brand standards. \nThe charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Company's strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand are as follows: Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy ($ in millions) Expenses Operating Expenses Total Charges Store closures and workforce reduction: Lease termination fees and lease losses $ - $ 23 $ 23 Employee related expenses 1 9 10 Store asset impairment 1 3 4 Other (1 ) 3 2 Total 1 38 39 Other charges: Store asset impairment related to underperforming stores - 33 33 Inventory impairment 11 - 11 Total 11 33 44 Total charges related to strategic actions $ 12 $ 71 $ 83 \nIncluding the charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company expects to incur approximately $130 million to $140 million of charges in fiscal 2015 associated with the strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales See Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-Q, for net sales by brand and region. Comparable Sales The percentage change in comparable (\"Comp\") sales by global brand and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Gap Global (6 )% (5 )% (8 )% (5 )% Old Navy Global 3 % 4 % 3 % 3 % Banana Republic Global (4 )% - % (6 )% - % The Gap, Inc. (2 )% - % (3 )% (1 )% \nComparable online sales favorably impacted total Company Comp sales by 2 percent in each of the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014. Comparable online sales favorably impacted total Company Comp sales by 1 percent and 2 percent in the first half of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Only Company-operated stores are included in the calculations of Comp sales. The calculation of total Company Comp sales includes the results of Athleta and Intermix but excludes the results of our franchise business. A store is included in the Comp sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. A store is considered non-comparable (\"Non-comp\") when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. \nA store is considered \"Closed\" if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year. Online Comp sales are defined as sales through online channels in those countries where we have existing Comp store sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. \nStore Count and Square Footage Information Net sales per average square foot is as follows: 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Net sales per average square foot (1) $ 86 $ 90 164 $ 174 (1) Excludes net sales associated with our online and franchise businesses. \nStore count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows: January 31, 2015 26 Weeks Ended August 1, 2015 August 1, 2015 Number of Number of Number of Number of Square Footage Store Locations Stores Opened Stores Closed Store Locations (in millions) Gap North America 960 16 33 943 9.9 Gap Asia 266 21 1 286 2.8 Gap Europe 189 4 4 189 1.6 Old Navy North America 1,013 11 11 1,013 17.1 Old Navy Asia 43 8 - 51 0.8 Banana Republic North America 610 10 6 614 5.1 Banana Republic Asia 44 4 - 48 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 11 - - 11 0.1 Athleta North America 101 10 - 111 0.5 Intermix North America 42 1 - 43 0.1 Piperlime North America 1 - 1 - - Company-operated stores total 3,280 85 56 3,309 38.2 Franchise 429 21 8 442 N/A Total 3,709 106 64 3,751 38.2 Increase over prior year 4.4 % 2.1 % February 1, 2014 26 Weeks Ended August 2, 2014 August 2, 2014 Number of Number of Number of Number of Square Footage Store Locations Stores Opened Stores Closed Store Locations (in millions) Gap North America 968 16 18 966 10.1 Gap Asia 228 9 2 235 2.4 Gap Europe 193 - 3 190 1.6 Old Navy North America 1,004 13 11 1,006 17.2 Old Navy Asia 18 10 - 28 0.4 Banana Republic North America 596 10 8 598 5.0 Banana Republic Asia 43 4 - 47 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 11 - - 11 0.1 Athleta North America 65 14 - 79 0.3 Intermix North America 37 2 - 39 0.1 Piperlime North America 1 - - 1 - Company-operated stores total 3,164 78 42 3,200 37.4 Franchise 375 25 6 394 N/A Total 3,539 103 48 3,594 37.4 Increase over prior year 4.4 % 1.6 % \nGap and Banana Republic outlet and factory stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. \nNet Sales Our net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased $83 million, or 2 percent, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $100 million and a decrease in net sales primarily at Gap and Banana Republic; partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 were translated at exchange rates applicable during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were flat on a constant currency basis compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We believe this metric enhances the visibility of underlying business trends by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \nOur net sales for the first half of fiscal 2015 decreased $200 million, or 3 percent, compared with the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $188 million and a decrease in net sales primarily at Gap and Banana Republic; partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for the first half of fiscal 2014 were translated at exchange rates applicable during the first half of fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our net sales for the first half of fiscal 2015 were flat on a constant currency basis compared with the first half of fiscal 2014. We believe this metric enhances the visibility of underlying business trends by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \nCost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses $ 2,440 $ 2,412 $ 4,715 $ 4,720 Gross profit $ 1,458 $ 1,569 $ 2,840 $ 3,035 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 62.6 % 60.6 % 62.4 % 60.9 % Gross margin 37.4 % 39.4 % 37.6 % 39.1 % \nCost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 2.0 percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014. � Cost of goods sold increased 1.6 percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily driven by increased markdown activities and incremental shipping cost partially due to the U.S. West Coast port congestion. Cost of goods sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars. \n� Occupancy expenses increased 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses. \nCost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 1.5 percentage points in the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the first half of fiscal 2014. � Cost of goods sold increased 0.8 percentage points in the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily driven by increased markdown activities and incremental shipping cost partially due to the U.S. West Coast port congestion. Cost of goods sold in the first half of fiscal 2015 was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars. \n� Occupancy expenses increased 0.7 percentage points in the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the first half of fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses. Operating Expenses 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Operating expenses $ 1,089 $ 1,002 $ 2,085 $ 2,025 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 27.9 % 25.2 % 27.6 % 26.1 % Operating margin 9.5 % 14.2 % 10.0 % 13.0 % \nOperating expenses increased $87 million, or 2.7 percentage points, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Operating expenses increased $60 million, or 1.5 percentage points, in the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the first half of fiscal 2014. The increase in operating expenses for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the respective periods of fiscal 2014 was primarily due to charges associated with the store closures, workforce reduction, and store asset impairment, primarily related to Gap brand incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as the gain on sale of a building recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2014; partially offset by the favorable translation impact as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \nInterest Expense 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Interest expense $ 17 $ 19 $ 22 $ 36 \nInterest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014 primarily consists of interest on overall borrowings and other obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion 5.95 percent Notes. Interest expense for the first half of fiscal 2015 includes $37 million of interest on overall borrowings and other obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion 5.95 percent Notes, partially offset by a reversal of approximately $15 million of tax-related interest expense primarily resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling and actions of foreign tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters. Interest expense for the first half of fiscal 2014 primarily consists of interest on overall borrowings and other obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion 5.95 percent Notes. \nIncome Taxes 13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended August 1, August 2, August 1, August 2, ($ in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Income taxes $ 134 $ 217 $ 277 $ 383 Effective tax rate 38.0 % 39.5 % 37.7 % 39.3 % \nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the indefinite reinvestment of certain foreign fiscal 2015 earnings, which will be used to fund international growth. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, share repurchases, and payment of taxes. As of August 1, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $1.0 billion. As of August 1, 2015, over half of our cash and cash equivalents were held in the U.S. and are generally accessible without any limitations. We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives and planned capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility or other available market instruments. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the first half of fiscal 2015 decreased $354 million compared with the first half of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the following: � a decrease of $170 million related to other current assets and other long-term assets primarily due to the change in timing of payments received related to our credit card program, which resulted in increased cash inflow in the first half of fiscal 2014; \n� a decrease of $134 million in net income; \n� a decrease of $122 million related to lease incentives and other long-term liabilities primarily due to the receipt of an upfront payment in the first half of fiscal 2014 related to the amendment of our credit card program agreement with the third-party financing company, which is being amortized over the term of the contract; � a decrease of $106 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to the volume and timing of receipts; partially offset by � an increase of $74 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to a lower bonus payout in the first half of fiscal 2015 compared with the bonus payout in the first half of fiscal 2014; and � an increase of $50 million related to accounts payable primarily due to the timing of merchandise payments. \nWe fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during the first half of fiscal 2015 increased $94 million compared with the first half of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the following: � $121 million of proceeds from the sale of a building owned but no longer occupied by the Company in the first half of fiscal 2014; partially offset by \n� $27 million less property and equipment purchases. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during the first half of fiscal 2015 increased $25 million compared with the first half of fiscal 2014, primarily due to the following: � $14 million more repurchases of common stock; and � $11 million more net cash outflows related to issuances under share-based compensation plans and withholding tax payments related to vesting of stock units. \nFree Cash Flow . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:41:23.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
