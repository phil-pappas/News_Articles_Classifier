New regulations following the financial crisis have forced banks to have stricter capital requirements which in turn have reduced their ability to lend in certain areas.\nCommonBond, which funds and refinances graduate school loans at lower interest rates, is just the latest online lender to announce funding, following the initial public offerings last December of LendingClub Corp and On Deck Capital Inc .\nLast year, lending startups raised more than $1.4 billion in equity financings across 48 deals, the highest annual total ever for the industry, according to research from CB Insights.\nCommonBond has 35 employees and plans to expand to 60 by the end of the year. It expects to originate more than $500 million in loans by the end of the year.\nCommonBond secured $150 million in loan purchase commitments in February from student loan servicing company Nelnet to finance more loans.\nIn July, the company hired former Macquarie Capital banker Morgan Edwards as its chief financial officer.\nDue to regulatory scrutiny, many large banks have pulled back from the student loan market, which topped nearly $1.3 trillion at the end of the second quarter. CommonBond competes with Social Finance Inc or SoFi for student loan refinancing business. CommonBond says it saves borrowers more than $14,000 on average over the life of the loan.
