Netwerk24, however, reported that ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said he had not yet seen the statement by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \nIt was understood that without admitting or denying the allegations, Hitachi agreed to pay $19m (R266m) to settle the case. \nAFP said the charges related to the company's late-2000s sale of a 25% stake in a South African subsidiary to a front company of the ANC, as Hitachi was competing for a deal to build two large power plants. \nMichael, however, said Hitachi had performed shoddy work and had been the cause of years of delays in the construction and completion of the station. \n\"There should have been millions of rands in penalties because of the inferior construction that was done by Hitachi and the years of delay that this caused in the construction of the station,\" she said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:21:35.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
