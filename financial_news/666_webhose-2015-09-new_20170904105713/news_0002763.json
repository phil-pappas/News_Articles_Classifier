By Keisha Bandz 9 hours ago  \n( Continued from Prior Part ) Diesel prices \nPrompt New York Harbor ULSD (ultra-low-sulfur diesel) futures traded on the NYMEX closed ~2.4% higher on a weekly basis at ~$1.62 per gallon in the week ended September 4. On August 28, prices were ~$1.58 per gallon. \nAs we saw with gasoline in the previous part, diesel prices followed crude oil prices and rose sharply on Monday, August 31, by 6% and gave back those gains on Tuesday. On Wednesday, September 2, prices rose due to the less-than-expected increase in distillate inventories, which includes diesel, as we had reported in our latest analysis of the Weekly Petroleum Report. You can read more about the latest distillate inventory trends at US Distillate Inventories Rose Less than Expected Last Week . \nThe rise in diesel prices is also likely the result of the approaching fall season when temperatures drop and home heating demand rises. Home heating oil and diesel fuel share the same components. Therefore, diesel prices are affected by heating oil demand in the fall and winter seasons. Why diesel prices matter \nAn increase in diesel prices might encourage refiners such as Tesoro (TSO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Valero Energy (VLO) to increase their diesel production, all else remaining equal. As with gasoline, which we discussed in the previous part of this series, investors also need to watch crude oil prices (USO) in gauging what could happen with diesel production and prices. \nPlus, diesel benefits from strong demand in European countries, which rely heavily on diesel-fueled vehicles. Keep in mind that refiners will also look at the feasibility of exporting diesel to satisfy overseas markets. Combined, PSX, VLO, and MPC form ~8.6% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE). \nIf refiners choose to increase production, MLPs such as Tesoro Logistics (TLLP), Valero Energy Partners (VLP), and MPLX (MPLX) would transport a higher volume, which could boost their revenues. Diesel price forecasts \nAccording to the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook released on August 11, diesel fuel retail prices should average $2.73 per gallon in 2015 and then rise to $2.81 per gallon in 2016. Prices averaged $3.83 per gallon in 2014. Retail prices differ from the futures prices we mentioned above. They include the added costs of taxes, distribution, and marketing. \nThe increase in 2016 price forecasts is fueled by expectations of increased consumption in 2016 over 2015. The EIA forecasts distillate fuel (which includes heating oil and diesel) consumption to increase by 100,000 barrels per day—or by 2.4%—in 2016 compared to 2015’s consumption. The EIA expects increased consumption to be driven by rising manufacturing activity, marine fuel use, and foreign trade. \nThe next STEO is expected to come out on September 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T10:30:45.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
