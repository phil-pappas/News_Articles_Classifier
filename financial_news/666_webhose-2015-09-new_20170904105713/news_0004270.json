He doubts that the city government will ever give permits to food trucks. \n\"It's more interested in votes to stay in power than allowing a nicer offering\" for foodies, he said. \nWhen food trucks park on a street, \"transit police or a borough authority arrives\" to kick them out, said Fernando Reyes, president of Foodtrucks DF, an association that represents dozens of the city's nearly 300 food trucks. \nWhile they now exist in the northwestern border city of Tijuana and the Caribbean resort of Cancun, food trucks cannot operate freely like in other countries, Reyes lamented. \nMostly young entrepreneurs, the \"food truckeros\" (food truckers) spend between $24,000 to $120,000 to start their businesses. \nWhile such vehicles struggle to find a place in the city, the traditional food stands are everywhere, with their owners admitting that they pay bribes to stay open. \n- Dead bill - \nSeveral bills have been proposed in the capital's legislature to allow food trucks to operate as long as their food quality and gas and water tanks are regulated. \nPriscila Vera, a former city lawmaker for the conservative National Action Party, said the proposed legislation was killed due to \"complicity\" between the authorities and leaders of the street food stands. \nCritics say the traditional food stands lack sanitary standards, with no running water, boiling oil or water in large cauldrons from the early morning. \nIn contrast, Reyes said, the food truckers want to work legally and pay taxes, promising high sanitary standards with stainless steel stoves, water tanks and refrigeration. \nHis association is pushing for legislators to revive the bill to finally give food trucks a place in the capital, home to 20 million hungry people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T11:28:41.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
