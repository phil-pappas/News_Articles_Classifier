A Glencore spokesman declined to confirm Thursday's meeting. \nThe London-listed company said on Monday it planned to suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper output at Katanga and at Mopani Copper Mines in Zambia over the next 18 months. \n\"This is not a mine that is going to close. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's just a moment when the copper price is very, very low,\" said the adviser, referring to Katanga Mining (Toronto: KAT.TO - news ) . \"When they sell copper they lose money.\" \nHe said Glencore's Mutanda Mining operation in Congo was a more efficient operation and did not face the same problems. \nA Glencore source said the company would invest about $900 million in Katanga Mining to modernize it. This would bring the production cost per pound down from $2.50 to about $1.65 by time mine reopens in 2017. \nBy comparison, Mutanda Mining's cost of production is around $1.33 per pound of copper because it is a newer mine, the source said. \nThe source declined to comment on potential job losses, saying discussions about employment continued. \n(Reporting by Aaron Ross; Writing by Daniel Flynn; editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:06:21.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
