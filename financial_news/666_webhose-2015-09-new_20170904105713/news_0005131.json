Annualised non-performing loan formation for mainland banks nearly doubled year on year in the first half of 2015. Photo: EPA \nPressure on the profitability of mainland lenders will persist through the second half of the year, Fitch Ratings said in a report following the gloomiest half-year earnings from the banks in more than a decade. \nA squeeze on net interest margin, a gauge of the profitability of lending, was not expected to ease in the near term, especially for mid-tier lenders, after five consecutive cuts in interest rates since November, it said. \nFitch noted that net profit growth slowed significantly in the first half of the year, rising by a weighted average of 2.4 per cent year on year compared with growth of 7.6 per cent for all of last year. \nMainland China’s biggest banks have entered into a critical period for growth. Based on data compiled by analysts, three of its four biggest banks posted negative profit growth in the second quarter of the year. \nThe deterioration of asset quality on the mainland also contributed to slowing net profits in the first half of the year. \nFitch noted that annualised non-performing loan (NPL) formation for banks it covered had nearly doubled year on year to 1.21 per cent between January and June. The mainland’s banking regulator said the average NPL ratio for commercial banks was 1.5 per cent at the end of June. \nHigher provisioning in the second half of the year was likely to continue to eat into profits, Fitch said. \n“Weakening asset quality could result in some profit decline in the near term, as banks cannot rely on lowering their provision coverage to generate positive profit growth,” the report said. “That said, government intervention through more aggressive disposals to asset management companies, debt migration and/or policy banks stepping into finance unfavourable projects, could mitigate the effects.” \nThe biggest risk to the sector was a squeeze on liquidity, Grace Wu, head of China banks for Fitch and the lead author of the report, said at a conference on Wednesday. \n“In most circumstances, banking crises happen not because of NPL problems,” Wu said. “It’s because of liquidity, because of lack of investor confidence with the system. I would say that would be the No1 risk.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T13:07:01.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
