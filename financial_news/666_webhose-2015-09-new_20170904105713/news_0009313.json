Carlos Soler Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett The architecture of the modern complex housing Valencia's museum of science and art is extraordinary as it is grand. One giant planetarium and IMAX building in a site stretching nearly two kilometres is in the shape of a huge eye. Another oddly shaped large purple edifice acts as public meeting space and events centre. The largest aquarium in Europe spreads out over the bed of Valencia's diverted river in the shape of a lotus.\nBut these buildings in Spain's third-largest city also symbolise the decades of excess in spending and in construction that turbocharged the economy before it all imploded so spectacularly during the global financial crisis.\nThe Spanish economy is recovering remarkably well from the trauma of the past seven years. Its growth rates are much higher than Germany's as well as the rest of Europe's, coming in at 3 per cent over the past year and 1 per cent in the last quarter. Its unemployment rate is still 22 per cent but it has come down from 26 per cent and there is optimism it will fall further faster. Consumer confidence is up along with capital investment for more productive purposes and the government has reduced regulations to make it easier to start businesses. Corporate income tax has been lowered to 28 per cent from 30 per cent and will fall to 26 per cent next year.\nSo far from Spain being a shining example of economic failure, the conservative Popular Party government of Mariano Rajoy​ has instituted a massive program of structural reforms as well as spending and tax cuts the Abbott government could only fantasise about. It included significant changes to laws affecting the labour market in order to make it more flexible and to lower costs. The result has been a clear reduction in Spanish living standards. The economy is still smaller than it was seven years ago. But the Prime Minister likes to note no one these days talk about bail-outs and recessions with reference to Spain.\nDemonstrators confront police in a protest against spending cuts and the government of Mariano Rajoy in 2012. Getty Images Reforms at risk Yet Valencia is also an example of why the Popular Party is so very unpopular as it prepares for elections later this year. And why it is possible Spain's tough reforms and hard won economic progress so praised by the IMF are now at risk of being reversed.\nThe original planning for the City of Arts and Sciences designed by Santiago Calatrava actually started in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the reign of the Socialists. But the PP has been the dominant political power in Valencia for two decades and is now constantly associated with examples of corruption, cronyism and wasteful spending while services continue to decline. Dozens of PP local officials are facing criminal charges.\nIt's a story repeated throughout Spain even if few cities have quite the same white-elephant architecture to show for it. But it means disenchanted voters are more in a mood to punish the PP than reward it for setting the economy back on track. The government initially didn't deal strongly enough with corruption in official circles and its attempt to take action now has had the perverse effect of increasing community anger by revealing how widespread it has been. Nor is there much voter faith in the traditional Spanish alternative of the Socialist Workers' Party. It's all part of the increasing fragmentation of European politics that is making it much harder to gain majority support or to form majority governments.\n So rather than Spain's voters choosing between two main parties of the centre left and centre right, the electorate's support is now split at least four ways. One very left-wing party, Podemos, (We Can) is like the Greek Syriza party and talks dismissively of \"la casta\" or the caste, to describe the systemic failures of politics as usual.\nThe popularity of Podemos was one reasons the Rajoy government was determined that the European Union take a tough line in negotiations with Greece. Rajoy certainly didn't want Spanish voters to get any ideas that there could have been an easier route to economic recovery. As it is, the total confusion in Greece and the missteps by Syriza's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will underscore that message. But Podemos is still popular among millions of very disenchanted voters in Spain believing the less privileged are, as usual, bearing the real cost of economic adjustment. The impact has already been successful in ensuring the left now holds the mayorships of important city councils like those of Madrid and Barcelona with policies like stopping banks from evicting tenants for non-payment of housing loans.\nIn Valencia, the PP lost half its seats in the May regional elections in its worst result since 1991, ending its political dominance. For the national campaign, another centrist party Ciudadanos​ (citizens), is gaining increased backing by condemning the many examples of corrupt behaviour in the PP. The party began as a counter to the fervour for independence in the Catalan region, centred around the second largest city of Barcelona. But support for Ciudadanos is now much broader based, even if the separatist movement in Catalan remains very strong and will continue to distract and destabilise national politics. A regional Catalan election linked to the idea of independence will take place on September 27.\nIt means Mariano Rajoy is likely to, at best, hope to form a coalition with Ciudadanos and at worst face defeat from a combination of Podemos, the Socialists and a variety of other left-wing parties. And with Spanish public and private debt still at extremely high levels, that is going to make the markets outside Spain apprehensive. They won't want to return either to an era of talking about any possibility of a Spanish recession or bailout.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:05:19.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
