The deal boosted General Mills's organic food business, which includes Cascadian Farm and healthy snacks makers Food Should Taste Good.\nNet earnings attributable to the company rose to $426.6 million, or 69 cents per share, from $345.2 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, well above average analyst estimate of 69 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet sales fell 1.4 percent to $4.21 billion, hurt by a strong U.S. dollar.\nAnalysts were expecting the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company to post revenue of $4.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n(Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\nConsumer Discretionary General Mills", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:56:25.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
