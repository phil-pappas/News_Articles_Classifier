The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose 2.9% in the three months to July, compared to the consensus forecast for a 2.5% increase and the previous quarter's 2.6% gain. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) marked the fastest rate of growth in more than six years. \nThe report also showed employers added 42,000 jobs in the May-July period, smashing estimates for a 18,000 rise and marking an improvement on the prior 63,000 dip. The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 5.5% from 5.6%. \n\"The long-awaited upturn in pay, which has been the missing element of the UK's economic recovery, looks to be finally upon us, reviving the prospect of a rate hike by the end of the year,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) . \nBoE governor Mark Carney reiterated his belief that the timing of a rate hike in the UK would become clearer around the turn of the year. \n\"The prospect of sustained momentum in the UK economy and the gradual firming of underlying inflationary pressure will likely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn of this year,\" he said in a testimony to the Treasury Select Committee on the August Inflation Report, Carney said the impact of China's slowdown on UK growth was likely to be \"modest\". Ian McCafferty, who was the only Monetary Policy Committee member to vote in favour of a rate hike last week, said the effect on markets was limited. However Martin Weale, known to be one of the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) 's more hawkish members, said China is a risk. \nUS core inflation dips The US consumer price index held at 0.2% year-on-year growth in August, in line with expectations. Excluding volatile components including fuel and food, the CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) rose 1.8%, in line with the previous month but worse than the 1.9% that was predicted. \nMonth-on-month the CPI fell 0.1% in August, as estimated, compared to a 0.1% gain in July. Taking away energy and food, it increased 0.1%, as predicted and the same as July. \n\"Fed chair Janet Yellen won't be overly concerned, viewing this as a temporary measure, but if consistent inflation doesn't return then uncertainty will continue to surround her interest rate decision.\" Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. The report comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on Thursday with the market pencilling in a 25% chance of hike. China slowdown concerns have caused many analysts to push back expectations for a rate increase. \nMeanwhile, forecasts for global growth this year have been trimmed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) due to the further worsening of the outlook for many emerging market economies. The OECD cut its global growth forecast for 2015 to 3.0% from the 3.1% it predicted in June, though both the US and Euro-zone were revised upwards. \nAdding to global pressures, Standard (Other OTC: SNDH - news ) and Poor's downgraded Japan's sovereign debt to A+/A-1 from AA-/A-1+, albeit with a 'stable' outlook. The ratings agency said policies put in place by Japanese authorities to stoke economic growth are unlikely to reverse the deteriorating trend of the past three to four years sufficiently to keep its ratings intact. \nSABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) tops FTSE SABMiller frothed higher after it responded to recent press speculation by confirming that Anheuser-Busch InBev has informed the company that it intends to make an offer. \nReckitt Benckiser (Xetra: A0M1W6 - news ) got a boost after Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'underperform' and lifted its price target to 6,600p from 5,800p. - Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) shares were up after news on Tuesday the company had bought London-based specialist investment manager Advance Emerging Capital for an undisclosed sum. \nMondi (LSE: MNDI.L - news ) slid after the paper and packaging group was downgraded to 'sell' by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) after a strong run in the shares and \"stretched\" growth expectations. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) gained after the miner said it had raised Â£1.6bn by placing new shares with institutions and senior management at a small discount in order to pay off some of its debts. \nAviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) fell after it emerged this week that 700 Royal Automobile Club workers have been paid the wrong pension for years because of a calculation error caused by the insurer. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,080.39 +0.28% FTSE 100 6,229.21 +1.49% FTSE 250 17,061.97 +0.59% FTSE 100 - Risers SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) (SAB) 3,614.00p +19.89% Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 134.70p +5.19% Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN) 334.50p +4.43% Randgold Resources Ltd.
