It's where it was born,\" said Mr. Rochon. \"Bringing this special event home, surrounded by the community and the Longaberger family, is the right thing to do.\"\nThe Longaberger annual event, called The Bee, is a three-day reunion, training session and celebration for Home Consultants and guests from all over the United States, held at Longaberger Homestead and in the village of Dresden between July 23 and 25. \nThe first Bee was held in Dresden as The Longaberger Company was beginning to build its business. Then, the event was moved to Columbus, Ohio, where it has been held the past 30 years. The homecoming to Dresden will be filled with symbolism that reinforces Longaberger's heritage, such as renewing partnerships with the local high school and community organizations, as well as a facelift for The World's Largest Basket, located in the center of Dresden and seen by many as a symbol of the company's ties to its home community.\nAbout The Longaberger Company\nFounded in 1973, The Longaberger Company ( www.longaberger.com ) is America's premier maker of handcrafted baskets and offers a variety of other home and lifestyle products, including pottery and other tableware and accessories.
