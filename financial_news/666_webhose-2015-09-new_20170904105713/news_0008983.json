Taken at Yoshii restaurant, Sydney. Louie Douvis by Andrew Clark Yoshii restaurant, perched behind the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney's Rocks region, is an unlikely hang-out for The Third Man. Unlike the 1949 Carol Reed film noir bearing the same name, the discreet, stylish Japanese eatery is not redolent of the Viennese sewers or dark alleyways that gave that classic movie such a menacing tone.\nAnd yet here he is, The Third Man aka John Hewson, checking messages on his iPhone, seated inside Yoshii. Former Liberal Party leader, economist, academic, investor, NGO provider, television commentator, one-time newspaper columnist, Hewson is also The Third Man in the highly charged debate about who are the heroes and villains in the history of economic reform in Australia.\nAs we hit challenging, post commodities-boom times, it's a debate we have to have. It's about the past, sure, but also it may help us to decide how we should reboot Team Australia.\nThe usual suspects in the \"history\" part of the debate are former Liberal prime minister John Howard and the combined figures of former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke, and his treasurer, and successor at The Lodge, Paul Keating. The latter two quarrel, too, even though they were on the same side, but for convenience's sake let's just fuse them and call the result \"Hawting\".\nAndrew Clark has lunch with John Hewson and sees him as a kind of mystery Third Man (here, Orson Welles plays Harry Lime in Carol Reed's film of Graham Greene's book) in the debate about the heroes and villains of Australian economic history. Supplied Now the turbo-charged Hewson - leader of the Opposition for three years, who lost the \"unloseable\" election in March, 1993 - reframes the debate about economic reform in Australia in a surprising and interesting, sure to bruise other egos, way.\nAccording to Hewson, the real hero of Australia's golden era of economic reform turns out to be, well, him. More of that later.\nThese days Hewson is fit and focused. Neatly suited and coiffed, he sits at the table amid Yoshii's pleasant, unobtrusive decor, in a calm, seemingly relaxed, manner. But the powerful \"lock on\" effect of his gaze suggests a rare intensity. He speaks rapidly, and without pause, but his language is pointed, uncluttered and concise.\nAs he talks Hewson's life takes shape as a giant compression chamber, encompassing a giddy number of investments, involvements, activities, and even families – he is in his third marriage.\n John Hewson on Australia in the mid-70s: \"I come back to Australia [and] it's the most inward looking, insular, ineffective, over-regulated, concentrated, economy I could ever imagine.\" Louie Douvis Meanwhile, we settle in like two old-age yuppies, skol fizzy mineral water, glance at the menu, and discuss business.\nIt is 20 years since Hewson left Parliament. Now in his 69th year, he cheerily admits to \"a mixed bag of interests\". Among many, there's garbage recycling, producing refined graphite for lithium batteries, a fuel produced from refined coal power and water, plus a global index that measures investment funds according to their level of involvement in fossil fuel-related companies.\nAfter a comprehensive tour of the Hewson-connected corporate horizon, he turns to the young Japanese waitress, and says, as if it's part of the same sentence, or at least thought process: \"Could I have some sushi and sashimi?\" I meekly follow suit, and also order a miso soup.\nReturning, without the loss of a beat, to a business-cum-climate change theme, Hewson says: \"I've believed for a long time that the business opportunities you can spin out of climate change are very real. [But] short-term politics has just played around with the issues for 15-20 years. Both sides are saying 'we are committed to the global objective of holding global warming to 2 degrees Celsius a century'. [But] neither of them have the strategy or the targets to deliver that.\"\nThe former Ferrari owner gets more revved up talking about Tesla, the phenomenal United States success story of new transport technology, with its range of electric cars. According to Hewson, Tesla has the technology to allow a household with a solar panel on the roof to store the electricity, \"have it on demand throughout the 24-hour period, and also charge their car\". Moreover, \"the prices are going to fall like flat screen TVs\".\nParadoxically, according to Hewson, there's room in this brave new world for King Coal as a refined, powderised product that, when added to water, produces a diesel-like fuel. But he says the Australian coal industry, with its dig-it-and-ship-it business model, is \"blinkered\".\nRuffling the 'Hawting' It is hard to remain blinkered about the meal. Yoshii prides itself on serving fresh food. The sushi and sashimi arrive, looking true to form, and exquisitely laid out on elongated plates. The taste does not belie the brilliant appearance. Hewson eats methodically, managing to masticate in a measured manner. Like not mentioning the war in front of Germans, the issue of alcohol never arises.\nYoshii is filling with other diners, but the atmosphere somehow remains seductively quiet, in contrast to other, ego-fuelled, eateries in the Sydney CBD. The orderly harmony is complemented by the charming efficiency of those waiting on the tables.\nProgressing through both plates, we traverse the world economy. The veteran forecaster admits he has \"never seen it harder than it is today to say what's going to happen\". Most of the world is afflicted \"with short-term policies and they are not addressing the longer-term stuff\".\nAccording to the doctor in economics, former Reserve Bank official, shadow treasurer, and one-time adviser to Liberal treasurers Phillip Lynch and John Howard, quantitative easing hasn't helped much, apart from creating bubbles, and increasing inequality and debt levels. It sounds a bit like that cliche du jour – kicking the can further down the road.\nBut reversing that can-kicking process threatens to result in a stock market crash, bond market crash, and currency realignments, Hewson says. Meanwhile, the Eurozone is being rocked by a euro \"that will only ever work\" if its 19 members pool their economic sovereignty and fiscal policies. \"But that's never going to happen. So they are going to limp from period of difficulty to period of difficulty, or crisis to crisis.\"\nThis leads to Hewson's take on the history of economic reform in Australia in the '80s and '90s. It began with the Fraser government's appointment of the Campbell committee – headed by the late, distinguished Keith Campbell, who headed LJ Hooker - leading to the great reform era of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments.\nHewson's account of how the process really unfolded is fascinating, and sure to ruffle the feathers of The First Man, \"Hawting\", and The Second Man, John Howard.\nReturning to Australia from the US in the mid-70s after securing a doctorate in economics from John Hopkins University and working for the IMF in Washington, he started forecasting at the Reserve Bank in Sydney. Hewson attracted the attention of then federal treasurer, and deputy Liberal Party leader, Phillip Lynch.\nHe wrote a paper on linking the then fixed Australian currency to movements in the trade-weighted index – a sort of limited dirty float.\nHewson claims on Campbell Report During the 1977 election campaign, Lynch attracted hostile press coverage over his personal finances. Fraser decided to appoint John Howard as his replacement, even though, according to Hewson, the two \"hated each other. Howard did a pretty reasonable job, so when Malcolm had to appoint him as treasurer after the election, I said I was going to the university [the economics chair at the University of NSW]. Malcolm rang the vice chancellor and said, 'He is going to be a professor and he is going to be here [working with the government].' That was that.\"\n\"I remember when we got the Campbell report [in 1981, which advocated opening up the financial markets]. I was in Fraser's office. There were volumes and supplementary research papers. On top of it all was a piece of paper saying [in effect], 'Malcolm do you realise one of those supplementary papers on housing, page 27 footnote three, or something, it says if you deregulate housing interest rates, they'll go up by 2.5%.\n\"Malcolm said, 'Shit, we can't have that.' He took the whole lot and physically threw it in the bin. I said to him, 'You can't do that. What we've got to do is have a process whereby we digest this into bite-sized chunks.' So we got [Fraser] to set up a task force,\" which included Hewson.\n\"Before the election in '83 [which Labor won emphatically], Howard announced the intention of licensing four to six foreign banks; we started optioning bonds and notes and looking at starting currency futures. It didn't matter who was in government after that. The snowball was too big; the expectations in the community were too big. You had to actually let the process run.\nAt the same time the world was globalising.\"\nOh, and the idea for setting up the Campbell Committee to, in effect, advise on injecting deregulatory blood through the sclerotic veins of the Australian financial system was Hewson's, too.\n\"When I came back from the IMF, I'd been writing on international banking, showing the insanity of trying to regulate some of these financial flows. I come back to Australia [and] it's the most inward looking, insular, ineffective, over-regulated, concentrated, economy I could ever imagine. And I thought to myself, 'Shit, this is ridiculous.'\n\"And I'm in the Reserve Bank writing pieces of paper [about] floating the currency and thinking, 'How's that going to happen?' and that's how we came up with the concept of the Campbell committee and fought it through that [Fraser] government. The thinking was you deregulate the financial sector, just start the snowball rolling, then it'll roll through industrial relations; it'll roll through protection; it'll roll through micro-reform. That's exactly what happened.\"\nSo there.\nThat was quite some mouthful, but Hewson takes it in his stride as we finish our meal. Referring to the current difficulties facing Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who once worked for Hewson as his press secretary, he says Abbott's best asset is Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, and forecasts an early election – probably around March.\nBy this stage Hewson is preparing for his next appointment. As Carol Reed could have said on the Vienna film set: \"That's a wrap.\"\nBut that wasn't quite the end of it. The thorough, ever-attentive Hewson later emails me five speeches plus a CV. The Third Man may have been out the door but he wasn't out of mind.\nMenu Yoshii, 115 Harrington Street, Sydney\n2 set sushi, sashimi and miso soup lunches, $96\n3 bottles of sparkling mineral water, $33\n2 teas, $10\nTotal: $139", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:08:52.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
