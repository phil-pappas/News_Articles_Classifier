They are starting with us to test the waters and if it doesn't spark an outcry, it could then spread to other media groups.\"\nShares in Koza Ipek companies, including energy firm Ipek Dogal Enerji and miner Koza Madencilik, fell 10 percent. Shares in other media firms not affiliated with Gulen also declined.\nLate last year, police detained dozens of people in raids on media outlets with ties to Gulen.\nThe cleric, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, denies any ambition to overthrow Erdogan.\nThe battle between Erdogan and Gulen became public in December 2013 when a corruption investigation targeting Erdogan's inner circle came to light.\nErdogan blamed the cleric's supporters and purged thousands of police and members of the judiciary he deemed loyal to Gulen.\nIn his early years in power, Erdogan drew on Gulen's influence in the judiciary to help tame an army that had toppled four governments since 1960, including Turkey's first Islamist-led cabinet, through a series of coup plot trials.
