No, I didn't think so.\nBut there are a few good reasons to not mind when the ASX swoons. You don't have to like it - but don't sweat it either. Here's why:\n1. If you're planning to be a 'net buyer' of stocks If you're still putting money into the market every week, month or year, lower prices are your friend.\nAdvertisement That's because your $1000 stretches further than it did previously.\nIf share prices fall 20 per cent, you can buy that many more shares of your favourite company - and if you're right about the quality of the business itself, you'll be richer in due course.\nOr, as Warren Buffett puts it : \"Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day's supply.\"\n2. If you're reinvesting your dividends Many, many investors take advantage of dividend reinvestment plans.\nOthers choose to manually do it. But, either way, just like being a 'net buyer', above, you end up with more shares if you're reinvesting them when prices are low. And, like the example above, you're far better off when prices are low - your reinvested dividends simply go further.\n3. Because you don't have to own 'the market' The ASX 200 is our premier market index. It represents (with a few exceptions) the 200 largest companies on our boards. And it's weighted by market capitalisation.\nIf the ASX 200 was calculated by simple average, each of the 200 companies would have a 0.5 per cent impact on the result.\nBut done by market cap, the largest companies have a much greater pull. That is, the largest company, Commonwealth Bank (ASX: CBA) is responsible for more than 8 per cent of the index's 'value'.\nThe smallest, Drillsearch (ASX: DLS) is 0.015 per cent of the index - meaning CBA has more than 500 times more impact on the reported movement of the ASX.\nI have no argument with the way the index is calculated, but it's important information to know.\nHere's a few examples, illustrating just how top-heavy the index is:\nThe top three companies, CBA, BHP and Westpac, make up over 22 per cent of the index The big four banks account for a quarter of the ASX 200 The top 10 companies - 5 per cent of the index - are responsible for more than 50 per cent of its 'weight' The bottom 50 per cent of the index - 100 companies - are just 7.1 per cent of the index So what should an investor do with that information?\nWell, on one hand, nothing at all. There's no intellectual or financial reason to care about the relative weights of companies when you invest. But almost every investor reads headlines about 'the market', as if it were important for them.\nI own no bank shares. I own no miners. In fact, I own only two of the top 20 companies on our market. And those 20 companies represent almost two-thirds of 'the index'. So, when I hear or read that the market is down, I don't get too worried - because I don't own 'the market' at all.\nYes, I use the long-term return of the ASX 200 (or its big brother, the All Ordinaries) to benchmark my returns. After all, if I can't beat it, I should simply join it and buy an index tracking fund. But I don't make the mistake of thinking there's an unbreakable nexus between the market and my portfolio. There simply isn't.\nFoolish takeaway Here's the other reason to ignore market gyrations: they don't matter to your long term returns.\nAfter every single 'crash', the stock markets of the developed world have gone on to new highs. It's ever been thus. Now, there's no immutable law that says they must, of course, but history is usually a pretty good guide.\nSo yes, you could worry about the market's movements. You could sweat over where it's going next week, next month or next year. I don't. I honestly couldn't care less - because I am a long-term investor. The only reason to take any interest in market slumps is because sometimes - often - it throws up some great buying opportunities.\nRemember; history tells us that the prize goes to those who ignore the short term and keep their eyes on the horizon. Everything else is noise.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
