Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Angus Grigg The number of Chinese buying overseas homes will slow rapidly this year, according to Mandarin-language property portal Juwai.com, but Australia is seeing an uptick in inquiries due to Beijing's recent currency devaluation.\nSimon Henry, the co-chief executive of Juwai, said overall sales growth by Chinese buyers would slow from 25 per cent last year to about 10 per cent this year.\nHe attributed the cooling to Beijing's crack down on illegal capital outflows , the slowing Chinese economy and a hit to confidence from the recent sharemarket slide.\n\"Confidence has been rattled by the stockmarket fall even though very few people own shares,\" Mr Henry said via phone from Beijing.\nHe said home sales in the United States had been the hardest hit, with growth in Chinese buyers expected to slow to about 5 per cent this year.\nThis has been attributed to Beijing's devaluation of the yuan against the US dollar in late August, which has made property and education in Australia and Canada relatively more affordable.\n\"I can see the market shifting away from the US to places like Australia and Canada,\" he said.\nJuwai estimates the number of property searches for Australia has grown 15 per cent this year, slightly stronger than the same period in 2014.\n Mr Henry said this would help insulated mid-priced homes in Australia, but high-end Australian property would be the most affected by Beijing's tighter enforcement of capital controls.\n\"I think this [the capital controls] are definitely going to hit the higher end as it will be harder to justify transferring $10 million out of the country via a legal channel,\" he said.\n\"That said I think it is pretty easy to justify something around $1 million.\"\nChina has previously tolerated significant capital outflows via so called \"grey channels\", but has tightened up enforcement in recent weeks as the economy slows and fears over capital flight put downward pressure on the currency.\nThe crackdown from Beijing has seen Chinese banks setting up watch lists for unusual transactions and preventing those wanting to transfer money overseas using the foreign currency quotas of family and friends.\nUnder China's closed capital account an individual can only transfer $US50,000 ($70,000) into an overseas account each year.\nExceptions are made for the purchases of homes for children attending school or university overseas and for tuition.\nOne Chinese property agent told The Australian Financial Review earlier this week that the tighter enforcement of capital outflows was starting to have a \"significant impact\" on his business.\n\"It has affected 70 to 80 per cent of current transactions and some have already been suspended,\" said the agent, who asked not to be named.\nChina's move to tighten its capital controls comes after the country's banks reported net capital outflows of $US109 billion in the first quarter of 2015, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\nThe People's Bank of China has also been spending record amounts of its foreign reserves to keep the yuan stable after the devaluation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-16T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:03:24.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
