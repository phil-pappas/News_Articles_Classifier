In the Philippines, global remittances form around 10 percent of GDP. \nGrowth in remittances have not yet been significantly hit by the roughly halving in oil prices since June last year. \nLong-planned major projects, such as the new terminal at Abu Dhabi International Airport and a scheme to build a canal through Dubai, are helping sustain appetite for blue-collar workers. But that could start to change. \n\"With oil going down certain projects will be delayed, so construction workers will come in at a reduced rate and we won't see the same rate of growth in remittances,\" said Rajiv Raipancholia, chief executive of United Arab Emirates-based Orient Exchange and secretary of industry body Foreign Exchange and Remittance Group (FERG). \nHe forecasts remittances growth for the UAE industry of 5 percent in 2016, down from 10 to 15 percent in 2015. \nOsama al-Rahma, chief executive of Dubai-based Al Fardan Exchange, and chairman of FERG, said some exchange houses were already starting to see slimmer remittance business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:40:22.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
