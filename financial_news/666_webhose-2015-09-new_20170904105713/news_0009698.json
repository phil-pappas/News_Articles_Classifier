Venezuela sells China more than 600,000 barrels of oil a day. \nThe socialist South American country is struggling with a recession and a cash crunch brought about in part by a steep drop in the price of oil, which makes up 95 percent of Venezuela's export earnings. \nChina has continued to loan Venezuela money as the country's economy struggles and some fear default.
