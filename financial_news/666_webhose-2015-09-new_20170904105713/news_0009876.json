After a brisk rally in the first part of the year, France’s CAC 40 Index tumbled as much as 19 percent during the past few weeks, dropping along with global stock markets hurt by brewing worries over China and the pace of global growth.\nThe CAC, which includes Orange SA, Engie SA and Electricite de France SA-- all companies in which the French state has significant stakes -- is now down 14 percent from its peak in late April.\n“This is really not a good time to unload stakes, and I don’t think that calm is about to return to the market with some big risks lying ahead,\" said Arnaud Scarpaci, a fund manager at Montaigne Capital, in Paris.\nThe value of the French state’s stakes in listed companies has fallen by about 12 billion euros in the past month to about 70 billion euros, according to Bloomberg calculations. The state’s shareholding agency has stakes in 77 companies, of which 13 are listed entities. Electricite de France, in which the state has its biggest stake, worth about 28 billion euros, has lost 22 percent of its market value since the start of the year.\nSlower Growth The volatility in the markets may force France’s shareholding agency to freeze sales for the coming months. France’s 2015 budget includes a provision for 4 billion euros in asset sales by the Agence des Participations de l’Etat, or APE, with the money earmarked to pay down debt.\nWith a stagnant French economy and 50 billion euros in spending cuts already in the pipeline, the divestment plan is key to Hollande’s strategy of\ncontaining borrowing. Even with the sales, public debt was slated to climb to the equivalent of 97 percent of economic output by the end of this year, up from 89 percent in 2012, the year the Socialist government came to power, according to International Monetary Fund estimates.\nFrench Stake Sales\nStake Sales Since January, the agency has sold stakes in three of its 13 listed companies with proceeds expected to reach about 1.8 billion euros, less than half the targeted amount.\nWhile the remaining about 2.2 billion euros left to raise wouldn’t be impossible to achieve, market conditions are making it unlikely, a person familiar with the stake sale process said, declining to be named because the information isn’t public. APE does not have a legal obligation to sell stakes to match the budget-law target if it believes market conditions are not favorable.\nThe market slide has come in the wake of slowing global economic growth. On Sept. 1, the IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said the world economy will grow slower than expected this year.\n“We expect global growth to remain moderate and likely weaker than we anticipated last July,” Lagarde said in a speech in Jakarta. “This reflects two forces: a weaker than expected recovery in advanced economies, and a further slowdown in emerging economies, especially in Latin America.”\nThe stock market drop accompanying the weaker outlook is giving France’s state shareholding agency pause after sales earlier in the year.\nLowered Expectations In March, it sold 3.96 percent of aircraft engine-builder Safran SA for about 1 billion euros. In April, it sold a stake in the Toulouse airport for about 300 million euros. APE is slated to sell a 0.9 percent stake by Sept. 16 in natural-gas utility Engie, formerly known as GDF Suez SA, that may yield 500 million euros, the person told Bloomberg News.\nThe state’s sale of its stakes in regional airports in Nice and Lyon will be announced in September but the sale won’t be completed before 2016, the person said.\nFrance’s 2015 budget is taking another hit after the government said last month that the cost of canceling the sale of two Mistral warships to Russia will cost close to 1 billion euros.\nIn October, the French government had more faith in stock market developments and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron boosted the sales target to “5 to 10 billion euros in the next 18 months.”\nMacron has since lowered his expectations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:32:31.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
