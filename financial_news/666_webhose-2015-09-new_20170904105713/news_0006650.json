The materials help shave up to 350 pounds off the vehicles' weight, making them more nimble and fuel efficient and increasing towing capacity.\nFord will offer three engines: a 6.7-liter V8 diesel, a 6.2-liter V8 gas engine and a 6.8-liter V10. Fuel economy hasn't been released.\nFord is also adding features, including blind spot detection, lane departure warning and LED lighting in the cargo box.\nSuper Duty work trucks make up about one-third of Ford's F-Series sales.\nThe 2016 Super Duty goes on sale early next year.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
