Photo: Philip Gostelow\nWoodside Petroleum has launched a $11.65 billion offer for Papua New Guinea-focused energy producer Oil Search in the biggest Australian takeover deal since 2011.\nThe approach, revealed by The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column on Monday night , would see Woodside buy Oil Search with the Perth-based producer offering one Woodside share for every four Oil Search shares via a scheme of arrangement.\nOil Search shares surged by 16.5 per cent or $1.11 to $7.84 in early afternoon trading on the ASX while Woodside fell 3.1 per cent or 94c to $29.63.\nWoodside's move - which if it proceeds would be the third largest energy deal on record in the Asia Pacific region - also sparked an investor frenzy in the broader energy sector.\nAdvertisement Embattled energy producer Santos, which is also seen as a takeover target, saw its shares increase by nearly 12 per cent in early trade while Origin Energy lifted 4 per cent higher.\nThe proposal, which implies a 13 per cent premium to Oil Search's closing price on Monday of $6.73, is subject to regulatory approval from the PNG Government and satisfactory due diligence.\nOil Search said while it will consider the deal its notes its shareholders are entitled to an offer which \"adequately reflects\" the company's value which includes a stake in the foundation Exxon Mobil-led PNG LNG project along with an associated Train 3 expansion and the Papua LNG project.\nThe tone of its statement suggests Oil Search may be unimpressed with the 13 per cent premium offered within the proposal.\nHowever, Woodside may pitch the deal on the basis that part of the premium is already baked in to Oil Search's share price.\nOil Search, headed by Peter Botten, has a market value of $10.3 billion with its shares falling by 30 per cent in the last 12 months due to the prolonged slump in the oil price.\nWoodside boss Peter Coleman has also seen the company's shares plunge by nearly 30 per cent over the same period giving the West Australian headquartered producer a market capitalisation of just over $25 billion.\n\"The Oil Search board intends to review the proposal and will update shareholders and the market in due course,\" Oil Search said in a statement to the ASX on Tuesday. \"The company wishes to emphasise that there is no guarantee that a binding proposal can be agreed between the parties.\"\nOne of the largest obstacles to the deal is the PNG government itself. It holds a coveted 10 per cent stake in Oil Search and is not previously thought to have been open to the idea of selling its holding.\nThe PNG government paid around $1.2 billion in February 2014 for its stake, which equated to 149 million shares at a price of $8.20 a share. The International Petroleum Investment Company, a sovereign wealth fund based in Abu Dhabi, also holds a 13 per cent stake in Oil Search.\nThe potential deal also heralds a major change of heart by chairman Michael Chaney, who has historically been extremely wary of investment in the PNG region due to sovereign risk issues.\nHowever, the dive in crude oil prices over the past year has slashed share prices across the board, opening up opportunities for predators such as cashed-up Woodside, which has made its appetite for acquisitions clear.\nAt Woodside's full-year results in August Mr Coleman said he would not spend \"precious cash\" on the lower-quality assets currently for sale, but will instead wait until companies under financial pressure from low prices are forced to put their \"crown jewels\" on the market.\nMr Coleman said it may take another one or two quarters of low commodity prices before acquisitions of the quality Woodside is targeting, with near-term production potential, come up for sale and the gap closes between bid and offer prices.\nWoodside is being advised by Merrill Lynch, Gresham and legal firm Herbert Smith Freehills while Oil Search has appointed Morgan Stanley and Allens as legal adviser.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/street-talk/woodside-makes-oil-search-approach-20150907-gjh7gp"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:53:28.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
