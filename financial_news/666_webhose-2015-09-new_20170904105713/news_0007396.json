And as a result, many investors are speculating about the future of bank stocks.\nThe obvious bull case for financial stocks is the hope of higher rates and better net interest margins. While many remain convinced that the Fed will not move quickly on rates and will delay any increase until after the upcoming September FOMC meeting, the bottom line is that rates have nowhere to go but up.\nBest investments for the next 10 years (6:27) Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates explains how he uses current valuations to predict future returns. Emerging Markets look great, he says, while U.S. stocks don't offer much upside.\nThat said, if you think the fate of bank stocks is wholly dependent on the Fed alone, you’re not seeing the big picture. The bottom line is that many indicators are looking up for bank stocks right now, and savvy investors may want to take a position in the sector — regardless of how the FOMC moves forward in regards to its rate policies.\nHere are six reasons why bank stocks are a buy, rate hike or no:\n1. Streamlined operations: After dealing with persistently low interest rates for years, banks have been forced to prop up their businesses through more efficient operations. For example, regional bank Huntington Bancshares HBAN, -0.09% just saw a record second-quarter profit thanks to higher fees but also lower costs. Or take PNC Financial Services Group PNC, -0.20% , which has targeted $500 million in cost-cutting this year through layoffs and 100 branch closures. Even if the Federal Reserve fails to act for some time, such corporate moves are sure to lift select financial stocks.\n2. Big earnings beats: Wall Street seems to be overlooking the impact of these cost cuts, based on the big earnings beats of banking stocks this summer. From megabanks including Bank of America BAC, +0.00% to regionals such as Huntington Bancshares, investors saw a bunch of impressive earnings surprises as well as modest top-line growth. In fact, FactSet reports that the financial sector was second only to health care with the number of companies topping revenue estimates in the second quarter. This, coupled with financial stocks posting an overall earnings growth rate of 6.8% year-over-year, is very encouraging for the sector going forward.\n3. Strength in housing: In August, existing home sales hit the highest level since 2007 , according to the National Association of realtors. The fact that transactions are at pre-recession levels is encouraging for the all-important mortgage lending business of banks. At the same time, foreclosures are at their lowest level since late 2007, meaning borrowers are making good on those mortgages and not just buying houses they can’t afford. Given the importance of this lending segment to banks, strength in housing is a promising sign.\n4. Attractive share valuations: After a pullback for many stocks in the last several weeks, bargain hunters have plenty of attractive targets among bank stocks. The current P/E of financial stocks is 14.7, and the forward P/E is just 6.7, according to financial data site FinViz . That makes financial-sector valuations the lowest among any sector. Furthermore, some of the biggest and most entrenched financial services companies are trading for significant discounts to book value. Take Citigroup C, +0.06% , trading at a price/book of about 0.75 right now, or MetLife MET, -0.35% at 0.78, or Capital One Financial COF, -0.29% at 0.89, to name a few.\n5. Cyclical potential: For all the grumbling about China and a strong U.S. dollar DXY, +0.18% and market volatility, the bottom line is that the U.S. unemployment rate continues to drop and consumers continue to spend more money. A 5.1% unemployment rate is the lowest level since 2008 , while personal spending and personal income both rose at a nice clip in July despite broader economic uncertainty around the globe. With more people working and spending, that naturally means more business for financial institutions.\n6. Millennials’ moment: Longer-term investors should keep in mind the millennials are entering a crucial stage of their lives as consumers. This age group has been kicked around about everything, from its work ethic to its lack of savings , but let’s remember that millennials tend to do everything later than previous generations — including getting married and having children. No surprise, then, that 20-somethings are taking longer to fall into the routine of an office job, a mortgage and daycare duties — particularly after taking on tons of student loans and suffering during the Great Recession. The good news is that many recent reports show that more millennials are looking at homeownership and that their attitudes about savings and investing are maturing. I am incredibly optimistic about millennials and their ability to drive economic growth in the future, and long-term investors can ride this trend by getting into financial services companies now before this influx of borrowing and investing from this underrated generation.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-spending-rose-0-3-in-july-1440765320", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/housing-boosted-by-u-s-millennials-finally-being-buyers", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/12/14/barely-half-of-u-s-adults-are-married-a-record-low/", "http://huntington-ir.com/ne/news/hban215.pdf", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/15/millennials-get-savvier-about-long-term-savings.html", "http://www.factset.com/websitefiles/PDFs/earningsinsight/earningsinsight_9.4.15", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-to-pre-recession-pace-1440079684", "http://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&v=120&o=pe", "http://time.com/money/3966249/millennials-retirement-savings/", "http://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2015/07/15/PNC-bank-financial-services-profits-dip-in-second-quarter-pittsburgh/stories/201507150165", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/02/AR2010040201452.html"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:20:28.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
