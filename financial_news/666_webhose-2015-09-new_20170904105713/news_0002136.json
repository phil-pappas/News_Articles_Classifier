Here's how to trade four exchange-traded funds based on the interest rate announcement. \nThe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ) continues to track its 200-week simple moving average higher. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( GLD ) , iShares GSCI Commodity-Index Trust Fund ( GSG ) and Deutsche Bank USD Index ( UUP ) remain above lows set in July and August. Here are this week's charts and trading levels for these exchange-traded funds. \nHere's the weekly chart for the 20+ year bond ETF. \nCourtesy of MetaStock Xenith \nThe bond ETF , which is a basket of U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities of 20 years to 30 years, is a flight-to-safety alternative for investors. It had a close of $121.39 on Friday, down 3.6% year to date, with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) down 4.8%. \nThe bond ETF is below its 200-day simple moving average of $124.87, and is on the cusp of its 50-day simple moving average of $121.40. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nThe weekly chart is negative, with the ETF below its key weekly moving average of $122.25, which indicates risk to the 200-week simple moving average of $117.53, which is considered the uptrend for bonds. The weekly momentum reading declined to 65.81, down from 72.84 on Sept. 4. \nInvestors looking to buy the bond ETF should place a good till canceled limit order to buy the ETF if it drops to $120.38, which remains a key level on technical charts until the end of September. Investors looking to reduce holdings should place a good till canceled limit order to sell the ETF if it rises to $125.19, which remains a key level on technical charts until the end of September. Here's the weekly chart for the gold exchange-traded fund. \nCourtesy of MetaStock Xenith \nThe gold ETF , which is backed by gold bullion, had a close of $106.16 on Friday, down 6.5% year to date. This ETF is above its July 24 low of $103.43, and below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages of $107.60 and $113.57, respectively. \nThe weekly chart is negative, with the ETF below its key weekly moving average of $108.09, and well below its 200-week simple moving average of $135.90. The weekly momentum slipped to 34.52, down from 34.69 on Sept. 4. \nInvestors looking to buy the gold ETF should place a good till canceled limit order to buy the ETF if it drops to $103.01, which is a key level on technical charts until the end of this week. \nInvestors looking to reduce holdings should place a good till canceled limit order to sell the ETF if it rises to $112.15, which is a key level on technical charts until the end of September. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:04:41.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
