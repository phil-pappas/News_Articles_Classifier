The ACB filed the charge sheet before Special Judge Poonam Chaudhry. In 2012, the ACB had registered a case in the alleged loss of Rs.100 crore to the Delhi government in awarding the contract of operation and maintenance of inspection and certification of CNG vehicles. The first information report was lodged on a court's order after a complaint case was filed by RTI activist Vivek Garg, who has alleged that then transport commissioner R.K. Verma with others has conspired to favour a private company, ESP India, in a contract, causing losses to the public exchequer. The contract was awarded to ESP India in 2002. According to Garg, in 2013, ACB has arrested several of the accused but later they were granted bail after probe agency failed to file a charge sheet in the case.
