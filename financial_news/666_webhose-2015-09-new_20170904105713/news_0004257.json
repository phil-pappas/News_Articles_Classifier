The managing director of the ailing mining services company, Brian Hodges, says he'll keep going as long as required. Daniel Munoz by Simon Evans Nick Greiner is stepping down as chairman of the ailing mining services firm Bradken, adding to the tumultuous last few months for the company, as soon-to-depart managing director Brian Hodges said he would stay on for as long as needed to guide the firm through a rough time.\nMr Greiner, a former NSW Premier, will also step aside as a director of Bradken where he has been on the board since 2004. He is handing the reins over to another Bradken director, Phil Arnall, who will become chairman at the company's annual meeting in November.\nMr Greiner is also deputy chairman of CHAMP Private Equity, the firm which joined forces with Chile's Sigdo Koppers and worked for months on a merger proposal with Bradken which ultimately didn't happen because the companies didn't see eye to eye on value .\nMr Greiner was in an uncomfortable position given his roles at both CHAMP and Bradken, and removed himself from all discussions around the proposal by appointing a three-person independent committee from Bradken to oversee the merger negotiations.\nCHAMP and Sigdo Koppers had a 60-day exclusivity period running from late June, 2015 to try and hammer out a merger deal after injecting $70 billion into a weak Bradken balance sheet in the form of redeemable convertible preference securities which have a conversion price of $2 per share. But the Bradken board refused to grant a request to extend the exclusivity period when it ran out and the merger talks were officially called off at the start of September.\nBradken shares are currently wallowing at around $1.05 each.\nThe exit of Mr Greiner, who was Premier of NSW from 1988 to 1992, will mean more renewal at the upper echelons of Bradken, which has been hit hard by the speed of the global mining downturn.\nBradken announced on June 19 this year that long-serving managing director Brian Hodges would be leaving, but didn't specify an exact time frame. Mr Hodges has been managing director for 18 years.\n Mr Hodges said on Tuesday he had yet to talk to the new chairman designate, Mr Arnall, about what this might mean for the executive search process and whether he might be required to stay on longer than the end of calendar 2015.\n\"I'm yet to talk to him,\" Mr Hodges says. \"It's been quite silent in that area.\"\nMr Hodges said he worked for the board, and he would do what was required to lead Bradken through a difficult period, with market conditions still difficult, although they hadn't worsened.\n\"It's still a real focus on costs and right-sizing the overall business,\" he says.\nBradken has been slashing costs to try and limit the damage as big mining companies slash their capital spending budgets. Bradken has cut costs by $25 million and reduced its workforce size by 1300 over the past year.\nMr Arnall has been a director of Bradken since 2004 and is also the chairman of ASX-listed A.J.Lucas, which provides drilling services to the mining industry and to shale gas explorers in Europe. Mr Greiner said in an announcement to the ASX on Tuesday that Mr Arnall was \"well qualified to lead the Bradken board through the current challenging stage of the resources cycle\". There was speculation in June that Mr Hodges wasn't overly keen to step down and had wanted to continue.\nOver the past 14 months Bradken has dealt with three separate buyout proposals. The latest was from Sigdo Koppers and CHAMP, while there have previously been two other ones from private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners, each one with a different partner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:03:50.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
