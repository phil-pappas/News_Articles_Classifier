Banks that issue credit cards currently cover these charges.\nAbout 10% of U.S. small businesses were victims of payment fraud, including the type of credit-card fraud the switch aims to prevent, in 2013, the most recent data available, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.\nMore\nChip-and-PIN Security for Payment Cards Won’t Happen Until 2020: Forrester Data Breach Puts Focus on Beefed-Up Card Security Chip-Card Rollout Has Banks, Retailers Scrambling iHospital, a Tampa, Fla.-based owner of seven Apple repair stores, began switching to the new chip-card system in August. “We are in the technology business and we wanted to be ahead of the game,” said iHospital Chief Executive Ross Newman. The new readers accept the Apple Pay AAPL 4.29 % mobile-payment service, another plus, he added.\nSmall businesses typically will pay $150 to $600 for each new payment terminal, industry officials say, though mobile readers can be had for less than $100.\nSome vendors are offering special promotions. Payments startup Square Inc. in June began offering merchants one Square reader that meets the new chip-card standards at no charge. Square won’t say how many have taken up the offer, or whether the new readers will be delivered by Oct. 1, though it promises to cover EMV-related chargebacks for small businesses that have ordered the new reader.\niHospital’s switch will cost about $15,000, or roughly $600 per terminal. “We use a custom system so our options are really, really limited,” said Mr. Newman. In all, merchants will spend $7 billion on new payment terminals and related software, estimates Strawhecker Group, a payments consulting firm.\nMany small businesses aren’t switching, mainly because they don’t know about the shift or don’t see any payoff from the new systems, which are slightly slower. Nearly two-thirds of companies with 500 or fewer employees say they aren’t ready for the October switch versus 44% of larger merchants, with more than 1,000 employees, according to a survey of 579 businesses to be released later this month by the Ponemon Institute, a research firm.\n‘ We use a custom system so our options are really, really limited. ’\n—Ross Newman, iHospital’s chief executive Valerie Koehler, owner of Blue Willow Bookshop in Houston, plans to stick with her current payments system, which was replaced a few years ago, instead of purchasing a new terminal in advance of the changeover.\n“I have not taken a charge back in 15 years,” said Ms. Koehler, whose average transaction is $30 to $50. “I am more likely to take a bad $100 bill, just because the staff wasn’t paying close enough attention.”\nJason Oxman, chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group, said the change “is not a mandate. If you don’t have any fraud at your store, then the EMV migration fraud liability shift is not particularly relevant.”\nMerchants that sell big-ticket items and smaller items, such as gift cards, that can be easily resold are most vulnerable to counterfeit fraud. “Something as small as a $10 gift card can be very easily monetized,” said Patty Walters, a senior vice president with payments processor Vantiv Inc. VNTV 2.79 % “A $500 spa gift certificate, not so much.”\nEven after the shift, small businesses may not be held responsible for some small purchases made with counterfeit cards, said Carolyn Balfany, a senior vice president with MasterCard Inc., noting that card issuers often don’t pass on liability for high-volume, low-risk transactions where merchants aim to keep lines moving, such as fast food and cups of coffee.\nSome small-business owners complain about aggressive sales tactics from independent sales organizations that sell payment services to small companies. Shelli Warren, owner of Y’all’s BBQ and Produce in Tyler, Texas, said she signed a contract to lease a card processor in March after the salesman said the switch-over was mandatory.\n“He had me in fear that that day or the next day I wouldn’t be able to run a credit card because of the smart chip,” said Ms. Warren, who said she is currently paying about $42 a month for the equipment.\nThe switch-over won’t solve all payment fraud. In the U.K., losses due to counterfeit cards fell by 56% between 2005 and 2013, after chip-enabled cards were rolled out, according to Aite Group, but online fraud jumped by 64%.\nPayment industry officials say they also are trying to prevent a run up in online fraud with new security measures such as tokenization, in which card numbers are turned into unique digital codes. “There are now more solutions to identify and detect online fraud,” said Stephanie Ericksen, a vice president with Visa Inc.\nWrite to Ruth Simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:16:01.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
