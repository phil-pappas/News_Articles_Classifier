Photo: Carla Gottgens\nAlcoa chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld​ says his company's plans to demerge its upstream and downstream businesses will give the company \"optionality\" for dealmaking, with analysts pointing to the potential for multi-billion dollar transactions involving Alumina Ltd, Rio Tinto and South32.\nThe US aluminium giant on Monday unveiled plans to split into two companies by the second half of 2016 after having bulked up its downstream unit through acquisitions over the past year. The upstream company will include its 60 per cent stake in the bauxite mining and alumina refining Alcoa World Alumina & Chemicals (AWAC) joint venture with Alumina as well as its global portfolio of smelters and casthouses.\nThe downstream company will provide aluminium products in the automotive and aviation sectors and presumably command a higher rating than the combined company's because the more volatile upstream business had been a drag on its price/earnings ratio. Alcoa shares closed 5.9 per cent higher at $US9.60 in New York after the demerger announcement, giving it a market value of $US11.9 billion.\n\"Clearly in separating these two companies it gives ... [dealmaking] optionality,\" Mr Kleinfeld told analysts.\nAdvertisement On a pro forma basis for the year to June 30, \"Upstream Co\" would have reported $US2.085 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation based on revenues of $US13.2 billion ($19 billion).\nJPMorgan analyst Michael Gambardella​ said there would be no savings or synergies created from the demerger – instead, it would increase overhead costs. As a result, he said the best way for Upstream Co to realise a significantly higher valuation would be to combine the business with another sizeable aluminium producer to enable it to cut costs and better control supply. Mr Gambardella named Rio's aluminium business as a prime candidate.\nAlcoa had attempted a $US33 billion hostile takeover of Canada's Alcan in 2007 but was trumped by a $US38.1 billion rival offer from Rio . At the time, Alcoa said the deal could generate $US1 billion of cost savings a year.\n\"Obviously much has changed with both companies shutting/divesting underperforming assets and reducing costs, but we still think meaningful synergies could be obtained from further supply rationalisations and base loading of the lowest cost production of the combined company,\" Mr Gambardella said.\nThe aluminium price has fallen by 20.8 per cent to $US1549.50 a tonne over the past 12 months and Alcoa has been shutting capacity.\nRio buoyant However, Rio has been quite upbeat about its aluminium division in recent times; it is understood it never seriously considered spinning it off even when many analysts and investors proposed it do so over the last few years. Mr Gambardella said the biggest hurdle for a deal would be agreeing on a value for the assets in any joint venture and who would control it.\nRio's aluminium division is higher margin than Alcoa's, having contributed $US3.52 billion of EBITDA based on $US11.8 billion of revenue in the 12 months ended June 30.\nIn addition, there would be complications resulting from Alcoa's AWAC joint venture with Alumina. Alumina would have the preemptive right to purchase a 40 per cent stake in any bauxite and alumina assets bought by Alcoa's upstream division.\nFor that reason, other analysts think it is possible Upstream Co's first acquisition could be the purchase of Alumina. Mr Kleinfeld indicated Upstream Co would have a high non-investment grade credit rating, but if it lacked cash, a scrip deal could be possible as Alcoa is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Alumina has a market value of $3.4 billion and its investment grade credit rating of BBB-minus was reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's on Tuesday.\nContrarian investor Allan Gray in August declared a 5.03 per cent stake in Alumina. Simon Mawhinney, the managing director and chief investment officer of Allan Gray said his firm had done so on the basis it was cheap rather than the potential of a bid from Alcoa.\n\"It is hard to know what [the Alcoa demerger] means for Alumina going forward,\" he said. \"There is nothing about this announcement that could be perceived to be bad for Alumina. It is either immaterial or incrementally positive if you thought there was going to be consolidation.\"\nShaw Stockbroking analyst Peter O'Connor​ noted Alcoa has scrip listed in Australia that it could use in the event of an acquisition of Alumina. \"They can keep the listing here,\" he said of a deal.\nSouth32, the BHP Billiton spin-off, also has the potential to be involved in any future transactions. It owns the Worsley alumina refinery located near AWAC's assets in Western Australia as well as a share of Brazilian assets run by AWAC, along with aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique. South32 reported underlying EBITDA of $US1.05 billion from those assets in the financial year ended June 30, based on revenue of $US3.96 billion.\nBut Mr O'Connor said he thought a deal between Alcoa and South32 was less likely, in part because Alcoa would have little interest in South32's smelters while South32 would want to make sure it sold them as part of any deal. Another analyst said the Worsley refinery was one of South32's best assets and it would be an unlikely seller.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/rio-announces-44b-alcan-bid/2007/07/12/1183833677930.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:26:56.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
