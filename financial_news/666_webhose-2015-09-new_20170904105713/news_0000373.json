The Tokyo-based company, which mainly does tramp services carrying bulk cargoes such as iron core, coal and grains, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the Nikkei report.\nShares of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the largest shareholder of Daiichi Chuo, slumped as much as 7.4 percent after the report. Mitsui O.S.K., also known as MOL, is seeking confirmation of the report on bankruptcy and can’t comment further now, Takafumi Shiina, a company spokesman, said by phone. MOL controlled 16.5 percent of Daiichi Chuo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nDaiichi Chuo shares fell 3.5 percent to 28 yen in Tokyo trading Monday, giving the company a market value of 11.7 billion yen.
