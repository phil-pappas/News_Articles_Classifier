But their hopes have been thwarted by robust output from other parts of the world, from Russia to Saudi Arabia and Iraq, that has kept a lid on prices.\n“We now know that the U.S. [production] is in decline,” said Eric Nuttall, portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management, which manages about $5.8 billion. “I would have thought [prices] would be higher, with the data points, but maybe people need another month or two” of statistics, he said. \nA month ago, Mr. Nuttall’s $37 million fund was fully invested in oil-company shares. Since then, he has closed out some of those wagers and is holding some cash as protection in case oil prices fall in the near term.\nU.S. government data confirmed in late August that the nation’s oil output peaked in April and has fallen steadily since. The news helped spur a three-day surge, but prices quickly reversed and are down 9.7% for September so far. \nThe muted price reaction to declining U.S. output underscores how the market’s focus has shifted to production gains elsewhere.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ output rose between April and August, offsetting the amount that U.S. production is estimated to have fallen. Rates of oil extraction in Brazil and Russia increased in recent months. Traders are also watching Iran, which says it can boost its exports by 500,000 barrels a day by late November or early December even before most sanctions are lifted.\nGlobal inventories remain high, meaning that the market could remain in a glut even if demand begins to outstrip supply. Consulting firm Energy Aspects estimated this month that global crude stockpiles are at 80% of capacity.\nAfter posting wild price swings in August, U.S. oil prices have traded in a $6-a-barrel range this month. The U.S. oil benchmark fell 2.8% Monday to $44.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 2.6% to $47.34 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\nThe confirmed drop in U.S. output has helped boost U.S. prices relative to the global benchmark. The two contracts now trade within $3 a barrel of each other, down from nearly $7 a barrel in mid-August. A halt in some Canadian production also boosted U.S. prices relative to Brent in recent weeks, as well as increased confidence that Congress could lift the ban on U.S. oil exports.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration on Aug. 31 said domestic production has been lower all year than previously reported. Current data show that output fell from a peak of 9.6 million barrels a day in April to 9.3 million barrels a day in June. The latest monthly data, which will include the first production figures for July, are due Wednesday.\nFor some fund managers, that was a reason to buy.\n“That’s a lot, lot bigger [drop] than anybody was predicting,” said Shawn Reynolds, portfolio manager at Van Eck Global, which manages $31.1 billion. Mr. Reynolds added exposure to U.S. oil producers this summer. “A week ago, I probably wouldn’t have been as upbeat, but I was really taken aback by that number,” he said.\nProduction in the lower 48 states fell for three consecutive weeks and was unchanged in the latest weekly report, according to the EIA’s weekly estimates, but those declines have sometimes been offset by increasing output in Alaska.\nBig investors such as hedge funds have added some bullish bets since early August, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. The number of bearish oil wagers has decreased, signaling a belief that oil bottomed when it hit a six-year low in August. \nStill, many investors say they aren’t ready to pile back into the market, and they expect prices to remain subdued through the end of this year. Société Générale said in a note to clients this month that U.S. oil prices are likely to trade between $40 and $50 a barrel for the rest of 2015.\n“The third quarter has been very frustrating,” said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which manages $15.6 billion. “The oil market is moving back to being in balance, but…sentiment matters a ton, and what it will be that changes sentiment is hard to say.”\nTortoise expects oil prices to rise to $65 a barrel or higher next year and has raised its exposure to oil producers. \n“The market is still struggling with a lot of inventory, and the market is still anticipating those Iranian barrels coming back,” said David Zusman, chief investment officer at Talara Capital Management, which manages $400 million.\nMr. Zusman expects U.S. shale-oil production to start falling more steeply, as older wells yield less crude. But for the market to rebalance, he said, “it doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a year or two.”\nWrite to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com \n\n\nMore From The Wall Street Journal \nCities See a 'Bright Flight' \nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324328904578624031829252000.html \nHow to Win a Real-Estate Bidding War \nCommodity Markets oil prices", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:11:57.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
