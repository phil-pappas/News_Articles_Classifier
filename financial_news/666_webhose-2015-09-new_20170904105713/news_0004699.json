The two plants, Green End (24.8 MW) and Fenland (20.4 MW), were both connected in March 2015 and therefore qualify for the UK Government's Renewable Obligation scheme, under which they receive Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) for 20 years. \nFinancing for the operation of the solar plants has been provided by Bayerische Landesbank, which provided a GBP 40.3 million non-recourse loan. EDF Energy, the UK's largest producer of low-carbon electricity, will purchase the solar energy under 15 year power purchase agreements with the two plants. \nJose Joaquin Munoz Osuna, VP EMEA Project Finance of Hanwha Q CELLS, said \"We are very pleased to announce the refinancing of our initial UK-solar portfolio with Bayern LB.
