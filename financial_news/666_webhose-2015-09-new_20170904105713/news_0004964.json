Under this Government, employment in the steel industry is up, where it was down under Labour. \n“Why is that? Because we have a car industry that is growing, an aerospace industry that is growing, and construction is growing. We are getting Britain back to work,” he boldly claimed. \nThe Prime Minister was technically right but only because the steel industry at the time of the 2010 election was on its knees amid a brutal global recession. \nHowever, when Mr Cameron made his statement during a special debate about British steelmaking, demand for this year was still forecast to be only 74pc of its 2007 level. \nEight years on from the financial crisis, the state of the industry is anything but rosy. As The Telegraph revealed , Redcar steelworks on Teesside is on the brink of administration, threatening up to 3,000 local jobs. Ask any of the workers who only received 30pc of their wages last month, and have been forced to wear dirty overalls because their employer can’t afford to have them washed, and almost certainly they will describe a sector on its knees. \nA similarly dire tale is likely at other big plants such as those owned by Indian conglomerate Tata in Scunthorpe and Port Talbot, or by Spain’s Celsa in Cardiff. \nLosses at Tata’s UK operations the largest in the country doubled last year to a staggering £768m, while revenue and production fell. \nTata has been struggling ever since it became the UK’s largest steel producer in 2007 with its $13bn takeover of Anglo Dutch producer Corus , a deal that must rank as one of the worst in recent memory. \nIn the intervening years, the company has continually slashed jobs and scaled back operations , reducing its European workforce from 25,000 to 17,000. \nAs a result of its current struggles, Tata has announced a further 700 job losses in Yorkshire and plans to mothball a plant in South Wales with several hundred more job cuts. \nSahaviriya Steel Industries , the Thai company behind Redcar, is in such a parlous state that it has asked for an emergency £100m government loan. \nThe request has fallen on deaf ears. Ministers insist that the steel industry is subject to strict state aid rules prohibiting rescue and restructuring aid for distressed companies, meaning it is unable to step in with direct financial support. British steelmakers insist they are facing a unique set of pressures, which should prompt the government to step in and help secure its future. \nOne of the biggest problems is the flood of Chinese imports. About half of the 1.6bn tonnes of steel made worldwide each year comes from China, and as its economy slows Chinese steel exports have been growing at a rate of around 53pc a year. Chinese imports have risen from 2pc of UK steel demand in 2011 to 8pc this year. \nWith the international price of steel plummeting from about $500 a ton to around $280 in the space of just 12 months, a fall of 45pc, and demand growing at a pedestrian pace, the flood of Chinese steel has had a dramatic effect, UK producers argue. \nOn the face of it, there is perhaps little the Government can do to influence such a global market but steelmakers claim that Britain’s failure to introduce protectionist anti-dumping measures like some countries, has pushed even more steel towards the UK market, exacerbating their struggles. \nSteel bosses insist there are plenty of other external factors that are weighing on their fortunes, which the Government has the ability to influence. \nUK producers have also consistently complained about high energy costs, environmental levies and high business rates, which can be around 50pc more than other nations. Easing pressure on these fronts would help the industry weather the current storm, they argue. \nThe Government insists that it has already provided real help, largely in the form of millions of pounds in compensation for energy costs. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also points out that it recently voted to extend anti-dumping measures on certain Chinese steel products. \nBut beyond that, ministers seem unlikely to go much further. Though it hasn’t said so explicitly, the position seems to be that the picture is hugely complicated and there is only so much it can do in the face of difficult global economic conditions. \nThe industry has been slowly dying for decades. Today, the UK steel sector employs about 20,000 people directly, just a tenth of the number who worked in it during the 1970s. \nYet unless something radically changes, Britain’s steelmakers face a seriously bleak future. \nThe UK’s major producers have been racking up losses for many years now but the picture has undoubtedly worsened dramatically in 2015. \nAs SSI has proven since it took over Redcar, the big players are prepared to withstand losses for a certain length of time, and indeed often expect to, as the market moves up and down. However, there usually comes a time, especially if you’re a foreign company with bigger interests elsewhere to protect, when you say the burden has become too great. Watching events unfold up in Redcar, it feels as though we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of British steelmaking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:34:50.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
