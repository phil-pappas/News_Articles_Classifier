Investors thought there will be a rebooting of Abenomics,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nAbe's fiscal policy has yet to translate into gains in real wages for Japanese workers, and market participants said easing the corporate tax burden is a step toward giving companies more profits to put into employees' pockets.\n\"There is also a sense of relief at seeing Abe turn his attention back to the economy after putting so much of his focus toward a controversial security bill,\" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.\n\"The markets need him to keep an eye on the economy, and he's starting to do that because of the elections ahead.\"\nLong-term investors also saw the Nikkei's dip to a seven-month low on Tuesday as a good opportunity for bargain-hunting as the Nikkei was trading around 14 times forecast earnings.\nThe country's public pension funds, which have been stepping up stock investment under Abe, are likely to be among them.\n\"Long-term investors such as public pension funds seem to be buying stocks today,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nIf the gains hold, the Nikkei is on track to post the biggest daily gain since March 16, 2011.\nTraders said that the Japanese market tends to be volatile as it is the most liquid market open during Asian trade. If the Chinese market falls, investors would trade on Japanese shares to hedge against the fall in China, they added.\nAll of the Topix's 33 subsectors were in positive territory.\nBrokerage stocks jumped, with Nomura Holdings up 7.3 percent and Daiwa Securities Group rising 5.8 percent.\nExporters also gained ground. Toyota Motor Corp jumped 3.9 percent and Honda Motor Co gained 3.4 percent. The broader Topix gained 3.3 percent to 1,462.80.
