As per the Reserve Bank of India data, credit in the system grew by 9.5 per cent at the end of 21st August 2015 to Rs 66,66,241 crore from Rs 60,86,903 crore a year ago.\nIn the same period deposits increased slightly faster at 12 per cent to Rs 89,59,701 crore.\nEven though the festival season is set to kick start banks do not expect a significant improvement in credit offtake. For over a year, credit in the system has been growing in single digits. Even though RBI is hopeful that credit off take will begin to improve by the September-October bankers are not that hopeful.\n\nRetail loans lead bank credit growth \n\nRetail loans continue to grow even as lending from the corporates has come down. And within retail, it is especially the unsecured segment-personal loans and credit cards that is growing at a robust pace.\nAs per the Reserve Bank of India data, personal loans increased by 16.8 per cent in July 2015 as compared with the increase of 15.1 per cent in the same month last year. On the other hand the credit card outstanding grew to 21.3 per cent in July this year as compared to 18 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. \nAt the same time, credit to industry increased by 4.8 per cent as compared with the increase of 10.2 per cent in July 2014. The regulator said that deceleration in credit growth to industry was observed in all major sub-sectors except basic metal and gems and jewellery. \nGrowth has come off in all major sectors.
