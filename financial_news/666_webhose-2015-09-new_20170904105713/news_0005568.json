Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Days into the job, The Clash fan and new arts minister Mitch Fifield has pledged to embrace more 'provocative' and diverse forms of art and flagged policy changes, saying nothing is set in stone.\nWhile the plan is unlikely to be scrapped, Mr Fifield also attempted to assuage critics of former Arts Minister George Brandis' shift of more arts funding under ministerial control, by saying he expects its decisions to be overseen by an expert panel.\nMr Fifield quickly distinguished himself from the bush poetry-loving Mr Brandis this week by declaring a weakness for the Pet Shop Boys.\nBut he said his taste is \"eclectic\" and includes The Whitlams, Frank Sinatra, Ryuichi Sakamoto and The Clash and even the ballet – his sister-in-law is a former Queensland state dancer.\n\"The arts has intrinsic worth. I think the arts should be provocative and disruptive, and surprising and, on occasion, outrageous but it can also be embracing and affirming,\" he said.\nPreaching from the Turnbull bible, Mr Fifield told The Australian Financial Review he would seek change where it's needed, become a \"student\" of the arts and \"be shaped by\" the sector.\n\"We shouldn't see things as set in concrete, we should be open to trialling things and changing them,\" he said.\nMr Fifield faces an uphill battle, however, with much of the arts community still fuming over Mr Brandis' shock redistribution of funds from the Australia Council and into his new National Programme for Excellence in the Arts in the May budget.\n The announcement came just as some arts companies were breathing a sigh of relief and applying for stable six-year grants with the recently restructured council – a scheme that was then scrapped.\nKatrina Douglas Artistic Director of Sydney's PACT Centre for Emerging Artists said they had done \"a lot of work\", and hauled in outside strategists to prepare for the application.\nSince then, she said \"there's been months of not knowing what was going on and what we were going to do\" before another four-year funding round was announced.\nShe said while PACT's status has assured funding for next year at least, many others have been left in the lurch, waiting for new Australia Council and NPEA grant rounds.\n\"There were many, many companies who are facing a year with no federal funding at all next year and those companies are definitely going to close...Youth theatre is in dire danger of collapsing,\" she said.\nMr Fifield said he was aware of the criticisms, but defended the new system.\nHe said \"having the opportunity for the executive government to have a role\" via the NPEA was not without precedent\" and it would allow for a wider variety of the arts sector to get funds.\nWhile he declined to give a date when arts companies can find out how the NPEA will allocate funds, he insists he's listening.\n\"There has been a period of consultation ... and that has been taken on board, so there will be some changes to the final guidelines and eligibility,\" he said.\nHe said outside experts will have a role in the NPEA, and was \"keen to consult, and minimise the number of surprises\" in the future for the community.\nWhile previous arts ministers have been seen as having a preference for the high profile art, Mr Fifield said he would be keen to support \"a broad cross-section of the arts community\".\n\"From fringe festivals, comedy festivals to the opera and contemporary music, I'm keen to get along, be a part and to learn\" he said.\nAfter his time as disabilities minister, he is also keen to support arts for the disabled and aging.\n\"Some people may have lost their capacity to speak, but they can still sing,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/attorneygeneral-george-brandis-busted-reading-poetry-books-during-estimates-hearing-20150604-ghgl8z.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-09-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:44:49.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
