The Federal Court has dismissed Archer Capital's claims that Sage reneged on a deal to buy the accounting software company. by Marianna Papadakis Private equity guru and former partner at Archer Capital Andrew Gray was given a birching in a recent ruling dismissing the private equity consortium's long-running court case against British software giant Sage.\nThe Federal Court dismissed Archer Capital's claims that Sage reneged on a $1.35 billion deal to buy the accounting software company MYOB.\nA FTSE 100-listed software company, Sage said it would now take steps to recover the costs it incurred during the legal proceedings.\nArcher Capital was the former majority owner of MYOB, which brought legal action on behalf of its investors after Sage pulled out of a private equity deal to buy MYOB in 2011.\nArcher later sold the software company to a competing bidder, another private equity firm Bain Capital, and sought about $200 million in damages for the difference in price it received.\nArcher claimed Sage was in breach of the terms of final offer in August 2011. It also claimed estoppel and misleading and deceptive conduct.\nSage refuted the allegations, arguing no deal was ever struck.\nGray 'an unreliable witness' Federal Court judge Kathleen Farrell ruled Sage had not breached any deal.\n\"I do not accept that any of the applicants were parties to any agreement of the kind alleged by the applicants, nor do I accept that any actionable representation was made to any of the applicants by or on behalf of Sage nor was any estoppel raised,\" Justice Farrell said.\nMr Gray, who co-ordinated the sale process, was labelled by Justice Farrell as an unreliable and unsatisfactory witness.\nJustice Farrell said Mr Gray, who is now a principal at recently established firm 5Value Capital Partners, maintained a mantra-like use of the phrase \"final binding offer\" in his evidence that was unpersuasive, repetitious and self-serving.\nThe judge also did not believe Mr Gray's evidence that he was unaware of a \"leak\" announcement by Sage on August 16, 2011 that a pending preferred bidder was about to be announced.\nMr Gray told The Australian Financial Review that he was \"quite disappointed with the judge's decision\".\n\"I disagree with her characterisations and several of her findings,\" he said in an email.\nJustice Farrell said Archer's failure to respond to the leak in any meaningful way indicated its acceptance that Sage was under no legally binding obligation at that point to finalise a binding arrangement.\nArcher's claims arose after Sage's former chief executive Guy Berruyer contacted former executive chairman, Greg Minto , then a director at Archer, saying it would not buy all of MYOB's shares unless either the price for them was reduced by $175 million or a transaction for $1.35 billion was put to Sage's shareholders for approval.\nArcher contended the communication was made after the parties agreed to a binding deal.\nThe case embroiled several high-profile personalities in private equity, including at Deutsche Bank , which acted for the UK technology company.\nIt was revealed during the case that former Deutsche Bank managing director Tim Longstaff had told colleagues in an email at the time, the bank would suffer \"massive reputational loss\" because the deal fell through.\nThen UBS managing director Aidan Allen, Archer CEO Peter Wiggs, Bain Capital managing director Craig Boyce, Deutsche Bank managing director Charles Bryant and recently retired Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Australia head Justin Reizes were among those caught up in the drama.\nArcher Capital declined to comment. The judgment was handed down on August 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:10:21.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
