Ltd. 005380, +1.22% and Kia Motors Corp. 000270, -0.57% settled with the EPA and the Department of Justice to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.\nThe car makers paid a $100 million civil penalty. The penalties centered on allegations Hyundai and Kia vehicles emitted more pollutants than what the companies had certified with the EPA, and they also overstated the vehicles’ fuel-economy performances.\nVolkswagen will be required to correct the problem without cost to the car owner, the EPA said. It is likely that owners will receive a recall notice from Volkswagen in the future, it said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/21b8983ffa5d0e4685257dd4006b85e2/dfc8e33b5ab162b985257ec40057813b!OpenDocument"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:31:58.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
