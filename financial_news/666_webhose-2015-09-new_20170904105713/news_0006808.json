The first phase is due to be completed in 2026 and the second phase in 2033. \nThe project has attracted a growing number of joint-venture partners such as Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) , Kier and Eiffage and possible collaborations between firms like Ferrovial (Other OTC: FRRVF - news ) , BAM Nuttall and Morgan Sindall (LSE: MGNS.L - news ) and Costain and Skanska (Stockholm: SKA-B.ST - news ) . \nOsborne will also invite Chinese investment in a series of projects dubbed the 'Northern Powerhouse', designed to spur development in northern England, where growth has lagged London and the southeast. \nAmong the key investment opportunities being touted are building 10,000 homes in Manchester and regenerating a 130 hectare site in Leeds. \n\"As we continue to work more closely with China, we have an unprecedented opportunity to secure significant investment into some of our most ambitious projects across our Northern Powerhouse,\" Osborne said in a statement.
