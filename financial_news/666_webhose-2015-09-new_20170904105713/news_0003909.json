In the industry which has seen a 7% decline in tablet shipments as compared to Q2 last year, Amazon has just announced its cheapest tablet till date, the Amazon Fire priced at just $49.99. Yes, this particular device is targeted at the users in the budget market who would like to have a large screen portable entertainment device that doesn’t cost a fortune.

In fact, the company claims that the display is better than most sub $100 tablets which come with cheap components. On the other hand, the Fire comes with an IPS display with wide angle screen ideal for watching movies and high contrast ratio. In fact, in a demonstration, the company tried to show that its screen was better than a Samsung tablet which costs twice as much. \nThe Amazon Fire tablet comes with a quad-core processor with 1GB RAM and 8GB of storage which is expandable up to 128GB via MicroSD. There’s a rear facing camera as well. Not bad for a $50 tablet. But Amazon didn’t stop at this; the company is offering the fire tablet in a six pack as well. The six pack of Fire tablet costs just $250, which essentially means that the customer gets one Fire tablet for free. That’s six tablets at less than the price of the cheapest iPad model. The company also goes on to say that this tablet is twice as durable as the iPad (according to their tests). \nAlong with the super cheap Fire tablet, the company also unveiled three other tablets, an 8-inch, 10-inch and a kid friendly, Fire Kids Edition that costs $99.99. The kids’ edition is a 7-inch Fire tablet inside thick pink or blue colored bumpers that can resist a few bumps and bruises. These kids edition tablets come with Amazon’s two year warranty that cover against damages to the tablet. As for the other two models, they are targeted at users who would like different display size options to fulfill their entertainment needs. \nThe Fire tablets will come with the Fire OS 5 which will reportedly sport Amazon’s new Word Runner feature. Word Runner shows the words on the screen at the desired pace, which helps increase onscreen reading speed.
