They are selling to both categories of buyer. \nMr Wilson said that, when selling to other investors, he has been selling \"in bulk at a minimum of 10 properties, with tenants in situ\". \nBut he said that where tenancies had ended he sold homes on an individual basis to owner-occupiers, where demand for stock is extremely high . \n\"There is an extreme shortage of vacant houses for estate agents to sell and the stock is depleted to the levels of 10 years ago,\" he said. \n= New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) buy-to-let tax 'will push up rents' = \nLike many other landlords the Wilsons have criticised George Osborne's new tax on buy-to-let, which will make it impossible for landlords to deduct mortgage interest costs from their taxable profits. \nSome will have to pay tax on zero income or even on net losses as a result of the change. \nThere is a growing consensus that the effect will be to push up rents. The tax change takes full effect only from 2020. \n\"We now have the Conservative government seeking to change the rules retrospectively,\" Mr Wilson said. \"Investors enter with their eyes open and expect whatever tax arrangements on entry to prevail until exit. \n\"There are now Investors looking towards 2020 saying they would not have entered this form of Investment had they been aware at the time of the proposed tax changes. \n\"The Government needs to think this out. It needs private landlords because it does not wish to fund houses for the social sector.\" \nHe pointed out that foreign buyers, cash buyers and institutional buyers - such as pension funds and insurance companies - were not affected by Mr Osborne's new tax. \nBut he said many landlords who did face the tax would respond by forcing higher rents on tenants. The shortage of properties will mean tenants have little choice. \nThis view has been echoed by others. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, representing banks that lend to landlords, warned that one consequence of the tax would be higher rents . Some landlords might simply sell up and further reduce the supply of rented accommodation, it added. \nJohn Goodall, chief executive of Landbay, a funding platform for landlords, said: \"It's basic economics. You've got rising demand for rented property and a limited supply. If you add a new tax into that equation, the tax will simply get passed on to the tenants.\" \nAt Labour's conference in Brighton, shadow housing minister John Healey announced a review into home ownershp to be overseen by Peter Redfern, chief executive of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) . \nThe backdrop is a wider concern that the growth of buy-to-let as a preferred source of income and capital growth for many investors risks destabilising the economy . \n• Predictions on interest rates, stock markets and much more: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:55:35.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
