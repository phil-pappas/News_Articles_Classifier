There are those who just do not want to compromise on performance, even if it means carrying another device everywhere.\nPortability can, of course, be a key issue for users who don’t want to lug around a big backpack. And people who travel a lot would prefer a camera that can take a bit of abuse.\nIf you are keen on photography and are looking beyond your smartphone, these are some of the best digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) and mirrorless cameras you can buy at the moment.\nULTRA PORTABLE\nMeant for those who do not want to compromise on the portability aspect, but want better performance.\nNikon 1 J4\nRs. 24,950\nThe Nikon 1 J4 is the latest addition to the company’s 1 series. It measures 99.5x60x 28.5mm and the reason it’s so small is because it is a mirrorless camera—there is no mirror reflex optical viewfinder. The 18.4-megapixel sensor, with 171 points of focus, uses the Hybrid autofocus system. The on-screen options are well laid out, and the responsive touch screen adds to the experience.\nSony Alpha A6000\nRs. 51,990 (ILCE-6000L/B with SELP1650 Lens)\nSony has managed to pack in a 24.3-megapixel sensor into a rather small form factor. It uses the updated BIONZ X image processor, which handles lighting better than the earlier version. The Alpha A600 claims to have the fastest autofocus among all cameras with advanced photo system type-C sensors—0.06 seconds. We like the attempt to offer a DSLR-esque user experience, including the button layout next to the 3-inch touch screen and on the top.\nMIRRORLESS CAMERA\nIf you find DSLR cameras too bulky but want similar levels of performance, mirrorless cameras are a good option.\nOlympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II\nRs. 74,990\nThis retro-looking camera has a 16.1-megapixel sensor, and can take fantastic photographs irrespective of the ambient lighting. It exhibits quick shutter speed, with none of the lag that some mirrorless cameras suffer from. The autofocus system locks on to the subject in less than half a second even in low light. Image processing retains the sharpness while doing away with any distortions.\nFULL-FLEDGED DSLR\nProfessionals and genuine enthusiasts don’t want to mess around with anything that is less than excellent.\nCanon EOS 7D Mark II\nRs. 1,50,795 (with EF-S18-135mm f3.5-5.6 IS STM lens)\nThe 20.2-megapixel sensor is assisted by Canon’s latest DIGIC 6 image processor. It has a 10-frames-per-second(fps) continuous shooting speed. This 18-55mm lens adds a genuine solidity to the low-light performance. There are dual card slots for both CF and SD cards as well as USB 3.0 and built-in GPS. A number of Canon EF and EF-S lenses are compatible with this camera.\nENTRY-LEVEL DSLR\nThis is for those who take photography seriously, or plan to. For those who are starting off on a tight budget, but want to experience a DSLR camera. Select your first one wisely, for most users tend to stay with the same brand for years.\nCanon EOS 1200D\nRs. 31,995* (with EF S18-55 IS II lens)\nThis 18-megapixel sensor packing 1200D is specifically designed for newbies. Hence the Canon EOS 1200D Companion app for Android phones and iPhones, an interactive guide. This camera is the successor to the successful 1100D, and while it has a more powerful sensor, the DIGIC 4 image processor remains the same. The 1200D isn’t the most powerful on the specification sheet, but then again, this is meant for a first-time user. It’s certainly worth considering.\nNikon D5200\nRs. 34,950 (with AF-S 18-55mm VRII Kit Lens)\nThe D5200 has a 24.1-megapixel DX-format sensor—it is essentially an advanced photo system type-C format sensor, but Nikon gives it a different name. The interesting bit is that Nikon uses the same EXPEED 3 image-processing engine in this camera as well as the flagship D4 series (D4S: Rs. 4,19,950 onwards)—this bodes well for the quality of images, which rivals may not always be able to match. The Active D-Lighting feature (an evolution of the HDR, or high dynamic range, that we see in smartphone cameras) improves the detailing in shadow areas.\nNO-COMPROMISE CAMERA\nBudget no bar, the newest kid on the block is changing the game.\nSony Alpha a7RII\nRs. 2,39,990 onwards\nSony claims this is the world’s first 42.4-megapixel back-illuminated 35mm full-frame sensor. So the images the camera captures will pretty much have no parallel, at least in this price bracket. Extremely fast-focus speeds and five-axis stabilization take care of the variables that tend to spoil a lot of photographs. Its range is ISO 100-25600, but that can be enhanced to ISO 50-102400 for still images in low-light conditions—the higher the usable ISO, the better the detailing without distortions. This camera has a magnesium body and works with a variety of Sony E-mount lenses.\nTHE UNIQUE CAMERA\nThis camera is different from the usual ones in terms of design and features. And travellers will appreciate its will to survive the cold in the mountains as easily as the moisture by the seaside.\nRicoh THETA m15\nRs. 34,770\nClick here for enlarge The camera has lenses both on the front and back, allowing you to take 360-degree spherical panoramic images and videos. The two images clicked at the same time are automatically stitched together. You can also use the THETA app (free download for Android and iOS) to click images if you have propped up the camera somewhere. It weighs just 95g and offers 4 GB of storage space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:11:06.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
