Their general vibe was that changes will be needed to improve the way that super, pensions, property and tax works in our ageing population.\nHere’s a quick look at some of their key ideas.\nSCRAP ALL SUPERANNUATION CONCESSIONS\nSalary sacrifice would go. So would low or zero tax rates on super for savers and retirees. This would deliver the Federal Government billions of dollars but would lead to lots of squawking among those who use these strategies to build bigger nest eggs.\nFuture of super ...

Source: Supplied\nCEDA says that removing the superannuation tax concessions would bring super in line with property, the other big asset that Australians use to build wealth.\nTAX DEDUCTIONS FOR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS\nAnother way of giving super and property the same tax treatment, CEDA says, is to hand people a tax deduction for their mortgage repayments.\nHowever, that’s not its preferred solution, largely because governments are already struggling to balance budgets so they don’t need to throw billions of extra dollars peoples’ way through new tax deductions.\nFAMILY HOME INCLUDED IN PENSION ASSETS TESTS\nMany people get cranky that under the current laws, you can live in a $3 million mansion and still collect the age pension.\nIf the family home eventually does lose its exempt status for pension assets tests, there will probably be tiers in place so that only the component of a property above $1 million or above the median house price or similar will count towards it. Winners and losers ... Many people get cranky that under the current laws, you can live in a $3 million mansion and still collect the age pension. Picture: Supplied. Source: News Limited\nSUPER AS A HOUSE DEPOSIT\nThis idea always sparks spirited debate. The super industry says it’s bad because it could dramatically shrink people’s retirement savings, while the property and mortgage industries love it.\nI find it hard to understand how it would help a twenty-something saver — whose super typically averages between $5000 and $15000 — pay for much more than the transaction costs of getting their foot into the property door.\nINCREASE SUPER PRESERVATION AGE\nMost Australians haven’t been able to get their hands on their super before age 55, although the goalposts are currently moving to 60, and it may go higher.\nGovernments will need to be careful about this, because lifting the super preservation age to 65 or 67 would deter many people in their 30s, 40s and 50s from stashing extra cash in super.\nRemember that these are just ideas being put forward by experts, not laws drafted by our politicians, but they are likely to help shape political thinking over the coming decades.\nSo for the moment, the pigeons are safe. Famous Aussie pigeons Wendy and Wendy Junior would be happy to hear that.\nHowever, always be watchful for signs of governments stalking your retirement savings.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.ceda.com.au/", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552&title=Super+suggestions+ignite+debate", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Super+suggestions+ignite+debate&c=A+CAT+was+thrown+among+the+pigeons+in+the+superannuation+world+as+suggestions+for+change+got+some+people+in+a+flap.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552&title=Super+suggestions+ignite+debate", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/superannuation/cats-pigeons-and-the-future-of-your-superannuation-savings/story-e6frfmdi-1227514236222?sv=605aa94fbf8c1450288b33ed8c11d552&h=Super+suggestions+ignite+debate", "http://www.ricewarner.com/", "https://www.actuaries.asn.au/"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T03:02:11.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
