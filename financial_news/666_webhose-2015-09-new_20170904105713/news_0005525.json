But once you begin getting settled in, those emotions start to fade away a little. However, settling in requires figuring out a lot of different things. Is there a dress code? Who should you make sure you know in upper management? Is there kitchen etiquette you're forgetting? You know, all the most important things.One factor of your new job you'll definitely want to spend some time learning about is its 401(k) plan. Even if you're just starting your career as a twenty-something, it's never too early to start investing in your retirement - after all, the money you invest now will have years longer to accrue interest than what you start contributing in 10 years. But investing in retirement plans and understanding them are two different things entirely.

Companies typically offer one of two kinds of retirement plans: a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k). The difference? In traditional plans, the money is deducted from your paycheck pre-tax, which means you won't lose quite as much each paycheck. However, you will have to pay taxes when you make withdrawals from the account as a retiree.A Roth plan is a reverse of that. The money will be deducted post-tax, but you won't have to pay any when you withdraw decades from now. Many companies actually offer both types of accounts-- it may be worth it to consider investing in both. If your company offers a different type of retirement plan altogether, make sure someone clearly explains it to you. When Can I Start to Contribute? The best time to start contributing to your retirement is right now. If you work in a large company, it's possible you'll be automatically enrolled in its 401(k) program, or an HR manager may have you sign up independently. If it's the latter, get started as soon as possible.On the other hand, your new job may require employees to work there for a certain time period before they're able to contribute to a retirement account. While that's not exactly ideal, make sure you're on top of getting started as soon as you're allowed to. How Much Am I Allowed to Contribute? There are actually legal limits to how much people are allowed to contribute to retirement in a certain amount of time. This will depend on how old you are and sometimes the company for which you work. Ask an HR representative if the company enacts limitations, and aim for the highest contribution you'll be able to afford right now, even if it's just 2-3%. Will You Match My Contributions? If your company matches contributions, that's an amazing bonus (who wouldn't want free money?). But unfortunately, companies aren't always able to afford that, especially if you work in a small business or startup. While you should be investing in an account either way, it doesn't hurt to ask what the match is. What Are My Investment Options ? Typically, you'll be able to choose between a number of different types of investments, depending on what your company's program offers. This will include things like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds-- stocks are often more aggressive, whereas mutual funds are a bit more conservative.Most financial advisors agree that the younger you are, the more worth it it is to invest aggressively-- if you lose money now, you'll have a lot more time to make a comeback. What Are the Fees Like? Many investment options come with a number of fees that are all rolled into what's called an \"expense ratio.\" Basically, the expense ratio is a certain amount of money taken from your account each year to cover operating expenses. It's a good idea to ask about the expense ratio associated with each type of investment offered, but don't let that make your decision for you, necessarily.Even if a long-term mutual fund has a higher expense ratio, you still may make more money off of it years down the line than a shorter-term stock option with a lower expense ratio. At What Point Will I Become Vested? Whatever money you contribute to your retirement plans will be yours to keep no matter how long you work at a company. However, if your company is matching your contribution, you may have to work there for a certain amount of time before that money is yours-- that's called becoming vested.So, if you quit or switch jobs before you're vested, you'd lose out on those contributions (but you'd still keep your own). What Happens If I Switch Jobs? Speaking of switching jobs, make sure you understand the process you'll have to go through if you do start working somewhere else. Often, 401(k) plans can simply roll over from one company to another, but depending on where you work and where you may work in the future, you also might have to roll your money into an IRA. It's worth understanding this now, so you know what to plan for down the road. When Can I Withdraw From My Account? Retirement plans usually can't be withdrawn from without fees until you reach 59.5 years old, according to federal law. However, there are some life events you may go through that make you eligible to make a penalty-free withdrawal, including things like buying a house or paying for a funeral. Have your company explain this process to you as well. Understanding your company's 401(k) offerings is a very important first step to contributing to your retirement confidently, so don't be afraid to ask questions!", "external_links": ["http://www.rent.com/blog/should-you-start-saving-for-retirement/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/legit-apartment-money-saving-tricks/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/saving-for-retirement/"], "published": "2015-09-24T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:22:56.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
