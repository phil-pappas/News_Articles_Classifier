Am I correct? Depending on the Government on Oct. 19, this seems to be the depending factor. Seniors are the group of citizens who always seem to get fleeced. Has anyone heard what may be in the policies of the three parties as far as any benefits to Seniors. I haven’t even heard the word SENIORS mentioned by any of the three candidates. Reply bigcajunman September 27, 2015, 5:21 PM \nHaven’t heard that, however, the CRA is watching TFSA accounts closely to make sure folks are not speculating too much in them, but haven’t heard that one. Reply Robert Champion November 13, 2014, 9:31 AM \nAs your three scenarios demonstrate, it is impossible to forecast how much tax revenue the federal government will lose as a result of TFSA’s. \nAnother perspective to consider: the TFSA was created because the government was concerned that Canadians were not saving enough to fund their retirements. If folks save more, they may be less dependent on a range of government programs. This could result in saving for governments at all levels. Reply bigcajunman November 13, 2014, 9:38 AM \nVery true, and given many Canadians have not picked up on this savings vehicle, how much could really be lost? ron December 28, 2013, 1:53 PM \nIf the gov’t were losing money, they would quickly find a way to change the rules. Bet Crooks December 11, 2013, 10:50 AM \nI agree. \nAnd if some people use their TFSAs successfully and save some money in it combined with some income, hopefully it should reduce the number of people falling into welfare programs especially as they age. That also saves the government some $$. \nI’m sure there are some investing magicians who will use the TFSA to protect enormous sums from taxes. But they would have just found some other way to do the same thing without the TFSAs so I think their impact on the tax stream is negligible. Reply Matt December 11, 2013, 10:30 AM \nI don’t think that TFSAs are going to cost the government all that much in potential tax revenue and here is my thinking: 1. There are caps on how much money you can put in so per person this amount is relatively small not to mention how many people are actually taking advantage of TFSAs? 2. Your argument is 100% valid, most investments aren’t going to make you any really significant returns and once you tax those in the long term the amounts aren’t going to be that significant. 3. If it was that detrimental to making money do you think they would still exist? while the minister of finance might not be an accountant or economist but people the governor of the bank of Canada is (among other people). If this was really going to hurt the government someone would have said this was a bad idea. \nAt the end of the day, I think most people don’t use TFSA’s and I would hazard a guess and say a lot of people don’t even know what they are. This is an investment vehicle that can be beneficial but doesn’t have to be and a smart investor will take advantage of it over the long term (but how many will?) jane savers @ solving the money puzzle December 11, 2013, 10:27 AM \nI don’t think the government needs to worry about losing tax revenue from TFSA investments. Most people don’t understand TFSAs and aren’t making much money on them anyway. \nIf they are investing the money is going in to mutual funds with high management fees and so the government came make money taxing the investment salespeople who call themselves investment advisers. Reply Greg December 11, 2013, 9:27 AM \n“Am I missing the point here, is the TFSA going to cripple the government by having Canadians not paying taxes on their investing growth?” \nI don’t think you are missing anything. Cutting the GST dwarfs TFSAs in terms of tax revenue reductions. Any smart economist would say reducing personal income taxes would be a better than GST cuts or TFSAs.
