Philip Gostelow by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Woodside Petroleum is sizing up its ability to raise more debt to fund a sweetened bid for rival Oil Search, sources told Street Talk on Thursday.\nIt is thought Woodside is seeking straight bridge financing although sources said the situation remained fluid.\nWhile Woodside's $11.6 billion bid for Oil Search was formally rebuffed on Monday , it was widely regarded as an opening salvo with the company's advisers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Gresham, straight on the phones to Oil Search investors on Tuesday.\nWoodside boss Peter Coleman is hedging his bets.\nSources have told Street-Talk that Woodside has gained access to the Santos dataroom with a focus on its 13.5 per cent stake in the lucrative Papua New Guinea LNG project, although they noted it was one of many parties running the ruler over the assets.\nWoodside was attracted to Oil Search for its 29 per cent stake in PNG LNG along with a planned expansion train and the prospective Papua LNG development.\nWhile Santos' balance sheet remains under huge pressure, its PNG assets will not come cheap.\nThe Oil Search bid implies Santos' stake in the project is worth $6.5 billion, a staggering half of its $13.7 billion enterprise value.\n But given Santos is a willing seller, Woodside's robust balance sheet may give it a strong position at the negotiating table.\nThere is one snag. Both Oil Search and ExxonMobil, the joint venture owners of PNG LNG, hold pre-emption rights to Santos' stake in the project should there be any change of control of its shareholding.\nThat means Oil Search boss Peter Botten, who is said to be keeping an eagle eye on the Santos process, could foil Woodside's PNG pitch simply by matching its offer.\nIt's why many in the market think Coleman may ultimately need a Plan C: bidding for New York listed Interoil, a major player in PNG with a far more digestable market cap of just $US1.7 billion.\nElsewhere, exploration minnow Segue Resources has struck a deal with a cashed-up investor - sources pointed to copper miner MMG - willing to spend on exploration at its Plumridge nickel project.\nThe Australian-managed but Chinese-owned miner is thought to have agreed to cover exploration costs for five years over about three quarters of Segue's tenement holding at Plumridge.\nMMG's bid to throw more resources, both financial and technical, at the minnow's expansive tenement holding in the highly prospective Fraser Range in Western Australia is understood to be its first foray into the region.\nEver since highly-regarded nickel play Sirius Resources discovered its Nova project in 2012, expectations other players would strike on similar finds in the region have been met with little success.\n​.​\nMMG is the publicly traded arm of Chinese state-owned miner China Minmetals, with a single listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:12:02.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
