The firm will release the survey’s results to participants this month. Exclusive to Longnecker & Associates, the two-part survey provides a comprehensive assessment of employee compensation across core midstream competencies. Designed for top executive and key technical positions in the midstream industry, the survey covers incentives like philosophy and pay practices, target and actual compensation, and vehicle design and prevalence. With nearly 30 years in the compensation consultancy industry, the firm created this survey to help companies discover how market-competitive salaries and targeted incentive compensation can help them maintain a competitive advantage. Since compensation surveys are known for being cumbersome, Longnecker & Associates administered the survey through its proprietary method that’s intuitive and streamlined.\n“This is the second year of our midstream industry compensation survey. As the socio-economic and regulatory environment has changed, the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating talent has only increased,” said Brent Longnecker, chairman and CEO of Longnecker & Associates. “At Longnecker & Associates, we know first and foremost that the midstream industry has great leaders at both the executive and board levels, and this survey is a great tool that will assist them in that regard.”\nAlthough the survey is now closed, interested and qualified parties have the opportunity to participate in the survey next year. Qualified parties include organizations whose operations include the transportation, storage and wholesale marketing of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Participants are expected to answer questions about their organizations’ incentives and are asked to provide compensation data associated with specific positions. The survey’s run dates are typically between May and June, and results are available to participants only.
