Manufacturing drives around 10pc of UK gross domestic output. \nThe survey also showed businesses expect average prices to fall further in the next quarter, to the greatest extent since August 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:41:13.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
