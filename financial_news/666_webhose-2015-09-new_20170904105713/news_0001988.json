When tracking market pricing, recency is everything. \"In addition to improved update frequency, we have an expanded equipment coverage beyond any existing agriculture valuation providers,\" said Rebecca Fowler, Industry Analyst. \"Whether it's sprayers, planters or balers, we have the best coverage for non self-propelled equipment.\" Available gratis to all existing valuation product subscribers immediately, the agriculture values product is now in the hands of hundreds of leading equipment finance and insurance companies, along with hundreds more equipment dealers.
