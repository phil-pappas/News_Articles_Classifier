In December US authorities extended their monitoring of the bank's sanctions compliance by three years, partly due to \"possible historical violations\" of US sanctions laws that took place after 2007. \nThe FT said on Monday it had seen documents suggesting that after the 2012 settlement Standard Chartered \"was still internally reviewing its client list and was unable to determine in certain cases whether customers were Iranian or not.\" \nThe newspaper said it had identified transactions involving Iran that could put the bank at risk of severe penalties ranging from further fines to suspension or loss of its crucial US dollar clearing licence. \nStandard Chartered was not immediately available to comment. The FT quoted the bank as saying following its decision to close its Iranian business in 2007 it had \"a number of legacy obligations including dormant accounts, outstanding loans and trade-finance agreements. Those legacy obligations have been handled in an appropriate manner in non-US currencies and since 2007 it has been the group's policy not to pursue any new business with known Iranian entities.\" \nThe bank has said it is cooperating with the investigations by US authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T11:34:12.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
