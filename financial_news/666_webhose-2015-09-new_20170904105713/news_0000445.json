It should also be commercially exploited for the good of Malawi and its people,\" she said. \nClarke added that Malawi must diversify and find complementary crops to tobacco and that it should also help create jobs and rural development of the country. \n\"Industrial hemp is a crop that has extremely exciting economic potential and support the national Export Strategy of oil seed cluster in Malawi. There is a large potential in the raw products such as construction, cosmetics, food stuffs and medicine. \nIndustrial hemp also known as 'ihemp' is in line with the green belt initiative to help achieve the goal called 'green chuma'. \nAccording to Clarke, Invegrow Limited (ltd) is a Malawian companies with an exciting new business plan to trial cultivate and process products from the variety of cannabis known as industrial hemp. \nConcurring with her is a South African industrial hemp expert, Tony Budden who urged Malawians to separate industrial hemp from Indian hemp that people use to smoke. \n\"People should know that there are a number of varieties of hemps and industrial hemp is a type that is used for production and that it has a very low drug variety to make one go high,\" he said. \nBudden further said the hemp is meant for a variety of production such as construction of buildings, textile and food stuff. \nCommenting on the same, a participant of the meeting Eisenhower Mkaka who represented Malawi Congress Party said that there is a lot to benefit economically from this industrial hemp since it is not harmful at all. \n\"I have seen ranges of products made from this industrial hemp and it could be one way of graduating from tobacco which is not doing well in the market,\" Mkaka explained. \nHe also said it is going to be a long term to be sustained economically but if engaged in the industrial hemp the country could grow economically through export. \nMalawi has since shown interest to start research in order to identify a variety that has low drug variety to start growing.
