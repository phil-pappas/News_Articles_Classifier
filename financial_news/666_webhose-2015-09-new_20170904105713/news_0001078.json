The last significantly large financial penalty against a bank was in June 2015,” said Mary Stevens from Wolters Kluwer Financial Services. \nThe fine Ms Stevens referred to was a £117.4m penalty handed to Lloyds Banking (Xetra: 871784 - news ) Group. \nThe banking sector has received 93pc of all fines given out by the FCA so far. \n“With just three months of the year remaining, it is not unreasonable to assume that 2015 will not breach the record level of fines issued in 2014.” \nMs Stevens expects the slowdown to continue as the FCA goes through a change of leadership. \nWhen the regulator launched, it was keen to show the industry that it represented a change from the approach of the old Financial Services Authority the FCA’s founding chief executive, Martin Wheatley, initially said he planned to “shoot first and ask questions later.” \nMr Wheatley left the FCA this month after being sacked by Chancellor George Osborne , who signalled he wanted a “different approach” from the watchdog. \n“It is widely believed that his early exit was as a result of Mr Osborne’s determination to win back the trust of the banking sector, who saw Mr Wheatley as a threat and not helped by his initial comments about punishing firms first before asking questions,” Ms Stevens said. \nThe FCA is currently being run by former enforcement boss Tracey McDermott, but she has only been given the top job on an interim basis. \nWhile the FCA may not be handing out as many fines, it is considering whether or not banks need to give more compensation to customers over the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal. \nOfficials are reviewing the case of a bank customer, Mrs Plevin, who won a court case arguing that her lender, Paragon Personal Finance, had unfairly failed to declare the commission on the PPI sale. \nThe regulators could order banks to compensate customers over similar commission payments, which could add substantial sums to the £24bn bill already incurred by the sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T23:19:00.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
