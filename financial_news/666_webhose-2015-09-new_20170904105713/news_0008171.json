The paper provides clarity on what a real-time payment is by exploring what real time means, outlining the challenges to implementing real time, and identifying major use cases and user impact.\n“Real time has the potential to drastically change the way consumers and businesses make payments and interact with their financial institutions,” said George Throckmorton, managing director, Advanced Payments Solutions at NACHA.\n“This paper seeks to bring the concept of real time to real life by informing the industry globally on the realities of deploying a real-time payment system and the benefits and opportunities a real-time system can provide to various users,” Throckmorton said.\nThe paper was released as part of the Payments Innovation Alliance’s Members Meeting , which is going on now through Oct. 1 in Miami. The Members Meeting features discussion of a variety of payments-related topics , including sessions dedicated to real-time and faster payments initiatives such as Same Day ACH. Same Day ACH, a new amendment to the NACHA Operating Rules that will move payments faster on the ACH Network, can serve as complementary functionality to any real-time payments system that is implemented in the U.S.\nLaunched last year, The Alliance is a membership group of more than 200 member organizations from throughout the payments ecosystem and around the globe that encourages industry dialogue and collaboration to help advance domestic and global payments.\nTo download a copy of the “Real Time in Real Life” white paper, visit nacha.org .\nAbout the Payments Innovation Alliance\nThe Payments Innovation Alliance brings together diverse, global stakeholders to support payments innovation, collaboration, and results through discussion, debate, education, networking, and special projects that support the ACH Network and the payments industry worldwide.
