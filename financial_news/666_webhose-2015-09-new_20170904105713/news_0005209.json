Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates The four major banks will be pressured to cut their dividends in the next three years, Citi analysts predict, citing a likely deterioration in charges for bad loans that will force lenders to retain a bigger share of profits.\nAnalysts Craig Williams, Brendan Sproules and Andrew Tam argue a combination of tougher regulation and a slide in credit quality means banks' dividends must be \"significantly lower\" over the longer term.\nWhile they say recent efforts by banks to raise capital have \"bought time,\" they forecast all of the major banks will cut dividends in 2018.\nOver the last two decades the share of profits paid out as dividends by Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac and ANZ Bank has been on a \"relentless upward journey,\" the note says.\nDividends payout ratios are likely heading towards 80 per cent next financial year.\nHowever, the analysts argue this has left \"very low\" levels of capital on the banks' balance sheets, and they predict boards will eventually lower dividend payout ratios to a more \"sustainable\" level of between 60 per cent and 70 per cent.\n\"On a 3-year view, we expect all the major banks to cut dividends,\" the note said.\n\"Major banks' dividend payout ratios appear headed towards 80 per cent following the issue of a substantial number of new shares to fund higher mortgage risk weights,\" it said.\n However, it said deteriorating credit quality would lead to a \"dramatic increase in the amount of cash earnings that needs to be retained to support changes in balance sheet growth and risk\".\nResponding to rules designed to make banks safer, the major banks issued new stock to raise more than $15 billion from shareholders this year.\nIf banks continue to pay out the same dividends at a time of soft profit growth, this will push up dividend payout ratios, which the analysts say are heading towards 80 per cent in 2016.\nThey argue bank boards should tackle \"unsustainably high\" dividends directly, rather than shorter-term responses, such as slowing their loan growth or increasing take-up of dividend reinvestment plans.\nThe argument stands in contrast to UBS analyst Jonathan Mott's view that the $20 billion a year the major banks pay in dividends is reasonably safe if Australia's economic situation worsens slightly .\nBell Potter analyst TS Lim also said in a recent note that major bank dividends had only been cut on three occasions in the last 37 years, and a \"benign\" economic outlook suggested the sectors' dividends were sustainable.\nDespite the Citi analysts' expectations of dividend cuts, they said the dividend yield on major bank shares still looked attractive even after a cut in the payout to shareholders.\nCiti's analysts forecast National Australia Bank will keep full-year dividends flat at $1.98 a share for the next two financial years before cutting to $1.68 in 2018.\nThey forecast Commonwealth Bank would cut its dividend to $3.64 in 2018, compared with $4.20 in the last full year; they forecast Westpac's would be cut to $1.69 a share, compared with $1.82 in the last full year; and ANZ would cut its dividend to $1.64 a share in the 2018 financial year, compared with $1.78 in the last full-year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042"], "published": "2015-09-21T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:11:21.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
