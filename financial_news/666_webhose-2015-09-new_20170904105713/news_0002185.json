U.S. crude traded at $44.31 a barrel, off $1.62.\nOil is a major export for Canada and the slump in prices has hit the economy, putting it into a mild recession in the first half of the year. Energy shares make up about 30 percent of the TSX.\nAt 10:21 a.m. EDT (1421 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 94.98 points, or 0.7 percent, at 13,474.91. Seven of the TSX's 10 main groups were lower.\nOil companies were among the biggest drags on the index, with Suncor Energy inc down 2 percent at C$34.32 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd declining 3.3 percent to C$26.65.\nThe overall energy group retreated 2.7 percent, while stocks of other natural resources companies also fell, including Goldcorp, down 1.9 percent at C$16.47.\nShares of Dollarama Inc gave up early gains to trade slightly lower after the discount retailer posted a better-than-expected increase in quarterly profit and sales. A number of firms raised their price target for Dollarama on Friday morning. Dollarama edged down 0.1 percent at C$85.46 (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:59:23.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
