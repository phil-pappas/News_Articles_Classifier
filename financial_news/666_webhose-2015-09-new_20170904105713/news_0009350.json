ESCB reports that introducing such requirements in EMIR would not be appropriate and that the existing legal framework is adequate for ensuring effective CCP access to central bank facilities. The current framework is such that national central banks are free to provide CCPs with access to central bank facilities when they deem this to be appropriate with regard to their mandates.
