In case you think justice has finally been served, think again. From the moment General Motors announced last year that it was recalling defective ignition switches from its cars, it has managed one of the worst auto-safety scandals ever with steely-eyed cynicism. And now the strategy appears to have paid off. \nBarra's first appearance at a congressional hearing, last July, was a display of rhetorical evasion that earned  a Saturday Night Live send-up . GM successfully endured subsequent hearings by holding out an  \"independent\" report by a lawyer , Anton Valukas, whose firm has had  a business relationship with GM  since at least 2010.\nNow the company has \"accepted accountability\" in exchange for a relatively modest $900 million settlement with the Department of Justice. And with one of the worst scandals in automotive history now largely behind it, it's tough to argue that GM's strategy hasn't worked depressingly well.\nThe most obvious example of the company's success was that it was able to settle with the the government for less than the $1.2 billion Toyota paid for its 2010 \"sudden unintended acceleration\" scandal.\nToyota's then-record fine was for a supposed defect that still has never been proved or even actually identified.  The \"expert witnesses\"  supporting the alleged victims who testified at congressional hearings gave an explanation that defied basic mechanical logic. Investigations  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA's Engineering and Safety Center ultimately found that the vast majority of the problems had been  largely caused by \"pedal misapplication \" -- that is, drivers hitting the accelerator when they meant to brake. The most concrete failing by the company was that it was slow to try address a situation whose alleged cause rotated between sticky pedals, moving floor mats and a wide variety of even less-plausible threats.\nIn short, Toyota paid more in federal fines for dragging its heels on an imaginary problem than GM did for a defect its testers first noticed in 2004 and which has  killed or injured 398 people  by the firm's own admission. \nGM's favorable treatment is being justified by prosecutors on the strength of its \"extraordinary cooperation\" with their investigation. What's not clear is what GM actually did to cooperate, besides sharing the results of the Valukas investigation, the accuracy of which has been called into question by  New York Times reporting  and Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who called it \" the best report money could buy .\" \n\nAs Barra  explained it in a tweet on Thursday,  \"the Valukas report was reviewed by the AG and the fact that we dealt with issues in a compassionate way was a good step.\" I am not a lawyer, but hiring one of your own to investigate your lethal negligence seems more like retaining a defense attorney than cooperating with prosecutors. GM has successfully  fought to conceal  all of Valukas's notes on his investigation, even as lawyers representing GM victims   pursue \"crime-fraud\" exceptions to attorney-client privilege .\nNot that any of this has stopped Barra from claiming that transparency, accountability and \"culture change\" are the order of the day at The New GM. Not only is it \"complying with all laws,\" according to Barra,  \"GM is a different company\"  as a result of the scandal. Leaving aside the fact that every GM CEO has uttered some variation of those words since the 1970s, Barra's claim of transformation stands at odds with this summer's revelation that the NHTSA had to force GM  to recall Hummer SUVs over fire risk , and that similar fires have been reported  in still-unrecalled trucks . Additionally, about 40 percent of the defective ignition switches were still  unrepaired as of April of this year , and  several GM dealers  have  been caught selling unrepaired recalled vehicles . Barra's culture change has turned out to be exactly as much as you'd expect from someone who has never worked outside of General Motors.\nAs for accountability, GM's top managers are now  compensated based in part  on a metric which takes recall-related costs out of the firm's performance, meaning their bonuses are being calculated as if the scandal had never happened. If that's Barra's version of accountability, it's no wonder a Harris poll this year found that GM was the second-most-hated company in America,  behind Goldman Sachs.\nHaving rewarded GM's decades of mismanagement with a bailout, the government has now responded to its lethal negligence with an astounding lack of consequences. Once upon a time, GM was a symbol of American pride. Now, after decades of market-share loss, a public bailout, and a dishonest PR campaign to avoid the consequences of the ignition-switch episode, GM is unmistakably a symbol of American decline.  \nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\nEdward Niedermeyer at edward.niedermeyer@gmail.com \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.net \nEdward Niedermeyer, an auto-industry consultant, is the co-founder of Daily Kanban and the former editor of the blog The Truth About Cars.
