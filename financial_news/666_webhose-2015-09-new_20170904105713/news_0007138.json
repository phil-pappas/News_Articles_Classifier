But now two Swedish inventors claim to have designed a laser-powered shaving tool that obliterates the chance of accidental cutting, irritation and expensive cartridge replacements. \nTheir futuristic creation, the Skarp Razor, is simply waved over a piece of skin and the razor cuts the hair to skin level, giving an \"incredibly close shave \". \nThe bladeless razor, made of aluminium, can last for around 50,000 hours, and it runs on a single re-chargeable AAA battery. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is designed for both men and women, and the creators say it will shave any area without irritation. \nThe razor, which is supported by a patent, can be used without water. \nUnlike some other laser products, the hair removal isn't permanent. The razor doesn't emit UV and the laser doesn't enter the skin, only the hair. Its creators say this means there is no risk of developing any complications or damage. \nThe founders are already pioneers in the field of laser hair treatment. Co-founder Morgan Gustavsson invented IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) in 1989, which is still the method used in many hair removal and dermatology treatments today. \nHaving spent five years testing the product, the pair are now ready for mass production and have turned to crowdfunding website Kickstarter to raise the money . \nOriginally, they hoped to raise $160,000, but they hit that goal within 48 hours and now more than $1m has been pledged, with 19 days to go. \nMr Gustavsson had the idea for a laser razor in 2001. However, laser technology at the time was not advanced enough to deal with light hair colours. With his business partner Paul Binun, he spent the next decade investigating and made a breakthrough in 2009 when he discovered a wavelength that could cut any hair colour. \nThe razor is estimated to be available from March and will cost around $159 (£105), plus shipping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:33:31.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
