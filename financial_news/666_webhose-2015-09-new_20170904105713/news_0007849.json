These loans for many are still being paid off—and at an exorbitant cost.\n“It’s not just students—what about regular, hard-working Americans who have suffered through the rocky waves of the financial crisis?” said Bob Harry, CEO of Debt Consolidation. “While we certainly agree with Clinton’s assertion that refinancing at a lower rate is good for society, we feel that this should refocused towards all who are suffering under a debt and finding it difficult to eliminate.”\nDebt Consolidation works nationwide to help Americans to consolidate their debts into one refinanced monthly payment, taking away much of the stress of multiple bills and instead delivering one simple bill—and a better road toward debt elimination and the dream of many: financial freedom.\nFor more information about Debt Consolidation, visit http://www.reducemydebt.fla or call up (561) 412-1856 today.\nAbout Debt Consolidation\nDebt Consolidation is a new website that has been designed to help consumers experiencing financial issues to consolidate their outstanding debts into one manageable debt for easier loan elimination, leading back to a healthier financial future.
