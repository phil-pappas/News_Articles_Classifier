The doodle, which features on Google’s homepage, shows a retro, plastic PC, lava lamp and even 1998’s “Google!” logo. There are two helium filled balloons that mark the festive occasion. There is a groovy green lava lamp on the right side of the desk. The web link to the doodle takes you automatically to the search “When is Google’s birthday”.\nToday, the 27th day of September is being celebrated as the 17th birthday of the search giant with the short text answer reading, “The Google doodle for its 4th birthday is dated September 27 but the 5th birthday doodle was on September 8, a year later it becomes September 7, followed by September 26 for its 7th birthday.”\nHowever, not even Google seems to really know when it was formed. Since 2006, it has celebrated its birthday on September 27, but the year before that, had it as September 26.\nIn 2004, its 6th birthday Doodle went online on September 7 and in the year before that, it was September 8.\nGoogle has celebrated its birthday with a Doodle every year since its fourth birthday in 2002.\n 27, 2015 11:38 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T00:30:08.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
