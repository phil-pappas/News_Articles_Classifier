We have also witnessed disastrous accidents such as the Three Miles Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima. Many countries are shifting away from this disastrous form of energy to cleaner, cheaper and sustainable energy. \nEarthlife Africa,South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) and Clairwood Racecourse Action Committee invite you to a Nuclear energy seminar on Thursday 3rd September 2015 at the Austerville Community Hall at 5pm. \nWe will be having Vladimir Slavyak as the key speaker.

He has been campaigning against nuclear energy for 25 years. He is also the author of 'From Hiroshima to Fukushima' which chronicles the 2011 Japanese nuclear catastrophe at Fukushima Daiichi and describes the Russian nuclear industry's lack of preparedness for similar accidents. He has also written over 300 articles on environmental and energy issues, which have been published in both the Russian and international media. \nThe future lies in our hands... . Let's all fight against this noxious proposed development that will cripple our communities and country. \nDate: Thursday 03 September 2015 \nVenue: Austerville Community Hall \nFor more information please call: \nThando - 031 4611991/ Thando@sdceango.co.za \nDesmond - 083 982 6939 / desmond@sdceango.co.za \nRoshan -0843063267/ ramdheenr@telkomsa.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:27:40.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
