Announces That Teamsters Ratify New NETTI Agreement Non-Cash Charge to be Recognized in Fiscal Fourth Quarter September 25, 2015 16:15 ET | Source: Star Gas Partners, L.P. \nSTAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 25,   Star Gas Partners, L.P. (the \"Partnership\" or \"Star\") (NYSE: SGU ), a home energy distributor and services provider, today announced that the Teamsters have ratified an agreement among certain Star subsidiaries and the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (the \"NETTI Fund\"), a multiemployer pension plan in which such Star subsidiaries participate, providing for Star's participating subsidiaries to withdraw from the NETTI Fund's original employer pool and enter the NETTI Fund's new employer pool. The withdrawal from the original employer pool triggered an undiscounted withdrawal liability of $48.0 million that is to be paid in equal monthly installments over 30 years, or $1.6 million per year. The estimated annual after-tax cash impact of entering into this agreement is $0.9 million. \nStar expects to record, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a non-cash charge in order to establish a withdrawal liability of approximately $17.8 million on its consolidated balance sheet, representing the present value of the $48.0 million future payment obligation at a discount rate of 8.22%. In addition, Star will record a non-cash deferred tax benefit of approximately $7.4 million. The net result of these two non-cash items is expected to reduce net income for fiscal 2015 by $10.4 million. \nThe NETTI Fund includes over two hundred of Star's current employees and has been classified as carrying \"red zone\" status, meaning that the value of NETTI Fund's assets are less than 65% of the actuarial value of the NETTI Fund's benefit obligations. The Partnership believes that the agreement has benefits for both Star Gas and the affected employees, including: The original employer pool of the NETTI Fund has historically had, and would likely continue to have, funding challenges; this represented a risk of Star having to face higher future contribution requirements and increased withdrawal liability, as well as a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those current and former Star Gas employees who participate in the NETTI Fund. The Partnership believes the 30-year fixed payment obligation reduces the risk of significantly higher future contribution requirements, including those already stipulated in the NETTI Fund's current rehabilitation plan. It also reduces the risk of future increases in the amount of the withdrawal liability the Partnership would incur upon any voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from the NETTI Fund if Star were to remain in the original employer pool. Star believes the new employer pool provides better protections for participating employers. This pool uses a direct-attribution methodology for calculating any potential future withdrawal liability, which is designed to minimize the risk of future withdrawal liability and exposure to any unfunded vested benefit liabilities attributable to other participating employers. Additionally, this pool contains provisions designed to maintain its fully-funded status. \nAbout Star Gas Partners, L.P. \nStar Gas Partners, L.P. is a full service provider specializing in the sale of home heating products and services to residential and commercial customers to heat their homes and buildings.
