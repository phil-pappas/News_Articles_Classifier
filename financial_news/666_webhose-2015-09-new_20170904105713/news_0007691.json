The majority of the highly paid bankers were based in the U.K, at 63%.\nAs a result, the metric is heavily influenced by the exchange rate between the euro and the pound sterling.\nEBA, Number of high earners by Member State (values shown refer to 2013; logarithmic scale) The U.K, in particular, unsuccessfully resisted the European parliament’s reforms aimed at capping bonuses at 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. The trend toward parity is likely to continue following implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV) in 2014, the EU law that introduced the so called ‘bonus cap’.\nThe EBA report says the approach toward deferred bonuses and other compensation tools such as severance packages differed significantly across the EU and individual banks. All EU countries are still working toward achieving consistency in the design of pay plans, so that the metrics reflect the numbers and trends accurately in the future.\nThe 2014 figures will not be released until the end of 2015.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.eba.europa.eu/-/eba-updates-on-remuneration-practices-and-high-earners-data-for-2013-across-the-eu"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:26:01.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
