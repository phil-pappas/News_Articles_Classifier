She also has about $2000 in an accumulation managed fund with GESB (a Western Australian Government super fund).\nWith her compulsory 4 per cent pension drawdown and a pension that I receive, we are in the happy position of receiving more cash than we need.\nI need a plan to put this money to good use, which is legal, provides a good financial return, allow funds to be withdrawn when necessary and is simple.\nTo this end will you please comment on the following:\n1 Combine the SMSF accumulation funds with the pension fund.\n2 Leave things as they are and contribute excess cash to my wife's GESB accumulation account until she turns 65 then withdraw from this account tax-free after she turns 65.\n3 Clean things up a bit and withdraw the $34,000 from the SMSF environment and deposit them in my wife's GESB account.\n Any other suggestion and/or advice appreciated.\nRegards, David\nWell done for getting yourselves set up for life. Excess cash flow is indeed a wonderful problem to have. Nevertheless, let's look at a few options for you.\nIn the first instance, while your wife is still under 65 and eligible to contribute to super, I'd consider continuing to make non-concessional contributions of any excess funds to her accumulation account, either in the SMSF or GESB.\nI can never really understand why people hold funds outside of their SMSFs unless there's a specific reason, such as cheap insurance, or if she's still working and thus contributing. If it were me, I'd consolidate all accounts into the SMSF.\nYou can roll the $34,000 from your SMSF into the GESB account, or vice versa. You can also, sort of, combine your accumulation accounts with your pension accounts by starting a pension with the accumulation funds, but I wouldn't do that until your wife has made her final contributions to super, as the tax benefit of $34,000 in pension mode is immaterial at this stage.\nThings may also stay as they are for ever more, if desired, but consider that the fees paid on a low balance account may be a large percentage and worth rolling into your SMSF.\nDepending on your age and amount in super, there maybe an opportunity to make non-concessional contributions to your own fund to even up the account balances or \"future proof\" your super from potential changes to the rules or the taxes applying to large balances. But only do this if you have less in your account than your wife's account.\nIf you're over 65 and no longer working then this will not be possible, as you would need to meet the work test: working 40 hours in a consecutive 30-day period or one week in a month.\nIf you are over 65 and you have less than $1.158 million in assets, you may be eligible for an age pension if your wife's super is turned back into accumulation mode.\nThis is a common 'Centrelink strategy' we often use to boost income if there's an age discrepancy between partners. The person under the age pension age must have their super in the accumulation phase (non-pension drawdown phase). In this instance, you may be eligible for a part pension until your wife reaches age pension age, although you don't need the cash flow.\nFailing the super route, any excess cash will need to be accumulated outside of the super system where it will potentially be open to the whims of the income tax assessment act. In such an instance, I'd recommend investing in joint names or via a family trust, where you may have discretion about who the income is distributed to and when.\nThis can then be engineered by your accountant or adviser in such a manner as to avoid or lessen the tax burden for the family, remembering the tax free thresholds are $18,200 for each individual plus any benefits possibly gleaned from a Seniors Australian Tax Offset (SATO).\nOnce we have exhausted all the possible uses of potential structures, of which there are many to consider depending on your full circumstances, we can then consider where to invest the funds in such a way as to minimise your tax burden.\nFully franked shares may be helpful, as they will give you the potential to receive money back from your franking credit refund form (if you don't need a tax return). Consideration to a fully diversified portfolio of direct shares, property and fixed interest would satisfy the basic rules of investing.\nFinally, you need to think about your investment and the relationships between risk and return, volatility, liquidity, flexibility, diversity, security, tax, cost and of course the timing of your purchases.\nTo flip this entire comprehensive response on it's head, why not just exercise your right of discretion to implement a philanthropic strategy and give all your excess cash to a well deserving charity.\nFinancial planner and Henderson Maxwell chief executive Sam Henderson will be answering your questions while The Australian Financial Review's veteran DIY superannuation columnist John Wasiliev is on indefinite medical leave.
