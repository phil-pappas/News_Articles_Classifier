Lidl has been paying workers outside of London a minimum of 7.30 pounds an hour, while those in the capital get at least 8.03 pounds. \nThe new levels are above a compulsory \"national living wage\" which the British government is introducing next April for workers aged over 25. \nLidl said the pay rise will cost it an additional 9 million pounds a year. \nClothing retailer Next (NXT.L), Costa Coffee owner Whitbread (WTB.L) and pub chain Wetherspoon's (JDW.L) have all warned about the higher costs stemming from the government's wage policy. \nLast month Sainsbury's awarded store staff a 4 percent pay rise, taking its standard rate of pay to 7.36 pounds per hour. \nMarket leader Tesco pays an hourly rate of 7.39 pounds, Asda will pay 7.00 pounds from Oct. 1, while Aldi pays 8.15 pounds. \nMorrisons' standard hourly rate for store staff varies from a minimum of 6.83 pounds to a minimum of 7.79 pounds depending on location, though it is yet to conclude this year's pay round. \nTesco and Lidl, unlike Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi, do not pay staff for breaks. \n(Editing by Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T15:18:51.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
