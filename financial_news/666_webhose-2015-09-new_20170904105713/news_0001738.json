With over 20 years of experience in global marketing leadership, Porres brings further expertise in revenue growth, acquisition diligence, international expansion and initial public offerings to the Sailthru executive team. \nMost recently, Porres served as Chief Marketing Officer of Rocket Fuel ( FUEL ), where he was responsible for all marketing and commercial insight activities contributing to Rocket Fuel’s revenue growth from $46M to over $408M in three years. During his tenure at Rocket Fuel, Porres grew the marketing team from four to more than thirty people in an international group supporting over 22 offices in ten countries. He was part of the management team through Rocket Fuel’s IPO and part of the diligence team for the [x+1] acquisition. \n“Over the last 18 months Sailthru has steadily transformed its leadership and operations teams. As we continue to grow and satisfy the demand for modern personalization in ecommerce and publishing, the missing link has been a seasoned marketing executive who has experience on a global scale,” said Neil Lustig, Chief Executive Officer, Sailthru. “We sought out a proven leader, with the experience we need for today and for the years ahead; a growth executive who has been on the proverbial ‘rocket ship’ before and has a proven track record of increasing value and differentiation for technology companies in markets worldwide. We are excited to have Eric at the helm of our marketing organization to have him further the success we have been experiencing since 2008.” \n“For too long marketing investments have been pointing at the wrong end of the funnel. Marketers acquire, acquire, acquire, but then treat the unwashed masses the same. As a result, the 80/20 Pareto Principle no longer applies, and the disparity is even more stark for media and ecommerce companies: 90 – 95 percent of ecommerce revenue and publisher pageviews come from just 1 – 10 percent of consumers,” said Eric Porres, Chief Marketing Officer, Sailthru. “A personalized and relevant experience between a person and a brand increases lifetime value and reduces churn. I’m excited to join Sailthru because our customers trust our easy and flexible technology solutions that make every interaction unique and profitable across their email, website and mobile applications, which are three of the most powerful retention marketing channels on earth.” \nAn entrepreneur himself, Porres founded several businesses and consultancies before he joined Rocket Fuel, including Underscore Marketing, a fully independent, full-service digital marketing and strategy agency; Pericles Consulting, a ‘pop-up’ strategic political marketing firm that executed digital marketing programs for presidential and senatorial campaigns; and Classelist, online software for managing school class lists. He also served as the Chief Marketing Officer for Lotame Solutions, a marketing technology company, where he oversaw the research and insights practice, as well as led business and product development for the company’s core data management platform technology for publishers. Previously he held management positions at Time Inc and Agency.com. Porres graduated from Duke University and is an investor and advisor for several startup companies. \nAbout Sailthru \nSailthru, the leading provider of email and personalization software for the world’s top ecommerce and media companies, is driving a major shift in how companies engage with their individual customers and optimize their revenue opportunities.
