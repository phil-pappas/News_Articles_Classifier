Photo: Bloomberg\nOil advanced above $US45 a barrel in New York, snapping a three-day losing streak, after US equities rebounded and speculation grew that declining American crude production may whittle away a global surplus.\nWest Texas Intermediate futures rose 4 per cent. The Energy Information Administration cut forecasts for US crude output in 2015 and 2016, predicting a slide to 8.82 million barrels a day next year from 9.22 million a day in 2015 in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook Wednesday. The market shrugged off an EIA report Thursday that showed crude supplies climbed last week as refineries idled units to perform seasonal maintenance.\nCrude has fluctuated since dipping below $US40 in August as concern over slowing Chinese growth fueled volatility in world markets. Prices are down more than 25 per cent from this year's June peak on speculation a global glut will persist as OPEC members sustain output and US stockpiles swell. Thursday's uptick shows bearish traders are now starting to close short positions, or buy back contracts, according to Saxo Bank.\n\"Oil is rising because the S&P is up and the Short Term Outlook showed a decent decline in US crude production through next year,\" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors and Cypress Energy Capital Management in Houston, said in an interview. \"The inventory data's been bearish.\"\nAdvertisement WTI for October delivery increased $US1.77 to settle at $US45.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 31 per cent above the 100-day average. Prices have decreased 14 per cent this year.\nBrent for October settlement climbed $US1.31, or 2.8 per cent, to end the session at $US48.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark crude closed at a $US2.97 premium to WTI.\n\"We still have excess production and supply but the situation should improve,\" Dan Heckman, senior fixed-income strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees about $US127 billion in Kansas City, Missouri, said by phone. \"The bottom in prices is here and prices should climb if demand continues to move upward.\"\nThe EIA cut its US crude output forecast for 2015 by 1.5 per cent to 9.22 million barrels a day in its Wednesday report. Production this year is still projected to be the highest since 1972, the report showed.\n\"This has been a roller coaster,\" Chip Hodge, who oversees a $US9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston, said by phone. \"The market will be vulnerable to moves south until there's a substantial decline in production.\"\nUS crude output slipped 83,000 barrels a day to 9.14 million last week, the lowest since January, the EIA said. Crude supplies rose 2.57 million barrels to 458 million, leaving stockpiles more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average.\nRefineries operated at 90.9 per cent of their capacity, the least since April 3, the report showed. US refiners cut operating rates during September in nine of the past 10 years as the end of the summer driving season allowed then to perform maintenance.\n\"Things are bearish from an inventory standpoint, with the driving season now in the rear-view mirror,\" Hodge said. \"Refineries will be in turnaround mode, which will reduce demand for crude.\"\nMembers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, competing with the US for market share, boosted crude output last month as Iranian production climbed to a three-year high, according to a Bloomberg data.\nIran has reduced price differentials for all October exports to Asia, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. It cut the premium on the Iran Light grade to 25 cents over the Oman-Dubai benchmark from 60 cents in September, they said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:48:14.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
