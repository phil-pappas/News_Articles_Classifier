But the introduction of Downer EDI to operate plant and equipment maintenance, run drill and blast operations and remove the topsoil that covers the coal seams means that 210 BMA employees will be asked to change jobs and another 96 contract workers will go.\nBMA says none of its 210 will be made redundant. A carefully selected 70 will be offered new tasks at Blackwater and the balance will be offered jobs at one of three Bowen Basin coal mines or can choose voluntary redundancy.\nOutside of the general anxiety caused by job losses, this selection process has provoked fears that BHP is attempting to weed out \"non-preferred employees\". Some in the union worry that its officials at Blackwater will be moved on.\nAs might be expected, the union has objected to BMA's plan. It has held community meetings to discuss the proposal and consider ways BMA's progress might be slowed or halted. The irony of it all is that the arrangements that made Downer EDI such an attractive option for BMA were made possible by agreement with the union.\nDowner EDI won this new business because it was able to guarantee it could do that work at Blackwater at a \"substantially lower cost\" than BMA does it now and it was able to reinforce that promise by signing a deal that enforces financial penalties if key performance indicators are missed.\nNo savings guidance Neither customer nor contractor has offered firm guidance of the quantum of savings targeted in this new arrangement. But there is informed speculation that Downer EDI aims to get the job done for up to 60 per cent less.\nThe complication here for the union is that Downer EDI's march into Blackwater was made possible by a site agreement that was finalised with the union at least three months before BMA confirmed this sea-change in its direct management model.\nThe site agreement recommended to the Fair Work Commission on June 3 by Downer and the coal mining union sets a pay schedule consistently lower than the current rates of pay BMA's Blackwater people receive.\nFor example, the basic hourly rate for a level three Blackwater operator is 25.7 per cent lower ($29.69 an hour versus $39.99 an hour) and the Downer EDI agreement allows for overtime to be paid at 150 per cent rather than the 200 per cent that is standard in the existing BMA agreement. The deal makes possible five-day-week rosters that could be used to reduce that overtime and does not include some other iconic fringe benefits like the payment by BMA of gym fees for miners and their immediate families.\nDowner EDI needed a new agreement for Blackwater because it was the incumbent operator of the load and haul of the mine's overburden removal. Just days after lodging the new enterprise deal the contractor confirmed its grip on that work had been extended by two years, with an option over a third. The value of that deal was put at $100 million.\nThere is considerable debate across Queensland's coal industry about whether the coal union was being complicit in the contractor's plans to open new fronts of opportunity for cost saving at BMA, or whether it has merely been artfully snookered by the miner's management.\nEmbraced the need Certainly it would be nice to imagine that the coal union's leadership had been visited with a Damascus moment and quietly embraced the need for concessions that might protect the most vulnerable of BMA's existing Bowen Basin coal fleet.\nBlackwater is a mature, high-cost operation that produces a lower caste of coal than other BMA operations. Its viability has been pushed to the limit by falling coal prices and a cost base that reflects supply and demand fundamentals that disintegrated almost immediately BMA signed its last employment deal in October 2012.\nBHP reckons that, across the board, its costs in coal are between 15 and 20 per cent higher than they need to be. But recognising the levers of cost management and being able to pull them to material effect are quite different things.\nHow people work at BMA and how much they get paid for it are defined by an enterprise agreement that covers all of the miner's sites. That agreement expires on October 26 but we hear that neither the company nor the three coal unions have opened negotiations yet over a new deal.\nThe 2012 agreement took two years, $US1 billion ($1.42 billion) worth of strike action and, finally, serious – and, at one level at least, disgraceful – concessions by BHP to finalise. Given that everyone fully appreciates the dire state of the local and global coal economy, no one anticipates that the next deal will be as violently divisive. Nonetheless, there is evidence enough around the coal fields of resistance of reality, with union leaders resisting any temptation to prompt more modest settlements. In some cases it feels as though the union is sitting back just hoping the commodities cycle will take a turn for the good.\nIt won't.\nFinger in the costs dyke The problem here, from the employers' view at least, is that the best they can hope for is to put a finger in the costs dyke. All they can do is slow the rate of wages inflation and focus instead on changing the way their people work. This is a disappointing reality of our industrial relations system. There is no obvious way that an industry facing post-boom realities can ever stop paying boom-time prices for labour.\nThat is because a pillar of a Fair Work Act is the better off overall test (BOOT). The effect of this test is that the Fair Work Commission cannot endorse an agreement that results in substantially lower rates of pay.\nBHP reckons that coal's new normal demands a 25 per cent lower wages bill. But that is a target beyond reach without structural change, because it cannot ask its workers to take less than they do now.\nSo what does it do?\nThe most immediate option is for BMA to hand over more and more of the real grunt work to contractors like Downer EDI, because they are allowed to pay people less. And the longer game is to focus on doing more and more with less and less, to work away at the basic stuff that is BHP's company-wide productivity project. And that is where the upcoming BMA negotiation will get interesting.\nI expect BHP to arrive at those discussions with a template for new workplace flexibilities and with the lure of gently improved rates of pay. And, if what we hear is correct, the union probably knows that this financial temptation to embrace change will start to look better and better the longer the negotiations roll on.\nAlready in discussions The word is that the main coal union, the CFMEU, is already in discussions with at least two contractors other than Downer EDI about new BMA site agreements that will probably be shaped by the June deal. The sites named in that speculation are Goonyella Riverside and Peak Downs and the work under discussion is the pre-strip and maintenance stuff that will be Downer EDI's responsibility at Blackwater.\nIf the Blackwater deal is the benchmark for both the saving promise and the level of risk embraced by the contractor, then joining BMA's new world of outsourcing could be a challenging task.\nThe one certainty though is that it will require the same sorts of wages outcomes that are embedded in Downer EDI's June agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:02:10.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
