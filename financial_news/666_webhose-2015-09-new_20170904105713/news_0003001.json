More Other People's Money John Kay talks exclusively to the FT about his new book \nTo submit a question, or view the event in Facebook, click here . \nAn extract from John Kay’s book has been published in FT Money, drawing on hispast experiences on the boards of British banks, and his subsequent re-examination of the financial crisis. \nHis central theory is that the complexity of modern finance “has been designed, and has operated principally to benefit, the financial intermediaries rather than the users of financial services”. \nDeclaring himself an advocate of “boring banking” , he is a supporter of separating banks’ retail and investment banking operations. But he also believes that reform of the financial services sector has not gone far enough. \nIn a podcast with FT Money this month, he said: “My fear is that the only way we’re ever going to get substantive reform is through another crisis — possibly even bigger than the last one.” \nHe also questioned the popularity of investment banking as a career choice. “The idea in the 1960s that your cleverest graduates would clamour for places in Goldman Sachs was something you just never imagined could happen,” he added. “What is the opportunity cost of having attracted many of the UK’s brightest people into activities that don’t actually add value for society as whole?” \nFT Money will also be hosting An Evening with John Kay at the FT’s London offices on the evening of Tuesday November 3, where he will talk about the themes of his book, and take questions from readers. Tickets cost £25 and include a signed copy of his book. \nYou can book tickets for the event at FT.com/johnkayevent .
