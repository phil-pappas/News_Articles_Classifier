The two issues are intertwined.\nThis trend explains why the former boss of one of Australia's biggest power generation companies this week launched a company which is seeking to disrupt the industry with new technology that helps consumers use less electricity.\nYou could say former EnergyAustralia boss Richard McIndoe, one of the most vocal critics of the former government's carbon reduction policies, has switched allegiances. But it is more complicated than that.\nAfter years running EnergyAustralia, whose assets included a coal-fired power station, he is now on the other side of the fence. The entrepreneur has swapped the Melbourne offices of EnergyAustralia for more modest digs in Hong Kong's Sheung Wan neighbourhood, an area more renowned for Chinese wet markets and a burgeoning hip bar scene than corporate activity.\nHe is the executive chairman of energy technology start-up Edge Electrons, which is about to start offering devices to Australian households which regulate the amount of electricity they consume. A partnership signed with Nasdaq-listed electronics giant Flextronics over the weekend was the launch pad to go live with the technology the company has been developing for a year.\n Bidders undeterred The threat to traditional business models in the electricity sector is also another issue for governments to weigh up as they evaluate the merits of privatising billions of dollars of electricity assets. There is little doubt private companies are in a better position to manage disruption than governments, although Australia Post will argue it is an exception. For the buyers lining up to secure NSW's electricity assets , the threat of solar, batteries and other new technologies is not putting them off bidding.\n\"What the last year has shown me is the potential for technology to disrupt the traditional industry is huge,\" McIndoe told Chanticleer in an interview at his Hong Kong office this week.\n\"It is as big in the electricity industry as it is in any other. I don't think people have recognised that in the past. Is the government in the best position to react to those technology developments or is the private sector better positioned to do that? I think it is probably the latter.\"\nMcIndoe understands the challenges facing the industry better than most. He ran EnergyAustralia for eight years, building a retail customer base which almost rivalled AGL and Origin.\nBut weak prices, tough competition, billing and industrial relations problems at its biggest generator, the Yallourn coal-fired station in the Latrobe Valley, meant parent China Light and Power shelved a $3 billion-plus IPO. A messy unfair dismissal case also overshadowed operational issues at the end of his tenure in 2014.\nMcIndoe says the industry made mistakes but this was during a period of regulatory confusion in a market coping with a mixture of state and privately-owned assets and falling demand.\n\"You could say acquiring some generation … well you don't need that generation any more, but if you hadn't acquired a retail customer base you wouldn't have that opportunity now about building that retail customer base,\" he says.\nIronically, it is the customer base he helped build that will be the target for the first phase of Edge Electron's global push. While the company is based in Hong Kong, has engineering operations in the Philippines and manufactures in China, it will use Australia as the test market.\nMcIndoe decided to team up with Neil Stewart, an Australian, who has worked in the electronics industry in Hong Kong since the 1970s, after being showed the technology which regulates the flow of electricity in a household and claims to be able to reduce consumption by 10 to 15 per cent.\n\"He showed me this technology and I had never seen anything like it in 20 years in the industry and I thought this is incredibly disruptive. \"\nFiercely competitive The company has spent the last year developing, testing and certifying the equipment. Australia is the test market because McIndoe knows it well but also because it is a fiercely competitive retail market and the country is more receptive to new technologies than many others.\nThe key product is a voltage regulator. Networks are increasingly running the voltages at the higher end of the required levels to cope with the intermittent supply coming into the system from things like solar panels. He says this means households are often paying for 255 volts when they only require 220 volts.\nThe device acts as a filter on the electricity supply which regulates the voltage down to a pre-set level. Electronics and software read the voltage on the networks every fraction of a second and the resistance is adjusted to accommodate fluctuatingvoltage.\nThe payback for a customer is two years compared to five or six years for buying solar panels.\nIt plays to other changes sweeping the industry which mean consumers suddenly have the power to make decisions about how much power they use through things like energy efficient appliances and battery storage and affordable solar panel technology.\nIt is not unlike the inflection point which hit telecommunications or banking years ago.\n\"We have this convergence of high technology, software and electronics with customers who want something different, and the added incentive of wanting to do something for the environment,\" McIndoe says.\nWhile McIndoe led the push by generators to oppose the carbon tax in Australia, he says that was more about dealing with damaging and costly regulatory confusion and arguing for a more measured approach to the climate issue.\nPanic in low-growth world The incredible panic sale of Glencore shares only to be replaced by buying 24 hours later is symptomatic of a market in a state of suspended terror in a low-growth world.\nWhile Glencore has its unique issues and commodities are at the centre of concerns around a China slowdown, the fact that one broker view can trigger such a dramatic sell-down says a lot about investor sentiment globally.\nAndrew Swan, the head of Asian equities for BlackRock, the world's largest investment manager, says the volatility stems from an uncertain policy environment.\n\"We are living in a pretty unique period now in a fairly growth-less world and in a growth-less world policy becomes a bit determinant of outcomes for asset prices. You have gone through a period where there was certainty over policy into a period of uncertainty,\" he told Chanticleer.\n\"The Fed is moving the goal posts a bit around rate rises, China has been through a lot of change around policy and it is that nervousness investors have in general.\"\nAustralian-born Swan believes investors have been living in \"suspended fear\" since the global financial crisis and the lack of growth meant markets were no longer always driven by fundamentals such as growth.\n\"In the last decade or two there were long periods where we didn't have this policy uncertainty. Policy is dictating outcomes. It used to be general fundamentals such as growth rates driving markets.\"\nHong Kong-based Swan said investors are watching the new Turnbull government for signs it can deliver on policies which generate growth outside the traditional areas of commodities.\nMICHAEL SMITH\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmith\nTony Boyd is on leave.\n​", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmith", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:06:11.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
