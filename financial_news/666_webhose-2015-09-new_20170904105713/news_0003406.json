The sale was Haley’s first in more than a year and shed 55% of his stake in Towers Watson, which he has expanded into a professional-services powerhouse whose shares have risen 156% since 2010.\nWhen the roughly $9 billion deal was announced on June 30 , Towers Watson shareholders criticized it, sending the Arlington, Va., company’s stock down nearly 9% that day. Their beef: the deal’s price tag, which valued Towers Watson at $125.13 a share, or about 9% less than the prior day’s close. Some of them groused that the big winner from the rare, so-called takeunder was Haley, who would be CEO of the combined company even though his shareholders would own a minority.\nHaley declined to comment through a spokesman. A person familiar with the situation said the trades took place early in the merger talks and were cleared by Towers Watson’s legal team. Mr. Haley doesn’t have a 10b5-1 plan, which allows executives to preschedule transactions for certain times or price triggers.\n“This deal destroys shareholder value,” said Matthew Schoenfeld, an assistant portfolio manager at Driehaus Capital Management LLC, a Towers Watson investor that has urged shareholders to reject the merger.\nAn expanded version of this story can be found at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/towers-watson-ceo-sold-stock-before-big-deal-1443052212"], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:51:20.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
