He was most recently a managing director at Lazard, and has worked on restructuring more than $100 billion of debt in his career, New York-based Evercore said.\nChief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein has said this year has been especially strong for hiring as he added to Evercore’s private capital, merger and debt-advisory businesses. Bankers expect restructuring work to pick up in the energy industry after oil prices tumbled.\n“Dan’s track record for advising on many of the largest and most complex restructuring transactions will enhance our ability to grow,” Altman said in the statement. “His stature in the Midwest corporate marketplace will enhance our standing with those companies.”\nAronson has advised both creditors and debtors and worked with clients including LyondellBasell Industries, the chemical maker that emerged from bankruptcy in 2010. He has also been involved in transactions tied to Station Casinos, Trump International and cable television-company Adelphia Communications, Evercore said. He worked at Peter J. Solomon and Ernst & Young before joining Lazard in 2000.\nAt Lazard, he was co-chief operating officer of the restructuring group.
