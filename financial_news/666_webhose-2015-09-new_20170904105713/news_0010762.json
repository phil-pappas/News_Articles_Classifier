PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Sep 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:33, Tue, Sep 1, 2015 IG Aga Rangemaster is at the centre of a takeover tussle The maker of the distinctive cast-iron ovens said it was in talks with Whirlpool over a possible offer after receiving an approach and has opened its books to the suitor. Whirlpool's move to gatecrash the Middleby takeover comes just a week before Aga shareholders are due to vote on the deal, with Aga set to officially seal the takeover on September 16. But Aga said it was still backing the 185p-a-share offer made by American kitchen equipment firm Middleby in July in the absence of any firm bid from Whirlpool. 888 raises Bwin battle stakes ONLINE gambling firm 888 Holdings has sweetened its bid for FoxyBingo owner Bwin.party, as the £1billion takeover battle with GVC Holdings rumbles on. Bwin said it has received a revised proposal from Gibraltar-based rival 888 and will consider it alongside a new offer made last week by GVC in a two-way bidding war that has swung back and forth throughout the summer. Bwin did not disclose the terms of 888's fresh approach, although Bwin said it came with \"a number of pre-conditions\". Bwin is also mulling a revised cashand- shares bid from Isle of Manbased GVC, worth about £1.07billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:59:16.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
