Sylvia Liber SVZ by Ben Potter and Tim Binsted Trade experts slammed a bid by unions and independent senators for a \"buy Australian\" policy and emergency tariffs to rescue BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla steel factory.\nUnions want BlueScope Steel executives to share in any job cuts at the struggling steelworks and have urged Treasurer Joe Hockey to impose emergency tariffs on cheap imported steel to save the plant.\nThe Australian Workers' Union wants the federal government to adopt a Victorian plan to buy \"100 per cent Australian steel\" for large public projects. Independent senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan are drafting a law requiring local jobs and taxes to be considered as well as price in procurement.\n\"It makes no sense to impose additional costs upon the use of steel or any other products in public projects by forcing their purchase at prices above international prices,\" Australian National University Asia expert and economics professor Peter Drsydale said.\nUnions want BlueScope Steel executives to share in any job cuts at the struggling steelworks and have urged Treasurer Joe Hockey to impose emergency tariffs on cheap imported steel to save the plant. Sylvia Liber SVZ \"Ultimately this will put additional burdens on the Australian taxpayer and shackles on the growth of the Australian economy and its productivity. There are much more efficient and productive ways to sustain jobs and growth.\"\nBlueScope chief executive Paul O'Malley said he needs to cut costs by $200 million or Port Kembla's No. 5 blast furnace and 4500 jobs will go . The nation's biggest steelworks is in Wollongong, NSW.\nMeasures breach our trade obligations Trade expert Alan Oxley, chairman of ITS Global, said the Victorian measures breached Australia's trade deals with Korea, Japan and the US, under which signatory nations must be treated equally in national procurement.\n Mr Oxley said he would await the Xenophon-Madigan proposal but \"if whatever is proposed has the effect of discrimination in public procurement against product from Japan and China, it is likely it would breach the terms of the free trade agreements\".\nHe described a plea by the South Coast Labour Council for emergency tariffs on \"dumped\" imported steel as \"grasping at straws\".\nWorld Trade Organisation rules allow emergency tariffs for up to 200 days in critical circumstances to give governments time to see if products are being \"dumped\" - or sold below \"normal value\".\n\"What's the emergency? Suddenly they have realised that they can't meet the market price? They would have known that for ages,\" Mr Oxley said.\n500 jobs to go to keep furnace going On Wednesday about 600 Port Kembla workers and union officials met in Wollongong to discuss Mr O'Malley's ultimatum. \"Plan A\" is to cut 500 jobs and $200 million of costs to keep the blast furnace running.\nAustralian Workers' Union branch secretary Wayne Philips said the meeting was \"very sombre\". The AWU has acknowledged jobs must go to keep the plant open and has agreed to suspend bargaining and industrial action for mediation.\nFuture Fund chairman and former Treasurer Peter Costello didn't comment directly on Bluescope but noted that Qantas Airways had pleaded for government aid \"a year or two ago\" and the government \"rightly\" refused.\n\"To their credit management and the board have managed to turn it around and it was the right decision for the government and it might even have been the right decision for Qantas.\"\nThe world is awash with surplus steel and prices have been hammered as China has slashed its steel consumption and switched production to export. China makes half the world's steel and doubled exports to more than 100 million tonnes a year from 2010 to 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:06:18.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
