Chris Pearce by James Eyers Perry Williams New Resources and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg warned that anti-coal activism could cost Australia capital for major resource projects, and pledged to use a $5 billion investment fund to develop infrastructure for the mining industry in Northern Australia.\nThe day after he was sworn in, Mr Frydenberg spoke with Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles and Queensland Minister for Natural Resources and Mines Anthony Lynham. He plans a trip to Western Australia in the coming weeks to meet government and industry leaders.\nOne of the first tests for the former political adviser and investment banker will be resolving the stand-off between Indian giant Adani and environmental protesters, which is threatening the $16.5 billion Carmichael mine project in central Queensland's Galilee Basin .\nAdani is \"a very important project, which will see significant investment in Australia and provide electricity to millions of people in the developing world,\" he said.\nHe said navigating the tension between activists and investors \"is going to be a real challenge for me\".\nHe indicated recent environmental campaigns created economic risks for Australia because they could dissuade foreign investors from investing in large projects.\n\"Anti-development activism can create major delays in projects and send investment offshore, and you have to be very conscious of that when there are such large time frames involved and we are competing internationally for investment in this country,\" he said. \"We are not the only nation in the world that produces iron ore or mines for coal.\"\nMinerals Council of Australia chief executive Brendan Pearson admitted the increasing clout of environmental lobby groups had led to the mining industry facing a tough challenge for projects to be approved.\n \"I do think we've got a challenge going ahead. Clearly there is still a small but vocal minority of people who will make new coal projects and to be honest all mining projects harder to get up,\" Mr Pearson said. \"We have to find a way to satisfy the legitimate expectations of people to have a say on projects without suffering from interminable delays.\"\nThe Minerals Council, which represents mining giants BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Adani, will meet with Mr Frydenberg in Melbourne this week to discuss industry challenges.\nThe campaigns director for anti-coal activist 350 Australia, Charlie Wood, said the divestment of coal stocks by pension and sovereign wealth funds and the reluctance of banks to fund Adani's Carmichael coal project illustrated the shift in mainstream thinking against the mining industry.\n\"It's not about the granola belt colleges in the US any more,\" she said. \"It's now heavyweight institutions and the mainstream investment sector which is finally listening.\"\nMr Frydenberg, whose ministerial responsibilities also include the development of northern Australia, said the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility announced in the federal budget in May would be deployed towards ports, roads, water and rail infrastructure projects, potentially in partnership with the private sector. The fund has been criticised for potentially building \"white elephants\".\nAsked if the fund might be used for building project infrastructure, such as a rail line to allow coal in the Galilee Basin to be transported to ports, Mr Frydenberg said: \"Yes, if there is a good case and state governments are willing to step up, then you would think that rail is one of the areas where it will go.\"\nThe government has pledged a further $1.2 billion as part of its northern Australia white paper released in June, which seeks to make it a more attractive place to invest and work.\nMr Frydenberg suggested that calls made last year by Â­billionaire miner Gina Rinehart for northern Australia to be declared a special economic zone, which would reduce taxes and allow special visas to attract labour, could be overly ambitious.\nWhile he wanted to look at all proposals, \"you wouldn't want an outcome that became overly complex and trying to have special economic zones perhaps could have that outcome,\" he said.\nWhile the slowdown in China had depressed the earnings of mining players, Mr Frydenberg said demand for resources is consistent, and the market is \"moving back to normalised, cyclical patterns\".\nIn this environment, the challenge is to \"boost productivity in our own domestic sector, which is where reduced regulation and innovation and technology is important. When you talk about innovation in the mining sector, Australia is world best in this regard, but there is always much more we can do.\"\nMr Frydenberg will chair the COAG Energy Council meeting in December, where a national energy productivity plan will be discussed with the states to develop policy to reduce energy per unit of gross domestic product by 40 per cent by 2030.\nHe said the mining industry would have to continue to reduce costs to remain competitive given the end of the resources super-cycle had driven down prices for some of Australia's biggest exports, including iron ore and coal.\nThe slump in commodity prices also reinforced the importance of the free trade agreement with, China which will reduce Chinese tariffs for various resources and support export volumes, he said. The agreement has been attacked by unions and the Labor opposition as a threat to Australian jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:41:37.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
