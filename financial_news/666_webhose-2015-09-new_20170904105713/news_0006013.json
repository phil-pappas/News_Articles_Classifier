On the eve of Winterkorn's departure, Wolfsburg was thrashed 5-1 by league champions Bayern Munich. \n- 'Irrational decisions' - \nAn avid goalkeeper in his youth, Winterkorn has been a regular spectator at Wolfsburg games, wearing the club's scarf around his neck. \nWhen it comes to football, the 68-year-old was \"known for being capable of taking decisions that are not always rational\" in terms of sponsoring, said Christoph Breuer, a economist specialising in sports at the University of Cologne. \nWinterkorn's successor, Matthias Mueller, is also known to be a football buff, having himself once dreamt of going pro. \nNevertheless, he is \"better known for his affinity to automobile sports,\" said Breuer. \nAnd the financial pressure weighing on Volkswagen from the growing tangle of legal woes could lead to \"calls for a cost-cutting programme\" at the carmaker, said the expert. \nThe question over what Winterkorn brought to the team financially had already been raised earlier this year, during an ugly leadership feud with his former mentor at VW, Ferdinand Piech, the group's patriarch. \nThen, Germany's influential Bild newspaper said that Volkswagen could slash its sponsorship to Wolfsburg by 30 million euros a year if Winterkorn were to be toppled. \nA sum of that scale could crimp the capabilities of the 2009 German champions to woo top flight players. \nThe club this year paid 32 million euros ($36 million, 24 million pounds) to bring Andre Schuerrle from Chelsea back to home turf, and another 35 million euros to Schalke 04 for Julian Draxler. \nVolkswagen's investment is not pure generosity in football-mad Germany. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also aims to \"make the city more attractive\" to its employees and to convince them to work at the headquarters rather than in Berlin, about 200 kilometres away, or in Munich. \n\"Wolfsburg will not disappear from the football map, but it may only dwindle in the middle of the league table,\" said Breuer. \n- 'No immediate impact' - \nThe club itself is putting on a brave face, with its sporting director Klaus Allofs insisting that the scandal will have \"no immediate impact\". \nConcerns are not limited to Wolfsburg, but also other clubs across several leagues. \nThe Volkswagen group and its subsidiaries are sponsors of 17 professional clubs on the top and second leagues. \nIts premium carbrand Audi (LSE: 0FG8.L - news ) , for instance, is a shareholder of both Bayern Munich and FC Ingolstadt. \nThere are therefore concerns that the scandal could spell \"the end of expansion in football\" by Volkswagen, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. \nOthers were less alarmist, noting that as part of damage control to its reputation, Volkswagen can ill afford to pull its sponsorship of these clubs. \n\"Volkswagen has a lot to do to improve its image\" and regain the public's confidence, said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) . \nCutting spending on Wolfsburg or other clubs could prove counterproductive, he said. \nThe analyst believes that Volkswagen has the financial muscle to settle the fines (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T08:11:54.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
