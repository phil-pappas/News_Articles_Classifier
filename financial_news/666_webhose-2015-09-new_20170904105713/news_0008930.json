We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?\nI have been a French and German teacher in a secondary school for 12 years and am also a pastoral leader (head of year). This brings with it more money but also significant extra pressure.\nThere are many aspects of my job I love: working with young people, helping them to sort out their problems, the fact that no two days are ever the same, the rhythm of the school year, my colleagues. But I am increasingly worn down by the workload and target-driven culture. Most weekdays are 12 hours long, increasing to 14 when marking is at a peak. I spend part of every weekend either planning lessons or assemblies, or marking. Hobbies and interests fall by the wayside.\nAt the age of 50, I long for a better work-life balance. My youngest child is one year away from university and I want to make decisions about my future. I have always been in education of one form or another. I would definitely consider a move into another sector but feel overwhelmed as to where to start. Working with people, a varied work environment and not being desk-bound are important considerations.\nAs a younger woman, I worked abroad and I would love to learn Spanish and am considering doing a TEFL qualification, which seems to be a minimum requirement in Spain. I would like a high quality, well-regarded qualification which seems to rule out studying online. This leaves a four-week intensive (impossible with work) or 12-week part-time (equally impossible in a working week). So I feel the only option would be to quit the job in England with no job lined up, do the four-week intensive course in Spain and then start job hunting, a prospect which I feel very anxious about, especially as I have no savings.\nAnd then the reality check kicks in: why I am I thinking of pursuing a career change which is financial suicide? An entry level English teaching job in Spain would pay less than half of my current salary. I still have 15 years of a mortgage to pay in this country.\nDo you need advice on a work issue?
