Freshmen were the most vulnerable, with 16.9% reporting such an incident; the rate steadily declined each year to 11.1% for seniors.\nAbout 19% of the 780,000 students contacted responded to the survey. Researchers cautioned the results could be skewed because students who skipped the survey may have been less likely to report assault. The survey was anonymous, as is usual for such studies.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-than-1-in-4-college-women-report-sexual-assault-by-graduation-1442881054?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:10:52.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
