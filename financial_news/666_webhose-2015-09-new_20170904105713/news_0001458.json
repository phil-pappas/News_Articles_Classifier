Many view it as distasteful. And it is inevitably expensive. Despite all that, more and more families are choosing to go to court to fight over the terms of their parents’ or another relative’s wills. \nThe number of will-related disputes to reach the High Court climbed by more than 80pc last year to 178 the highest number since 2007. Booming property prices are the “main motivation” for children and other family members to contest a will, say lawyers. \nNumber of will disputes to reach the High Court \nBut other factors are usually also at play. Parents and their children may have become estranged, or fallen out over a particular issue. More commonly, families simply fail to discuss their plans ahead of time, leading to shock and anger if the contents of the will are unexpected. \nBeing open about your will while you are writing or updating it can help to prepare children or other beneficiaries for what’s in it, lawyers suggest. \nA number of prominent entrepreneurs, including Bill Gates and Nigella Lawson, have declared that they will not spoil their children with huge fortunes, but will leave their money to charity instead. And Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop, left nothing to her daughters in her will when she died in 2007, instead donating her £51m fortune to good causes. \nMatthew Barnett, of law firm Harbottle & Lewis, said that being upfront about your intended legacies is particularly helpful in cases where one sibling stands to inherit more than another. \n“There may be a very logical reason for the decision for example, if one sibling is financially well-off and the other is struggling,” Mr Barnett said. “By making your intentions known ahead of time, you avoid the shock factor at a time that can already be fraught with emotion.” \nThis summer, the Court of Appeal made headlines when it overturned the will of charity donor Melita Jackson . She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) had stipulated that her £500,000 estate be distributed among animal charities, leaving nothing to her daughter, Heather Ilott. The court heard how Mrs Jackson had never forgiven her daughter, 54, for eloping when she was 17. \nJudges described Mrs Jackson’s actions as “unreasonable, capricious and harsh”. The court found that she failed to make “reasonable provision” for her daughter in her will, and awarded Mrs Ilott, who lives on benefits, £164,000 from the estate. \nThe judgment attracted harsh criticism because it went against the well-established principle in England and Wales of “testamentary freedom”, where every individual is free to leave their estate to whomever they wish. Lawyers are undecided about whether the Jackson/Ilott case could set a precedent for more wills being contested and with success. \n= Could your will ‘fail’ or be successfully challenged? = \nThe best way to make sure your wishes will be followed is to understand the grounds on which wills are successfully challenged. \nChallenges to the will’s validity \nClaimants can cite a number of reasons why a document doesn’t fulfil the technical requirements of a will. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) could be argued that the writer was not in a fit state of mind or was under undue influence from another beneficiary, for instance. It could be claimed the will was forged by another party or that there weren’t enough witnesses present. \nMatthew Evans, head of contested wills, trusts and estates at law firm Hugh James, said the best way to prevent such challenges from succeeding is to make sure that your solicitor has a detailed paper trail. \n“Your solicitor must be able to produce notes showing how the will was drawn up and executed,” he said. “There needs to be clear evidence of why the will was written in the way that it was.” \nTo make the will as watertight as possible, there are some key steps you should take. Meet with your solicitor on your own, and don’t have a friend or family member drive you to the appointment or wait outside. This can help avoid claims of undue influence. \nDiscuss the assets you own. If you want to exclude a spouse, or family member, give a very detailed explanation of why and make sure your solicitor notes this down. \nIf you are aged 70 or over, or have a history of mental illness, it might be worth asking your GP for what is known as a “capacity report”, which states that you are of fit mind to write a will. Your solicitor may ask you to do this, even if you feel it is unnecessary. \n“If the will is challenged down the track and a claimant says that you were not mentally capable of writing a will, this document will go a long way to fighting the claim,” Mr Evans said. \nAsk for copies of your solicitor’s notes, to ensure you are satisfied with the level of detail on record. \nIt is also worth writing a “letter of wishes” to add to the file. This explains, in your own words, who you want to benefit from your estate. If you want to exclude someone, include specific reasons why. “Avoid spiteful language here,” Mr Barnett said. “The court will not look favourably on it. It is much better to couch things in positive, factual terms.” \nDisputes that fall under the heading ‘proprietary estoppel’ \nClaims can be brought if you promised to leave assets to someone, usually property or land, but fail to do so in the will. The claimant can say that they have suffered detriment financial or otherwise because they relied on the promised inheritance. \nMr Evans said this is common in farming families, for example, where children work on the farm with little or no pay with the expectation that they will one day inherit it. \n“If you fail to write a will, or you fall out with that child and decide not to leave the farm to them, they could argue that you can’t renege on the agreement because they have suffered detriment,” he said. “This could be financial, if they worked for no pay, or through the loss of opportunities that they turned down or did not pursue because they believed they would inherit the farm.” \nThese sorts of claims can be avoided by not promising assets and then changing your mind. If circumstances do change, however, and you need to renege, try to do it before the detriment goes too far, or compensate the person at the time. \nClaims under the Inheritance Act \nUnlike the first two categories, it is difficult to prevent claims being brought under the Inheritance Act. \nThe act allows your current and former spouse (if separated but not divorced), children, cohabitants and financial dependants to bring a claim if they feel they have not received enough in your will. \nThe court considers whether the will makes “reasonable provision” for the claimant, taking into account the need for support and maintenance. The status of the claimant is particularly relevant. A surviving spouse is entitled to a higher standard of provision than other claimants, such as children, who are limited to reasonable provision for their maintenance only. \n• 'How a £90 will by Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) lost half my house' • 'My cousins will inherit my uncle's home can I contest the will?' \nThe court may decide that a financially stable adult child is not owed anything in maintenance, but a child living on benefits, as in the case of Heather Ilott, might be. If you want to exclude a family member altogether, but are concerned about future claims, it can be a good idea to leave them something in your will. \n“One approach that I sometimes recommend to wealthy clients is to take out a life policy and leave it to that person,” Mr Evans said. “It will cost a few pounds a month during their life and it means that the person will get some money, but it doesn’t take assets away from your intended beneficiaries. \n\"It might be enough to deter them from challenging the will and, if they do make a claim, it could help water down their challenge in the eyes of the court.” \n• Ask a money question: Email moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T11:48:10.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
