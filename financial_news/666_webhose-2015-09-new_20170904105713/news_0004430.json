We showed a very high level of profits with return on capital of 16pc and that is obviously not going to continue ,” said chairman John Nelson . \n“So what we are seeing is tremendous competition coming in, lots of capital coming in, attracted by the returns, and a lot of capital coming into Lloyds, which is seen as a very attractive place.” \nAs a result, return on capital was pushed down to 10.7pc in the first half of this year, with intense price competition. \nLloyds' combined ratio - the proportion of premiums that are paid out in claims and thus measures profitability - rose from 87.4pc to 89.7pc, indicating a fall in profitability. However this was still better than the industry average. \nThe group said it expected to see growth in regions such as China and Brazil continue as take-up of insurance rises in these regions. \nMr Nelson warned that some rival insurers could be overstretching themselves by offering broad coverage at low prices. \n“The carriers are coming in to compete with Lloyds, offering low rates and in some cases broader coverage. Obviously the concern about that is if conditions change, which they will if we get catastrophe claims and so on, how secure and sustainable is that capital for the long term?” he said. \n“At Lloyds, we operate a very disciplined underwriting regime so we will certainly be there, but the worry for the insurance market is to ensure the capital coming in is there for the long term.” \n= Poor returns = \nMuch of the fall in profits came from poor returns on Lloyds’ investments, which dived by almost half from £647m in the first half of 2014 to £339m in the same period of this year. \nAs insurers have to hold highly liquid investments in case of a large payout being made, Lloyds already gets low returns thanks to rock-bottom interest rates. This year, rocky market conditions depressed those returns further, the group said, with recent turmoil in China expected to extend that run of weak returns into the second half of the year. \nMr Nelson said this had the side effect of driving other investors to seek better returns in high-performing markets driving them into insurance, where they compete with Lloyds of London. \n“ With very low interest rates and the returns that the insurance industry is showing, that is attracting capital in, therefore arbitraging out the spreads with massive competition. I do not see that changing in the short term,” he said. \n“In a sense, what would be helpful would be a gradual pickup in interest rates, which would tighten everything up a bit, and it would also provide other asset classes with the opportunity to attract capital.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T14:24:51.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
