A lack of clear and correct disclosures concerning college costs and financial aid causes confusion about college affordability. Some of the more egregious problems include:\nColleges often talk about loans as though they cut college costs or make college more affordable. Loans only postpone paying college expenses. t Financial aid award letters often blur the distinction between grants and loans. t Loans are mixed in with grants, without any distinction between the two types of aid. t Loans are not identified as loans and do not present important details like interest rates, fees, repayment terms, monthly payments or [entity display=\"total\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"total\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4402\"]total[/entity] payments. t Loans list the annual limit as the award amount, without any indication that the family can choose to borrow less, making it too easy to borrow to the limit. These problems cause students and parents to take on too much debt or the wrong type of debt. It shouldn’t be surprising that some students graduate with too much debt.To figure out how much to borrow and what types of loans to use, follow these four steps: Minimize debt. Enroll at a lower-cost college, such as an in-state public college or a college with a “no loans” financial aid policy , to reduce the amount of student loan debt. Maximize free money, such as grants and scholarships . Every dollar you save and every dollar you win is about a dollar less you’ll have to borrow. Since about half of college costs at an in-state public college come from living expenses, try to economize by buying used textbooks, renting them, and/or selling them back to the bookstore, minimizing the number of trips home from college and getting a roommate to split the rent. Live like a student while you’re in school, so you don’t have to live like a student after you graduate. Consider using tuition payment plans, which break up college costs into equal monthly installments, as a less expensive alternative to long-term debt. t Choose lower-cost loans. The most important difference between different types of education loans is in the cost. The eligibility criteria, borrower and cosigner requirements, loan limits and repayment plans also matter, but ultimately you should concentrate on minimizing the cost of the debt. Generally, students should borrow from the federal government first, because federal student loans are cheaper, more available and have better repayment terms. t Don’t borrow too much money. When a student has exhausted the loan limits on the Federal Stafford loan, it may be a sign that the student is over-borrowing. Total student loan debt at graduation should be less than the student’s expected annual starting salary. If total student loan debt is less than annual income, the student should be able to repay his or her loans in 10 years or less. Otherwise, the student will struggle to repay his or her loans, and may need alternate repayment plans like extended repayment or income-based repayment to afford the monthly loan payments. These repayment plans reduce the monthly payment by increasing the term of the loan to 20, 25 or even 30 years. This means you may still be repaying your loans when your children enroll in college. t Shop around when federal student loans are not enough. FederalParent PLUS loans, private student loans and private parent loans may be options when a student has reached the annual and/or cumulative limits on federal student loans. Depending on the credit history of the student and parents, as well as credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, private loans may be less expensive than the Federal Parent PLUS loan. But, borrowers must consider the tradeoffs. Borrowers with very good or excellent credit may be able to save a percentage point or two on the interest rate and fees.But federal student loans offer other benefits that may be lost, such as flexible deferments and forbearances, income-dependent repayment plans, loan forgiveness options, and death and disability discharges.
