The worries also contributed to a rally in the U.S. crude futures market, traders said.\nWhile some traders originally expected the outage to last for days, three sources said earlier that the company was now anticipating the loss of 6.1 million barrels in September.\nLight synthetic crude from the oil sands for October delivery jumped to $2.00 per barrel above the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. That was the strongest premium since late June and $6.50 higher than last Friday, prior to the fire.\nThe front to second month WTI spread CLc1-CLc2 tightened on Wednesday, trading from as wide as negative 68 cents up to negative 55 cents around midday, as traders anticipated less crude arriving at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the U.S. crude futures contract.
