Named ‘Smart Vault’, the locker is equipped with a multi-layer security system, including biometric and PIN authentication and debit cards, among others. Customers can access it without any intervention by the branch staff, ICICI Bank said in a statement. “Through the Smart Vault, we bring a very different, much more convenient, state-of-the-art branch experience to the customers,” ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar said after its launch. The ‘Smart Vault’ is an example of ‘Make in India’ programme as it has been designed and manufactured by Indian partners, she said. “The vault uses robotic technology to access the lockers from the safe vault and enables customers to access their lockers at any time of their preference,” said the statement issued by ICICI Bank.
