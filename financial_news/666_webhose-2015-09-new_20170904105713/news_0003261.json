So equipped, you can shrug off the panic-inducing headlines and keep on truckin’.\nIt works in part because the indexed investor doesn’t try to time the market or even beat the market. Instead, you make regular contributions to investment capital, buying into chosen vehicles by the calendar. Sometimes prices are high, and you buy fewer shares. Sometimes prices are low, and you buy more shares.\nBest investments for the next 10 years (6:27) Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates uses current valuations to predict future returns. Emerging Markets look great, he says, while U.S. stocks don't offer much upside.\nThis practice, known as “dollar-cost averaging,” disciplines investors in two ways. First is the logical behavior of buying more when prices are cheaper than when they are expensive. Second, scheduled purchases are habit-forming, which helps keep up an indexed investor’s courage when all around them are losing theirs.\nInvestors needn’t be robotic about this. Suppose, for instance, an investor contributes monthly on the 15th. The U.S. market started turning down on Aug. 19. With prices suddenly more attractive, the investor could move up the September contribution to take advantage. But don’t stretch this too far or the discipline will be lost.\nChoosing to reinvest dividends amplifies the benefits. No matter how often they are distributed, automatic reinvestment achieves the same results as dollar-cost averaging. The amounts of money involved may be smaller than contributions, but over time these incremental additions build up.\nSometimes, doing nothing is the best thing you can do. Indexed investing is essentially an exercise in asset allocation. Stocks and bonds are the two biggest asset classes, and many investors stick to them. Stocks provide growth and bonds offer regular income. Interest rates are low now, but it’s important to build a portfolio for the long run rather than current conditions.\nHow much to allocate to each asset class is largely a matter of how much time there is to reach the investment goal. If you’re young and retirement is far in the future, a stock allocation of 70% to 90% isn’t unreasonable. As you get older you should trim that portion, but not much below 60% because post-retirement is growing longer.\nAn imperative consideration for both stocks and bonds is whether to confine your portfolio to U.S. securities or to include other parts of the world. The U.S. markets offer relative stability but lower growth. International markets have greater growth potential but are more volatile.\nOnce you have decided these issues, you can choose the investment vehicles to execute your strategy. Index-tracking mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are the two main types. Mutual funds work better with dollar-cost averaging because there are no fees for buying directly from the fund, which puts more money to work.\nHowever, ETFs are proliferating faster and attracting more assets these days. You pay commissions to buy and sell them, but they are more tax-efficient than mutual funds. Moreover, they can be traded whenever the exchange is open rather than just end-of-day, which is the case with mutual funds.\nTo illustrate, suppose we build a portfolio that is 60% stocks and 40% bonds. We decide to take a global perspective because there is more equity and debt outstanding beyond the United States than in it. And we favor ETFs, despite the commissions, because there are more index-based choices.\nA global equity fund can handle the stock allocation. We choose Vanguard Total World Stock VT, -0.94% because it has the lowest management fee (0.17%) of 18 ETFs in the category. Also, it holds close to 7,000 stocks, which means its coverage is more thorough than funds that build portfolios of 1,000-2,000 stocks with “sampling” techniques.\nThere is no index-based global bond ETF; all on offer are actively managed. So, we choose iShares Core Total USD Bond Market IUSB, +0.15% , which includes taxable bonds from around the world that were issued in U.S. dollars DXY, +0.00% . Most are U.S. bonds, of course, but 13% of current holdings are international. And there is no currency risk.\nThis portfolio held up quite well in the three weeks from Aug. 17 to Sept. 4. Its biggest drawdown was less than 1% on Aug. 28. It ended the period 5.8% higher than when it started. By contrast, the Russell 3000 dropped 11% at its nadir on Aug. 25 and ended the period 8% below its Aug. 17 level.\nThree weeks is way too short a period to validate an investment strategy. Diversification paid off in this case, but it wasn’t much help in the crash of 2008. Nonetheless it’s clear that even a simple indexed portfolio can navigate much market turmoil as long as the owner doesn’t panic.\nSometimes, doing nothing is the best thing you can do.\nJohn Prestbo is retired as editor and executive director of Dow Jones Indexes, now part of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in which Dow Jones & Co., publisher of MarketWatch, holds a small interest.
