For many the cost of fuel can also prove prohibitive while environmental groups criticised the impact of the traditional stoves. \nModern versions can be easily switched on and off, including with a smartphone, while smaller models have been created to appeal to city dwellers. \nAround 80 percent of those sold today are the newer, more efficient designs that have been launched since 2011, and are offered in a variety of colours from rose, pewter and lemon to pistachio and aubergine. \n\"You can get all the virtues of an Aga in a 60 centimetre package, which is something we'd expect over the next five to 10 years to become a more and more appreciable part of the business,\" said McGrath. The largest version of the stove can be 2.5 times that size. \nASPIRATIONAL LIVING \nMcGrath said the new owner was also drawn to its heritage - a company with a history that reads like a spy novel. \nCreated in 1922, the first Aga was invented by Swedish Nobel Prize winning physicist Gustaf Dalen who, confined to his home after being blinded in an accident, witnessed his wife struggling to cook on their old range. \nBy 1929 manufacturing had begun in central England, with early sales driven by David Ogilvy, a salesman who went on to become one of the most famous advertising men in the world, the original 'Mad Men' and founder of the Ogilvy & Mather ad agency. \nNewer versions were designed by Raymond Loewy - who produced some of the most famous product designs in history, including Greyhound Scenicruiser buses, Coca-cola vending machines, Lucky Strike boxes and the livery of Air Force One. He worked with Douglas Scott, who later designed London's famous red buses. \nA written history of the company notes however that several of the leading protagonists including Ogilvy, his brother Francis and W.T. Wren, an early Aga boss, also played important roles for Britain in World War Two, either as spies, writing for Winston Churchill or in aircraft manufacturing. \nBritain is still Aga's biggest market but they can now be found in the United States, Europe and China, and Middleby aims to take the brand further afield. \nThe sale adds to concern among some Britons about the number of prominent companies that have been bought by foreign owners, including department store Harrods, toy brand Hamleys and chocolate maker Cadbury. They fear that such sales could ultimately put UK jobs at risk and dilute much of the brand's appeal - its intrinsic Britishness. \nMcGrath is more positive, saying his firm hopes to mirror the success of another luxury British brand, Jaguar Land Rover, which has flourished under the ownership of India's Tata Group . \n\"We'd love to get in the wheel tracks of Jaguar Land Rover,\" said McGrath. \"Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the product has evolved, the potential can be immense because the brand is much loved.\" ($1 = 0.6513 pounds) (Editing by Susan Fenton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T14:14:38.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
