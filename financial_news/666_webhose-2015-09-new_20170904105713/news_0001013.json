The bombing killed 17 sailors and injured more than three dozen.\nThe plaintiffs, 15 American sailors injured in the attack and three of their spouses, filed a lawsuit in 2010 against Sudan in Washington, D.C., claiming the country provided material support to al Qaeda that helped facilitate the bombing.\nIn 2012, a federal judge in Washington issued a default judgment of $314.7 million against Sudan, which did not respond to the lawsuit.\nIn an effort to collect some of the money, the plaintiffs secured orders from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in New York requiring the banks to turn over certain assets they held for Sudan.\nThe amount of money held in the accounts is redacted from court filings.\nThe banks themselves were not parties to the appeal and did not contest the orders.\nIn a statement, Mashreqbank said it turned over the funds, which were frozen under U.S. sanctions, in December 2013, pursuant to the court order. Credit Agricole also confirmed it had turned over the money.\nA representative of BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs were not available on Wednesday for comment.\nSudan's appeal of the turnover orders was the first time the country made a formal appearance in the case.\nSudan argued the original lawsuit was not properly served on its foreign minister and said the lower court failed to follow the appropriate steps in issuing the turnover orders.\nThe appeals court, however, rejected both arguments.\nSudan faces other judgments as well. A federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia, ordered the country in March to pay USS Cole victims and their families $48 million, while a judge in Washington ordered Sudan and Iran in March to pay a combined $75 million.\nThe case in Wednesday's ruling is Harrison et al v. Republic of Sudan, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-121.
