Take the University of Michigan, for example. Last year, Michigan finished a dreadful 5-7, saw scores of seats at the Big House in Ann Arbor sit empty and had students call for athletic director Dave Brandon's job after both the losses and an incident in which the team sent quarterback Shane Morris back onto the field immediately after he suffered a concussion. \nHowever, with Brandon having long since resigned (and now running both Toys 'R' Us and Dominos), coach Brady Hoke fired and former San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh leading the Wolverines, average ticket prices are up almost 52% ($113 to $171) on the secondary market, according to ticket brokerage aggregator TiqIQ. In fact, the folks in Salt Lake City who watched the University of Utah take down the Wolverines 24-17 in Harbaugh's debut paid an average of $421 for the pleasure. \nHow steep are college ticket prices at the highest level? Well, just consider that preseason No. 2 TCU (with an average resold ticket price of $117) and No. 3 Alabama ($164) don't even make the Top 10 among the nation's costliest college football teams. Reigning national champion and preseason No. 1 Ohio State and its average $198 tickets are impressive, but only good enough for No. 5 in the ticket rankings. It trails preseason No. 25 Tennessee ($199), unranked Texas A&M ($201, or almost $60 more than the average University of Texas ticket), No. 9 Georgia ($235) and No 11 Notre Dame ($332).
