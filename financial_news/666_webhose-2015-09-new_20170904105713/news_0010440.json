Oil Search had lifted 3.53 per cent to $7.04.\nBut they all lost ground as trading continued, following the release of weak manufaturing figures in China — Australia’s biggest trading partner — and closed in the red.\nSantos was hit heavily, closing 6.6 per cent lower at $4.79. Woodside shares closed 2 per cent lower at $31.62 and Oil Search ended down 0.9 per cent at $6.74.\nThe banks again fell heavily, with ANZ down 3.1 per cent and Westpac off 2.9 per cent.
