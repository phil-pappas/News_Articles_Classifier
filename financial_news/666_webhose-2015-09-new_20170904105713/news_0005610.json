It now serves more than 20,000 students in over 20 cities in China and maintains high retention rate and customer satisfaction rate.\n\"We are excited about our acquisition of Firstleap as we believe it will complement and extend our tutoring service offerings in the pre-K to college space, as well as help us gain more insight into childhood development and learning,\" said TAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bangxin Zhang. \"Firstleap has built a strong online-to-offline platform offering comprehensive tutoring services to children. This acquisition aligns well with our vision to position TAL at the intersection of where education meets technology. After the acquisition, we plan to keep Firstleap as a separate brand for independent operation within the company structure. Firstleap will continue to provide practical English training focusing on qualitative development in the live context, as is the latest trend in English tutoring. Our organic small class Lejiale English business will be specialized in exam-oriented English subject tutoring, while our other proprietary brand Lewaijiao will provide online one-on-one oral English tutoring by native English speaking teachers. The separate brands will also work together with Shunshun Liuxue, the online C2C overseas studies consulting platform in which we have invested recently. We expect to see all these separate brands to grow into integrated businesses under the TAL umbrella.\"\nThe total consideration for this acquisition is not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
