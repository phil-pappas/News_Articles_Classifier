Last season, the five broadcast networks launched 54 new shows; 35 didn’t make it, according to the advertising and media-buying firm Dentsu. This time around, the networks will debut 44 shows this season. Most will quietly fail, a few will be spectacular flops and a handful will succeed. Below is a look at some of the biggest bets.\nWatch the trailer for ‘Supergirl.’ ‘Supergirl’ (CBS Mondays 8 p.m. starting in November) Think superhero meets “The Devil Wears Prada.” If “Supergirl” feels like it belongs on the CW Network that’s because it was developed there before CBS picked it up off waivers. The network hopes that like last season’s surprise success “Scorpion,” “Supergirl” will bring the network younger viewers. It’s a swing for the fences, but going head-to-head against Fox’s “Gotham” could result in a quick strikeout.\nWatch the trailer for ‘The Grinder.’ ‘The Grinder’ (Fox Tuesdays 8:30 p.m.) Coming off a season of big ratings declines, Fox is betting heavily on this sitcom starring Rob Lowe as an actor who plays a lawyer on TV. After his series ends, he decides to try his hand at actually practicing law alongside his dorky and jealous brother ( Fred Savage). Mr. Lowe is charming, but is there enough material here to build a case for an entire series?\nWatch the trailer for ‘Quantico.’ ‘Quantico’ (ABC Sundays 10 p.m.) This drama follows a group of FBI recruits from intense training at the academy in Quantico, Va. to the real world, where one is accused of taking part in a terrorist attack on New York City. Amid the flashbacks to training and pre-FBI lives, hints are dropped about what’s real and what isn’t. The show feels like a Shonda Rhimes drama along the lines of “Scandal” or “Grey’s Anatomy,” leading some to dub it “How to Get Away with Terrorism.”\nWatch the trailer for ‘Blindspot.’ ‘Blindspot’ (NBC Mondays 10 p.m.) A beautiful naked tattoo-covered woman with amnesia is found in Times Square. No, she’s not another desnuda trying to hit up tourists for change. Turns out she’s a former Navy SEAL. The FBI agent assigned to mind her—whose name is mysteriously tattooed on her back—is assigned to decipher the tattoos and stop the terrorists. NBC hopes that it can bring back some of the Monday night audience the network lost when it moved “The Blacklist” to Thursday.\nWatch the trailer for ‘My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.’ ‘My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ (CW Mondays 8 p.m.) Cocreated by comedian and YouTube sensation Rachel Bloom (think Amy Schumer with a dirtier mind and more musical talent), “My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” was originally made for Showtime and will have to have its mouth cleaned out with soap before it can air on the CW. The title is self-explanatory but not only does Ms. Bloom’s character stalk her ex-boyfriend, she sings about it too. Hopefully the risqué wit Ms. Bloom has shown in her music videos (whose titles we can’t print here) won’t be softened too much by the CW.\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:46:42.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
