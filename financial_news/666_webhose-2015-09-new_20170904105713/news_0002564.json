That’s more in line with companies with ratings closest to junk than the A grade that Volkswagen has from Standard & Poor’s. Credit-default swaps traders drove up the cost to protect against losses on debt across the auto industry as they braced for the potential of a widening probe.\nThe rapid selloff in the debt of such a large and creditworthy borrower was starting to remind some investors of the market fallout when BP Plc faced cleanup costs from the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Volkswagen faces questions from its supervisory board over how much its leaders knew about a scheme intended to dupe regulators and consumers about emissions of diesel engines installed in 11 million cars worldwide, a person familiar with the matter said.\n“You don’t know the extent of the financial hit to VW,” said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research in Portland, Oregon, at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $127 billion. “Remember what happened to BP as well,\" she said. Some investors “can’t afford even an interim price loss,\" she said. \"You’ll see them exit the position.”\nThe auto-maker faces civil penalties of as much as $19.9 billion for government allegations covering the 482,000 diesel cars it sold in the U.S., CreditSights Inc. analyst Brian Studioso wrote in a report Sept. 20. What could cost the company even more, he said, are unknowns such as reputational damage that could crimp demand and weigh on bond ratings as well as the prospect that Volkswagen will face lawsuits.\nJeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said she could not comment on the impact of penalties on bondholders or securities trading.\nVolkswagen’s $42.7 billion worth of bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate index lost 2.2 percent on Monday and were poised to show further declines for Tuesday. The extra cost investors demanded to own all of the debt in that index climbed an average of 2 basis points to 157 basis points, matching a more than two-year high.\nThe automaker’s $750 million of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds due in 2020 saw their yield jump to 4.64 percent from 2.39 percent last week as their price tumbled more than 10 cents on the dollar.\n\"You’ve got some severe damage that they’ve done to their reputation beyond just the cost to fix the problem and the fines that they might face here and in other countries,\" said Joe Mayo, who heads credit research at Conning & Co., a global insurance investment manager that oversees about $92 billion of assets. He said he’s concerned by the \"lack of visibility\" revealed by the scandal, and that it raises questions about practices of others in the industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T04:54:31.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
