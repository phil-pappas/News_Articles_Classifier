AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The international economics establishment has stepped up pressure on the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates, with the World Bank the latest institution to warn that the US central bank risks sparking \"panic and turmoil\" in emerging markets if it increases rates next week.\nWorld Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu reportedly said that growing uncertainty over China's economy and the knock-on effect on the world meant that a Fed rate rise would have negative global consequences.\nIt follows similar recent warnings from the International Monetary Fund, although appears at odds with with the Reserve Bank of Australia's preference for the Fed to begin lifting rates.\n\"I don't think the Fed lift-off itself is going to create a major crisis but it will cause some immediate turbulence,\" Mr Basu told the Financial Times .\n\"It is the compounding effect of the last two weeks of bad news with that [China devaluation] ... In the middle of this it is going to cause some panic and turmoil.\"\n\"The world economy is looking so troubled that if the US goes in for a very quick move in the middle of this I feel it is going to affect countries quite badly,\" he said.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee's highly anticipated meeting next Wednesday and Thursday will debate the merits of lifting rates for the first time in almost nine years.\nFinancial markets are pricing in about a 28 per cent chance of a hike, with most bond traders favouring a deferral to upcoming meetings in October or December.\n When the Fed dropped rates to near zero in 2008 and later embarked on a $US4 trillion bond buying stimulus, money flowed into fast-growing emerging economies in search of the higher returns.\nIn recent weeks, funds have poured out of slowing emerging market economy bonds, equities and currencies, in anticipation of a Fed rate rise and due to China's economic headwinds.\nChina's 4 per cent yuan devaluation last month, its tumbling stock market and slowing economic growth, have triggered concerns about the outlook in other emerging market economies.\nEmerging market currencies including the Brazilian real, Russian rouble, South African rand, Mexican peso, Turkish lira, South Korean won and Vietnamese dong have been hammered in the past couple of months. Oil and mining exporters such as Russia have also suffered from plunging commodity prices.\nThe IMF has repeatedly warned in recent months that it would be premature for the Fed to increase the cost of borrowing, pointing to risks to growth in the US and emerging economies, as well as from a surging US dollar .\nIMF chief Christine Lagarde said at a Group of 20 meeting in Turkey on the weekend that the IMF \"thinks that it is better to make sure that data are absolutely confirmed, that there is no uncertainty, neither on the front of price stability nor on the employment and unemployment front, before it actually makes that move\".\nThe commentary from international institutions has put the Fed in an awkward spot.\nEven though the Fed's policy decisions can impact the global economy, its mandate from the US Congress is to focus on inflation and employment in the US.\nThe US economy grew at a robust annual pace of 3.7 per cent in the June quarter and unemployment dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 per cent last month. Inflation remains persistently weak, below a 2 per cent target.\nSome international observers worry that rising US rates and China's slowdown could inflict ructions similar to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when hot money was yanked out of developing economies like Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. Their currencies collapsed and foreign debts ballooned, impaling economies across east Asia.\nThough the World Bank's outlook is not as dire, the Washington-based institution is concerned about a slowdown.\n\"There is a concern in emerging economies all around in case China takes a hit,\" Mr Basu said.\n\"This is the problem right now in the world ... Overall we are going to get into a slower global growth phase.\"\n\"All this put together and what has happened over the past two weeks with the Chinese markets leads one to believe the scenario is looking worse than it did even in June.\"\nA rising US dollar, which would likely be boosted further by a Fed rate rise, may also put pressure on the balance sheets of companies in emerging markets that borrowed unhedged in US dollars.\nBank for International Settlements figures show that emerging market corporate debt has more than doubled in US dollar terms in China, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Mexico since 2008.\nNon-resident portfolio flows in emerging markets turned negative last month for the first time in 2015, the Institute of International Finance reported. Equity flows bore the brunt of the outflows, with $US8.7 billion being pulled.", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e5142190-5630-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3lB8WVMB9", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-09T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:08:10.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
