Such company shall within a period of one year from the date of such direction comply with direction issued,\" it said in the draft. While it was earlier anticipated life insurers would bring out initial public offerings (IPOs) soon after they complete 10 years in the sector, none of them did so. This was due to stress in business, no higher foreign direct investment (which has now been raised to 49 per cent) and poor market conditions, among others.
