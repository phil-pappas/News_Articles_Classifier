The reason behind this ‘recipe for success’ is that Katti Batti stars Imran Khan and especially, Kangana Ranaut , who has transformed into a B.O. queen due to her recent movies turning into virtual goldmines for producers.\nKangana Ranaut has burnished her reputation immensely with her ability to draw crowds to theatres with the off-beat characterisation of common girl themes that tend to transcend most acceptable brackets in India. A repeat performance is anticipated with Katti Batti.\nWhile last week’s release Hero will not up up any resistance against Katti Batti as a rival to the box office collections take, another release may well pose a problem. We are talking about Messenger of God (MSG 2), starring godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim, which did phenomenally well when its first part had hit theatres. However, while at the first instance it had received a lot of attention due to the controversy then generated, this time that same ‘magic formula’ may not work. Having said that, MSG 2 caused a huge traffic jam in Gurgaon a couple of days ago during a special screening.\nOn the ground, it is being reported that Katti Batti box office collections are set for a nasty surprise as the occupancy rate in theatres is just 30%-35%, which is a massive setback as it has been promoted very well indeed. The weekend collections now will be dependent a lot on the word of mouth.\nTake the opinion poll, tell us what you think:\nTake Our Poll ‘Katti Batti’ box office collections: Imran Khan could not be bothered less\nJust ahead of the release of his film, Imran Khan says ‘Katti Batti’ box office collections were not really something that he is bothered about.\nSpeaking to the media 32-year-old Imran Khan said, “To be really honest, I am not really bothered about the commercial success of this movie.
