U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $11.80 an ounce at $1,142.00.\n\"In her speech, Yellen said... the Fed would most likely still hike rate this year, so on the back of that the dollar gained some value. Gold came off in the Far East, and has been coming off in Europe,\" MKS' head of trading Afshin Nabavi said.\n\"$1,140 and $1,135 were levels of resistance we had on the way up, so now they have turned into a bit of support.\"\nYellen's speech sent the dollar to a five-week high against a basket of major currencies, and lifted it 1 percent against the euro.\nThe world's top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, saw a third straight day of inflows, with its holdings up 3.87 tonnes to 680.27 tonnes on Thursday.\nThe central banks of Russia and Kazakhstan raised their gold holdings for a sixth straight month in August, while Jordan and the United Arab Emirates both bolstered their reserves in July,\nSilver was down 0.6 percent at $15.02 an ounce, while platinum was down 1 percent at $943.25 an ounce and palladium was up 1.2 percent at $661.55 an ounce.\nPlatinum hit a 6-1/2-year low on Wednesday and is set for its biggest weekly drop since mid-July on fears that demand from the auto sector, where the metal is used in diesel catalysts, could fall following the Volkswagen emissions scandal.\nPalladium, which is used more heavily in gasoline autocatalysts, is poised for its biggest weekly rise since March 2013 meanwhile, up 8 percent, on expectations that consumers could move away towards gasoline vehicles.
