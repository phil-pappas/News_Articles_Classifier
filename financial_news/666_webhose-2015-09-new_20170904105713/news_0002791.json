Tomorrow, they will start demanding the videos of what has been happening in people’s bedrooms,” Tewari said.\n“The BJP is a Fascist party. First, they try to intrude and transgress into kitchens through various meat bans, and now, they want to transgress into people’s bedrooms by this absurd policy,” he added.\nAs per the original version of the draft policy, users of services that use encryption to secure communication, such as WhatsApp and other instant messaging services, were required to store all their communication for as long as 90 days and make them available to law enforcement agencies when legally asked to.\nAfter the widespread protests by Indian Internet users and experts, the Department of Electronics and Information Technology today said that the social media websites and applications will be exempted from the purview of the National Encryption Policy.\n 22, 2015 7:12 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:55:25.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
