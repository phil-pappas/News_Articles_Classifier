Marko Djurica by Alan Mitchell Almost everywhere we turn we see our political leaders struggling with the pressures of globalisation.\nIn Ankara, Joe Hockey railed at so-called corporate tax avoiders while, at home, Bill Shorten rails at the bilateral trade agreement with China and Tony Abbott comes under the pressure to take more refugees from Syria.\nHowever, the vehicles for corporate tax avoidance are the same international supply chains that offer Australian trade-exposed industries their best chance of success in fiercely competitive global product and capital markets.\nThese supply chains also are ladders for the development of third world countries struggling to become the next generation of middle- and high-income export markets for countries like Australia.\nDavid Rowe Under the leadership of the United States, the developed economies are acting to close the \"loopholes\" in their corporate tax systems – although, to the displeasure of the Americans, some countries, including Australia, are taking unilateral action.\nWill it work? Unilateral action necessarily is limited by diplomatic pressure from the US and because it can put our own multinationals at a competitive disadvantage.\nAnd even the multilateral effort to shore up the company profits tax base is likely to be vulnerable to further aggressive tax planning which, in turn, will force Australian governments to rely more on value-added taxes such as the GST to get at the Australian transactions of multinational companies.\nOf course, as the Europeans have discovered, in a globalised economy, borders can be almost as porous as corporate tax regimes.\n The surprising thing is that it has taken so long for the river of Middle Eastern and African refugees to become a flood.\nThe Abbott government is in the painful process of responding to pressure to take more Syrian refugees.\nShorten, who already had proposed to increase the refugee intake as a concession to his middle-class supporters for Labor's decision to join the Coalition parties in \"stopping the boats\", seized the moment to embarrass Abbott.\nBut potentially it is as difficult an issue for Shorten as it is for Abbott. Both need the support of blue-collar workers who see themselves competing with unskilled migrants (or, even more threatening, highly productive skilled migrants with unrecognised qualifications) for jobs and government services and benefits.\nJust the tip of the iceberg Shorten is pandering to this fear of increased competition in the labour market when he attacks the Abbott government's free trade agreement with China.\nYet the heavily safeguarded use of foreign labour allowed in the agreement is just a hint of what inevitably is to come.\nTrade in services will be crucial for high-income, service-dominated economies such as Australia. And in return for accepting our lawyers, bankers and engineers, the emerging market and developing economies increasingly will demand that we accept their less skilled workers.\nIf the thought of more foreign workers in Australia comes as a shock, it will be just one of many shocks, as more and more white and blue collar jobs by are bundled off to the low-cost links in ever multiplying global supply chains.\nThese global supply chain links are not going to go away. If anything, they will become more user-friendly as the governments of low-wage countries improve their institutions to suit foreign businesses.\nThe refugees and economic migrants won't be going away either – at least not so far as the Europeans are concerned, and not for Australia either if, as is likely, we are corralled into participating in a global response.\nIt is not just ISIS and the war in Syria. Bureaucrats were warning the Australian government in the 1980s that refugees and illegal migration were about to become a major global issue. The arrival of the Boeing 747 and the era of international mass transport had shrunk distances and transformed attitudes among the visited as well as the visitors.\nThe third world's increasingly educated and mobile young inevitably would be less willing than their parents to accept the political upheavals, mismanagement and predation of their own governments.\nAs often happens, the flood was slower to build than the experts predicted in the 1980s, but it had inundated Europe's borders well before the Syrians were forced to flee their country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:08:17.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
