The two nations restored diplomatic ties and reopened embassies this summer.\nHowever, many restrictions remain on travel. U.S. citizens can visit the Communist-ruled island only for a dozen purposes, including cultural exchange, journalism and religious activities, but general vacations are barred. On Friday the Obama administration issued a new rule allowing authorized travelers to visit Cuba with their close relatives.\nU.S. airlines cannot operate scheduled flights to Cuba. While the countries reached a formal air transport agreement in 1953, carriers have been limited to operating charter services for specialist tour groups since the 1959 revolution.\nWhile major U.S. airlines have all expressed a desire to add Cuba to their route maps, American Airlines Group Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp might stand to benefit most. They have focused more on the Caribbean than their U.S. rivals, offering travelers many connecting opportunities.\n(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York and Arshad Mohammed in Washington; Writing by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)\nCuba", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:53:56.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
