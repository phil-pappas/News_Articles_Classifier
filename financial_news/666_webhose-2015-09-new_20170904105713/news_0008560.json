They pride themselves on being a company that’s flawless.”\nApple’s headquarters in San Francisco did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday. An Apple spokesman in Sydney said the company had no comment.\nDespite any troubles, significant numbers of iOS users had upgraded; more than 16 percent, according to Mixpanel, a San Francisco, California-based analytics company, as of 4 p.m. PDT (2300 GMT) Thursday.\nERROR MESSAGE\nCharlie Brown, a technology expert at Sydney-based Cybershack, said any number of dissatisfied customers was significant in the social media era, particularly following the troubled rollout of iOS 8. Apple released several further updates to iOS8, but some of the bugs were never fully fixed.\n“The risk to Apple in terms of having dissatisfied customers is that as their customer base grows, so will the number of those dissatisfied customers,” said Brown.\nOne group of users reported that iOS 9 upgrade would fail after several minutes, requiring them to start the process over. Many posted screen shots of the error message they received: “Software Update Failed”.\nThat problem was likely caused by servers that were overloaded when too many people tried to download the upgrade simultaneously, tech analysts said.\n“It’s like the Black Friday thing,” said Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research, referring to the major U.S. shopping sale day after Thanksgiving. “Some websites get creamed on the traffic on Black Friday.”\nOther users, many of them with older devices, reported their devices seizing up on a “swipe to upgrade” page. The latest upgrade had been deemed by Apple as “friendly” to the older devices after the iOS 8 problems.\n“Apple were saying the downloading mechanism doesn’t take as much space to download,” said Sydney-based Graham McKay, an IT support specialist.\nMcKay and Brown said they always advised clients to wait several days before downloading any new upgrades from Apple, Google Inc or Microsoft Corp to make sure any glitches had been found and ironed out.\nMetering the upgrade, or allowing users to upgrade in waves rather than all at once, would have been a smarter approach, O’Donnell said.\n“It’s a lot about setting expectations,” he said.\nApple did this week delay the release of watch OS 2, its updated operating system for the Apple Watch after it discovered a bug in development.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 4:36 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T02:51:17.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
