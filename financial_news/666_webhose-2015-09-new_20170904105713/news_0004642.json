Exports were up a small 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, helped by stronger sales of U.S.-made autos and machinery, while imports declined 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion.\nSo far this year, the deficit is running 3.6 percent above last year's level, reflecting weaker export sales. The concern is that U.S. growth will be hurt by further declines in exports, reflecting a stronger dollar and overseas weakness in nations such as China.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:53:44.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
