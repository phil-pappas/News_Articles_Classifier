Pat Scala Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak The draining of foreign exchange reserves by some of the world's central banks does not look good for the Australian dollar.\nThe Australian dollar bull run coincided with a push by central banks from Kazakhstan to Switzerland to diversify their reserves, introducing strong demand for the currency and leading to its overvaluation. Now, they might be starting to cool their interest.\nIndeed, central bank currency interventions such as the large scale one undertaken by the People's Bank of China, have also led strategists to speculate the rebalancing of reserves will be a negative force for the Australian dollar. This is because central banks sell US dollars when they need to defend their currencies, and as the time comes to top up those reserves, they tend to fund the US dollar shortfall by selling other components of their reserve portfolios.\nChina devalued the yuan last month but it has still been a seller of US dollars lately because of its stabilisation efforts aimed at keeping the yuan from falling too sharply. The Chinese economy is also experiencing capital outflows.\nOn Monday, China revealed the largest single-month decline of foreign exchange reserves on record, at around $US93.9 billion ($134.5 billion), reducing its balance to $US3.6 trillion.\nSince China's warchest of foreign exchange reserves has never been disclosed, experts can only guess at the extent of its non-US dollar holdings. But using a crude benchmark of 2 per cent as the average central bank allocation to Australian dollars, the People's Bank of China August activity implies it would be a net seller of around $US2 billion Australian dollars.\nDownslope Other central banks in emerging markets facing currency depreciation are said to be whittling down their reserves too.\n \"If all the central banks in the world, including those like China who don't report the breakdown, hold reserves in similar proportions you could say there's at least [$US200 billion] held in Australian dollars around the world,\" said Ray Attrill, National Australia Bank's global co-head of foreign exchange strategy.\n\"We've just entered the downslope of an era that began after the Asian crisis.\"\nIn response to the Asian crisis, central banks in developing economies made enormous efforts to build-up their currency reserves so they could be better placed to defend currency levels in future times of distress. That has been largely successful.\nThe Australian dollar was fetching US69.47Â¢ on Tuesday.\nThe other trend in reserve activity that might be shifting is the reduced impetus to accumulate Australian dollars as China market access widens. The Australian dollar's role as a China proxy was another reason for central banks to diversify into Australia's currency during the China boom but if the renminbi is successful in achieving reserve status then the case for holding Australian dollars weakens.\n\"Central banks and fund managers haven't had full access to Chinese financial assets, one way of giving yourself some kind of quasi-sensitivity to China is the AUD, the most liquid currency in the region,\" Mr Attrill said.\nCentral bank activity remains one of the most opaque segments in the global foreign exchange market, making it difficult to track changes in portfolios. The Bank for International Settlements in its 2013 update affirmed the Australian dollar's status as the world's fifth-most traded currency behind the greenback, euro, yen and pound.\nChina could probably run its reserves down by a further $US700 billion before it comes up against reserve \"adequacy\" issues, said ANZ senior foreign exchange strategist Khoon Goh, estimating a minimum reserve level of around $US2.8 trillion.", "external_links": ["http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfx13fx.pdf", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:15:22.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
