In the event that DHN makes any payment under the guarantee, DHN would intend to pursue claims under these indemnities to seek to recover any outstanding amount,\" Diageo said in its annual report of 2015. \nThe company said the underlying security held by Standard Chartered included shares in UBL and Watson's interest in a venture that owns the Force India Formula One team. \n\"Under the terms of the guarantee, there are arrangements to pass on to DHN the benefit of the security package if it makes a payment under the guarantee of all amounts owed to Standard Chartered,\" it added. \nHowever, in June 2015, a consortium of banks led by the SBI obtained an order from the tribunal blocking the sale or transfer of UBL shares to Diageo. \nFlagging concerns that the company may not fully recover the amount, Diageo said, \"In light of the litigation risk associated with the UBL shares and the potential loss of realisable value of the F1 security during enforcement, Diageo believes that the outstanding amount may not be fully recoverable.\" \nMallya has been battling a number of cases, including against banks over a 'willful defaulter' tag related to loan defaults by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. \nEarlier this year, a 17-bank consortium led by state-run SBI had initiated the process of taking over physical possession of the prized Kingfisher House, worth Rs 100 crore. \nMallya has also been under scanner over issues at his various group companies, including United Spirits Ltd where he has sold the controlling stake to UK-based Diageo Plc. UK-based Diageo has spent nearly USD 3 billion for a controlling stake of about 55 per cent in United Spirits Ltd (USL). The company had first acquired 25 per cent in USL from Mallya-led UB Group in late 2012, while it bought further shares from non-promoters last year. \nIn April this year, Diageo-controlled USL Board said it has \"lost confidence\" in Vijay Mallya after an internal probe and a forensic inquiry by PwC revealed alleged fund diversion to Kingfisher and other UB group entities. USL said \"various improprieties and legal violations\" were found in the probe into loans given to UB Group firms and it asked Mallya to quit the board. \nHowever, Mallya rejected the charge against him and said Diageo has contractual obligations to support him. \nIn July, 2015, USL alleged irregularities and potential violations of law in diversion of funds by UB Group and said it is initiating process to recover dues of Rs 1,337 crore. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:14:36.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
