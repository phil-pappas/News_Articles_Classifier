(Photo: Business Wire) Wakisaka joins Nihon Rimini Street from SAP Japan, where he served most recently as vice president and senior business development executive for the Automotive Business Unit. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the growth and operations for SAP’s largest automotive company accounts on a global basis. During his 18-year tenure at SAP, Wakisaka held various roles of increasing engineering and executive responsibility, including VP and head of Pre-Sales, Value Engineering and Industry. Prior to SAP, Wakisaka was an engineer at NEC Office System Co. As a veteran of the enterprise IT industry, he brings proven experience in the growth and execution of global business development capabilities and operations in enterprise applications in Japan. “The adoption of independent support in the Japanese market continues to rise as enterprise leaders place more scrutiny on the high costs of maintaining enterprise software and the value they receive in return,” said Wakisaka. “Rimini Street helps companies in Japan and around the world save up to 90 percent on total maintenance costs for their ERP software and enables them to run their current systems without required upgrades for at least 15 years. With these significant savings, IT leaders can become business enablers, helping to fund more strategic initiatives that drive growth and innovation.” Rimini Street Continues Strong Momentum 18 Months After Launch Nihon Rimini Street, K.K., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rimini Street, Inc., launched its Japanese headquarters in Tokyo in 2014.
