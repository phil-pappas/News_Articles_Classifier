Sales are up 25.8% compared with the same time last year. \nHome prices are also on the upswing. According to the June Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index, prices rose 4.5% year over year. \n\"Recent housing data continues to show a strengthening housing sector,\" David Nice, economist and vice president at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, says in a blog post. \"This can't come at a better time, as it provides some soothing and stabilizing news in the face of recent volatility in the global equity markets.\" Get in where you fit in \nMortgage applications inched up 0.2% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly survey. A rise in government purchase loans led the increase; FHA and VA purchases were up 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. \nBusiness has been chaotic because of the recent stock market events, says Pava Leyrer, chief operating officer for Northern Mortgage Services in Grandville, Michigan. \"People are going crazy over trying to either lock in, or (asking) what can they do, or changing terms,\" she says. \nIt might be a good time to lock in your rate, Sinnott advises. \n\"A lot of lenders have policies in place (stating) that should rates improve by a certain amount, that you can take advantage of it.\" \nBut don't obsess too much over the interest rate attached to your loan, Leyrer says. \n\"Take what you can get and go with it,\" she says. \"Don't look back; look forward. Look to the excitement of your new home, not to whether or not you could have saved $10 or $20 off your payment.\" Share this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:17:52.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
