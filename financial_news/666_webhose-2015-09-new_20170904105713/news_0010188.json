The strike was started yesterday and even all the children have including my own never went to school yesterday. This means that this is not a teachers' strike. This is a strike for the whole nations for children and teachers are saying that this time round, they have exploited all the avenues and this money must be given to them,\" Joshua Ogalo, a teacher in Kisumu stated. \nOgalo said that they will not back off until the government implements the 50-60 percent pay increment awarded to the teachers. 1 | 2 \nHe noted that teachers will be visiting banks more often to see if the pay rise has been wired into their bank accounts. \nThe strike came even as TSC insisted that the strike was illegal and that all tutors must report to class. \nREAD: Teachers strike enters day 2 as Treasury adamant \nAccording to the TSC's Public Relations Officer Kihumba Kamotho, the teachers must allow the legal process to run its course since there was still an appeal pending on the salary increment. \nTreasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich has already ruled out any possibility of paying the teachers, saying the government is not able to raise the Sh17 billion required to meet their demands. \nThe CS explained that the only way to meet the additional expenditure was to increase taxes for Kenyans, a move likely to raise public outcry. \nKNUT's lawyer Paul Muite told Capital FM News that the commission only required Sh1.4 billion to pay teachers their August monies and not Sh17 billion. \nHe pointed out that the funds can be availed from the Sh18.1 billion allocated to the TSC from the Contingency funds.
