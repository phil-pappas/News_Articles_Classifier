Lara Nobel says girls should not be intimidated about being in the construction industry. Picture: Annette Dew Source: News Limited\n“We know it’s undervalued and it shouldn’t be,” he said.\n“I would encourage more people to put their ‘lets explore’ hat on and look at all the opportunities in vocational education and the careers that extend form that.\n“Universities don’t release how many drop outs they have but we know many kids go to TAFE after (university) to get some skill or trade.”\nThere are 64 traditional trades on the Federal Government’s Nationals Skills Needs List, ranging from arborists and bricklayers to carpenters and cooks.\nVocational students also are more likely to get jobs more quickly.\nIn 2014, less than 15 per cent of apprenticeship and traineeship graduates were unable to find a job within six months of completing their qualification, Department of Employment report Australian Jobs 2015 reveals.\nThose with a certificate III had the best employment prospects with 86.6 per cent in work soon after graduation, followed by those with a diploma or higher (85.5 per cent).\nBachelor degree graduates, by comparison, had a 68.1 per cent chance of finding full-time employment within four months of completing their degree – their lowest rates since at least 1990, according to GradStats.\nMORE: What young workers need to get a job\nFor apprentices and trainees, the biggest issue was encouraging them to see training through to completion.\nFor those commencing in 2010, contract completion rates were 46 per cent in trades occupations and 56 per cent in non-trades occupations, NCVER finds.\nThe rates ranged from 78 per cent for protective service workers to 31 per cent for food trades workers.\nThird-year carpentry apprentice and recent TAFE QLD Scholarship winner Lara Nobel said more people should consider a vocational pathway.\n“Society puts pressure on, saying that all smart people go to uni and that is not true at all. There are a hell of a lot of smart people at TAFE and there are different types of smart,” she said.\nMs Nobel, who also has a Masters in Architecture from university, chose her carpentry apprenticeship to gain hands-on experience.\n“You become a better architect if you know how to build and a better builder if you know how to design,” she said.\n“Sometimes girls are nervous about being in the construction industry but they shouldn’t be.\n“Maybe decades ago when we didn’t have power tools it was a bit harder and heavier to do but these days the tools are good and we can do anything the guys can.”\nTAFE QLD will award another 60 scholarships this year.
