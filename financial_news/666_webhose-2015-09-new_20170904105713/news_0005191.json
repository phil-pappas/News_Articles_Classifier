Furthermore, a high proportion of workers live in surrounding areas, allowing them to walk or bicycle to work,\" Mr Westaway said.\nJLL's head of strategic research, Australia, Andrew Ballantyne, said a shortage of contiguous options and a limited supply pipeline over the medium term meant upward pressure would be placed on rents in the Sydney fringe office market over the next 12 months.\nJLL's numbers show that prime gross effective rents have increased 6.4 per cent over the 2014-15 financial year.\n\"Furthermore, given the proximity to the CBD and strong demand for residential developments across the Sydney metropolitan area, we will see increased developer interest for office assets with adaptive reuse potential,\" Mr Ballantyne said.\n\"We have already seen this with Aqualand's most recent acquisition of the No. 8 Revy site in Pyrmont for $180 million, which is to be redeveloped into luxury apartments.\"\nMr Westaway said technology and education were growth sectors in NSW and there were several organisations on a rapid expansion path which would drive leasing activity in 2015-16.\nSavills' research team said the north shore market shrank by 24,734 square metres throughout 2014, representing a reduction in office space by 1.1 per cent.\nThe latest Property Council of Australia numbers show the overall vacancy rate for the combined north shore is 8.5 per cent.\n\"In the 12 months to June 2015, Savills identified 41,615 square metres of leasing activity in the north shore market. This is down 68.1 per cent on the 12 months prior, and down on the five-year average (86,890 square metres). The majority of these leases, of about 64 per cent of space, were leased in the North Ryde precinct,\" Savills researchers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T03:04:17.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
