Reuters by Josh Hall The rollercoaster ride in equity markets over recent months has highlighted that investing in the world's sharemarkets, particularly those of developing or emerging nations, can be a volatile ride.\nThe recent market volatility began in China where one of the major Chinese markets, the Shenzhen Index, increased in value by over 60 per cent from the beginning of 2015 to early June. By late August this same index had given up all those gains to be back to where it started the year. This volatility has also had ripple effects on other emerging and developed-world sharemarkets.\nBut is this kind of volatility normal? And if so, are emerging markets still worth investing in?\nYes, volatility is normal, but it can be sporadic. Global equity markets have generally been well behaved since the recovery from the global financial crisis started in 2010 where volatility and general falls in markets have been below long-term averages. However, intermittent volatility is to be expected and can actually be a good thing as it can offer a great entry point to those markets.\nAFR Graphics When considering any investment, an understanding of the risks involved is central to the decision to invest or not. When considering whether to invest in emerging markets here are some key risks to think over:\nCountry-specific risk As emerging markets, by definition, are still developing there can be an increased opaqueness within particular legal and political systems making it sometimes difficult to have confidence in the macro environment of that country .\nCompany-specific risk Information can be harder to come by for companies within these markets as they're generally less developed. Individual emerging markets can often be dominated by only a handful of companies that might all belong to the same industry. Such concentration can offer less-than-adequate diversification.\nCurrency risk Along with movements in that country's sharemarket, currency movements can amplify both gains and losses.\n The key to managing these risks is to understand the market before you choose to invest. This can be a difficult task and often requires specialised local knowledge. This is why most investors choose to access emerging markets via a managed fund.\nThere are numerous benefits to investing in these markets.\nEmerging markets account for more than half of global GDP according to the IMF World Economic Outlook 2014 despite only accounting for around 10 to 15 per cent of global sharemarkets by value. There is great potential for the further growth of emerging market sharemarkets over time.\nMore than 80 per cent of the world's population live in emerging markets and rapid urbanisation of many of these countries continues to be a key theme. This is creating significant investment opportunities for companies that offer goods and services for this emerging middle class.\nSome exposure to emerging markets can add significant diversification benefits to existing portfolios. Many SMSF investors are heavily skewed to just three asset classes: blue chip Australian equities, Australian residential property and cash or term deposits. A portfolio such as this could benefit from some exposure to emerging market equities.\nWhile its true that risks can be higher, emerging markets have outperformed strongly over the past 17 years and are worthy of consideration for inclusion in many portfolios.\nJosh Hall is an investment specialist at Aberdeen Asset Management", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:00:51.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
