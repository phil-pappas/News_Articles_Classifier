Negative US and Asian market cues coupled with anxiety over the upcoming domestic factory output data caused the major indices in the Indian stock market to fall marginally. The market has been moving sideways after a two-day rally. Indian markets were initially hammered by a sharp fall in the US markets and a fall in the Asian bourses. The news about Standard & Poor's downgrading of Brazil’s credit rating was added fuel. However, expectations that Bank of England (BoE) will continue with its \"easy monetary policy\" by maintaining lower interest rates and the gains made by the rupee buoyed markets and the market rebounded sharply from the day’s lows, even though Indian equities ended in the red. The continuous slide in the Chinese markets had spooked global investors and dampened Indian equities on fears of another recession due to the slowdown in the $10 trillion Asian economy. Among the Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled by 2.57% and Shanghai Composite Index slipped by 1.31%. On Wednesday, the US-based Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 239.11 points, or 1.45%, to 16,253.57. The S&P 500 lost 27.37 points, or 1.39%, to 1,942.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 55.40 points, or 1.15%, to 4,756.53. The fall in the US markets and S&P's downgrade of Brazil's ratings had a cascading effect on the Asian markets, which were subdued. The ECI (eight core industries) for select factory output slowed to 1.1% growth in July from an increase of 3% in the previous month. The ECI's constituents contribute a whopping 38% to the IIP (Index of Industrial Production). Sector-wise, out of 12 sub-indices of the BSE only capital goods and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) managed to stay afloat. The S&P BSE consumer durables index plunged by 187.324 points, information technology (IT) index plummeted by 81.90 points, metal index receded by 56.44 points, technology, entertainment and media (TECK) index declined by 48.05 points and bank index decreased by 25.16 points. The S&P BSE capital goods rose by 145.82 points and FMCG index inched higher by 1.14 points.
