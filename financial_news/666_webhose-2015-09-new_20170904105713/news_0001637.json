SIU spokeswoman Rae Goldsmith says the cuts were unavoidable because of a state budget stalemate and a funding reduction for the school because of lower enrollment this year. \nThe school's Morris Library will have nearly $460,000 in reductions, forcing librarians to decide which online database subscriptions to cancel. The school's public radio station, WSIU, is losing $97,000 or 10 percent of its state funding. The Paul Simon Public Policy Institute will absorb about $54,000 in cuts, or about 10 percent of its state funding. That will mean fewer events this year. \nInformation from: Southern Illinoisan, http://www.southernillinoisan.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:03:26.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
