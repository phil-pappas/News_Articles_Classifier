Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Cleveland Company offers a wide range of employee benefit services, allowing them the flexibility in creating a customized approach to meeting their client’s varying needs including employee benefits, human resources, employment law, executive benefits, executive coaching, compensation planning, and more. “Affordability and flexibility of health care plans has become the #1 topic for employers and families since the ACA,” says John Cleveland, partner of the Cleveland Company. “It is affordability, not only in the sense of how can I afford the premium, but also affordability in the sense of how much will I pay for health care at the time of care. This is a balancing act that, now more than ever, requires careful consideration, education and planning. Creative plan design and effective communication is what we are really good at. We will now be even more effective because of our affiliation with UBA.”\nAt the Cleveland Company, the cornerstone of their business is to work diligently to create a “culture of care” by providing education, direction and support to enhance the financial security of their clients and the employees they serve. Their specialty is creating success stories in this challenging, complex world of employee benefits by working closely with real people who have real problems.\n“The Cleveland Company emphasizes that they are a ‘culture of care’ and that makes them a perfect fit for the culture of UBA and its Partners,” says UBA CEO Les McPhearson. “Being in the benefits business, it is our mission to improve the lives of the clients being served by our Partner Firms. The addition of the Cleveland Company will undoubtedly help to further that mission.”\nAs the newest Partner Firm of UBA, the Cleveland Company joins a network of more than 130 employee benefits advisory firms that serve employers of all sizes across the United States, Canada, and Europe. As a combined group, UBA’s annual employee benefit revenues rank it among the top five employee benefit advisory organizations in the U.S.\nABOUT The Cleveland Company\nAn industry leader in the Twin Cities for over 25 years, the Cleveland Company began as an employee benefits consulting firm that helps employers create a caring culture.
