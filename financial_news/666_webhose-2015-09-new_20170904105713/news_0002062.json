Declares Special Dividend September 14, 2015 16:15 ET | Source: Marlin Business Services Corp. \nMOUNT LAUREL, N.J., Sept. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marlin Business Services Corp. (NASDAQ: MRLN ) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the declaration of a special dividend of $2.00 per share. The special dividend is payable on October 5, 2015 to shareholders of record as of September 24, 2015. The Company's Board does not expect the special dividend to affect the payment of the regular quarterly dividends, which remain subject to Board approval. \n\"Marlin's strong balance sheet and earnings capacity has put the Company in a position to return excess capital to our shareholders. Along with the Company's regular quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program, this special dividend further demonstrates our commitment to prudently manage capital and total shareholder return,\" said Daniel P. Dyer, Marlin's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. \n\"The Company maintains a strong capital position and payment of the special dividend will not change that in any way, nor will it be an obstacle to our strategic growth plans,\" said W. Taylor Kamp, Marlin's Chief Financial Officer. \"The payment of additional cash dividends, coupled with our continued execution on the $15 million stock repurchase program authorized by the Board in July 2014, strongly reflect the Company's commitment to our shareholders and the Board's confidence in the Company's business strategy,\" said Mr. Kamp. \nAbout Marlin Business Services Corp. \nMarlin Business Services Corp. is a nationwide provider of commercial lending solutions for small and mid-size businesses.
