The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the personal current account market , and banks are keen to show that customers are aware that they are able to move easily if they wish. \nThe CMA began looking at a probe in 2013, and began it in earnest last year. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is due to publish an interim report next month, along with notice of any likely remedies which it feels are needed to boost competition further an eventuality that the big banks would like to avoid. \nAmong the big banks, the winners under the seven-day switching scheme so far have been Santander which offers relatively high rates of interest, plus cashback on spending and Halifax, which gives customers a joining bonus plus a monthly payment. \nMeanwhile, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) have struggled to attract more customers through the scheme. However, they do note that the data on switching numbers do not cover those customers who sign up directly without closing their old account, for instance students setting up their first account, or customers who want to keep both open.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:59:58.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
