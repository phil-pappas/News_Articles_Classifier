Apple’s iOS platform is relatively free of such issues. However, a few days back, security researchers revealed that many of the top apps on the Apple App store were infected with malware. While it’s still unclear how many apps in total were affected by this issue, now the company has removed a number of iOS apps that were believed to be plagued by the malware. Sponsored Links \nPalo Alto Networks, the firm who found out this malware said that there were around 39 apps that were affected by malware on the Apple app store. Many of these are top selling apps on the store, like WeChat, Didi Kuaidi, CamCard, Railway 12306 etc. While the security firm estimates around 39 infected apps, another Chinese security research company claims that this figure may be much greater than 300. \nApple App store is usually found to be much more secure and stable as compared to its competitors. This is because the Cupertino giant makes sure that each and every app that gets listed on the store has to pass stringent tests. This has helped the company maintain its impeccable reputation so far. However, it looks like attackers used another way to bypass Apple’s security measures. They released an infected fake version of the Xcode, which is the code used by developers to build apps for the iOS platform. It is said that the fake version was uploaded on a Chinese server, which was reportedly faster than the US server. The Apple Website is much slower than local sites like Baidu cloud where the infected software was uploaded, thanks to the Great Firewall of China. So, anyone who used this copy created infected apps. \nThe infected code in the app works like most other app malwares on the internet. It can prompt the user to re-enter the username and password via fake login attempt. Once these details are entered, it can then be sent to a third party server which stores these data. Other possible ways to access details include accessing the user’s clipboard. This can turn out to be disastrous for many users who make use of password managers for logging into their accounts. \nApple has already removed all of the known infected apps from the Apple app store. It is advised that users update their apps to the latest version as soon as possible.
