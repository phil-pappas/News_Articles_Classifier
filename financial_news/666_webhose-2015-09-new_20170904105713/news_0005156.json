Getty by Kate Cowling Investors often dive into self-managed super funds with two things in mind: control and cost.\nBut once you have one, it's common to find yourself either relinquishing some of the management and/or paying more than you expected on administration â€“ something which isn't necessarily a bad thing if it translates to better compliance with the rules and protection of your retirement savings.\nRetail investors can get ahead by taking advantage of the growing pool of apps and websites emerging to aid DIY research and administration. But when a simple Google search returns more than 86,000 results, the bulk of which would arguably be linked to a product, how do you choose where to go for the best insights?\nSmart Investor asked SMSF advisers to name their favourite day-to-day apps for managing their clients' super savings, all of which are available to those who want to ramp up their super from home.\nTax Office app a good start\nThe best insights into how to properly manage your SMSF are free and available via the Tax Office's app , according to SMSF adviser Liam Shorte of the SMSF Coach and Tim Mackay of Quantum Financial. It offers checklists, videos and compliance information and is available via iTunes, Windows and Google Play with \"no sales pitch\", Mackay says.\nOther apps Shorte uses for research include the ASX app, for sharemarket announcements, XE for insights on currency and Stocklight for market analysis.\nWhen it comes to portfolio tracking and trades, Peter Small of Fluid Financial Planning uses Sharesight and CMC Markets in concert. He says Sharesight is a wrap alternative that sends updates on price moves and automates dividend payments (for $25 a month), but could be improved by recording corporate actions. CMC is an online broker not aligned to the banks.\n On the organisation side, Google Drive is handy for synchronising spreadsheets, documents and calendar dates, says Sharesight CEO Doug Morris. He also uses \"Twitter for investors\" site Livewire and Morningstar for research.\nSpaces to watch? Mackay says while still behind in Australia, robo advice could storm the SMSF app space shortly. \"While this market has yet to take off in Australia in a material way, US-based apps such as Wealthfront and Betterment are moving ahead in leaps and bounds,\" he says. Currently, InvestSMART and Stockspot hold the market locally.", "external_links": ["https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Online-services/ATO-app/", "http://www.xe.com/", "https://www.investsmart.com.au/healthcheck", "http://www.cmcmarkets.com.au/en/AdvancedTradingPlatform?gclid=CMbk8dag5scCFU8IvAodfRcB3A", "http://www.asx.com.au/", "https://www.livewiremarkets.com/pages/about_us", "http://stocklight.com/", "https://www.betterment.com/", "http://www.sharesight.com.au/", "https://www.wealthfront.com/", "http://www.morningstar.com.au/", "https://www.stockspot.com.au/"], "published": "2015-09-08T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:44:56.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
