Mr Arora said two of the multinationals had signed up to set up shop. \nFollowing the extension of the African Growth and Opportunities Act (Agoa) with the US for the next 10 years, Kenya has been tipped to enjoy a boom. \nMeanwhile, China's Jiangsu Lianfa firm is planning to set up a textile factory in Naivasha, worth Sh40 billion. It is set to produce textiles worth Sh153 billion ($1.5 billion). \nThe factory will source cheaper power from Olkaria geothermal plant.
