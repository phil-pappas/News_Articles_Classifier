Bradley Kanaris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jenny Wiggins The competition watchdog plans to scrutinise Brookfield Infrastructure's $8.9 billion takeover of ports and rail group Asciano , said chairman Rod Sims as he warned the regulator would keep pushing for more oversight of monopoly infrastructure assets.\nBrookfield Infrastructure's proposed acquisition, which will combine its Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Western Australian rail networks with Asciano's Pacific National rail haul services, requires approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as well as the Foreign Investment Review Board before it can proceed.\n\"I think it's a very interesting issue that we'll have to have a very close look at,\" Mr Sims told The Australian Financial Review .\nRail operator Aurizon, the Western Australian Farmers Federation and grain growers co-operative CBH are among the groups that have concerns about the proposed acquisition and will be making submissions to the ACCC by Friday. The regulator plans to announce its decision on the takeover on October 15.\nAsciano's stock closed on Thursday at $8.40, well below Brookfield's cash and stock offer of $9.15 a share.\nThe review comes as Mr Sims pushes for tougher regulation of monopoly infrastructure assets like ports and railroads amid concerns that a series of privatisations will lead to higher prices and restricted access.\n\"Monopolies can be harmful in that they can limit investment and innovation in upstream or downstream industries,\" Mr Sims will tell a conference hosted by industry group Infrastructure Partnerships Australia (IPA) in Sydney on Friday.\nMr Sims said he was concerned about the pending sale of the Port of Melbourne, arguing more clarity was needed over how much compensation its new owners would receive if a second container port was built in Melbourne and how the port would be regulated in the future.\n \"Governments have the ability to exclude us so we're doing what we can to advocate for sensible policy,\" Mr Sims said.\nLend Lease chief executive Steve McCann will tell the IPA conference that Australia needs to increase densities surrounding existing transport corridors, interchanges and activity centres, and build infrastructure projects that \"anticipate and address the needs of the future\".\n\"The Central to Eveleigh transformation program, Sydney Metro and the Victorian level crossing removal program will create interesting urban renewal opportunities as they offer old spaces for new uses â€“ for parks, pathways, recreational facilities and residential and commercial purposes,\" Mr McCann said.\n\"It's critical we give as many people as possible the opportunity to live closer to transport, and especially public transport, to access employment, education and markets.\"\nIPA will on Friday release data showing that the total number of civil construction contracts signed over the past 12 months has fallen, according to an index compiled by the group and researchers BIS Shrapnel.\nThe Australian Infrastructure Metric fell 28 per cent in 2014-15 compared to a year earlier, with the mining portion of the index down 96.5 per cent.\nBut the transportation portion of the index rose 40 per cent, reflecting an increase in rail and road projects.\nRail infrastructure investment is running at its highest levels since 2010, IPA chief executive Brendan Lyon said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennywiggins", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/117166018980952797102"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:05:29.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
