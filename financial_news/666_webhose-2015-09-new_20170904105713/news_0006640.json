Shares of the company have fallen 12.6% since the earnings release.\n\nWe note that though Rite Aid posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter, adjusted quarterly earnings plunged 69.2% year over year. Further, management lowered its outlook for fiscal 2016 based on current soft sales trends.\n\nRite Aid’s generic drug sales are being adversely affected by Wal-Mart’s WMT strategy of entering the retail generic drug market. Due to Wal-Mart’s wide array of manufacturers in India, Israel, and the U.S., the mass merchant offers generic drugs at a discounted price compared to its rival companies.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S., pharmacy sales growth rate has slowed down due to a longer FDA approval process, drug safety concerns, loss of individual health insurance and an increase in the use of non-brand drugs, which are less expensive but generate higher gross margin. These factors may undermine the company’s performance.\n\nWe are also seeing increased competition in the retail drug store space. Over the last few years, many healthcare companies have merged to form a larger enterprise. As an enterprise, these companies enjoy greater power as well as cost and pricing benefits. Continuation of such a trend will reduce Rite Aid’s bargaining power, thereby resulting in increased pressure on the prices of the company’s products and services.\n\nCurrently, Rite Aid carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStocks that Warrant a Look \n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Herbalife Ltd. HLF and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA. While Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walgreens Boots holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
