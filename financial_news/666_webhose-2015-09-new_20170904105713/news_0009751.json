The company urged protesters in block 8 to seek dialogue.\n\"So far, however, they insist on holding control of installations,\" Pluspetrol said in a statement.\nSandi said the Achuar in oil block 192 would soon seize wells there following a dispute with the government over proceeds for communities in a new contract awarded to Pacific Exploration and Production Corporation.\nBoth oil blocks are in Peru's northern region of Loreto.\n\"The decision (to seize wells) has been made, we just need to wrap up some coordinations,\" Sandi said.\nPeru signed a last-minute deal with Pacific for the rights to tap oil block 192 for the next two years after an open auction for a 30-year contract failed to draw any bids last month.\nThe government included benefits for some indigenous communities in the new contract but a stalemate with others over their share of oil profits left many out.\nRepresentatives of Pacific could not be reached outside of regular business hours.\nPluspetrol previously operated block 192, which produces about 12,000 barrels per day.\nNative protesters have halted output from block 192 several times in recent years to demand the government clean up spills and give them more compensation. Peru has declared several environmental emergencies there because of oil pollution.\nPeru is rife with conflicts over mining and energy projects. The South American country is a relatively small oil producer and imports crude to meet local demand.
