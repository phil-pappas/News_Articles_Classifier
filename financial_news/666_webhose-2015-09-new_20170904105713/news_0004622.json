Canada's export sector posted healthy growth for the second month in a row in July, helping cut the country's trade deficit to an eight-month low of C$593 million, significantly less than the C$1.30 billion economists had forecast. Market participants were hoping the closely watched trade figures would offer a clearer picture on whether the impact of cheap crude has been contained and whether a soft Canadian dollar has helped stimulate other parts of the economy, such as exports. Following the data, markets were pricing in a lower probability the Bank of Canada would cut interest rates by 25 basis points for a third time this year at its next meeting in September. Overseas, the ECB kept its 60 billion euro a month asset purchase limit unchanged, but said the euro zone economy was not recovering at the pace expected. President Mario Draghi said economic conditions had worsened since mid-August. * At 9:32 a.m. EDT (1332 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3252 to the greenback, or 75.46 U.S. cents, stronger than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3271, or 75.35 U.S. cents. * The loonie traded between C$1.3245 and C$1.3289 so far during the session. * The U.S. trade gap also narrowed in July to $41.9 billion, its lowest level in five months, as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid concerns about a global growth slowdown. * U.S. and Canadian employment data for August are due at 08:30 a.m. EDT on Friday. * The Canadian dollar, which was outperforming nearly all of its key currency counterparts, is expected to trade between C$1.3220 and C$1.3320 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, according to Royal Bank of Canada. * Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price up 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 0.413 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.453 percent. * The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -28.3 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -71.9 basis points.
