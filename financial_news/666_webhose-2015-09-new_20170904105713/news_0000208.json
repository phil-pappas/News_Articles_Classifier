Federal Reserve speakers did little to settle nerves, sending mixed signals as New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams separately both said they expect to see a rate rise this year, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said a rate rise probably wouldn't be appropriate until well into 2016. \nThe dour sentiment spilled over into Asian trade Tuesday, where Japan's Nikkei closed down more than 4%, wiping out gains for the year. Stocks in China and Australia were also punished by the continued rout in commodities, sparked by a collapse in Glencore shares on Monday. \n\"There is a growing feedback loop between Glencore and the broader commodity trade,\" said Chris Weston at IG. \"There is clearly a sustained and ferocious attack on its equity and it’s unclear whether this is a genuine view that the company is not going to be around in six months.\" \nAhead Tuesday, while Fed officials debate the precise timing of the next U.S. rate rise, a new raft of eurozone data-- including economic sentiment and German CPI-- could add further pressure on the European Central Bank to ramp up its policy support. \nWatch for: Eurozone economic sentiment, business climate, industrial and consumer confidence; Germany preliminary CPI; U.K. consumer credit, mortgage lending, CBI distributive trades; U.S. consumer confidence; S&P/Case-Shiller house price index. \nMarket Snapshot: FTSE 100 down 0.54%, CAC 40 down 0.49% and DAX down 0.31%. Nikkei closed Tuesday down 4.05%. Brent crude up 0.57% at $47.61. Gold down 0.46% at $1126.50. EUR/USD at $1.1253. Ten-year Treasury yield lower at 2.073%, Bund yield lower at 0.579%, Gilt yield lower at 1.647%. \nWhat You May Have Missed on MoneyBeat \nEnergy Transfer Bulked Up on Banks to Win Williams: The bragging rights may be larger than the fees for many of the banks advising Energy Transfer Equity LP on its $32.6 billion deal to buy Williams Cos. \nGlencore’s Red Tide Hits U.S. Shore: Shoot first, aim later.
