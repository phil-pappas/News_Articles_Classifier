Photo: Jesse Marlow\nThe big banks are viewed as the dividend darlings of the stock market, showering more than $20 billion a year on their shareholders.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? Weâ€™re @FairfaxMoney\nBut unlike the interest a bank pays on a term deposit, dividends are not a sure thing. Investors should consider if the returns are sustainable, especially when share prices are plunging, as they have recently.\nWith bank shares in a \"bear market\" at the time of writing - meaning they are 20 per cent below their peak - many investors are clearly much less optimistic about these stocks than they were a few months ago.\nAdvertisement So, what type of event might be needed to force the banks to cut their highly-prized dividends?\nBell Potter analyst TS Lim has opened up the archives to find out. His conclusion is that outright cuts to bank dividends have been rare, and normally the result of a severe shock or serious slump in economic conditions.\nIndeed, the average dividends paid by the big four banks have only been cut during three periods in the last 37 years.\nThe first decline was relatively small and came in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, when average dividends were cut by 15 per cent, or 5 cents. Banks' charges for bad and doubtful debts had lifted after a period of strong borrowing from business, in a financial system that was only recently deregulated.\nDividends fell more sharply in the severe recession of the early 1990s, when payments to bank shareholders were slashed by 35 per cent.\nAustralia's economy was in strife: more than one in 10 people couldn't find a job, and the banks also got themselves into a fair bit of trouble after lending too heavily to commercial property borrowers in particular.\nWestpac racked up some particularly hefty losses, the value of its property assets and collateral fell almost 40 per cent.\nMore recently, the global financial crisis caused average bank dividends to fall by 23 per cent, though in dollar terms the reduction was the biggest of the lot. Again, the problem was loan losses, after some large corporate borrowers got into strife.\nIn each case, Lim says the cuts in dividends happened when there were \"unique\" events in the economy that gave banks a significant shock in their profits: such as rapid growth in lending, a hit to banks' funding sources, a sharp rise in interest rates, or a surge in unemployment.\nThe official forecasters are not penciling in these sorts of events over the next few years, even though conditions are getting tougher for banks. Bank directors are loathe to irritate their hundreds of thousands of shareholders by cutting dividends unless they really have to. This year they have shown they would rather raise billions of dollars in capital by issuing new stock than returning less to shareholders.\nIt all suggests there would have to be a severe economic shock to cause outright falls in banks' dividends.\n@clancyyeates", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@FairfaxMoney", "http://twitter.com/@clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:43:55.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
