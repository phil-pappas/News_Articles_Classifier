Lenders will also work with students attending colleges on a quarter system. \nWhile many students are locked into obtaining a loan to pay for tuition during the requisite fall and spring months, lenders tend to become more competitive as you get closer to the first day of classes. Many will start offering incentives and reduce interest rates for private loans, said Patrick Kandianis, co-founder of Valore, the Boston textbook seller and renter which also owns SimpleTuition, a student loan comparison engine.
