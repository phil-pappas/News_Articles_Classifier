The Department of Agriculture estimates that demand for food in Asia will increase faster than anywhere else in the world, doubling between 2007 and 2050.\nIt represents an unprecedented opportunity for farmers and food producers but also for investors who can find equities that tap into this enduring trend.\nWhile investing in commodity growers or traders might seem like the obvious starting point, some advisors say that price volatility and food deflation makes these difficult investments to manage (witness the 7 per cent drop in cereal prices and the 8.6 per cent drop in vegetable oil prices in August). One approach is to buy into international companies which sell direct to emerging consumers.\nChief Investment Officer at Insync Funds Management Monik Kotecha highlights Swiss-based Nestle because it has a strong balance sheet, an excellent track record of paying increasing dividends, and crucially, a developed distribution infrastructure to access emerging markets.\n\"They get in very early and they start spending money and start developing their distribution infrastructure in those markets,\" he says.\n\"The infrastructure is so rich and so deep that they've now moved into areas that most other companies wouldn't even dream about going into. They're now starting to introduce their brand and their products to those consumers who will then be able to access them in growing amounts in the years to come.\"\nGrowing markets Kotecha notes that in packaged foods, emerging markets are currently just one-eighth the size of developed markets.\nBrewers also have the potential to outperform in Asia. Beer companies generally produce stable, consistent, predictable, recurring earnings that grow over time and reward shareholders through increasing dividends and rising share prices over time, Kotecha says.\nInsync Funds Management currently owns US based Anheuser Busch, famous for producing Budweiser.\n\"Some of these companies are really benefiting enormously from the growing consumption we're seeing in beer in emerging markets. And what's interesting is some of the markets in the emerging areas are not only growing much faster than developed markets, but the profitability in those markets is even greater than it is in developed markets,\" he says.\nKevin Bertoli, portfolio manager, Asia at PM Capital, also likes brewers, but is focussed on the Malaysia market.\nUnlike China where there is a range of brewers and likely to be some consolidation, in Malaysia there are only two players who control virtually the whole market, Carlsberg Malaysia, which owns Carlsberg and Corona, and Guinness Anchor, which has Heineken and Tiger. This means that neither business acts irrationally by adding extra capacity, and instead they are able to pay out most of their earnings in dividends.\nMalaysia has a median age of just 27, which means more consumers are moving into that \"core\" drinking age of 25 to 35, which is growing at 1 or 1.5 per cent a year, says Bertoli.\n\"When it comes to feeding the world, we're more focused on buying the actual brand owners and them benefiting longer term from a consumption view,\" he says. PM Capital prefers to focus on locally-owned brands in Asia more than international players. \"We actually think longer term the domestic know-how will be the success stories because they understand the culture, they understand the consumption patterns,\" says Bertoli.\nBacking local as well as big producers One example is Tingyi, which is the bottler for Pepsi in China and the country's largest noodle manufacturer.\nIt has a very strong distribution network – important in a country as fragmented in China – and Pepsi is stronger than Coca-Cola in China. In fact, when Disney opens its theme park in Shanghai next year, it will be the only one in the world where Pepsi is sold instead of Coke.\nGreg Smith, head of research at Fat Prophets, says growing global demand for food and the need to boost the yield from crops mean that crop protection companies are well-positioned.\nOne such company is Australia's own NuFarm, although Smith highlights Swiss-based Syngenta, which produces agrochemicals.\nLast month Syngenta spurned a takeover bid from US crop protection giant Monsanto. The US$47 billion ($66 billion) bid was at a premium of about 40 per cent to the pre-offer share price. \"Typically you get M&A activity in a sector which is either depressed or has significant growth opportunities, and we think this is the latter,\" says Smith.\nSmith says current forecasts for an El Nino weather pattern – which typically causess droughts – also presents an opportunity for investors. El Nino forecasts often don't eventuate or if they do, they're often not as bad as feared.\nThe current forecasts have depressed agricultural stocks and if it doesn't eventuate then stocks such as US-based Tyson Foods, the world's largest meat producer, could benefit, Smith says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T17:51:45.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
