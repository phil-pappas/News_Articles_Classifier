If the Fed does lift rates, it would be the first increase since 2006. \nAn increase in their loan rates of one percentage point would translate into $2.70 billion in additional profits for JPMorgan, $3.85 billion for Bank of America and about $2 billion for Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , according to calculations included in the banks' securities filings. \nBut if the Fed does move on rates this week, the hike is likely to be just 0.25 percent, which on its own would not significantly boost bank profits. \n\"If they only increased it 25 basis points, I think the banks will welcome the signal, but you are not going to see massive earnings improvement on something like that,\" said Justin Fuller, a senior director at Fitch. \n\"In order for them to benefit from increased interest rates, they need a series of rate increases over time.\" \nAnalysts say banks could receive an additional benefit from an interest rate hike this week if businesses hasten efforts to secure debt financing in advance of subsequent increases. \n\"You will see some kind of more rapid borrowing to get in before rates go up further,\" Fuller said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T21:42:50.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
