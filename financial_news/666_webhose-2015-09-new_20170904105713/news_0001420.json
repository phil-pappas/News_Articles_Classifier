He loves Australia but ruminates \"it may well be a lemon\". Louise Kennerley by Andrew Clark Bob Ellis is archiving. Stricken with cancer, the 73-year-old blogger, playwright, scriptwriter, speechwriter, novelist, book and film reviewer, libel writ magnet, serial book pulper, political candidate, Labor stalwart and all-round troublemaker, is trying, in the winter of his being, to impose order on a notoriously disorderly life.\n\"I tumble down into an absolute oblivion but only for about an hour,\" he says about mood swings generated by illness. But he is soldiering on as a sort of psycho-diarist of modern Australia, someone who brings out the emotional warts, secret shame and weird beauty in all of us with his Rabelaisian ramblings.\nDressed in black trackies, seated on the deck of his brown timber home at the bluff end of Barrenjoey Road, Palm Beach, about 40 kilometres north of central Sydney, the pale Ellis reflects on illness and death, and the current state of Australia.\nThe country he loves \"may well be a lemon\", he says.\nBob Carr launches Bob Ellis' book, Goodbye Babylon in October, 2002. The former NSW premier and federal foreign minister praises Ellis' freshness, his acute sense of what is good cinema and good theatre. But he once joked with Ellis, he says, that Ellis wasn't \"someone who would miss a train because he was back in the office checking every last fact\". Andrew Quilty He talks in quiet tones, interspersed with verbal volcanoes, as he looks out on Lion Island and Pittwater, at the mouth of the Hawkesbury River, on a brilliant Sydney afternoon.\nMaybe it was inspiration gained from the, as Ellis puts it, \"astounding\" view, or noisy interruptions by bush turkeys scurrying onto the deck, or brilliant flashes of lorikeets flying between trees, or squawking of yellow-crested white cockatoos, but he adds: \"My son, Tom, who is a nanotechnologist, tells me that about 33 per cent of all cures are placebo effect. Positive thinking [brings on] this rush of wild hope.\n\"I am now beginning to believe it because I haven't had any symptoms of the disease at all and I feel better and stronger.\" Then he adds: \"Maybe I don't.\"\nAfter two weeks of medical crisis in July, Ellis has been put on a new course of chemotherapy, and the cancer has retreated.\n The young Bob Ellis of the ABC, pictured in Sydney in August 1971. Geoff Bull \"They wouldn't let me sleep in the hospital. I didn't know then if I had days, or whatever. I had no moral energy to talk to anyone. People like [retired High Court judge] Michael Kirby and [filmmaker] Paul Cox were waiting to have their last conversation with me.\"\nThere have been many more. Ellis had, through announcing (hopefully prematurely) his imminent demise on his own blog, triggered a strong response. \"I thought I was a grimy, long-forgotten eccentric but when the news came out I just got all these people [responding]. Kim Beazley [the former ALP leader who is now Australia's ambassador to the United States] sent me flowers from Washington. Beazley is my favourite: he is such a great soul.\n\"He once launched a book about World War I [ The First World War by Trevor Wilson and Robin Prior, in 2000]. He said, 'You know, this country started out very well. We had widows' pensions, free public education and so on and we were looking good, and then the war came'.\"\nWorld War I was followed, Ellis says, by a \"dance of death between two ugly ideologies. It's not over yet. We have to start all over again.\"\nBob Ellis gained a respectable number of votes when he stood against Bronwyn Bishop in the 1994 Mackellar byelection, thus affecting the upward trajectory of her political career. Simon Alekna Political ego Bob Ellis may not be starting \"all over again\", but he's archiving what he considers his \"best stuff\" – that is, \"Ellis on film and Ellis on the questions of a larger kind of morality.\n\"I didn't realise what I was doing in the months before the illness. It was like I had a deadline and apparently I have. I was writing daily about 'the 31 worst things the Liberals did yesterday' and I got up to 297 and I am not finished. I am going to progressively publish them – posthumously, or whatever.\n\"I realised that at a certain point we would come to a punchline which was: Bronwyn Bishop had a gin and a strange light suffused her august Tongan features. 'Tell Mr DeMille​ I am ready for my close-up.'\nEllis' summation of the way human beings act: \"We're all a wandering archipelago of random impulses.\" Louise Kennerley \"I don't mind predeceasing Bronwyn because I was part of her defeat 20 years ago.\"\nThe – shall we say flamboyant? – reference to the recently departed parliamentary speaker revives the memory of Ellis running against Bishop as an independent candidate in the 1994 byelection for the blue-ribbon Liberal, northern beaches Sydney seat of Mackellar, which includes Palm Beach. His more than respectable showing, and Bishop's failure to secure much of a swing in a byelection (when, typically, there is a protest vote against the government of the day), derailed the BB-train's unannounced effort to knock off then Liberal Party leader John Hewson.\nThe Mackellar result was soon followed by then South Australian frontbencher, and later foreign minister, Alexander Downer, replacing Hewson as Liberal leader. Eight months later, former party leader John Howard, in turn, pushed aside the hapless Downer for the top job. The rest, as they say, is history.\nEllis' take on this brief political narrative is that he \"caused the Howard era\". And it doesn't stop there: \"I not only caused Howard, I caused Abbott.\"\nThis habit of inserting himself in the centre of seminal events – the one-time subject of a theatrical parody by comic chronicler Max Gillies – extends to just about anything, everything and everyone: politics, films, plays and a litany of leading figures in the passing parade.\nBut Ellis has a point. Of a kind. I recall sitting in my Fairfax office in Parliament House in Canberra at about 1 pm on November 11, 1975, when Ellis popped his head around the door, and shouted: \"Kerr has just sacked Whitlam!\"\nAnalysing Abbott Still, the reference to Prime Minister Tony Abbott seems, at first blush, puzzling. It's hard to conjure up two more disparate characters: the louche, unkempt, Labor devotee and literary hellraiser in Ellis, and the strict Catholic, physically Spartan, right-wing Liberal in Tony Abbott. Unconsciously borrowing from the title of the reality TV series starring comely MAW (model, actress, whatever) – and former Charlie Sheen squeeze – Denise Richards, Ellis says \"It's complicated\" when asked about the Abbott-Ellis polka.\nIt goes back to 1998, when Abbott was a minister in the Howard Liberal government. The first edition of Ellis' book on politics, Goodbye Jerusalem , was pulped following a successful defamation case brought by Abbott, then-treasurer Peter Costello and their wives. At issue was a single sentence in which Ellis Quote: d politician Rodney Cavalier as having said, \"Abbott and Costello … they're both in the Right wing of the Labor Party till the one woman f---ed both of them and married one of them and inducted them into the Young Liberals\".\nThe publisher, Random House, accepted the disputed content was a falsehood and the book was removed from sale. ACT Supreme Court Justice Higgins awarded the two politicians and their wives a total of $277,000 damages.\nThirteen years after the Goodbye Jerusalem fiasco, Ellis' book, Suddenly, Last Winter – An Election Diary , published in early 2011, created waves for the rusted-on Labor supporter's criticism of then Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, and praise for then Liberal opposition leader, Tony Abbott. He described Gillard as \"not well informed\" and \"sudden, firm and wrong\" in everything she did. \"She has no power, no influence, no friends, no learning. There's not much there\", while Abbott had \"good manners\", was \"formidable\" and possessed a \"first-class mind\".\nNot long before these comments on Gillard, Ellis had also written, as he put it, \"a rave review\" of Abbott's book, Battlelines . Later, Abbott contacted Ellis \"and we were for a while friends. It's probable that that rave review shifted just one vote his way [when Abbott defeated then Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull for the Liberal leadership on December 1, 2009].\n\"He sued me [over Goodbye Jerusalem ] and ruined me, and so on,\" Ellis says in the slightly irritated tone you might use about spilling egg on your tie. But about the time of Ellis' favourable Battlelines review, \"Abbott said: 'Are we still on for lunch on Tuesday?' and so we arranged to launch each other's book at [the Sydney bookstore] Gleebooks.\"\nThe appointed date for the book launch turned out to be two nights after Abbott toppled Turnbull. But Abbott \"did turn up. We had a very interesting conversation which contained a very unusual exchange. I said: 'Have you read [the Evelyn Waugh novel] Brideshead Revisited ?' \"\n\"[Abbott said] 'Many times. I like especially that sentence about \"the cloistral hush which down the years …\" ' [ It was this cloistral hush which gave our laughter its resonance, and carried it still, joyously, over the intervening clamour. ] This is the moment in which Charles [played by Jeremy Irons in the 1981 British TV series based on the book] and Sebastian [played by Anthony Andrews] fell in love. Abbott mentioned it in front of an audience of Greenies and Trots in Gleebooks.\n\"This does not compute, this does not compute,\" Ellis repeats, in part referring to Abbott's public acknowledgment in March 2010, on the Channel Nine 60 Minutes programme, that he felt \"a bit threatened\" by gay people and his trenchant opposition to same-sex marriage. Says Ellis, \"I formed the view then, and I think it's the only reasonable explanation, that Abbott is in fact six people: rugger bugger; the absolutely strict, self-flagellating priest; the man who will discuss anything with you over a Guinness; and the jogging athlete and cyclist.\"\nEllis pauses a moment, \"computes\" his own numbers, then qualifies his remarks with: \"There may be seven of him or there may be five [in fact he has four]. I remember [the former editor of The Anglican newspaper, the late] Francis James saying to me of [Abbott's political mentor, Bartholomew] Santamaria​: 'The difficulty, Ellis, is that good men can do evil.' I don't think any of us is stable. We're all a wandering archipelago of random impulses. I don't think anybody is just one person.\"\nThe observation may have been spurred by the Abbott story but, as his use of \"we\" implies, it also applies to Ellis himself.\nSome things don't \"compute\". He is the slovenly, unkempt, indulgent, serial womaniser, who has constant feuds with publishers, editors, film directors and journalists, particularly female journalists. He is also the man who has been married to, and lived with, the same woman – distinguished novelist and scriptwriter Anne Brooksbank – for nearly half a century, has raised a wonderful family – one daughter, two sons – and written an extraordinary amount.\nMaverick critic turns scriptwriter Bob Ellis was born in 1942 in Murwillumbah and grew up in Lismore, a northern NSW seaboard city with a current population of about 30,000. Among other claims to fame, Lismore is the one-time home of cricketer Adam Gilchrist and painter Margaret Olley.\nEllis' father, Keith, was a travelling salesman and his mother, Elsie, a strict Seventh-day Adventist. When Ellis was just 10, his 22-year-old sister, Margaret, was fatally struck down by a car while she was crossing a road. This tragedy has haunted him ever since.\nBob Ellis was a student at Sydney University with, among others, Clive James, Richard Walsh, John Bell, Germaine Greer, Arthur Dignam and Les Murray. Walsh, who was his editor in the '70s at the now defunct, lèse-majesté weekly, Nation Review, recalls that during their university days, \"Bob occasionally came and stayed with me\" in the Walsh family home on Sydney's North Shore.\n\"He would always come with his huge suitcase containing his dirty washing and then prevailed on my mother to do his dirty washing. A winsome bludger.\"\nAfter graduation, he started work at the ABC, with colleagues such as broadcaster, columnist and author Mike Carlton. But writing was his passion. The Ellis name grew with the landmark 1970 musical play, The Legend of King O'Malley – which he co-wrote with the late Michael Boddy, and which was a big success – and his tearaway film reviews for the Nation Review .\nNo matter what the film under review was ostensibly about, Ellis' magnetic copy often veered into reveries about the contours of actress Kate Fitzpatrick's bosom. Labor he is, politically correct he ain't.\nEllis became a popular playwright, often working in collaboration. For some time during the '80s, he and Brooksbank owned the Stables Theatre, in Sydney's Kings Cross, which became a home to the Griffin Theatre Company.\nHe has written numerous film scripts, such as Cactus , My First Wife and Man of Flowers – all with director Paul Cox. There has been Where the Green Ants Dream (with legendary German director Werner Herzog), Goodbye Paradise , Maybe This Time with Brooksbank, and Fatty Fin . Ellis has also directed several films, including The Nostradamus Kid , Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train , Unfinished Business and the documentary Run Rabbit Run .\nHis writing for television includes the miniseries True Believers (with co-authors Matt Carroll and Stephen Ramsey) and Infamous Victory: Ben Chifley's Battle for Coal , with co-author Geoff Burton. He has written the non-fiction work, Goodbye Jerusalem (which was pulped) and Goodbye Babylon (also pulped in one state), on his experiences of the Labor Party; First Abolish the Customer – 202 Arguments Against Economic Rationalism ; The Capitalism Delusion – How Global Economics Wrecked Everything ; and The Ellis Laws.\nDramatic powers His most iconic film script was Newsfront . Set in mid-1950s Australia, and largely about rival newsreel companies, Newsfront effectively launched the celluloid careers of Bryan Brown, Bill Hunter, Wendy Hughes and Chris Haywood. The script was very much Ellis, with its original account of the struggles for a national identity, expressed through the popular media and the prism of an Australia consumed with the Cold War and growing American influence.\nWhat happened next was also very much Ellis. The original script was too long and too expensive for the film's $600,000 budget. So director Phillip Noyce​ ( Clear and Present Danger, The Quiet American ) and producer David Elfick​ supervised significant script cuts at Elfick's Palm Beach Studios, just down the road from the Ellis residence.\nSpeaking from South Africa, the normally Hollywood-based Noyce says: \"There wouldn't have been a Newsfront without Bob because he was, and still is, steeped in the politics of the era and of the Labor Party. I owe a lot to him. You can't make a movie without a script and we had a great script.\n\"But it was too long and we could only raise a certain amount of money. Bob was naturally appalled by the prospect of the cuts. He went to war which was sometimes very distressing, and sometimes a pantomime of great comedy.\n\"He came into Palm Beach picture studios where the script assistant was retyping the script. He read over her shoulder for half a minute and grabbed the manuscript and ran down Palm Beach. David Elfick was in his Speedos and gave chase and tackled him. The script ended up all over the road and the footpath. The production assistants were running along the road and picking up the pages.\n\"Bob came to the screening of the finished film, and he said he was taking his name off the credits and said it was rubbish. A few weeks later, it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The screenings were always full. It won Australian Film Institute awards in 1978, presented by Fred MacMurray​ and Britt Ekland, including an award for best screenplay.\n\"He writes from the heart and speaks from the heart and thinks from his heart, not anyone else's heart. You could say he's jaundiced but it's always illuminating. That's a very rare quality. He's Australia's Hunter S. Thompson. So much journalism and writing is safe. Bob was never safe and he has often paid for that.\"\nOutrageous and a talent for outrage Ellis believes his best work is the book Night Thoughts in Time of War (2004) \"which is like a chronicle of a nervous breakdown during the first months of the Iraq war. It's a diary but it kind of roves everywhere and things fell out just as [former Iraqi dictator] Saddam [Hussein] was captured and so on. There's also the lesser books, which are nonetheless quite useful as moments in history. I didn't manage to make it to [former Labor prime minister Kevin] Rudd's orations from the executioner's block after he was sacked. [But] I wrote about that very well.\"\nRichard Walsh, who was his editor at Nation Review , and who has also, like many, had difficulties with Ellis, recalls him penning \"wonderful metaphors of the rococo kind,\" but \"at some time Bob and I fell out\".\nWalsh recalls earlier, happier days at Sydney University. \"Most of us were involved in [the Sydney University student newspaper] Honi Soit​ and the theatre world. Clive James had a pernicious influence. He was very politically conservative and very up himself. He wrote [university] revue scripts and there was just no way in which young whippersnappers like us could cut in on that.\"\nLater, Ellis worked in advertising, at Hansen Rubensohn-McCann Erickson, where he \"didn't do very well. He didn't want to cut his cloth to the [demands of] the advertising world. He was given a laundry powder account, and he came up with the idea of filling the whole of Sydney Harbour with sudsy water. He had those dreamy ideas, which were fabulous in the conception.\n\"He fell out with a lot of people. He wasn't generous spirited, always a bit curmudgeonly.\"\nWalsh recalls at one time publishing a \"Best of\" series of books, including collections of articles by Nation Review 's legendary food critic, Sam Orr (aka Richard Beckett), cartoonist Michael Leunig and columnist John Hepworth.\n\"He and Anne Brooksbank came into the office and he was carrying this huge carton of material and said we could have another three huge cartons. I said 'I want a selection, not a collection'. He was really pissed off with me. It was part of his vanity.\n\"Bob tells good stories. He and Clive James would have loved to write one creative novel. But they are not [those] kind of writers because they don't listen enough. There's a wonderful flow of language and rich prose but they're not able to create an imaginary world outside themselves.\"\nPersuasive words ABC broadcaster Margaret Throsby says that \"anyone who takes that shambolic persona as indicative of who he really is just doesn't understand Bob. He's an astute thinker and he understands Australian politics in a way that not many people do. He's prepared to say what he says and stay by it. He has a wonderful Australian larrikin quality which I think is very endearing.\"\nAccording to former NSW Labor premier and one-time federal foreign minister Bob Carr, Ellis was heavily influenced by the New Journalism craze that swept America in the late '60s, with practitioners such as Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson, and, in his non-fiction writing, novelist Norman Mailer.\n\"He was so distinctive, you always looked forward to reading him. His writing style was terrific,\" says Carr, who employed Ellis as a speechwriter. \"I joked with him that he wasn't someone who would miss a train because he was back in the office checking every last fact.\n\"But among his speeches, there was a beautiful one I gave in the Parliament paying tribute to the Australians who were killed in the Bali bombing in 2002.\" Ellis Quote: d W.B. Yeats, from Easter, 1916 : \"To murmur name upon name/As a mother names her child/When sleep at last has come/On limbs that had run wild.\"\nCarr continues, \"I also recall a speech he wrote for me to give during the presentation of the [RSPCA] award for the state's most courageous dog. No speechwriter could have done that better.\n\"His deep sense of what worked in the theatre [is] demonstrated in The Legend of King O'Malley . His writing avoids cliché and delivers real freshness. He has an acute sense of what is good cinema and good theatre. His little performances he puts on with actor friends are a tribute to him.\"\nLiterary influences So what impels a writer like Ellis? Pale, and looking out at the Pittwater view, he says: \"You stir yourself. Each word stirs the next one and the irritation you have with the next word stirs yourself [again]. The great lack in modern times is this idiocy with a keyboard. I write longhand because it takes a while to form a word writing longhand. You've done a lot of editing of what the next word is. The proportion of good writing that is done on the keyboard is about one in 10.\n\"Hemingway did two things. He had a long verandah and he had a stand-up desk. He used to walk up and down, up and down and eventually form a sentence and he'd write it down in longhand. When he wrote dialogue, he typed. T.S. Eliot did exactly the same thing.\"\nEllis himself says that \"what I have been secretly doing in a lot of my work is writing in exactly the same style as Evelyn Waugh. That's one branch of my work. In other parts I am striving to be more like George Orwell – you know, whatever.\n\"I've spent seven years writing a screenplay about George Orwell and the Spanish Civil War.\"\nDirector Hugh ( Chariots of Fire ) Hudson will also direct Catalonia , Ellis' screenplay adaptation of George Orwell's book, Homage to Catalonia . Orwell's book traces the complexities of an avowed left-winger who travelled to Spain to fight on the Republican side becoming a fierce anti-communist and anti-Stalinist through his searing experience.\nLove in a Cold War climate The emotions are different, and the settings – 1950s Australia, compared with 1930s, civil-war-torn Spain – could not be more different, but there is a level of complexity in both Orwell's Spain and Ellis' relations with women.\nIn the early naughties, Ellis told George Negus on ABC TV that in his teens he \"fell in love repeatedly with various girls\". The unusual part was that these thrusts of the heart occurred at annual Seventh-day Adventist camps. Later, at university, he \"fell in love a great deal\", proposing to at least 14 girls while \"secretly knowing they'd say no, but liking the thrill. I was very much in love with being in love.\"\nSpeaking on the same ABC program, cinematographer Geoff Burton says that women's attraction to Ellis was pretty inexplicable. \"He had shocking greasy hair. In those days he wore a full-length gabardine overcoat and for months I never knew what he had on underneath it, if anything. And yet he managed to attract these most extraordinary women.\"\nOne was Penelope Nelson, daughter of David McNicoll, the then editor-in-chief of the Frank Packer-owned Sydney Daily Telegraph (it has been owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for the past 43 years). Fearing nuclear annihilation, the catastrophist Ellis fled with Penelope to the Blue Mountains at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\nThey travelled \"in her own father's stolen car, and [I] found to my amazement the world hadn't ended. There wasn't a mushroom cloud over Sydney, and I had to bring her back and face down David. And I had this plan that we would marry in Broken Hill and slowly cough ourselves to death with the radiation, after long hours of making love.\"\nDefamation and scandal That was 1962. Fast forward 40 or so years and his louche habits, particularly regarding women, have fallen spectacularly foul of Sydney's female journalists. There have been numerous Ellis threats to \"get even\" after reports of his misadventures. The high, or low, point in this exchange came midway through 1999, when ace Sydney Morning Herald investigative journalist Kate McClymont averred that, when it came to his own sex life, Ellis changed the rules of freedom of speech.\nThe previous September, Ellis had said he would \"not humiliate my wife in public for even $1 million\". At the time, his one-time paramour, screenwriter Alexandra Long, was three months pregnant with, as she claimed, Ellis' child.\nDuring this same period, Ellis was defending himself after a week of screaming publicity over the defamation case brought against the publishers of his soon-to-be-pulped book, Goodbye Jerusalem . At the time, he railed against the practice of suing because, he said, it infringed on free speech.\nMcClymont reported that when she contacted Ellis to check on the claims made against him by Long, and her husband, lawyer Wayne Cooper, Ellis threatened to sue her. \"I can possibly sue you individually, too, and I might choose to do that instead of [suing] the Herald ,\" she reported Ellis as saying, and then him wondering \"if there is a law under which I can get you now for harassment\". This tawdry episode degenerated into a media circus with, as McClymont detailed, TV stations rushing to sign up the warring parties and photographers leaping out of bushes trying to snap the baby. The airwaves almost melted with a white hot level of traded insults. The aggrieved Cooper told one radio station: \"Could I just first say that the most ringing endorsement of anyone in my life was Bob Ellis saying he doesn't like me; I feel like cracking open the Moet.\" The following day, McClymont's story continued, Ellis claimed on ABC radio the child could not be his because \"penetration\" was only \"briefly achieved\".\nMuch later, McClymont, in what practitioners would refer to as a \"red hot first par\", opened a story with: \"Fresh from the launch of his new book Goodbye Babylon [published in 2002], which only got pulped in one state as opposed to his earlier effort Goodbye Jerusalem which was pulped in many …\"\nLooking back, McClymont describes Ellis as an \"enormous talent but very thin-skinned when it comes to himself\" and someone who is \"quick to blame others\". She says the father-baby story was \"exacerbated\" by Ellis' appearance on ABC radio when he maintained he couldn't be the father of the child because he \"couldn't keep up an erection\".\n\"He did threaten 'I will go you' and I thought 'that was a little bit rich',\" McClymont says. In reply, Ellis says the vehemence of his reaction was because the story was \"a lie. F--- her. She [McClymont] destroyed my life and lost me the column in The Herald .\"\nAFR Weekend : That didn't destroy your life though.\nEllis: Yes it did. She's an awful person. She has never gone after a Liberal. Never has.\nMcClymont replied to that: \"Bob Ellis' greatest flaw is his indifference to the truth – whether it be about paternity issues ... or which politicians I have pursued. When journalists expose wrongdoing, it is so much easier for the person concerned to blame the journalist rather than examining their own moral compass.\"\nWhat lies beneath He may not be quite as vehement, but Ellis also has trenchant views about the Australian economy and Australia itself. He declares a fatwa against what he calls \"fundamentalism\" in the management of the economy. He says there was a point in the '80s when the tariffs were \"where they ought to be and [Treasurer Paul] Keating, against [Prime Minister Bob] Hawke's beseeching, kept bringing down [the levels of protection] and thereby managed progressively to abolish the country towns. You can't have civilisation without country towns. Otherwise it's just a vast vanilla.\n\"The single worst thing that happened is that [Treasurer Joe] Hockey invited Holden to go away so they f---in' went [Holden is not due to close its Australian manufacturing plants in Melbourne and Adelaide until 2017] and everyone else went [the other major car manufacturers are planning to leave 2016, 2017]. I believe it was actually fatal to Australia. You can't get by without industries, you can't get by without country towns and country towns can't get by without industries, and, in brief, you can't get by without tariffs.\"\nDeeper pessimism runs through his view of Australia.\n\"It occurred to me lately that the reason why the Anzacs on the Western Front were so feared and such good fighters was they got in some practice killing Aborigines. Our story gets worse and worse. Most of the people we think of as Aboriginal activists are the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of white rapists. Think what that means. It's a horrible story. Nobody's clean.\n\"There's probably a few honest Irish chamber maids who came here during the famine who were fine and so on and you can't criticise the women for the things that happened to them. But, Jesus Christ, more and more lately it seems that almost every institution is not only tainted with, but populated by, child abuse. Everybody was covering it up. You wonder about the whole thing – how you're not supposed to be homophobic … And it may well be there in one in four adult males, maybe only one in five, maybe only one in six.\"\nMoving further into a dark place, he says: \"I think Australia may well be a lemon. We don't deserve a future.\"\nThe lemon part applies to economic policy and the deep flaws in our national character flowing from our troubled past. Some observers may refract this darkness through the inevitable emotional trough that accompanies serious illness. But it also reflects Bob Ellis' unique gift for picking the scabs on the nation's deep psychological sores and exposing, in a fearless and unrelenting manner, what lies beneath for all who are willing to see.\nThe words are uttered quietly. Then there's another Ellis volcano, this time directed at the \"f---in' vultures\" – the fossicking bush turkeys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:09:39.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
