The stagnation of Japan should be a warning of where China could end up.\" \nIn its report the Chamber said that some progess had been made in areas such as streamlining government administration. \nBut it added that a raft of laws recently introduced on grounds of national security were \"vague\" and will act as a crimp on foreign firms. \nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) still dominate China's business landscape, but are widely seen as inefficient, and the Chamber warned there were concerns that \"meaningful SOE reform will not be forthcoming any time soon\". \nIt highlighted recent mergers between such firms, such as the combining of two of China's largest railway firms to create a $130-billion behemoth to bid for contracts abroad. \nWuttke criticised the new firm as a \"railway company monster\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:40:32.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
