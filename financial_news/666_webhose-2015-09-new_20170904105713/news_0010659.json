They are being marketed with a flexible floorplan able to accommodate between two and four bedrooms.\nAdvertisement A short distance to Bourke Street and Athletes Walk, occupants within The Whitt Apartments will also enjoy north facing views.\nMark Adams Real Estate is selling apartments for the SCV. The proposed flats were exclusively offered to SCV members prior to the public campaign.\nSCV says the development will not proceed unless all apartments are sold. If they exchange however, building could start as early as next month.\nLike the beach house market, Victoria's alpine sector is more susceptible to market rises and falls than the metropolitan property sectors, but can offer investors, at times, a strong rental return, if at times, no capital gain.\nIn 2011, developer and publisher Morry Schwartz, with business partner, Callum Fraser, made a high-profile exit from the Falls Creek market, using a \"no reserve\" auction to offload 74 properties, which ended up selling for a fraction of their retail cost.\nHowever the sector is showing signs of strength this season. In June, Autobahn founder Garry Dumbrell paid developer Rino Grollo $1.7 million for the luxury Howqua penthouse within the Mount Buller Chalet.\nAlso in that facility, which is near to SCV's The Whitt Apartments, businesswoman Rose Yong, responsible for bringing thousands of wealthy Asian investors to the state each year, purchased a strata retail space for use as a high end eatery, described as \"The Flower Drum of the high country\".", "external_links": ["http://www.domain.com.au/news/property-developer-rino-grollo-to-pocket-cold-hard-cash-for-his-alpine-penthouse-20150612-ghm64w/"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:47:35.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
