In itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is what it is,\" says RBA assistant governor Guy Debelle. Michel O'Sullivan Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro The RBA's Guy Debelle has a message to skittish bond traders who complain their market has become a dangerous and illiquid place to trade – \"It is what it is\".\nSpeaking one day before the US Federal Reserve decides whether to lift rates for the first time in nine years, Debelle told traders and investors to prepare for a new bond market order where volatility is almost certain to rise in times of stress. He also pushed back on calls for central banks to intervene if bond markets become too dislocated by assuming a 'market maker of last resort' role.\nThe assistant governor financial markets of the Reserve Bank of Australia outlined the rise of algorithmic trading and the withdrawal of banks to warehouse risks had changed the structure of the bond market in a way that increases volatility in times of stress. Its time however that traders and fund managers got used to it.\n\"It continues to evolve but it is not going back to what it was any time soon. So participants in the bond market need to adjust to the current situation rather than simply complain about it.\"\n'Awkwardly named flash rally' Debelle famously warned of rising volatility on the eve of the \"awkwardly named flash rally\" in US Treasuries that occurred in mid-October when bond yields plunged dramatically for 12 minutes before returning to previous levels.\nThat had become a study of a report that was inconclusive but Debelle said \"the fact that such events can occur in arguably the most deep and liquid market in the world does mean that we need to understand what is going on here.\"\nThe flash rally did highlight the prevalence of high frequency traders, who now account for about a third of the Australian bond market trading activity and a half in the larger US market.\n The rise of computer traders meant there was plenty of liquidity to buy small parcels of bonds at prices close to the market but the depth of liquidity was poor as there were few buyers prepared to take larger parcels near the market price, creating a conundrum where liquidity was both good and bad simultaneously.\nThe lack of depth, Debelle explained is because of the withdrawal of banks which may have been unwilling to catch a falling knife and buy assets that were falling sharply in value, they did tend to be among the first to push against a selling tide. That has changed partly due to new regulation which means prices will deviate from fair value for longer periods and volatility will rise.\nHigh volatility? 'It is what it is' \"Volatility will be higher,\" Debelle said. \"In itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is what it is. But with higher volatility, the distribution of price movements will have fatter tails. Overshooting will be more likely and that can have long-lasting and more deleterious consequences.\"\nIn this new world fund managers had to accept the bond market had changed, adapt the way they buy and sell bonds and manage their portfolios to handle unexpected redemptions.\nDebelle also seemed to push back on calls for central banks to interject in times of market stress as a 'market maker of last resort' an extension of their function as a 'lender of last resort'. But he doesn't seem favourably disposed to such as responsibility.\n\"A market-maker makes two-way prices, both buying and selling. In a dislocated market, with most of the trading one-way, the central bank would only be buying, it wouldn't be selling the asset to anyone else anytime soon. A more appropriate description is buyer of last resort, with the risk to the central bank's balance sheet that comes from performing that role.\"\nThe China question Debelle also offered thoughts on another big topic in the bond market – the liquidation of China's enormous $US4 trillion ($5.6 trillion) stockpile of foreign currency reserves held largely in the form of US treasuries and other government bonds.\nTo prop up its exchange rate as a result of capital outflows China has reduced its foreign currency reserves by almost $500 billion.\n\"We don't know what the Chinese are selling because we don't know the composition of their reserve holdings. But it probably involves some US treasuries and other sovereign bonds.\n\"Nor do we know what assets the private capital outflow from China is buying. But they are both huge orders of magnitude are most certainly having a first order influence on financial markets.\"\nThe process represents a switch of ownership of assets from the public to the private sector as controls are lifted and Chinese invest abroad while the government had previously down so on behalf of its citizens.\n\"That is, a fair part of what is going at the moment is a shift in who is holding foreign assets in China, not necessarily a large change in the total quantity of foreign assets being held by China. What matters for global financial markets is the difference in portfolio allocation between the public and private sector in China.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-ag-2015-09-16.html", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-16T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:03:42.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
