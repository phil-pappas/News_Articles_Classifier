Capital inflows will be reduced whilst capital outflows will increase in anticipation of a close election. Expectation is a peaceful outcome, however markets will price in any risk factors and this could exacerbate pressure for the period,” Pianim said. \nGeneral elections will be held in Ghana to elect a President and Members of Parliament. \nSome tensions have characterised the run up to the poll. \nOn Wednesday, police in Accra, the capital, fired tear gas and rubber bullets to bar opposition protesters from the headquarters of the Electoral Commission (EC) to demand a new electoral roll. \nPresident John Mahama is seeking a second term in next year’s election in what is expected to be a tight contest between him and the New Patriotic Party’s Nana Akufo Addo. \nMeanwhile, the Cedi has been subject to volatility for the better part of 2015. The unrest has been due to falling commodity prices globally and growing import demand locally. These challenges have are partially due to macro-economic imbalances arising from 2014. \nThe currency opened the year at 3,2 and is currently at 3,9. \n– CAJ News \nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=8227   17     National , Regional .
