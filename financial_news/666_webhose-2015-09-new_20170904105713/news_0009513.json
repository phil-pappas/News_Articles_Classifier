Some of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee might take a different view, particularly after data on Wednesday showed the global drag is starting to put a brake on U.K. output.\nMinutes of the September policy meeting will be scrutinized for clues on the timing of the first interest-rate increase in eight years. The record, which will be published alongside the MPC’s decision at noon in London, gives committee members a chance to set out their views on the past month’s events, including a slew of domestic reports that point to a loss of momentum. Economists see officials keeping their key rate at a record-low 0.5 percent.\n“What we’ll hear from the whole committee is how serious they think the downside risks have become, and whether Mark Carney is sticking out like a sore thumb,” said Rob Wood, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London and a former BOE official. “There’s been a steady drumbeat of disappointing data over the last couple of weeks. I think that’s going to mean more caution in these minutes.”\nServices Falter Recent evidence includes disappointing data on manufacturing and retail sales. Services, the main driver of the recovery, grew the least since 2013 in August, and a report on Wednesday showed goods exports plunged the most in nine years in July. Inflation is just 0.1 percent -- well below the BOE’s 2 percent target -- and falling oil prices may push it even lower.\n“I wonder whether other members of the committee are going to be a little bit more worried” than Carney, said Brian Hilliard, an economist at Societe Generale SA in London. “Since the last meeting we’ve had an intensification of the China market volatility, which has to make people less keen to move,” he said. “There’s no urgency.”\nThe uncertainty will be enough to keep Ian McCafferty on his own in insisting that higher borrowing costs are needed now, according to economists. McCafferty wanted a 25 basis-point increase in the BOE’s key rate in August, citing upside risks to inflation as wage gains pick up.\nChina Turmoil As China’s Aug. 11 currency devaluation sparked ructions in financial markets and oil prices fell, market expectations of a U.K. rate rise have been pushed back. Forward contracts aren’t fully pricing in an increase until October 2016 and at the same time, investors have had a lull in commentary from BOE officials in what is traditionally a holiday month in the U.K.\nIn Carney’s analysis, delivered on Aug. 29, he said officials can ignore the deflationary impact from recent global events and signaled that early next year remains a possible starting point for interest-rate increases. The only other recent comments came from Kristin Forbes in a newspaper opinion article, where she said events in China could weigh on global prices temporarily, but there are risks to waiting too long before raising rates.\n“There is a lot in flux at the moment. I would have thought waiting and seeing is going to be what most of the committee members will want to do,” Kate Barker, a former MPC member and now an adviser at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an interview. “I think Carney’s remark that, as you get to the turn of the year the decision is going to be quite sharply focused is about right, because that’s the point you think wages are picking up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:18:06.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
