He said that he was going \"in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part.\"\nUnder German law, it is not possible to bring charges against a company - only against individuals. Meyer would not elaborate on specifics of the investigation, and it wasn't clear what Winterkorn's suspected role might be.\nThe head of VW's Porsche division, Matthias Mueller, was appointed Friday as his successor.\nThe company has admitted that it used a piece of engine software to cheat on diesel car emissions tests in the U.S. It will have to fix programming it has said is in some 11 million cars worldwide, far more than the 482,000 originally identified by U.S. authorities.\nDetails on what cars are involved have emerged gradually. The group, which has 12 marques in all, said Friday that some 5 million cars made by its core Volkswagen brand had the diesel engine in question.\nOn Monday, Audi said that 2.1 million of its vehicles also had the engine.\nVolkswagen shares were down 6.5 percent in midday Frankfurt trading at 108 euros ($120.87).\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:56:35.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
