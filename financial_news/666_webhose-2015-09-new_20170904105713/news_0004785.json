Sieh \nAt the height of the deadly Ebola virus and the run-up to the Montserrado County Senatorial elections, in December 2014, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf heralded a rarely implemented Vehicle and traffic law in issuing Executive Order No. 65 ordering all concerted mass movements of people on the streets of Monrovia during the ensuing special elections, including in particular rallies, demonstrations and parades prohibited and for 30 days after the announcement of election results. \nLost in the issuance of the order was a mention by the President that \"the Government has noted with concern the increasing number of incidents of concerted mass movements of people on the streets of Monrovia and its environs, including in particular rallies, demonstrations, and parades, which have led to persistent and frequent violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Laws of Liberia, obstruction of the free flow of traffic and the movement of peaceful citizens, the disruption of economic activities, and concomitant panic in the City with total disregard of the consequences thereof.\" \n'No Matter the Status'; Police Caution Officials \nA year earlier, Liberia was embroiled in a series of unfortunate acts involving attacks on officers of the Liberia National Police enforcing traffic violations, prompting Police director Col. Chris Massaquoi to declare that individuals caught violating traffic rules will be dealt with according to the law. \n\"The LNP will resist any and all attempt by any motorist, be it government workers, government officials or whoever deliberately or attempt to deliberately run over officers,\" Col. Massaquoi averred. \"This will be regarded as an attempt to run over the officer and as such, such individuals again no matter the status will be exposed and will face the full weight of the law.\" \nCol. Massaquoi's angst had been fueled after members of government particularly the national legislature took matters in their own hands by attacking traffic officers in the line of duty. In 2010, the U.S. State Department Report noted that in May, Representative George W. Blamoh allegedly beat an LNP officer who attempted to impound his vehicle for improper parking and traffic violations. An investigation was completed and submitted to the Ministry of Justice, and Blamoh was awaiting trial at year's end. \nTwo months later, on July 10, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Togbah Mulbah allegedly ordered the beating of LNP officer Lexington Beh for impounding a truck belonging to the Lawmaker. The incident became politicized when partisans from the Lawmaker's political party, the Congress for Democratic Change, surrounded Mulbah's residence the next day as Police attempted to arrest him. Upon further investigation, an 11-count indictment was issued in July, and Mulbah was awaiting trial at year's end. \nCol. Chris Massaquoi himself was summoned and held in contempt by the legislature for simply discharging his statutory duty enshrined in the Vehicle and Traffic Laws of Liberia. The Police Chief was summoned because his officers apprehended a traffic violator who claimed to have been Senator Armah Jallah(Gbarpolu County). Even though the Senator himself was never onboard the vehicle, the driver insisted that the vehicle should benefit from all immunities that are restricted to him, even though traffic violation is not part of his immunities. \nIronically, Article 42 of the constitution makes no mention of immunities from traffic violations. It states: \"No member of the Senate or House of Representatives shall be arrested, detained, prosecuted or tried as a result of opinions expressed or votes cast in the exercise of the functions of his office. Members shall be privileged from arrest while attending, going to or returning from sessions of the Legislature, except for treason, felony or breach of the peace. All official acts done or performed and all statements made in the Chambers of the Legislature shall be privileged, and no Legislator shall be held accountable or punished therefor. \nThe Traffic law only reserves special treatment for the President and Vice President but that has been unofficially extended to all other branches. Senator Jallah, now Pro Temp of the Senate, apparently misinformed his colleagues that he was in the vehicle on his way to execute his official duty when the Police chief obstructed him, something Jallah argued is in total violation of the Constitution of Liberia as it relates to the Legislature's benefits and immunities. The Lawmaker's story was rebuffed by eyewitnesses who explained that he was not in the vehicle when the offense was committed as he had claimed. \nDespite the observations by the U.S. State Department, officials of government representing all three branches continue to ignore the vehicle and traffic laws of the republic and putting the lives of scores of motorists and pedestrians at risk of being maimed or killed. Over the past few months, a team of FrontPageAfrica reporters and editors have been monitoring the rush hour traffic movements and uncovering a lot of violations of the traffic by senior government officials including the Minister of Justice Benedict Sannoh, Information Minister Lewis Brown, members of the judiciary and legislative branches of government. \nBesides bulldozing their way past Police officers, many officials have developed the tendency of driving in opposing traffic lanes during rush morning and evening traffic in a bid to get the work or home in total disregard of the vehicle and traffic laws or those ordinary pedestrians and motorists plying the already small roads filled with potholes. \nUnder Section the Vehicle and Traffic law only the President, vice president and emergency vehicles are required to use sirens in traffic and change lanes. Police vehicles are allowed but only in emergency situations. The 102-plated vehicle is considered emergency throughout the day or night. But in most instances, our investigation, encountered non-governmental organization (NGO)-plated vehicles parading through the traffic at will. In one instance, a driver in a Navigator jeep actually pulled his glass down to tongue-lashed a reporter who refused to remove from the right lane to give him access to pass as he blinked his lights and put on his vehicle siren. \nWhat the Vehicle and Traffic Law says \nSection 10.4 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of Liberia in the Liberian Code of Laws is clear that: \"Any person who operates a vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property is guilty of reckless driving. A person who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine of not more than US$500.00 or imprisonment for not more than six months or both.\" \nIn 2014, the LNP reported that it had generated more than LD$5.4 million in traffic violation tickets issued by its Ticketing Unit. The Unit issued 8,108 tickets that fed government coffers with LD$3,374,444.99 and US$24,620.72, an equivalent of LD$2,018,899 (US$1=LD$82), during the period under review. The money covers collection from the Ticketing Unit, Highway Patrol Section, Motorcycle Unit and the counties, according to the 2013 annual report of the LNP Traffic Section which made no mention of the number of Lawmakers or government officials issued tickets. \nAccording to the LNP report, the amount collected, US$11,480 was raised from 900 traffic violation tickets issued to motorcyclists in 2013. During the period under review, the Police said of the 8,108, ticket issued, 111 tickets were challenged in court by accused violators, and that there were 11 tickets won by alleged violators, while the remaining 100 were won by the LNP. \nLaw Enforcement observers say the funds collected by the Police could be a lot more if those paid by taxpayers and working in their capacity as Lawmakers and officials of government were made to pay for breaking the law in the same manner ordinary motorists are pull aside by Police officers. \nDuring our investigation, a lot of government-plated vehicles from O, representing senior Cabinet ministers to RL representing those at lower levels, to REP or HOR representing the legislature and JUD, representing the judicial branch, were seen overtaking, overlapping and driving in opposing lanes. In most cases, ordinary-plated vehicles were seen taking advantage of the opening by driving behind those vehicles during the rush hour traffic period. \nSection 38: 10.21: Under the general rule states that vehicles shall be driven on the right half of every road of sufficient width except as follows: \"When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction under the rules governing such movement; when overtaking or passing pedestrians or obstructions on the right half of the highway; when the right half of a road is closed to traffic while under the construction or repair; upon a roadway designated and signposted for one-way traffic.\" \nSection 10.21 states that drivers of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right and upon highways having width for not more than one line of traffic in each direction each driver shall give to the other as nearly as possible at least one half of the main-traveled portion of the highway. \nPart of the problem, according to John Etherton- an expat who was a victim of pullover by an officer of the LNP boils down to ignorance. \"If you're fortunate enough to have a UNMIL, Republic of Liberia, Consular Diplomat, or Non-Governmental Organization (this only works when it's on a shiny white SUV) license plate, this doesn't apply to you. You can drive like an idiot all day long and not get pulled over. The problem is, aside from the socioeconomic profiling that stems from corruption, that no one really knows the traffic law. Can I legally put a surf board on the roof of a taxi? Is it illegal to make a U-turn when there are no traffic signs in the country? What is the speed limit on a pot holed road in a shanty town? \n'No Drivers' Handbook \nEtherton's frustration led him to purchase a copy of the entire Vehicle and Traffic Laws of Liberia and post online. \"I think the law is dated to sometime around the '70s. So it may not be the most up to date law, but it's the only law you can get. There's no driver's handbook, or other publication that informs the public on how to drive. In light of this lack of information I've posted the entirety of the book here for anyone to educate themselves on how to drive in Liberia. I also had a little help from an independent scanning contractor. I hope this will lead to a better informed and safer driving public. If nothing else I'd especially like to point out section 6.35.6, which discusses the use of high beams.\" \nAs Lawmakers and government officials break the law, the Police hierarchy has reported in recent times that some of its officers have had to be flown abroad for specialized medical treatment after sustaining life-threatening injuries as a result of being intentionally hit and run by vehicle operators including Lawmakers. \nDirector Massaquoi had previously warned against the flagrant and wanton disregard of the vehicle and traffic laws by both elected or appointed officials 'driving themselves or are driven by their chauffeurs'. He called individuals engaged in the illegal and unlawful use of emergency devices, such as emergency lights, sirens and horns to immediately desist and remove these devices from their vehicles; while those using the shoulders of the roads to create a third lane to refrain and stay on the main road. \n\"The above dangerous and illegal practice has become alarming at the point when some officials of government when told to observe the laws attempt to run the traffic Police over in the callous disrespect for the law and safety of the republic of Liberia; especially for officers, whose duty it is to regulate and control the traffic,\" he said. \nNo justice for the poor \nAs it is a popular saying in Liberia that the Lawmakers are the lawbreakers, ordinary Liberians do not have the choice to get away with violations like officials of government do. Many told FrontPageAfrica in separate interviews that they get frustrated to see officials of government who want the ordinary people to obey the law, themselves disobeying the law without remorse. Several taxi drivers believe that government officials misuse their power by taking advantage of the poor people. James Kamara, a regular taxi driver along the Sinkor route expressed serious disappointment over the act of traffic violations by officials of government. \n\"We waste our time in huge traffic in the morning, sometimes our gas finish because of the time spent in the traffic waiting for traffic to be free, it can really hurt me when I see government officials taking advantage of us the common people,\" he stated. Prince Morgan, another taxi driver is blaming the Police for not enforcing the laws. \n\"The Police is responsible for all of these traffic violations. If an official of government takes the opposite lane to beat the traffic the Police will not arrest or park them, but if it is me who is just a taxi driver, they will park or even give me ticket. The justice system is not fair to us the poor people especially the traffic laws,\" he expressed. \nRose Johnson, a resident of the Gardnesville community has described the cause of traffic congestion in the vicinity as horrible. She said \"they take advantage of their government plate and their position to violate the traffic by taking the opposite lane, the road already small and bad, where do you expect the cars on the opposite lane to go when government cars on their (opposite lane cars) lane, this alone cause traffic in our area\". Other Liberians say one of the areas that most government officials violate the traffic is the Duala to Monrovia route, as these officials are seen using their blinkers like they are in emergency. The Police is responsible to regulate the traffic mainly when there are traffic jam. In most cases the Police allow government marked vehicles to use the opposite lane to beat the traffic in the morning and evening hours. \nNo choice, Police officers say \nA Police officer who asked not is named told FPA that traffic Police in most cases take instructions from their bosses to allow top government officials to use the opposite lane to go to work. The Police officer described the situation as wrong, saying, they (Police) have no choice but to obey what their bosses tell them. \"What to do my brother, whenever we catch a government car and park it for violating the traffic, that official will take the telephone and call our bosses, and our bosses in return will tell the driver to present the phone to us and they will instruct us to allow the car to go and even tell us at times to escort such official with the Police car,\" the Policeman explained. \nThe Police officer furthered that the traffic and vehicles law prohibits unauthorized cars using the opposite lane. He said the only cars that are allowed to use the opposite lane are emergency vehicles such as cars from Fire Service, Ambulances, Police marked vehicles among others. The Police officer also said vehicles in such category can still be stopped if they are on emergency. \nAnother Police officer also narrated that he nearly lost his job for impounding a vehicle which later turned out to be a family member to one senior government official. \"One day I parked a car in which one lady was riding for using the opposite lane, she was so rude and started abusing me but in the end she just called on her phone and one of my bosses was on the line yelling at me to allow her go\", the officer explained. On a daily basis the number of vehicles using the opposite lane is increasing with more individuals taking advantage of the weak enforcement by the Police. \nReporter Edwin Genoway Contributed to this report Liberia \nPresentation to the U.S.-Liberian Trade and Investment Forum see more » Copyright © 2015 FrontPageAfrica.
