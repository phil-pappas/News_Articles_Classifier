CMAF was designed specifically for the Fund and targets long-term net asset value growth while further expanding the set of investment strategies utilized in MSGI. CMAF is a diversified, growth-oriented portfolio of ten independent hedge funds, all of which have limited access. CMAF represents a collection of experienced and accomplished hedge fund managers within the absolute return investing landscape. Collins Capital Investments, LLC (\"Collins Capital\"), a veteran hedge fund-of-funds provider, is the manager of the strategy and worked closely with Lucia Capital Management to develop the strategy through its long-standing reputation and long-term relationships within the industry.\nCMAF is designed to be consistent with MSGI's goal of achieving compelling, risk-adjusted returns by employing a \"multi-manager\" approach utilizing a select group of investment managers. The underlying managers have historically exhibited results that are consistent with the Fund's objectives of current income and capital appreciation with low correlation to traditional asset classes. \"The low correlations these managers have demonstrated to stocks and bonds, as well as to our existing Fund investment strategies, combined with their ability to outperform relevant hedge fund indices over the long-term 1 was very attractive to us,\" said Mark Scalzo , co-portfolio manager of the Fund. He added, \"Through this investment, we continue to demonstrate our ability to access and create opportunities for the typical investor that would generally be available to only large institutions and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\" \nRay Lucia Jr. , co-portfolio manager of the Fund, said, \"This investment is the culmination of several months of exhaustive efforts from our investment team, Collins Capital, and third-party due diligence groups. Designing a structure and lineup that fit the specific needs of our portfolio was no easy feat, but the resulting investment opportunity is something that we're all very proud of.\" He added, \"This is just another step forward in our efforts to provide our investors with unique, institutional-quality exposure. We believe a diversified set of investment strategies will position MSGI for the future in a variety of possible market cycles. We are excited about this opportunity and what it means for the Fund.\"\nAbout Lucia Capital Group \nHeadquartered in San Diego, California , Lucia Capital Group, led by its chairman, Ray Lucia Jr. , encompasses a family of companies across multiple lines of financial services businesses, including wealth advisory, asset management, investment platform, and product origination.

It allows investors diversification in several potentially income-producing alternative strategies at a low minimum investment while providing limited liquidity.\nThe Fund seeks a multi-strategy approach to investing by diversifying assets across various alternative investments, including real estate investment trusts (REITs), equity income investments, and business development companies (BDCs), with the overall goal of providing a consistent quarterly distribution. However, there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its objectives, generate profits, or avoid losses.\nThe Fund gives investors access to alternative income strategies that may provide greater yields and growth opportunities than traditional investment strategies. The primary objective of the Fund is current income generation. The secondary objective of the Fund is to achieve long-term growth.\nThe Fund intends to make a distribution to its shareholders each month of the net investment income of the Fund after payment of the Fund's operating expenses.\nTo learn more about the Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund, contact Shelsey Carpenter at (800) 825-0937.\nAbout Collins Capital Investments, LLC \nCollins Capital is an experienced alternative investment firm whose funds use differentiated, non-correlated strategies to target compelling, risk-adjusted returns. Collins Capital offers diversified multi-manager, multi-strategy portfolios and seeks long-term capital appreciation through absolute returns while maintaining a low correlation over time with major equity and bond markets.\nFounded in 1995, Collins Capital is an independent, owner-operated registered investment advisor specializing in hedge fund portfolios.\nFor more information about Collins Capital, visit www.collinscap.com .\nLimited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund's quarterly repurchase offers for up to 5% of the shares outstanding at net asset value (NAV). There is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares they desire in a quarterly repurchase offer. The sale of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund's NAV. \nDistributions through the managed distribution policy are not guaranteed. Shareholders receiving periodic payments from the Fund may be under the impression that they are receiving net profits. However, all or a portion of a distribution may consist of a return of capital. \nThere is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives, generate profits, or avoid losses. Past performance does not guarantee future results. \nMutual funds involve risk including loss of principal. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, mutual funds, and closed-end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. \nAn alternative investment is an investment that is not one of the three traditional asset types (stocks, bonds, or cash). Most alternative investment assets are held by institutional investors or accredited, high-net-worth individuals because of their complex nature, limited regulations, and relative lack of liquidity. Alternative investments include hedge funds, managed futures, real estate, commodities, and derivatives contracts. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and will magnify the Fund's gains or losses. There currently is no secondary market for the Fund's shares, and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. The Fund will not invest in real estate directly, but, because the Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of REITs, its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market. \nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (800) 644-1150. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. \nMorningstar HSCI Hedge Fund Multi Strategy Index - An investment may not be made directly in an index. \nThe Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund is distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC. Northern Lights Distributors is not under common ownership or control with Lucia Capital Group, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates. \nCollins Capital Investments, LLC is not under common ownership or control with Lucia Capital Group, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates. \n2402-NLD- 7/23/2015 \n1 A weighted average custom portfolio comprised of the historical performance from each underlying fund was used for analytical purposes. The results were compared to the Morningstar HSCI Hedge Fund Multistrategy Index. During diligence on individual hedge funds, each fund was compared to one or more relative HFRI, HFRX, MSCI, Dow Jones/Credit Suisse or other benchmarks. Comparisons were completed by the MSGI Advisor entity (\"the Firm\") and/or the manager of CMAF (\"Collins Capital\"). Underlying fund performance is private, and cannot be publicly disclosed. \n2 Interval Fund: An interval fund is a type of investment company that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. That is, the fund periodically offers to buy back a stated portion of its shares from shareholders. Shareholders are not required to accept these offers and sell their shares back to the fund.
