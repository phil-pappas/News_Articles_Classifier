Also, Nifty can decline, if it closes below 7,750. The major indices in the Indian stock market were initially range-bound, but closed the day with gains. Hopes of a rate cut by the apex bank on the back of strong macro-economic data buoyed the Indian equities markets on Monday. The better-than-expected wholesale price index (WPI) and a modest factory output data cheered investors. The hopes of a healthy consumer price index (CPI) data, expected to be released later in the day, further supported the markets. Analysts cited healthy WPI data released on Monday and Friday's index of industrial production numbers (IIP) to be the positive triggers for the markets. Despite a steep rise in prices of pulses and onions, India's annual inflation rate based on wholesale prices continued in the negative territory in August, falling to (-)4.95%. The wholesale prices had decelerated by (-)4.05% in July. The steep decline in August was mainly led by lower fuel prices. Another key macro indicator showed that India's factory output had grown by 4.2% in July against a marginal rise of 0.9% in the like month of last year. On the other hand, the growth seemed to have slowed when compared to the revised figures for June which showed a rise of 4.4% against a rise of 3.8% which was published in the \"Quick Estimates of IIP\" released on 12 August 2015. The major data of IIP, WPI and CPI are the last significant pointers towards Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) rate decision. India Inc. expects a better-than-expected WPI and CPI will drastically improve chances of a rate cut during RBI's monetary policy review slated for September 29. The WPI and CPI indicators are also important, as they will give domestic guidance to the capital markets, just before the US Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet on September 16-17. The US Fed will decide during the FOMC meeting whether or not to raise interest rates The top gainers and top losers in the major indices in the stock market in India are given in the table below: The closing values of the major Asian indices are given in the table below: More in Moneylife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:32:41.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
