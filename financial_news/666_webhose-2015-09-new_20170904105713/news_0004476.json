Japanese policymakers are nervous because they can't do anything until it's clear what the Fed will do, which has kept investors on edge.\"\nA weakening yen also helped boost shares of Japan's major exporters. Investors had feared continued strength in the yen after it 116 against the dollar last week.\nToyota Motor Corp. shares climbed 2.4 percent and Nissan Motor Co. gained 1.3 percent.\nToshiba shares gained 2.1 percent after the Yomiuri newspaper said the company will likely report long-delayed earnings as early as this week. The company has twice postponed releasing its earnings for the 2014-15 financial year amid a probe into improper accounting.\nNTT Docomo jumped 4.4 percent after Barclays upgraded its stock to 'overweight' from 'under weight' and raised its target price to 3,000 yen from 2,200 yen.\nThe Nikkei volatility index fell 3.8 percent, but remained high at 35.7 percent.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,474.98, closing with 19 of its 33 subsectors in positive territory. Its Insurance subsector led the day with a gain of 2.8 percent.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 gained 0.6 percent to 13,246.79.
