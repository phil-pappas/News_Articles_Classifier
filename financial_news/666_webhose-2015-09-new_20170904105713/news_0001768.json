Labor Day came later and Hanukkah will come earlier. The Hanukkah timing could lead to higher sales in November, ShopperTrak said.\nAnother trend offering support is a reduction in the number of store trips consumers are making, but an increase in the size of individual transactions. Despite the August increase, the number of shopper visits decreased by 2.7% for the month.\n“Several trends indicate a successful November and December, including the rise of the educated consumer -- who visits the store less but buys more -- and the lengthening of the shopping season,” said Kevin Kearns, ShopperTrak’s chief revenue officer, in a statement.\nPaula Rosenblum, retail analyst at Retail Systems Research, is also expecting a robust holiday season, perhaps a better one than that predicted by ShopperTrak.\n“Given the stunning fall in gas prices, I would expect something closer to 3%,” Rosenblum said in an email. “Sales have been strong over the past few months. I see no reason why they will slow down. And given retailers’ hyper-promotional bent, consumers will be looking for deals, and will likely get them.”\nSee also: Stop whining about Christmas Creep: It’s your fault it exists \nConsumer electronics, like smartphones and possibly televisions, will be on many consumers’ shopping lists, said Rosenblum. And the “athleisure” fashion trend – items like yoga pants – will continue.\nSee also: Yoga pants make their way to New York Fashion Week \nWhen you take e-commerce into account, holiday receipts will be even higher. Online sales account for about 8% of retail sales, said Rosenblum.\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.75% is certainly mindful of the digital side of the retail business. The retailer announced on Thursday that it will hire 60,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, the same number as in 2014. Wal-Mart plans to add department managers in 3,500 stores specifically to handle in-store pickups for items purchased online, said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer at Walmart U.S., in a statement.\nStill, the retailer is focused on expediting the checkout process and other parts of the shopping experience by adding hours for existing workers as well as bringing on new staffers. New holiday workers will start with pay of $9 per hour. \nKohl’s KSS, -2.88% is bringing on 69,000 seasonal workers , up from 67,000 a year ago. It plans to add 50 workers to each of its 1,166 stores and about 9,500 people to its e-commerce and distribution fulfillment centers.\nAnd Toys R Us has announced plans to add 40,000 seasonal workers, but that will be fewer than the 45,000 hired in 2014. A spokeswoman for the retailer said the cut was primarily due to an increase in the number of hours that seasonal hires can work, an average of 18 to 20 hours per week from an average of seven hours last year. Seasonal workers may work up to 30 hours per week during the peak portion of the holiday season. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:18:17.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
