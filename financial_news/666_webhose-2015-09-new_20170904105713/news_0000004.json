Justin Sullivan by Ed Crooks\nInvestors controlling about $US2.6 trillion ($3.7 trillion) in total assets have made commitments to cut back or sell out of their holdings in fossil fuel companies, campaigners say, signalling the growing momentum of the divestment movement.\nThe actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who has joined the campaign, said on Tuesday that more than 2,000 individuals and 400 institutions were committed to taking their money out of fossil fuel companies.\nThere has been a 50-fold increase over the past year in the value of funds that have pledged to shift away from coal, oil or gas, citing both ethical and financial motives for their decisions.\nHowever, the largest investors have made only limited commitments, pledging to divest from coal companies while retaining large investments in oil and gas.\nCampaigners concerned about the threat of climate change argue that investors have a moral responsibility not to finance activities that lead to high emissions of greenhouse gases, and that forthcoming climate policies are likely to make those activities unprofitable.\nEllen Dorsey of the Wallace Global Fund , a foundation that works on environmental and social issues, said the divestment campaign had evolved from \"a few scrappy students\" into a global movement.\n\"We're seeing a fundamental change here,\" Ms Dorsey said. \"If you're not paying attention to that, as an investor, you're being negligent.\"\n The total value of the holdings that investors are selling is not known, but Ryan Strode at Arabella Advisors , the research firm that calculated the $US2.6 trillion figure, said a sample of just 7 per cent of the investors involved had between them sold or promised to sell about $US6 billion worth of fossil fuel investments.\nThe largest investors that have made commitments include Norway's state pension fund, Axa, the French insurance group, Nordea Asset Management, the largest Nordic fund manager, and the University of California.\nThese funds have sold or pledged to sell their shares in coal companies, which have performed very poorly in recent years.\nFor example shares in Peabody Energy, the largest US coal group by production, have dropped 98 per cent since April 2011, under pressure from environmental regulations, competition from cheap natural gas, and a slump in world markets caused by falling demand in China.\nThe University of California has also sold its shares in companies operating in Canada's oil sands, an industry that faces a squeeze on its profitability because of the slump in crude prices.\nDivestment remains controversial among investors. California's state assembly has backed legislation to bar public employees' pension funds Calpers and Calstrs from buying new shares in companies that make more than half their revenues from mining coal used for power generation. It has also forced the funds to sell any shares they hold in those companies by July 2017.\nAnne Stausboll, the chief executive of Calpers, said in the Financial Times earlier this year that large institutions \"walking away\" from fossil fuel companies by selling their holdings would not help tackle the threat of climate change.\n\"As a long-term investor, a seat at the table is the most effective way to shape how our investment capital gets put to use in a sustainable manner,\" she wrote.", "external_links": ["http://www.arabellaadvisors.com/", "http://wgf.org/"], "published": "2015-09-23T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:12:48.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
