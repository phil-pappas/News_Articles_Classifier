A higher return indicates more efficient use of capital. \nHere, Barratt is doing well: ROCE rose to 23.9pc from 19.5pc last year. \nThe construction firm maintained its owned and controlled land bank supply at 70,523 plots, equating to four-and-a-half years of production, with 16,956 plots approved for purchase during the year. \nThe housebuilder made a strong start to the new financial year, too, with net private reservations up 15pc to 257 a week compared with the same time last year. \nForward sales, including joint ventures, are running 32pc ahead. \nChief executive David Thomas said: \"The strong operational and financial performance reinforces the progress we have made over the past few years. \n\"The new financial year has started very well. We have a strong forward sales position and are making very good progress towards our 2017 targets of at least a 20pc gross margin and at least a 25pc return on capital employed.\" \nJohn Allan, chairman of Barratt, said: \"The market for new homes remains strong across Britain, with demand continuing to exceed supply. The mortgage market has continued to improve both in terms of availability and rates, as well as Government support for the new-build market. \n\"Against this strong market backdrop we are delivering ongoing improvements in our own performance across all aspects of our operations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T18:30:31.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
