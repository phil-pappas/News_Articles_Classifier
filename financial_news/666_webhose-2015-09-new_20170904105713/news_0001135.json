Shares of car giant Volkswagen tumbled 19 percent after it was found to have cheated U.S. emission tests.\nInvestors cheered an unexpectedly clear election victory for the Syriza party in Greece on Sunday that boosted hopes its bailout program would stay on the road.\nIn Asia, equity markets slumped, with 1.5 percent to 2 percent falls in Australia, Korea and Malaysia .\nChina defied the region's downtrend, with the Shanghai Composite index up 1.9 percent and the CSI300 rising 1.75 percent.\nOil and metals markets also rebounded from falls at the end of last week, although emerging market stocks and currencies continued to struggle amid global growth worries caused by last week's latest postponement of a long-awaited U.S. interest rate hike.\n\"Generally, markets are a bit more positive today,\" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets in London.\n\"The economic environment has changed since the Fed last hiked rates (in 2006). It is not just the U.S. central bank ... It is wearing the mantle of the global central bank, and markets are struggling with that.\"\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened against a basket of major currencies on hopes the Fed was still on track to hike rates this year while the European Central Bank may ease further.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 1.05 percent.\nThe Fed's decision last week may lead other central banks, including the ECB, to ease further, said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.\nInvestors should get a good explanation this week on why the Fed did not raise rates, with Chair Janet Yellen among a host of officials due to speak.\nU.S. Treasuries prices fell as U.S. equity markets rallied and two top Federal Reserve officials spurred sales of debt by suggesting that a year-end U.S. interest rate increase was possible.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasuries notes were down 21/32 in price, yielding 2.208 percent, up 7 basis points from late on Friday.
