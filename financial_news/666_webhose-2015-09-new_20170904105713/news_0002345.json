This is why the German Consulate General in Bengaluru engages in discussions on Climate Change with local politics, academia, NGOs and the interested public. Climate change is a question of international responsibility and solidarity. We need to use the tools of diplomacy to raise ambition in partner countries, to forge alliances and build the necessary political momentum.” Ms Anandi Iyer , Director Fraunhofer India says “ With the Inspiration and Energy of our Hon’ble PM Mr Narendra Modi, the Smart cities initiative is gaining momentum and already the first set of 98 smart cities have been identified. Fraunhofer has immense competencies in this field, we have been executing Global Projects on Smart Cities since the last 5 years and given our broad capabilities across the industry spectrum, we would be delighted to partner with India in the unfolding Growth Story.”“The three priority areas in the context of a metropolis like Bangalore would have to be efficient mix of the energy options to optimise use of energy, rationalising the distribution and usage of water, and totally cut out wasteful and dangerous disposal of waste.
