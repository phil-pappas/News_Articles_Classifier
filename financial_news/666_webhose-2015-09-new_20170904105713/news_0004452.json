At least for the time being. \nThis dullness refers to the trendless state of the averages over the past week. This is probably the most bullish thing a market two weeks from a selling climax can do. \nThe chart below of the Nasdaq Composite highlights the most recent swing high and swing low. They define a triangular-shaped price pattern, the likes of which can sometimes lead to a pickup in volatility should price break out. \nFor a larger chart, please click here . \nChart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2015. All rights reserved. \nAbove-average volatility will be present for a while. Following a highly volatile event such as the Flash Crash (2010) or Black Monday (1987) or August 2011, the tendency is for volatility to work its way back to the mean. On its way to the mean, there is still the residual effect of the event's volatility. This is similar to throwing a stone into a placid lake. The concentric circles (volatility) that emanate from \"the event\" dissipate over time as the lake reverts to its mean state of placidity. \nOtherwise, it is premature for a momentum-based speculator in aggressive growth names to move off of a high cash position. The pattern setups are simply not there. Only a few growth issues that led the market prior to this correction are showing outperformance, while emerging leaders — new merchandise — have yet to make their identity known. \nWhat is needed is time for broken individual stock charts to mend themselves. From the standpoint of a speculator, of utmost import is focus. Now is not the time to become despondent about the market environment such that one's regular routine of research is broken. \nAlong these lines, this participant learned a valuable lesson back in 1990, his first year as a trader/speculator. He found himself safely in cash just as the short 1990 bear market had begun. But as the averages sank, he made the mistake of discontinuing his research routine. He stopped looking at charts completely. \nLittle did he know that many of the outstanding actors of the explosive 1991 bull market were beginning to build the right sides of bases despite the punk action of the averages. \nThe market liftoff of early 1991, precipitated by the start of the first Gulf War, made the onset of a new bull market obvious. Powerful breakouts were everywhere. \nBut wouldn't it have been nice to have gotten into these big winners prior to their outsized moves? \nLesson learned. And just in time for the 'Nineties bull market that followed.
