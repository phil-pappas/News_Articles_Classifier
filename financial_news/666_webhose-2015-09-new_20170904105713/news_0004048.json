The Independent Greeks would get 10 votes, potentially giving a Syriza-Independent Greeks alliance a narrow majority.\n(Reporting By Renee Maltezou, writing by Michele Kambas; editing by John Stonestreet)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T21:25:10.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
