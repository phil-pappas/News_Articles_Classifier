The city approved the $3 billion project last month, which would encompass 40.6 million square feet of warehouse space—a giant development by industry standards.\nBut the booming logistics industry faces unique challenges in California, where developments must satisfy requirements under a strict statewide law known as the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, which requires a detailed, publicly-available report on the environmental impacts of any project. That law is behind the challenges filed in Moreno Valley.\nThe litigants—Riverside County, the region’s air quality regulatory body, several environmental advocacy groups, transportation officials and the Laborers International Union of North America—allege that the city should not have approved the project because its environmental impact report didn’t adequately take into account the community’s public health concerns. The lawsuits ask the Riverside Superior Court to invalidate the city’s approval and enjoin the city and the World Logistics Center developers from proceeding with the project.\n“We’re asking the city to engage in this land use decision responsibly,” said Yana Garcia, a lawyer with public interest law firm Earthjustice, which is representing a handful of environmental groups that filed one of the lawsuits. “Our position and our clients’ position is not anti-growth, anti-jobs or anti-industry,” Ms. Garcia said, “what we’re asking for is responsible growth.”\nRepresentatives for the city and Highland Fairview, the real estate developer behind the project, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\nOther real estate developers and lawyers say CEQA lawsuits have caused unnecessary delays for many big projects, and they’re calling for reform to the law.\n“The process clearly isn’t working,” said Fran Inman, senior vice president at Majestic Realty Co.\nWrite to Erica E.
