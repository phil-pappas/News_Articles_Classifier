Those were the marching orders issued to the Alabama House of Representatives from Gov. Robert Bentley (R) earlier this year. Specifically, the \"or else\" included a threat to cut a number of services to taxpayers including closing prisons. Kicking up the rhetoric, he warned taxpayers in April, [tweet_Quote: display=\"&quot;You might not care about prisoners but when you have them in your basement, you’re going to care.&quot;\"]\"You might not care about prisoners but when you have them in your basement, you’re going to care.\"[/tweet_Quote: ] The House answered the call this week, passing five bills to raise taxes and fees in the state. Among the taxes and fees that are going up? Cigarette taxes, automobile title fees, car rental taxes, pharmacy taxes and nursing home taxes. The combination of tax increases will raise approximately $107 million in more revenue for the state in the next fiscal year. The problem? The state was $200 million short.[caption id=\"attachment_485225914\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] LOS ANGELES, CA - AUGUST 25: A dancer leads guests into the party at a Special Screening and After-Party for EuropaCorp's 'The Transporter Refueled' held at the Playboy Mansion on August 25, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Playboy)[/caption]As the House scrambles to make up the difference, Rep. Jack Williams (R) thinks he has the answer: a tax on porn. He has proposed a 40% (no, not a typo, that's 40%) excise tax on receipts from \"the sale of sexually-oriented materials and certain charges related to sexually-explicit businesses.\"I know what you're thinking: how would you even define those sexually-oriented materials and sexually-explicit businesses?In an effort to avoid any Justice Potter Stewartesque \"I know it when I see it\" standard, the bill goes into some pretty serious detail of what constitutes sexual conduct, sexually-oriented material and sexually-explicit business. For purposes of the tax, for example, the bill defines sexual conduct as \"[a]ny act of sexual intercourse, masturbation, urination, defecation, lewd exhibition of the genitals, sado-masochistic abuse, bestiality, or the fondling of the sex organs of animals.\" (Really, Alabama?)The definition goes on to include \"any other physical contact with a person’s unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or the breast or breasts of a female, whether alone or between members of the same or opposite sex or between a human and an animal, in an act of sexual stimulation, gratification, or perversion.\" (Seriously, Alabama?)The bill further defines sexually-oriented material as \"Any book, magazine, newspaper, printed or written matter, writing, description, picture, drawing, animation, photograph, motion picture, film, video tape, pictorial presentation, depiction, image, electrical or electronic reproduction, broadcast, transmission, video download, telephone communication, sound recording, article, device, equipment, matter, oral communication, depicting breast or genital nudity\" or any of that sexual conduct defined earlier.That covers quite the gamut. To be more specific, the law basically targets any \"entertainment product that’s adult in nature\" meaning, according to Rep. Williams , that you have to be over 18 to purchase the product. In that way, he says, it's the same as an excise tax on cigarettes and tobacco. He feels so strongly about this point that it's reiterated in the introduction to the bill.So, I get it. Anything more sexually charged than, say, a Pixar movie, could result in a massive tax, right? That means adult movies for you, Alabama. Because I've seen - I mean, I've heard - that some mainstream movies do, in fact, show a little skin. And some of those mainstream movies even pick up an Academy Award or two ( Gwyneth Paltrow , anyone?). But if you have to be an adult to see it, you're out of luck: Alabama is going to tax it.But wait, as it turns out, the drafters thought of that, adding that \"the tax levied by this section shall not apply to motion pictures designated by the rating board for the Motion Picture Association of America by the letter “R” for restricted audiences, persons under 17 years of age not admitted unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian, or the designation “NC-17” for persons under 17 years of age not admitted.\" So, to be clear, any movies that are rated R or NC-17 would be okay - but any magazine shots or books about the same would be taxed since we don't have a ratings system for those. Got it. I think.As for those sexually-explicit businesses? They are defined as a business at \"which any nude or partially denuded individual\" performs \"any of the following services\" which include \"Striptease, burlesque, or drag shows\" or \"Massages.\" And no, there's no further distinction when it comes to massages. Somewhere, someone in the healthcare industry is banging their head against a desk. There is, however, this bit that exempts \"any contraceptive device or medication\" as well as \"any medication that is prescribed by a physician that is intended to enhance sexual performance or sexual enjoyment.\" That's right, you don't have to read too much between the lines: Alabama politicians have declared that, as it applies to this bill, Viagra remains tax-free. (Insert your own joke here).Try as I might, I can't find any details on how much revenue Alabama expects to raise by slapping a tax on porn but clearly, Rep. Williams, believes that it might be significant. He might be onto something. A state-by-state ranking of the 37 million users of cheating website Ashley Madison arranged by spending (dollars per capita) put Alabama right at the top. So clearly there is a market in Alabama willing to spend money to engage in at least some kind of sexual conduct. I'm sorry, I meant discreet encounters.Still, it doesn't appear that there are any concrete revenue projections. Similarly, I haven't seen any firm numbers on associated costs (I don't even want to think how you would enforce tax collections on that beat: \"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm going to have to watch that lap dance one more time before I render my decision.\"). Nonetheless, the Alabama House Ways and Means Committee seems to think it's a good idea and has passed the bill along to the House for consideration.You can read the full text of the proposal bill here (downloads as a pdf).", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/485225914/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.businessinsider.com/ashley-madison-leak-reveals-which-states-like-to-cheat-the-most-2015-8", "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/alabama_house_passes_five_tax.html#incart_story_package", "https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB17/id/1261438/Alabama-2015-HB17-Introduced.pdf", "http://wiat.com/2015/09/08/porn-tax-being-proposed-as-second-special-session-begins/", "http://wiat.com/2015/04/08/bentley-warns-of-major-service-cuts-if-taxes-arent-raised/"], "published": "2015-09-12T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T20:24:13.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
