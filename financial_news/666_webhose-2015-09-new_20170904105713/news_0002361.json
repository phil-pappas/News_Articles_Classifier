The firm made the announcement at an investor symposium in Hong Kong.\nNaveen Chawla, Chief Investment Officer at Bluefield Partners said that the milestone marked the firm’s transition to upper-quartile wealth manager status in the Asia Pacific region.\n“The passing of this milestone places us in rarified company in our region. The fact that we’ve achieved this as a local practice rather than as a subsidiary of a larger US or European parent makes it all the more satisfying,” he said.\nThe firm has developed extensive relationships with primary broker/dealers in the US and Europe and has developed innovative products that have been warmly received by a burgeoning Chinese middle-class with money to invest but it is the inroads it has made into the Asia-Pacific institutional investor segment of the market that has provided much of the boost to its funds under management.\n“The fantastic performance on both the Hang Seng Index and the Shanghai Composite this year has seen a surge in interest among retail and institutional investors alike and Bluefield Partners has been well-placed to tap into that demand,” added Chawla.\nBluefield Partners says it will continue to innovate in product development while ensuring that clients can still gain full access to new and exciting stock floatations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nAbout Bluefield Partners:\nBluefield Partners was established in 2005.
