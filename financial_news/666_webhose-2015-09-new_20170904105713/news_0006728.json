Nastco Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jill Margo Maintaining a healthy body weight is more challenging than ever and people under 25 now have to eat even less and exercise more, than their parents once did, to stay in shape.\nA study published in the journal Obesity Research & Clinical Practice suggests factors other than food and exercise are now contributing to the rise in obesity.\nFunded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the study analysed dietary data of some 36,000 American adults over a 37-year period. Physical activity data was available for about 14,500 of them over half the period.\nThe authors observed that for a given amount of food intake, people were about 10 per cent heavier in 2008 than in 1971.\nIt is harder for younger people to remain trim than it was for their parents. Getty They were also about five per cent heavier for a given amount of physical activity level in 1988 than 2006.\nThe authors say secular changes may, in part, explain the dramatic rise in obesity in Western societies. Although several studies have shown that eating less and exercising more results in weight loss, in the long term, these measures are mostly ineffective.\nThe authors say weight management is much more complex than simply 'energy in' versus 'energy out'.\nThis would be similar to saying an investment account balance is simply deposits subtracting withdrawals without accounting for other factors that affect the balance such as sharemarket fluctuations, bank fees or currency exchange rates.\n They note body weight is affected by lifestyle and environment, such as medication use, environmental pollutants, genetics, timing of food intake, stress, gut bacteria and even night-time light exposure.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-09-22T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:15:49.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
