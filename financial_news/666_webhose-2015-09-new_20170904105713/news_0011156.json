Merran reports to Philip Olesen, global head of credit flow, the person said.\nHana Dunn, a spokeswoman at UBS in London, confirmed Merran’s appointment without elaborating on his role.\nMerran, who is based in London, spent about three years at the Swiss firm before departing for Deutsche Bank AG in 2012 where he traded credit-index options. He was among traders let go by the German lender last year as it pared back its fixed-income business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:12:30.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
