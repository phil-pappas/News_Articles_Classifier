The Company can now confirm that orders have been received to progress the national rollout and deliveries to the Walmart network across the U.S have commenced. \nThe launch across the national network of Walmart stores is a direct result of a consistent Yowie sales performance that began with a 50 store trial in Texas during September 2014 extending in March 2015 to a rollout across 1500 Walmart stores. Progression from a 50 store trial to a national rollout in less than twelve months confirms Walmart's high expectation for the Yowie product. Yowie ranging across all Walmart stores will be in prime in-store location for an impulse purchase on \"assisted\" and \"speedy\" check-out stands across all 4300 stores, but may vary by store. The expanded point of sale to the speedy check- out lanes will give the product additional front-end exposure for impulse purchases. As individual Walmart stores come on line, regular store location updates together with mapping guidance will be provided at www.yowieworld.com in the top navigation bar under 'Where to Buy'. Measured by revenue, Walmart is the largest company in the world and the largest grocery retailer in the United States.

With U.S. sales of approximately $288 billion in fiscal year 2015, Walmart U.S. employs 1.4 million associates. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also owns and operates the Sam's Club retail warehouses in North America. A national rollout in a market the size of the U.S. is a lengthy process and successful execution and quality servicing of the Walmart account remains a priority focus for the Yowie North America team. A new key account team has been recruited to service the Walmart account supported by a third party national merchandising team to ensure service levels are fully optimized. A successful rollout into Walmart stores is an endorsement of the Company's strategic approach to the U.S. market and further reinforcement of consumer acceptance of the Yowie chocolate product.
