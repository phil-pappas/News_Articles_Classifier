Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Resources and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg backed the expansion of the coal industry but was coy on whether the Turnbull government will go ahead with a plan to make it harder to challenge resources projects.\nAfter long-serving Resources Minister Ian Macfarlane was dumped from cabinet on Sunday, he successor used his first day in the job to promote renewable energy.\nWhile the Abbott government was often seen at war with clean energy, especially wind turbines, which Tony Abbott and former Treasurer Joe Hockey described as offensive, Mr Frydenberg said the Turnbull government was committed to boosting renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions – but not at the expense of coal.\n\"If you're talking about coal, that's an important part of the energy mix and an important part of Australia's energy production. But at the same time, renewable energy is too,\" Mr Frydenberg told ABC Radio.\n\"I think we have shown our true colours there with a very strong bipartisan agreement to increasing – and in some ways doubling – our renewable energy production. I'm very comfortable with that.\"\nUnlike the Abbott government, Mr Frydenberg talked up the new deal over the Renewable Energy Target which creates cross-subsidies for 33,000 gigawatt hours – or about 23.5 per cent of clean energy – by 2020. He said the scheme cleared the way for an expansion of the sector.\n\"That agreement will see a doubling of renewable energy over the period and small-scale – that's solar, that's thermal, that's everything else. I think that's a very good outcome for the renewable space,\" he said.\nOpportunities He said Australia needed to make the most of the opportunities that arise from the expansion of the Chinese and Indian economies.\n\"I'm very excited about the opportunities in energy and resources from the export income from the sale of our resources overseas, but also to create tens of thousands of new jobs in Australia,\" he said.\n\"We export 80 per cent of our energy production. Over the next decade or two you're going to see an increase of about one-third of global demand for energy. So Australia is well placed to capitalise on this.\"\nHe backed coal seam gas developments, but acknowledged the sensitivities around development approval.\nMr Frydenberg, who was assistant Treasurer in the Abbott government, refused to confirm if the Abbott government's change to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to make it harder for environmental activists to launch legal challenges, would be scrapped.\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt in August introduced legislation which would only allow those directly affected by mines to challenge them in the courts.\nThis follow's the little-known environmental organisation, Mackay Conservation Group, forcing Mr Hunt to re-visit a decision on Indian energy giant Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine.\nLaw change uncertain Mr Frydenberg on Monday said it would be up to Mr Hunt to announce if the tough new laws on legal challenges would be scrapped. Mr Hunt's office would not comment.\nClean Energy Council policy manager Darren Gladman said they were encouraged by Mr Frydenberg's comments on embracing renewable energy.\n\"It is no secret that the last couple of years were both challenging and frustrating for the renewable energy industry under former prime minister Tony Abbott,\" Mr Gladman said.\n\"Australia has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, and we believe the new government can see the job and investment benefits of these newer forms of energy for rural and regional areas of the country.\"\nMr Frydenberg, who in his previous ministry was responsible for overseeing the insurance taskforce exploring the possibility of a government insurer in Northern Australia, has now been given a new portfolio for Northern Australia.\nNorthern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles said the Melbourne MP was not his first choice for the job. He said he would make it his job to \"educate\" Mr Frydenberg.\n\"How can someone from Melbourne have a view or a responsibility for Northern Australia?\" Mr Giles said.\nOne of the first people to get in Mr Frydenberg's ear will be North Queensland MP Warren Entsch, who pushed for the insurance inquiry and now wants a $2 billion contract for Pacific patrol boats to be awarded to Cairns .\nIt is unclear if the insurance taskforce would come across to Mr Frydenberg's new portfolios, or stay with new Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-09-21T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:48:31.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
