Sure, he left behind Transfield and the BCA presidency, but then tucked into the incoming Abbott Government's Commission of Audit (chairman, Barry O'Farrell 's Westconnex Delivery Authority (chairman) and kicked on with the AFL's frontier club GWS Giants (president).\nNo surprise then, that Shep has decided to give away the gig fronting the Westconnex mega-road , a project he's tirelessly proselytised for in the wake of some pretty vocal opposition .\nBut we're not sure he's done so simply to lighten the workload. Perhaps it's more a case of political fatigue? Because it's a fairly safe bet that – once enough time has passed and potential conflicts of interest have expired, of course (Lend Lease has been and remains a bidder for stages of the Westconnex roll-out) – we'll see Shepherd join the Board of construction giant Lend Lease .\nWord is, Lend Lease chairman David Crawford (also 71, chairman of BHP spin-off South32 and a director of the Big Australian for two decades) is keen for Shep's big-project experience around his table. And who could blame him?\nStills from the WestConnex imagery showing the WestConnex freeway's St Peters interchange.
