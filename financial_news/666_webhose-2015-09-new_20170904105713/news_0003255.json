Betting taxes, imposed by states on race clubs, are pushing bettors to indulge in 'kerb betting' - illegal off-course betting - which has crimped profits of turf clubs across the country. According to managers at various race clubs in the country, illegal betting has gone up 30-50 per cent over the past three years which in turn has eaten into betting volumes. For instance, annual betting volumes at Mumbai's Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) slumped from about Rs 250 crore in 2011-12 to just about Rs 130 crore last fiscal. The Hyderabad Race Club, among the most profitable race clubs in the country, has seen a 15-25 per cent drop in betting volumes. Despite repeated efforts to boost the popularity of the sport (and relatively lenient betting taxes in Karnataka and West Bengal), Bangalore Turf Club and Royal Calcutta Turf Club have not managed to lift up their 'takings'. \"Our betting revenues have fallen significantly over the past four years,\" said Vivek Jain, former chairman and managing committee member of RWITC. \"Betting tax has been the killer in our case. This has prompted our patrons to shift to illegal off-the-book betting channels,\" Jain added. The Maharashtra government levies 20 per cent (up from 10 per cent a few years ago) as betting tax. In addition, RWITC also charges a 10 per cent club commission on their customers. So, if a bettor hands out Rs 100 to a bookie, only Rs 70 goes into the betting pool. The remainingRs 30 is accounted as upfront betting tax and club commission. In Karnataka, betting tax has doubled to 8 per cent, while West Bengal collects taxes at three levels: 5 per cent for betting in 'wins and places' (bets placed on the position of the horse at the end of the race), 10 per cent on other type of bets and 15 per cent if bets are placed through bookmakers (who provide better odds). The Hyderabad Race Club charges 12 - 15 per cent tax on bets placed with club-permitted bookies. Apart from betting tax, bet winners (above Rs 5,000) are required to pay 33 per cent income tax (including surcharges and cess) as TDS on their gains. TWO BOOKS \"These days even club-permitted bookies keep two books: one, for legal tax-paid bets and other for informal, 'no-taxes-only-(bookie)-commission' betting. Most people prefer to place their bets in the second book,\" said a race club manager on conditions of anonymity. \"Apart from regular bookies, there are several freelancers who pool bets informally and pay-out at the end of the race. This eludes both turf club's account books and government's tax ledgers,\" the race club manager said. Declining betting revenues have plunged almost all turf clubs into deep losses. Mumbai's RWITC booked a loss of about Rs 15 crore last year; While Calcutta suffered losses worth Rs 6 crore, Bangalore Turf Club - regardless of having betting volumes worth Rs 1600 crore per annum - managed profits worth \"a few lakhs.\" \"We've cut club commissions significantly to accommodate higher betting taxes. This has reduced our revenues drastically. We're now worried what would happen when the government rolls out GST in the country,\" said Nirmal Prasad, secretary of Bangalore Turf Club. Lower race sponsorships, stakes (prize money for the winning horses/breeders amount to as much as Rs 35 crore every year) while turf & paddock management, water charges and personnel costs too comprise a big portion of the club's expenditure. Footfall revenues have fallen for all turf clubs, with attendance dropping as low as 15,000 spectators, even on red letter race days. In the heydays of racing, turf clubs marked attendance upwards of 40,000 spectators. \"Horse racing is not a big draw anymore. Our footfalls have not gone up despite our attempts to make the sport popular,\" said Sudhir Kothari, CEO of Royal Calcutta Turf Club. \"I think we've hit a saturation point. The new generation is not interested in visiting turf clubs anymore,\" Kothari summed up. It looks like this horse may have bolted.
