Same goes for homes, and most electronics—the more you pay, the more value you’ll get. But wine is downright personal, and a gold-medal, $150 Rhone red might be elixir of the gods to one person, but not the next, who is happier with an $8.99 zinfandel. The average price of a bottle on Wine Spectator’s 2014 Top 100 list is $47.Robert Hodgson is a retired professor of oceanography who founded Fieldbrook Winery 40 years ago. He has served as a judge at the California State Fair Commercial Wine Competition and has been a member of the State Fair’s advisory board since 2003. He has published numerous peer-reviewed papers on the reliability of wine judges and wine competitions—and famously found that often, wine ratings are inconsistent and price has less correlation with taste than you might think.Now that summer’s picnics are giving way to dinner parties and holiday gatherings, I asked Hodgson for some wine-buying strategies.[caption id=\"attachment_639\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Robert Hodgson uncorks his wine-shopping strategy[/caption] Q: Sometimes you just stare down the wine aisle at the grocery store and are numbed by the selection. Best way to make a choice? A: You’re in the wrong store! Labels, of course, tell you nothing except the creativity of the graphic artist. Price is probably a better indicator. The dilemma you face is like picking up a book at a library without knowing the contents. It could equally be a treatise on the Civil War, a novel about a boy going through trials of adolescence or a text on quantum mechanics. I suggest you find a store where the merchant or wine buyer has personal knowledge about the wines on display. Then, since wine is meant to be served with food, my opinion, describe what you intend to serve: Scallops in tangerine sauce, pasta with a white sauce, or hamburgers. Let the merchant guide you. If you find he or she provided good advice, seek his/her help in the future. Otherwise, find another merchant. Q: I’ve been told not to bother buying any wine between $10 and $20. Good or bad advice? A: [tweet_Quote: display=\"#Wine expert never buys wine outside of this price range. #retail #shopping\"]I virtually never buy outside of the $15-$25 range[/tweet_Quote: ] (retail, not restaurant pricing). When traveling in Italy, I almost always order the table wine. I’ve never been disappointed. I avoid $9.99 wines and those that cost less. I also do not buy wines costing more than $30. Let me put it to you this way: I use the example of a place setting. Do you want the wine to be placed in front of the dinner plate, behind the plate or alongside the plate? If you have an opportunity to taste a classic wine, like La Tache, you would not even want to have dinner at all! Such wines are classics and deserve attention. However, if you are simply having a nice meal, I think you can find a wine that complements the food for a moderate price, $15 to $25. Q: What’s the best way to get value for your dollar while buying wine? A: My research has shown that gold medals, for the most part, only reflect the amount of money a winery is willing to spend for marketing, not so different than winning a jackpot at a casino. The more you play, the higher the probability of winning at least one jackpot. So it is with gold medals. The more competitions entered, the higher the probability of winning at least one gold medal. And, as I have shown, if a bottle displays a gold medal, there is overwhelming evidence that the identical wine was also panned in other competitions.

Hodgson #retail\"]I personally do not place any faith in the verbiage to be found in the major wine publications.[/tweet_Quote: ] As far as “experts” are concerned, it is well known that they disagree. Again, my advice is to seek out a wine merchant. Q: Any wine etiquette people should know about giving it as a gift? A: [tweet_Quote: display=\"Buying #wine as a gift? Ask the merchant for something unusual you can't find in a supermarket.\"]I suggest you ask the wine merchant for something a bit unusual[/tweet_Quote: ] , something not to be found in a supermarket, but don’t expect your gift to be served, especially if the host has put a lot of thought into food-wine pairing. Something unusual? A wine from New Jersey (Yes, New Jersey makes some pretty good wine) or a Canadian wine from British Columbia or Ontario (Niagara). If you are lucky to be in the San Francisco area, anything from Kermit Lynch. Q: Anything else people should keep in mind while buying wine? A: I think [tweet_Quote: display=\"&quot;The most important thing about buying #wine is accepting the responsibility of learning what you like&quot; ~ R. Hodgson\"]the most important thing about buying wine is accepting the responsibility of learning what you like[/tweet_Quote: ] . Form wine-tasting groups and taste cheap and expensive wines of the same style (varietal). Enjoying wine is a personal endeavor and takes experience to learn what you like. I don’t think you would ask your neighbor about advice on whom you might like to marry! That is something you have to figure out for yourself.", "external_links": ["http://2014.top100.winespectator.com/", "http://fieldbrookwinery.com/"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:51:05.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
