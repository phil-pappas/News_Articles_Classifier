The outlook on the new rating remains negative, which means additional downgrades are possible in the near term.\nThe investment-grade rating was a key imprimatur that solidified Brazil's emergence as an economic power during a decade-long commodities boom that fizzled in recent years as the Chinese economy, Brazil's biggest export market and once ravenous for its raw materials, began slowing.\nFurther fallout from the downgrade will depend on whether Brazil retains investment grade ratings from other major agencies.\nFitch Ratings currently rates Brazil at BBB, two notches above investment grade, with a negative outlook. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Brazil less than a month ago to the brink of junk, but said its investment grade was safe for now.\nS&P said on Wednesday its decision was based on the mounting political problems that have muddled economic policy.\nThese problems, S&P said, have been weighing on the government's \"ability and willingness\" to submit a 2016 budget consistent with the significant policy fixes Rousseff promised after she won re-election last year.\nRousseff's planning minister, Nelson Barbosa, said after the downgrade that the government would continue to honor its financial commitments and move ahead with efforts to get Congress to cooperate on much-needed economic reforms.\nBut S&P's move caught Rousseff's economic team off guard.\n\"We did not expect a downgrade now,\" said a person at the finance ministry who requested anonymity, adding that it was too early to determine how it will affect the government's austerity efforts.\nInvestors speculated whether the move would serve as a wake-up call for the government and Congress to move faster on those measures, or whether it would encourage Rousseff to change tack and boost spending once more to stimulate the economy.\n\"Now that the battle to preserve investment grade is lost ... there is some probability that the government could waver even further,\" Goldman Sachs senior economist Alberto Ramos said in a note to clients.\nWhen Brazil first got the coveted investment-grade stamp from S&P, after decades of financial volatility, it was considered a star among developing nations.\nLeveraging soaring export and tax revenues at the time, the ruling Workers' Party broadened generous social welfare programs and encouraged lending by public banks, fueling a prolonged consumer boom. Combined, the measures lifted 40 million people out of poverty.\nOnce Rousseff took office in 2011, however, the economy began to slow down sharply and last quarter it officially entered a recession.\nThe economy has also been weighed down by a massive corruption scandal at state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA , freezing many infrastructure investments.\nBrazil's currency, the real, has slumped and the inflation rate has jumped to almost 10 percent. The economic crises and the corruption scandal have both battered Rousseff's approval ratings, which are now in single digits, fuelling opposition calls for her resignation or impeachment.
