These bulk-goods stores offer low per-unit prices on many things they sell. Don’t be afraid to stock up on the best bargains at warehouse clubs including batteries, meats and wines. \nHowever, it’s easy to make costly mistakes when shopping at warehouse clubs . Perhaps the biggest miscalculation: Assuming the club price is the best price on every item. That’s not the case. Another big blunder made by club shoppers is buying things they don’t need simply because the price is “too good to pass up.” Unnecessary spending can deal a blow to any budget. \nIt’s best to avoid bulk purchases of perishable items at warehouse clubs, no matter how tempting the price, if there aren’t enough people in your household to consume them quickly. Throwing away spoiled or expired goods is the same as tossing money in the trash. Plus, you should always shop with a list to avoid impulse purchases, which can be whoppers at warehouse clubs. \nWhen making your warehouse-club shopping list, keep these 16 things off it. You can find them cheaper elsewhere, or you simply won’t reap value by buying them in bulk .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:06:04.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
