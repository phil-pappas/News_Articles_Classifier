Although it raised concerns about the growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy, some saw it as a sign that China's authorities would do more to support the economy. \n\"(There is some) hope that you've got a lot more stimulus on the way from China,\" Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said. \nFinancial companies led the gainers, with EM-exposed HSBC and Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , a financial service provider and asset management company, both up 3.4 percent. \nThey were joined by Asia-exposed bank Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) recovered from its post-Lehman lows to trade up 3.3 percent. \nThe FT350 banking sector index, was up 2.9 percent overall, on track for its biggest daily gain since late August. \nUnited Utilities was the index's top gainer, rising 3.5 percent after another broker upgrade, with the utilities company on track for its sharpest two-day gain in nearly 4 months. \nWhitbread was the biggest faller, dropping 3.1 percent after posting slowing Q2 sales growth. The company, which owns Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee, said it expected to cut spending and increase some prices to counter the \"substantial\" cost of the higher national living wage. \nIn the FTSE mid-caps, insurer Amlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) 's stock surged by almost 33 percent, the top gainer, after Japan's MS&AD agreed to buy the UK rival in its fourth major international deal in as many months by Japanese insurers expanding overseas. \nOn the macroeconomic front, British retail spending stagnated last month as mixed weather and the later-than-usual date of a public holiday dampened sales of furniture and school clothing and equipment. \n(Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:05:05.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
