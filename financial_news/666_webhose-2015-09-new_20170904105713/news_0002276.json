Sebi can only explain the basis of their decision to do so. However, Sahara is in the process of doing the needful as Sebi has directed,\" it added.\nThe RBI had yesterday said it has SIFCL's certificate of registration as NBFC with effect from September 3. The NBFC was registered in December 1998.\nEarlier, markets regulator Sebi had cancelled mutual fund and portfolio management licences of other firms of the group, which is engaged in a long-running battle with the regulator in a case related to refunds totalling thousands of crores of rupees. Its chief Subrata Roy is in jail since March 4, 2014. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T22:02:44.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
