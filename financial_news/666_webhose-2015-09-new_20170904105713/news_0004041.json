Income tax increases, higher social fees for young workers and lower tax breaks on home repairs and household services could weigh on the labor market.\n“The balance between monetary and fiscal policy in Sweden remains out of whack,” Anna Breman, a Swedbank economist, said by phone. “Monetary policy doesn’t get any help from fiscal policy.”\nPrime Minister Stefan Loefven, who leads a minority coalition, says deficits left by the previous administration have forced it to raise taxes as it seeks to increase spending on labor market programs and education to drive down unemployment, currently at 7 percent. In his election campaign last year, Loefven promised to have the European Union’s lowest jobless rate by 2020.\nThe budget comes as the country’s central bank has unleashed unprecedented stimulus to prevent disinflation from taking hold. The central bank has cut its main rate to a record minus 0.35 percent and is also buying government bonds to revive price growth which has been below targets for almost five years.\nGraph of Sweden&apos;s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.\nAccording to Lennart Flood, professor emeritus at Gothenburg University School of Business, the income tax increases could backfire and raise far less than they are intended to.\n“It’s an unfortunate signal,” he said. “If you want to finance the public sector, people need to work more, not less.”\nThe government last month released a more upbeat assessment on growth. It predicted that the largest Nordic economy will expand 2.8 percent this year and next year with unemployment at 7.1 percent in 2016. It also predicted Sweden will remain in deficit until 2019.\nBusiness groups are also balking at higher taxes.\nSweden is already one of the countries with the world’s highest marginal taxes, Confederation of Swedish Enterprise economist Johan Fall said.\n“Among our relevant competitor countries, we’re already on top of the list, and now we add further distance by raising it again,” Fall said. “This could for example mean it won’t be as interesting for employees to work a little bit extra or invest in additional education.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:15:17.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
