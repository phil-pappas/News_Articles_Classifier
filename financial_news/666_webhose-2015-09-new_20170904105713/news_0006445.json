It’s a collection of 10 songs that explore a person’s thoughts during a typical day—from the personal, like wrestling with parenthood on “Dancing Right in Front of Me,” to the worldly, as on “In Any Tongue,” which touches on war-induced trauma.\nRelated Reading Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour Samples Brand Jingle for New Single David Gilmour’s Secrets to Success David Crosby Talks About His New Solo CD He co-wrote five of the songs with his wife, Polly Samson , a novelist who has been writing lyrics for Mr. Gilmour since Pink Floyd’s 1994 album, “The Division Bell.” Mr. Gilmour also rounded up a few longtime associates to help out: David Crosby and Graham Nash contributed vocals on the somber tune, “A Boat Lies Waiting.” Composer Roger Eno played piano on that number as well, and on the instrumental “Beauty.”\nBut for Floyd fans, Mr. Gilmour’s guitar remains front and center. “People have said that they can hear one note and know it’s me,” he says.\nAside from a few one-off gigs in the last 20 years, Mr. Gilmour’s career with Pink Floyd has largely been over since the mid-’90s, when the band toured for “The Division Bell.”\nThough he says there are no plans for any future Pink Floyd archival releases, Mr. Gilmour is working classic numbers into his solo live show, which will tour Europe and South America this year before heading to the U.S. in 2016. At a recent warm-up gig in Brighton, England, he played “Comfortably Numb,” “Wish You Were Here,” “Us and Them,” and “Money” along with debuting many “Rattle That Lock” numbers.\nIt’s been nine years since his last album, but he hopes it won’t take that long before his next album arrives. “I got a lot of starting points that are fairly well-developed,” he says. “I suspect the next one will be quicker, but I’m not making any promises.”\nWrite to Mike Ayers at Mike.Ayers@dowjones.com\nMore on Music Celebrating Sonic Experimentation at the Chicago Jazz Festival Foals’ ‘What Went Down’ Is a Visceral Confessional Radkey: A Band of Brothers Proving They’re More Than a Rock Anomaly Gregg Allman Plans His Solo Future", "external_links": ["http://www.rogereno.com/", "http://www.pollysamson.com/", "http://www.davidcrosby.com/", "http://www.pinkfloyd.com/", "http://www.grahamnash.com/"], "published": "2015-09-14T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:17:21.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
