The IMF said this suggested that annual growth of net commodity exporters was expected to decline further by an additional one percentage point between 2015 and 2017 compared with 2012 and 2014. \nFor energy exporters, which have seen the price of oil tumble from $115 a barrel last summer to around $48 a barrel today, the drag on growth is expected to be around 2.25 percentage points over the same period, the IMF said in a pre-released chapter of its World Economic Outlook. \nWhile the Fund said history provided a guide to the turbulence that will be seen in the coming years, it noted that the commodity boom experienced at the start of the millennium was longer than the average median upswing of six years. \n\"The slowdown could even be larger than those experienced in past episodes, since the terms-of-trade upswings that many exporters experienced in the first decade of the 2000s were much larger than earlier ones,\" the IMF said. \n\"As a result, they may have led to much larger increases in actual and potential output growth than in the past upswings analysed in the chapter. If the terms-of-trade downswings are now also larger, the declines in growth would likely be correspondingly larger as well.\" \nThe IMF said the decline would also hit medium-term growth in these economies. \nPlunging commodity prices have hit exporters much harder than other emerging markets Photo: IMF The analysis showed that countries had become more resilient to price shocks through healthier current account balances and more flexible exchange rates, which would help cushion recent price falls. \n\"More robust policy frameworks, and more developed financial markets, could help mitigate some of the growth impacts,\" the IMF said. \nHowever, it warned that this also left countries with limited ammunition to fight the slowdown as countries with exchange rate flexibility had little room to cut rates to stimulate the economy without stoking inflation. \nThe sustained fall in oil prices has forced countries such as Saudi Arabia to raid asset managers for funds to plug ever widening deficits. \nThe IMF called for structural measures to cushion future shocks that would help economies to eliminate \"supply side bottlenecks\" and produce more efficiently. It also called for countries to build up fiscal buffers during times of growth, which would help to mitigate downswings in prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:25:43.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
