The maximum cash Isa amount for this tax year is £15,240. Fixed rate Isas mean that savers cannot access their money during the fixed term, if they do, they will face the penalty of lost interest. Interest rates on Isas and other savings accounts are influenced most by the UK Bank Rate but also by how keen banks and building societies are to raise money from savers. The Bank Rate, at 0.5pc since March 2009, is expected to stay there until mid-2016. [ Interest rates: 'July 2016' for first rise ] This means that locking your money into a one, two or three year fixed-rate Isa could be a good idea if the income meets your needs, and you're certain you won't need to touch the money during the fixed term. THE BEST FIXED-RATE CASH ISA DEALS ONE YEAR Tesco Bank, Holmesdale Building Society, Shawbrook Bank and Julian Hodge bank all pay 1.75pc. TWO YEARS Virgin Money pays 2pc on balances above £1, with old Isa money accepted and interest paid annually or monthly.
