But it will happen, at which point marketing campaigns from existing carriers and newcomers will bombard the Kingdom’s airline passengers. Just who will remain standing a year or two down the road remains to be seen.\nSaudi Arabia, the largest nation on the Arabian Peninsula, is an ideal market for domestic services. Distances between many cities are too long for easy car travel, the country has the largest population of any in the region with around 27 million people, and there is a large, wealthy middle class accustomed to flying.\nFor years, national flag-carrier Saudia has handled the vast bulk of this internal traffic. It carries the great majority of current domestic passengers; in 2013, 15 million of its 25 million customers were internal.\nSome routes are densely trafficked; for example, Saudia has 12 flights daily between the capital, Riyadh and the country’s commercial center, Jeddah, and frequently uses Boeing 777s for the 90-minute hop. These are often full.\nThe other domestic player is flynas, which began life in 2007 as low-cost carrier Nas Air but has recently moved to a hybrid model with business-class cabins and other amenities. It operates 24 Airbus A320s.\nThe Saudi regulator, the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), announced in December 2011 that the domestic market would be opened to new entrants and these could include foreign companies. A year later, it said that licences would be granted to two bidders—Al Maha Airways, an offshoot of Qatar Airways, and SaudiGulf Airlines, a new venture by the Al Qahtani Group, a Saudi industrial consortium with no previous airline involvement.\nAl Maha plans to use Airbus A320s and unspecified twin-aisle aircraft diverted from its parent company’s vast orderbook, with Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker pledging to build an Al Maha fleet of 50 aircraft within a few years. SaudiGulf announced early last year an order for 16 Bombardier CSeries CS300 regional jets, with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft regional VP-sales, Middle East and Africa John Kassis commenting that the new airline “picked everything on the option list” to provide a high-amenity cabin.\nFour A320ceos have been ordered to fill the gap until the delayed Canadian airliners are delivered.\nAOC Delay\nAl Maha was due to start operations in the 2014 third quarter, with SaudiGulf following shortly afterward. Neither has yet taken to the air, and there is no clear idea of when this will happen, although local press reports in late May said SaudiGulf was aiming to start services Nov. 1.\nThe problem lies in gaining an air operator certificate (AOC) from GACA. At the handover of Qatar Airways’ first Airbus A350 at Toulouse last December, Al Baker told ATW that Al Maha was only awaiting the document before starting services, but that this was proving to be a “complex” process. The following month, he was reported by Saudi newspaper Al Watan as saying that conclusion of the procedure could be “anywhere between six to 18 months from now.”\nIntriguingly, in February, GACA’s new president, Sulaiman Al Hamdan, was Quote: d by Saudi newspapers as saying that the delays were not his organization’s fault: “There are regulations that [the airlines] have to follow to get the license. We are transparent and we provide the same facilities to all airlines.”\nGACA told ATW months ago that “once the two mentioned companies meet all the security, economic and technical requirements, the AOC will be granted,” but has said no more since. SaudiGulf declined to comment about its activities for this article, while Qatar Airways has been almost as tight-lipped about Al Maha’s status.\nIn April, however, Al Baker was at Airbus’s Hamburg facility to take delivery of four A320s in Al Maha’s livery; while the AOC affair rumbles on, these will be slotted into Qatar Airways’ mainline schedules. At the time of writing, at least two A320s in SaudiGulf’s green and gold color scheme were parked at Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées Airport in southwest France.\nFor its part, flynas is preparing for the forthcoming ramp-up in competition by strengthening its internal services. Its current timetable shows no fewer than 14 daily round-trips between Jeddah and Riyadh compared to 11 a few months ago and CEO Paul Byrne told ATW that it was changing departure times to de-merge them from those of Saudia.\nSaudia’s New Destinations\nA ‘nasmiles’ loyalty program was launched at the Arabian Travel Market travel trade shop window in May and more Saudi destinations are due to be launched this year.\nSaudia, meanwhile, is gearing up for a fight. A spokesman told ATW that it had more than 90% of the domestic market and expected still to be taking 80% even after the arrival of the two new entrants.\nHe noted that new aircraft were being acquired this year for “frequent point-to-point services” and to provide connections at the two main hubs of Riyadh and Jeddah. Aircraft deliveries in 2015-16 would comprise eight Boeing 787-9s and four 777-300ERs, he said.\nHe added that Saudia was the only carrier to serve all 26 Saudi airports and expected to continue to do so.\nSaj Ahmad, lead analyst at UK-based Strategic Aero Research, believes that the two winners in the forthcoming struggle for passengers will be those with the deepest pockets, namely Saudia and Al Maha.\nAhmad, who has good connections in the Middle East, believes that the Saudi government will not allow the national airline to be too badly affected by increased competition, while Al Maha will benefit from back-up from its parent company.\nHe believes the two most at risk from any trench warfare to capture market share are flynas and SaudiGulf.\nHe argues that flynas is hampered by its relatively small route network: “They’re not expanding anything like as fast as [low-cost carriers] flydubai or Air Arabia. Flydubai has been flying six years and has more than 100 destinations. Flynas has been around for 10 years and has 24 destinations.” This gives the Jeddah-based airline a lack of connectivity compared to rivals, he believes.\nHis greatest concerns, however, are for SaudiGulf. “SaudiGulf worries me for a number of reasons. If Al Maha wasn’t there, they might have some chance of making inroads … [but] I don’t think they have the power to make any meaningful difference to the market.” The combination of the Al Qahtani Group’s lack of aviation experience, its planned reliance on the untried CSeries and what Ahmad perceives as a relative lack of financial muscle may be fatal, he said.\nAs for the Saudis: “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of publicly available material on why the issue of licenses has not been more forthcoming and there is no update on what’s going on with the whole policy of liberalization.”\nHe thinks that the country’s authorities may now be having second thoughts on the wisdom of opening up the domestic market to competition, but that they have passed the point of no return.\n“I genuinely believe that the Saudis may have requested more information [from the airlines seeking AOCs] and moved the goalposts. The biggest flaw in their strategy is that opening up the domestic Saudi market harms Saudia and flynas … I think they are realizing their folly,” Ahmad said.\nAs for the delay in granting AOCs: “I think it’s nothing more than Saudi procrastination at this stage. The only thing we can say with any certainty is that it will happen, but we can’t say when.”\nSaudi passengers are about to enjoy a bonanza of choice; time will tell whether a similarly happy experience awaits all the airlines serving them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:43:10.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
