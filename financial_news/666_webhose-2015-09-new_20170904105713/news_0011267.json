In an interview with M Saraswathy , Anoop Pabby , MD & CEO, DHFL Pramerica Life talks about this strategy and way forward.\n\nPrivate life insurers' new business premium has been seeing consistent growth since last fiscal. Will this continue this year as well, especially for the company? \n\nGrowth has been good in the industry, where the private sector market share is pacing up. Further, group business is outpacing retail in life insurance. Also, insurers believe that engagement of customer, core emphasis on savings orientation is far more economical through a group platform than doing it through retail. We moved up in the rankings from 23 to among top 15.\n\nWe achieved break-even due to increase in revenue and severe cost restructuring without compromising quality of people on board. Further, we also reduced staff strength.\n\nWhen are you planning to enter the online insurance space? \n\nWe plan to launch online insurance in next one to two quarters. Lot of research has gone into it and we have also received approval for it. We are going to the regulator for approval for some other products for online sale with respect to discount/benefit for customers, wellness among others.\n\nHowever, some traditional products will still need agent support during purchase. Presently, the approach that most insurers have taken for online term is flawed. We are planning an online product, but not an online term. Our product will have protection will be key component and will have components of endowment and saving.\n\nWhile you already have DHFL as a partner, what are the newer distribution channels you are investing into? \n\nIn the agency channel, we have segmented it into sub-segments like paramilitary personnel, self employed, teachers, shop-keepers and hired form affinity and key influencers who were respectable people as agents and hired them as our agents. \n\nThere, we saw an exponential growth in our numbers. It is a segmented and targeted approach. This channel contributes 40% of non-DHFL business and this fiscal we will take a call on whether to invest further into this, to make it more scalable.\n\nWe also worked with certain key distributors in South and West in rural and cooperative bank platform and on-boarded a lot of customers.\n\nNow that the Insurance Act has come into force, has your foreign JV partner taken a decision to hike its stake? \n\nOur foreign partner Prudential Financial (Pramerica) is keen to take it up to 49% and have expressed their intent. They have already taken it up with the Indian shareholder. The discussions are progressing well.\n\nBank channel is being opened up. But, do you think banks would be ready to tie-up with other insurers to sell their products? \n\nBancassurance segment has been growing outpacing every individual segment in the market. If you take bancassurance out from the entire pie, it is growing at a faster pace. Here, the early movers with bank partners and shareholders are at an advantage,. Creating new relationship with customers only based on life insurance is a challenge.\n\nWe see quite a few public sector banks and some private banks who are not shareholders in insurance ventures as potential partners. We will go to them once guidelines are out.\n\nSince the new partner is on board for some time now, has the cost rationalisation been complete? How much premium growth do you expect in FY16? \n\nOur key intent was to rationalise cost and there was lot of ambiguity and productivity went down. We took a decision to cull out non-productive ones and to reward productive ones in a more handsome way. We have opened 20 new branches in last 15 months, opening 15 more in new fiscal.\n\nWith respect to growth, we expect 50% growth from last year on APE basis and that would translate into an AUM of about Rs 2200 crore by end of this fiscal. We are a protection centric company, there will be lot of traditional product sale.\n\nYour unit-linked insurance product (Ulip) share in new business has been low. Would you look to increase it? \n\nIn our new business mix, Ulips are 10%, while it contributes 5% to our assets under management (AUM). We are not aggressive on Ulips and do not want to be aggressive in it. It is a volatile space and margins are fairly low in this product.\n\nDistributors expect insurance kind of payouts in these products and they want to go for product which have healthier commissions. In the valuation game, Ulips do not contribute healthily to growth of your embedded value,\n\nWhile it is a necessary product to have in the bouquet since some customers want it. we would not cross the 10% threshold in Ulips.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:20:39.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
