You’ll need to start taking RMDs after age 70½. \nIf you had a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) or SIMPLE IRA instead, you’d still have to take RMDs at 70½. Those accounts follow the rules for traditional IRAs, which are subject to required minimum distributions after age 70½, whether or not you are still working. \nFor more information about the RMD start dates, see this IRS Fact Sheet .
