Source: Supplied\nThe brick house at 99-107 Abbotsbury Drive in Horsley Park sold for more than $3.2 million, well above the vendors’ $2.35 million reserve, which was already almost double the suburb’s median house price of $1.4 million. The $3.2 million purchase price was almost $2 million above the area’s median house price. Source: Supplied\n“The whole room cheered when the final bid came in,” said the home’s auctioneer Rocky Bartolotto. “It was a simply amazing result and surpassed everyone’s expectations.” The home is situated on an elevated 2ha block close to the M7 and attracted a lot of attention when it first hit the market due to a shortage of property listings in the area, selling agent Charlie Cini of United Realty Acreage and Residential said.\n28 parties registered to bid at the auction. Source: Supplied\nClose to 30 parties registered for bidding and a large crowd of local residents gathered to watch the potential buyers battle it out. Bidding had started at $1.1 million, but two determined bidders drove the price past $3 million, until a third buyer, who hadn’t participated in bidding until that point, entered the fray.\n“It was almost like he came out of nowhere,” said an onlooker. “The other two bidders had been fighting it out between themselves, but he came and blew them out the water.”\nMr Cini said the final result was proof that the local region is still producing big sales results.\n“We had been expecting around $2.5 million, but the market has spoken,” he said.\nIt is not yet clear what the new owner intends to do with the property.\nOriginally published as Would you pay $855k extra for this?
