Koch is the literary member of the Koch family.\nShe has an MFA in creative writing from Syracuse University, where she studied with author George Saunders, has published several short stories (some under a pen name), and is working on a novel. This month she is launching an independent publishing company called Catapult.\nMs. Koch, who comes from one of the nation’s wealthiest families, personally invested the seed money for Catapult, which has an annual budget in the high six figures and aims eventually to publish 12 books a year. She is the daughter of Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist who, with his brother David, co-founded a web of conservative interest groups.\nIn contrast to her father and uncle, Ms. Koch, 39, describes herself as apolitical. “We’re very close but we’re all different,” she said of her family.\nWith Catapult, Ms. Koch says she hopes to create the same kind of safe, collaborative atmosphere that she found at Syracuse, where she finally became comfortable with the idea of being a writer.\n“It can be a terrifying proposition to create something from nothing,” she said. At Syracuse, she said, she and her classmates were encouraged “to show our most vulnerable selves. We were really encouraged to take risks.”\nIn addition to publishing books, Catapult is offering creative-writing workshops and next week will launch a website where it will publish narrative nonfiction and fiction pieces, as well as a community site where writers can post works in progress and receive feedback from peers.\nMs. Koch, the company’s CEO, tapped Andy Hunter, co-founder of the literary website Electric Literature, as publisher. He recruited well-respected editor Pat Strachan —who at Farrar, Straus and Giroux acquired books by Seamus Heaney and Czeslaw Milosz before they won Nobels—to join the team as editor in chief.\nCatapult’s first book, released Thursday, is “Cries For Help, Various,” a surreal and at times laugh-out-loud collection of short stories by National Book Award nominee Padgett Powell, a longtime collaborator of Ms. Strachan.\nRead an excerpt from “Cries For Help, Various.”\nBorn in 1975, Ms. Koch grew up in Kansas, and wrote stories from the time she was young. She studied English literature at Princeton University, then held a series of jobs, editing books, working at magazines and doing a brief stint in journalism. She was an editor at Opium Magazine and co-founder of Literary Death Match, a raucous reading series in which authors compete for the best performance.\n“I was doing so many other things because I didn’t have the courage to write,” she said. “It wasn’t until I got into Syracuse that I felt, okay, now I think I have permission. That’s part of what we want to do at Catapult—give people permission. Don’t quit… We’re here, we’re with you, we support you.”\n“She’s one of the most verbally gifted writers I’ve worked with, just wildly imaginative,” Mr. Saunders said. “Her work is kind of dark but personally, she is very optimistic and bright. The darkness is the willingness to acknowledge that things don’t go perfectly… Some people come in and light up the room and raise the bar and she was one of those.”\nIn 2006 and 2007, Ms. Koch wrote a confessional, 11-part travelogue for Smith Magazine , in which she described her ambivalence about her family’s wealth. (Charles Koch is estimated to be worth $47.8 billion, according to consulting firm Wealth-X.)\n“Having money upsets and confuses me into feeling crappy and spoiled and quivering with self-loathing,” she wrote. “I expend a lot of energy pretending I don’t have it.”\nCharles Koch, himself a published author with a new book about his business strategies coming out in October, declined an interview request.\nMore recently Ms. Koch has kept a lower profile, publishing fiction pieces under a pseudonym in literary magazines such as Fence and One Story.\n“I just want my writing to be judged on its own merit,” said Ms. Koch, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband. “That’s what every writer wants.”\nCatapult will offer fiction, narrative nonfiction and graphic novels as well as creative-writing classes and online publishing. Its courses—six-week workshops and one day boot camps—began in April with the fiction workshop taught by “Delicious Foods” author James Hannaham. The fall instructors include Julia Pierpont, author of “Among the Ten Thousand Things,” and essayist Chelsea Hodson.\nCatapult plans to publish three books this fall and three next spring, all in paperback and e-book editions. Coming in October: Irish author Gavin McCrae’s “Mrs. Engels,” a debut novel imagining the life of an illiterate Irishwoman who became the lover of Friedrich Engels, co-author of “The Communist Manifesto.” The Guardian said the novel was narrated with “a fierce wit and trenchancy, shot through with poetry.”\nCatapult joins a field of thriving small presses responsible for some of the past year’s biggest hits, from Graywolf’s “On Immunity” and “The Empathy Exams” to books by Elena Ferrante and Karl Ove Knausgård.\nAside from Ms. Strachan, most of Catapult’s management and staff are writers themselves, like Ms. Koch.\n“I think it contributes to empathy for writers,” Ms. Strachan said. “That’s one of the most important things for an editor to have.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK805_KOCH_JV_20150910142838.jpg", "http://www.smithmag.net/memoirville/2006/12/01/new-feature-elizabeth-kochs-world-tour/"], "published": "2015-09-10T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:26:09.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
