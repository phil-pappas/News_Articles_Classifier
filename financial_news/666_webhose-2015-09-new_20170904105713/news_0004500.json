It will coincide with a meeting of both the Asia/Pacific and global franchise councils.\nAdvertisement Hopefully Wilmot can still make it to the Gold Coast event.\nAd guru and Fairfax Media boardroom dude, Todd Sampson , is speaking, and so is former AFL boss, Andrew Demetriou​ .\n7-Eleven is also sponsoring two of the awards; Australian Emerging Franchisor of the Year, and Australian Established Franchisor of the Year.\nUnilife sale The good news continues for Unilife, the ASX-listed retractable syringe maker headed by colourful Irishman, Alan Shortall​ .\nThe company on the cusp of finally making its first buck from actually selling a syringe, a milestone it promised to meet a decade ago, but it has found something better to sell – the company itself.\nOn Thursday the company announced a \"review of strategic alternatives\" in response to \"third-party initiated expressions of interest.\"\nUnilife said it has engaged Morgan Stanley to conduct the review to maximise shareholder value, which could include putting the entire company on the block.\n\"In keeping with the board's commitment to act in the best interests of all shareholders, we have determined at this time that it is prudent to explore strategic alternatives to determine the best opportunities for enhancing shareholder value. Unilife management will continue to operate the business as normal during this review process to serve the needs of existing and prospective pharmaceutical customers.\"\nWhich is great news, because CBD was worried that things were not going well after Shortall's long time sidekick, Jim Bosnjak​ , retired from the board late last month - days before the company announced that full year losses rocketed to more than $US90 million as revenues dropped to $US13.1 million.\nAll is well it seems, despite accumulated losses now exceeding $384.5 million and Unilife reporting that \"there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the minimum liquidity target or achieve the minimum cash revenue covenants during the 12-month period from June 30,2015.\"\nBrain drain A quick dig through the Fairfax archives revealed some of the achievements that the Irishman has modestly left off his CV.\nThis includes, Formulab Neuronetics, which captured the stock market's imagination in the mid-'90s with claims it had produced a \"thinking computer\" that functioned like the human brain, only 180 times faster.\nSoon after US investors gave the alleged product a fail mark, Shortall moved on to Sigma Global, which he described to the Sydney Morning Herald as \"investment analysis software\" designed to pick winners at horse races.\nKat walk It looks like Rod Duke 's Briscoe Group will walk away from its $324 million bid for Kathmandu when the current offer expires September 17.\nWhile its release affirmed its commitment to the bid, the signs of abandonment were unmistakable with both Duke, and his Aussie PR team, nowhere to be seen on the press release.\nDuties were left in the capable hands of chairman, Dame Rosanne Meo , who made the announcement \"on behalf of the board.\"\nThis is all great news for Kathmandu's newly installed chief executive, Xavier Simonet , who had barely reached his desk when the bid lobbed, as well as his chairman, former World Cup winning All Black captain, David Kirk .\nThe only interruption he faces to any World Cup plans, the tournament starts September 19, is the Kathmandu full year's results on September 29 – five days after the All Blacks take on the mighty Namibia.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:45:56.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
