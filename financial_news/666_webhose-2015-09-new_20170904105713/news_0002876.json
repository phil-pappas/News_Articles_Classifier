GHÈ¼215.69 million or $72.59 million representing 39.26 per cent was allocated to roads and other infrastructure. \n'Agriculture modernisation had GHÈ¼170.62 million or $7.43 million, representing 31.06 per cent with nothing being allocated to capacity building. \n'At the end of 2014, total balance standing in Ghana Petroleum Funds was $535.559 million, made up of $286.644 million in the Ghana Stabilisation Fund and $248.915 million in the Ghana Heritage Fund,' he said. \nProf Ivan Addae Mensah, Founding Member, PIAC, called for collaboration between PIAC and the Petroleum Commission for resource and revenue share formula to be effective. \n'Ministry of Finance, Bank of Ghana and Attorney General should work together and establish some guidelines for interest to be earned on any utilised funds,' he advised. \nOther stakeholders also called on the Ghana National Gas Company to ensure that invoices are submitted by the GNPC in relation to gas supplies and honoured in a timely manner. \nThey also called for the urgent need for a critical appraisal of the visibility of the continuous operation of the Saltpond field against the backdrop of low crude oil price. \nPIAC is a statutory committee established under section 56 of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2011 (Act 815), with the objective of monitoring and evaluating compliance with the Act by the government and other relevant institutions in the management and use of petroleum revenues. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:38:03.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
