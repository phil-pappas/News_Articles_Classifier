It is fair to say that the Australian market is stuck in purgatory, which is that intermediate state between heaven and hell.\nChanticleer turned for advice on the market's drivers and its likely direction to Jason Todd, a division director at Macquarie Securities and the firm's new head of Australian macro research.\nTodd comes to the task of pontificating on the Australian market with 14 years' experience in equity markets in the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. He analyses four key areas before forming a view on the market – economics, earnings, valuations and liquidity.\nTodd came away from the profit reporting season with a pretty gloomy view of corporate Australia. He was disappointed to see industrials deliver zero revenue growth in the June half.\nThe only reliable source of growth in the industrial sector has been the international companies but they will require an Australian dollar materially below US68¢ to drive another round of earnings upgrades.\nHe concluded that although major corporates were growing the large majority had rates of growth that were uninspiring, and for some tailwinds were fading. \"Earnings growth is becoming increasingly scarce,\" Todd says.\n Todd is on the same page as the Reserve Bank of Australia when he notes the lack of capital investment by Australian companies to generate future growth. Without that investment dividend payout ratios cannot be sustained.\nHe says that \"against a backdrop of declining factor productivity and slowing long-term growth, we think corporates will need to invest more in order to grow their earnings base and maintain dividends without pushing payout ratios too much higher\".\nThe paradox sitting behind this burning issue is the historically low cost of capital in Australia. \"We have seen the weighted average cost of capital fall from a peak of 9.9 per cent in 2008 to a recent trough of 5.6 per cent [a decline of close to 50 per cent],\" he says. \"Over the same time the historic industrial price earnings ratio has nearly doubled, rising 88 per cent.\"\nHe says this comparison can be misleading because the cost of capital was rising as the financial crisis unfolded while at the same time earnings were still rising, which means the PE was falling.\nThis is where the conversation gets interesting because Todd believes the cost of capital is about to start rising. He says \"if we were to take the peak in the cost of capital at year end 2011, earnings have contributed less than 30 per cent of the rise in the PE multiple for the market ex-resources\".\n\"If the cost of both debt and equity were to return back to the average, this would represent a 25 per cent contraction in the multiples ceteris paribus [all things being equal].\n\"This assumption is potentially a longer-term normalisation but we do expect to see the weighted average cost of capital rise around 50 basis points over the next 12 months due to both a 25bps rise in the equity risk premium (positively correlated to rising bond yields) and a 25bps rise in the cost of debt as spreads across the swap curve creep wider on the back of Fed tightening. This would only take the WACC back a little over 6 per cent – not an aggressive assumption.\"\nTodd worries about the market's concentration on a shrinking set of winning stocks in healthcare, utilities and infrastructure.\n\"Breadth always narrows as a bull market ages and this in itself is not alarming, however, weak market internals need a catalyst for change and this is where the backdrop becomes more risky,\" he says.\nThis is where the Turnbull factor could come into play.\nIf Turnbull's ascension to the prime ministership leads to rapid policy action that restores consumer and business confidence then boards of directors will respond by investing for growth.\nThis is a tall order but as Todd points out in his latest research, corporate Australia is delivering strong cash profits which provide flexibility for boards to capitalise on the relatively low marginal returns available.\nThe flipside of no action, which means more buybacks and higher dividends, is the probability that market multiples cannot be sustained at levels which are at a significant premium to other markets in the region.\nASIC on the case The arrest and charging of the former chief executive and executive chairman of Kimberley Diamonds, Alex Alexander , for allegedly issuing false information to the market shows the corporate regulator is doing its job. Chanticleer was recently critical of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and its role in the collapse of stockbroker BBY. But when it comes to enforcing market disclosure the regulator is doing well.\nAlexander was charged on Wednesday with four offences relating to false and misleading statements made by Kimberley Diamonds to the ASX between October 2013 and March 2014.\nCanadian action plan Company directors should be paid more and sit on fewer boards, according to Mark Wiseman, chief executive of the $280 billion Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.\nWiseman recommends higher pay, including a significant proportion in equity, to compensate directors for the extra time and effort that is required for boards to focus on developing long-term strategies. This idea is one of many put forward by Wiseman as part of his global campaign to fight back against short-termism in capital markets and among corporations.\nThe campaign, called 'Focusing Capital on the Long Term', was launched with the publication of a study by McKinsey & Co of 600 C-suite executives.\nThe study found that senior executives are facing increasing pressure to deliver short-term results. Two-thirds of those surveyed said this pressure was coming from the board and senior managers. A quarter said there was similar pressure coming from institutional fund managers.\nWiseman's fightback against short-term thinking among fund managers and on boards hit Australia this week with a speech to the Canadian Australian Chamber of Commerce.\nSome of his most interesting comments were in relation to directors and the central role they must play in long-term value creation.\nHe told the lunch audience in Sydney that directors must spend more time focusing on long-term strategy and the business context in which it is unfolding. \"This means not only spending more days on board work but understanding the business, meeting with customers and clients, visiting R&D labs and so on,\" he said.\n\"It also means spending more time supporting management by being active in dialogues with investors, helping to ensure they understand the long-term strategy.\"\nLater, in an interview with Chanticleer, Wiseman said directors should be paid substantially more money, receive a large proportion of compensation in stock and be forced to invest in the companies that they oversee. \"The payout should continue for a period after they have left the board,\" he says. \"You are asking directors to make long-term decisions so the payout on equity should continue long after their retirement date.\"\nWiseman said CPPIB was not prescriptive about the number of boards directors could serve on but as a guide someone on more than four boards would find it difficult to manage the workload if they are focusing on long-term strategies.\n\"If you want to boil all of this stuff down into a simple statement it's this: institutional investors and directors ought to act like owners.\"\nTONY BOYD\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-16T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T22:05:07.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
