Tony McDonough Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Both major parties were claiming victory following Saturday's Canning byelection with pro-Turnbull Liberals contending the dumping of Tony Abbott limited the backlash against the government\nLabor noted the swing towards it was still large enough to give it government if replicated nationally on election day.\nWith about 70 per cent of the vote counted in the West Australian seat, victorious Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie was a comfortable winner, leading Labor's Matt Keogh by 55 per cent to 45 per cent after preferences had been distributed.\nThis represented a swing towards Labor of 7 percentage points, which is less than the 10-point swing the polls were predicting as late as Monday, the day Mr Abbott was removed in a lightning coup and replaced by Malcolm Turnbull.\nLabor's Matt Keogh lost in Canning. Tony McDonough However, a 7-point swing to Labor on election day, if uniform, would deliver it 31 seats and government.\nParty spin Both major parties spun the result to their advantage but there was still evidence of underlying tensions left over from last week. Mr Turnbull said it was a repudiation of Labor trying to scare people about the future, such as the free trade deal with China.\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann, a West Australian who voted for Mr Abbott in the leadership ballot, said the leadership change may not be the reason for the better-than-expected swing.\n \"Nobody will ever know what the result would have been if we did not change leader,\" he said.\nHe said the local party and Mr Hastie ran a strong campaign.\nBut NSW Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos, part of the group that ousted Mr Abbott, said the swing would have been worse if there had not been a change.\n\"It's a better result than we would have expected at the beginning of the campaign,\" he said.\nMessage to electorate He said Mr Turnbull's ascension had sent a message to the electorate that the government was once more listening and wanted to rebuild trust.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten was content with the swing.\n\"Because of Labor's campaign, a safe Liberal seat has become a marginal one and the Liberal Party – led by Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop – cut down their Prime Minister,\" he said.\n\"The Liberal Party sacrificed Australia's Prime Minister to hold the seat of Canning.\n\"Voters in Canning have sent Malcolm Turnbull a clear message: the Liberals changing leaders changed little. This evening's result is a strong rejection of the Abbott/Turnbull government's cuts and broken promises.\"\nHe was at pains before the byelection to point out that the average swing in a byelection caused by the death of a sitting member was 2.4 per cent.\nThe byelection was caused by the death of Liberal MP Don Randall, who had held the seat by a margin of 12 per cent.\nSwing to Labor The primary swing towards Labor was more than 9 per cent, which came at largely the expense of the Liberals and the Palmer United Party, and to a lesser extent, the Greens.\nMr Hastie's primary vote was 46 per cent and Labor's was 36 per cent. In the Fairfax-Ipsos poll of the seat conducted a week before the election and when Mr Abbott was still prime minister, the Liberal primary was 45 per cent and Labor's was 36 per cent.\nIt will be some time before the final result is known given about 10 per cent of the seat's 113,000 voters cast their ballot before election day using pre-poll and postal votes.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-20T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:45:03.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
