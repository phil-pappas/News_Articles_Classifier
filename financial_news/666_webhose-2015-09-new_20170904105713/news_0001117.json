And if this year’s show is any indication, sentiment in the industry remains pretty weak. \nDeutsche Bank analysts Jorge Beristain, Chris Terry and Wilfredo Ortiz attended the show. They said year-over-year total attendance was down 12 per cent, which is not too surprising after three miserable years in the sector. \nMore importantly, they said most companies and investors at the show did not expect precious metals prices to turn around anytime soon in U.S. dollar terms. That meant cost cuts were in the spotlight, as they have been for some time. \nThe analysts drew a few other key conclusions from the show: new equity and credit access has dried up in the sector; more silver and gold streams will likely be sold to keep companies afloat; compensation and accountability practices in the sector are improving (but still need work); and global gold supply is poised to decline due to a lack of new mines being built. \n“A worrisome trend is the slashing of exploration budgets, particularly by the junior miners, which has implications for gold production sustainability given long discovery-to-production cycles, currently pegged at 27 years and growing due to an increasing regulatory-social-environmental gauntlet,” they said in a note. \nAmong the senior companies, the Deutsche Bank analysts found that too many of the investment cases presented at the conference sounded alike. \nMany investors think this sector needs a big round of consolidation, but the analysts think this will be deferred as long as royalty and streaming companies continue to step up with money for underfunded projects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:04:45.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
