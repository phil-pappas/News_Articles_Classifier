Getting the right investing platform is key, making sure the charging structure flat fee versus a percentage of your money suits you and that the price is low for your level of investment. \nAfter that you need to make sure you are buying funds that represent good value and it is not all about price. \nTraps are everywhere for the uninitiated. Tracker funds those that replicate a whole index are often the cheapest way to invest but get the wrong one and you will dramatically overpay sometimes by as much as 10 times. \nThe worst culprits include household names like Scottish Widows, Virgin and M&S. All offer tracker several times the cost of rivals doing exactly the same job. \nAmong actively managed funds, you can pay as much for a badly underperforming fund as you can for a star manager with a record of beating the market in al conditions. \nWith the help of Jason Hollands and Laith Khalaf of, respectively, Tilney BestInvest and Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , two leading fund shops, we’ve pulled together a group of funds we think give investors a great deal. \nAlways ensure you buy the “clean” share class that includes no extra fee for middlemen. The fees quoted here are the “ongoing charge figure”, which includes most of the manager’s \nFidelity UK Index / L&G UK Index \nBoth of these are available for 0.06pc through favoured fund platforms (Fidelity and Hargreaves Lansdown respectively). Simply, it is the cheapest way for ordinary people to invest in shares. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if you don’t invest through those platforms, these funds, and others such as Vanguard UK All-Share Index, will do the job for fractionally more. \nBlackRock (Swiss: BLK.SW - news ) Consensus 85 \nThis gives investors exposure to both shares and bonds for 0.22pc, or even as little as 0.09pc through selected platforms. Funds are not actively managed but come from markets around the world and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK - news ) will rebalance to ensure the asset mix is maintained. Vanguard LifeStrategy 60pc Equity does a similar job for 0.24pc. \nScottish Mortgage \nWe’re fans of investment trusts for those who know the risks and this one gives exposure to hand-picked stocks from around the world for 0.48pc. The portfolio is high conviction, with 95pc of the picks differing from underlying indices. \nAs the chart shows, it has significantly outperformed a global index over one, three, five and ten years. As such, the premium looks worth it. \nScottish Mortgage: The trust (blue line) has comfortably beatne the IA sector for global funds onver the long term. Source: FE \nMelchior Global Equity \nThis is a tiny fund but it is managed by Nick Mottram, former Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) of Equities at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) and Global Head of Research at Schroders (LSE: SDR.L - news ) , using a screening process. \nOver the last five years the fund has returned 83pc versus a 58pc return from the MSCI AC World Index and it’s available for just 0.4pc. \nWoodford Equity Income \nThere are other great performers out there who know they can charge more than competitors, and do so. \nNeil Woodford’s fund, however, is available for 0.75pc, which in the context of his track record represents great value. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:46:10.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
