When I pointed out the FXJ share price's recovery in recent months, I was given some salty language and told to sod off.\nMost pricey apps The most expensive app in the Apple store is $US999.99, which is the cap Apple has put on price. As with a vast portion of the app store, some of the most expensive apps are utterly stupid. Water Globe costs $379 and is a set of interactive screen toys. They snow, change direction and make you fall asleep.\niVIP Black aka \"The Millionaire's App\" costs $US999.99 and offers users perks and discounts from various luxurious partners; private jet companies, bodyguards, jewellers and the like. Users must have at least $1 million to their name. After providing information on one's salary range, how many international flights a year were taken and how often one stays in hotels, would-be users are then vetted before being approved to begin using the application.\n The initial price tag allows a membership of one year.\nThankfully, I found a putz who had downloaded this app. And from what I understand, the discounts range from about 5 per cent to 15 per cent off and provide access to complimentary room upgrades and top quality services from partners like Virgin Limited Edition and Gordon Ramsay Restaurants.\nWithin the app, there is a Black Box section which is a continually updated list of deals and offer. In all honesty, this app is pretty much a millionaire's Groupon.\nLuxury is terribly delicious, and outlandish spending is enjoyable, but as Orson Welles points out, \"Living in the lap of luxury isn't bad, except that you never know when luxury is going to stand up.\"\nIndeed, iVIP attempts to replicate what very good personal assistants can do in their sleep and the blend of Apple Watch and Hermès may result in some serious brand confusion. While I think the new watches look beautiful and I find the technology deeply attractive, Apple isn't exactly known for making products that last a long time, and Hermès, well, is.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/water-globe/id315423511?mt=8", "http://ivipworld.com/"], "published": "2015-09-11T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:12:22.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
