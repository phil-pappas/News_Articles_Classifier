( JCI ) . The $1.48 billion acquisition closed on September 1 and is expected to be about 8 cents to 10 cents per share accretive to earnings in the first full year. \n\"Notwithstanding the implications of the recent stock price performance, we remain constructive on the company's prospective earnings growth potential,\" Barclays said in a note. \nCBRE's second quarter 2015 AEPS was in-line with Barclays' estimate at 42 cents. Revenues were up across the board, led by the Americas. \nShares of CBRE were up 0.53% to $32.50 in early morning trading on Thursday. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates CBRE GROUP INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate CBRE GROUP INC (CBG) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, notable return on equity and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: CBG's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 11.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 12.4%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. CBRE GROUP INC has improved earnings per share by 15.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, CBRE GROUP INC increased its bottom line by earning $1.45 versus $0.94 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.95 versus $1.45). The company, on the basis of net income growth from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly outperformed against the S&P 500 and exceeded that of the Real Estate Management & Development industry average. The net income increased by 18.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $105.46 million to $125.03 million. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Real Estate Management & Development industry and the overall market, CBRE GROUP INC's return on equity exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 199.37% to $137.66 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, CBRE GROUP INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -22.07%.
