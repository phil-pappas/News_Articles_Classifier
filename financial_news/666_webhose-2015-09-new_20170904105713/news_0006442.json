Increases in gasoline supply across the country and profit margins that Lundberg called \"healthy\" gave the refiners and retailers leeway to take pump prices down.\nCompared with one year ago, the $2.44 average price was lower by $1.02 a gallon.\n\"Consumers are winners at this point,\" survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. \"It is a big historical discount to last year.\"\nThe latest decline came despite crude oil prices having gone up between surveys, she said.\nGasoline prices could slip another 4 to 10 cents in coming weeks, as long as crude prices do not surge, Lundberg said. \"The price trend is probably still down from here.\"\nProduction costs for many refiners across the country should go lower because many will see anti-smog regulations ease on Sept. 15 allowing them to operate in the winter with higher vapor pressures than in the summer, she said.\nDrivers in Indianapolis saw one of the biggest declines in the last three weeks in the survey area, which covers the 48 contiguous states. Gas prices there fell 73 cents to $2.13 a gallon as BP PLC's Whiting, Indiana, refinery came back online following repairs, Lundberg said.\nThe lowest average price, as in the previous survey, was in Charleston, South Carolina, and the highest was again in Los Angeles. The latest prices in Charleston were $1.94, compared with $3.31 in Los Angeles.
