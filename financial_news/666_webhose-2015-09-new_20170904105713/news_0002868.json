In addition, it contributes significantly in export earning. \nHowever, because of its rain-fed nature, the subsistence and traditional farming system the nation pursue could not promise food self sufficiency at the required level. Crop production is one of the key player for food supply but because of the aforementioned factors, it could not fully bridge the gap between the demand and supply of food .Hence, modernizing or increasing crop productivity is a task that must enjoy the push of all stakeholders. \nAchieving food security is not a task that eyes at this generation alone, it must also eyes at the future generation because the fast growing population may further widen the gap between supply and demand. \nAlongside with crop production, others means that can support food security should be considered. Among several kinds of food sources, fish farming can be taken as a supportive sub-sector still not set in motion. \nAccording to studies, Ethiopia is endowed with enormous water bodies including reservoirs and ponds covering over 8000 square kilo meter as well as river systems that stretch over a distance of 7100 km. There are also over 30 major lakes in the country. These water bodies are known to harbor a diverse array of flora and fauna of significant economic importance to the country. About 200 fish specious have been available, of which 30 to 40 are endemic. \nIt is roughly estimated that some 40000 -50000 tons of fish could be harvested from lakes, reservoirs and rivers annually. However, a very recent study shows that, the fish potential could be pushed to 94000 tons per year. For this increment, additional artificial water bodies being constructed for irrigation and power generation purpose could play a significant role. \nCurrently, small scale fish farming is practiced by traditional method. Mostly it is being conducted by self employment schemes. The product is mostly consumed by family members and members of the surrounding community. This clearly indicates how the nation is far from unleashing its potential in optimizing profit from the sector. \nThe recent report of Ministry of Agriculture regarding the exploitation of aquatic and water wealth indicates that, the level of small scale fish farming in the country is very minimal,archaic and subsistence based. Fish farmers lack the know how. And the loss attendant on pre and post harvesting proves very high. For want of access to the market, most of the products perish. This in turn,affects the natural resource and the ecosystem at large. Over fishing particularly endangers the juvenile fishes. This critically depletes fish stalks. Unless this inimical trend is reversed, not only the fishes but also the livelihood of the hunters will be jeopardized. \nOn the other hand, fish farming in rural parts of the country plays a crucial role in creating job opportunities for thousands. Both young men and women having traditional skills could support their family making food available at household level. Small scale fisheries have the tendency of being firmly rooted in local communities,traditions and values. In this engagement, self employment is common and women prove significant participants in the sector particularly in post harvest processing such as drying and preparing dishes of fish and fish related dry foods. In this regard, if the sector is value chained and integrated to the market, its contribution both for employment and the national economy ,no doubt,will be tremendous. \nHowever, to render the sector viable and support sustainable development a responsible management is essential. Side by side with this, enhancing public awareness and advancing knowledge at local level is essential. Conservation work in protecting the resource is also called for. Sound policies must be formulated and implemented and to that end, empowering fish farmers is vital. Their participatory role in decision making should not be compromised. Because every thing happening on the ground directly affects their livelihood. \nNevertheless, beyond this, there is another challenge which needs cooperation between stakeholders not only locally but also globally. \nCurrently global warming and climate change directly endanger water bodies. This is particularly true in poor countries,which have a limited adoptive and mitigation capacity. These countries greatly suffer from the phenomena. As a result, their effort to poverty eradication is hampered. \nDue to drought and the disruption of rain fall pattern, the sources of the water bodies gets dwindled. The inflow of rainwater to rivers and ponds critically diminishes, the clearance of vegetation cover in the surrounding and overgrazing in the suburbs of lakes slashes down the volume of water. The expansion of lodges and hotels in the suburbs further complicate the matter. The cumulative effect of climate change and human activity endangers marine life. Consequently, this aggravates food insecurity. Hence, land and natural resource management work should be strengthened. The preservation of natural resource means the protection of marine life such as fish stalk. In line with this, replenishing the fish stalk in the water bodies is vital to protect aquatic life from extinction. \nCurrently the Ministry of Agriculture through the National Fishery and Aquatic Life Research Center is doing its level best to meet the mentioned objectives. The center is engaging in different activities including the rearing as well as the stalking of fish into natural and artificial water bodies. Provide training to stake holders and undertaking experiments and such practice hopefully strengthens the preservation of marine life which is the source of food and nutrition. Thus,paying attention to the small scale fishery for supporting food security is essential and to that end all stakeholders should support the government's endeavour.
