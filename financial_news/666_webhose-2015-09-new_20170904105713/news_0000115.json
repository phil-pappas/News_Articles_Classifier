Almost half of UK households buying groceries visit Aldi or Lidl every month, researcher Nielsen has said. \nWith their low price, limited assortment, low cost strategy they have won share from Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , Asda, Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) and Morrison, forcing Britain's \"big four\" to cut prices, improve product quality and boost customer service. \nAll four are competing for a share of the fast growing grocery e-commerce market, with Morrison the last to go online when it struck a deal with Ocado in 2013. \nGrocery e-commerce in Britain is more advanced than elsewhere in Europe, accounting for about 5 percent of sales and forecast by researchers IGD to grow to 8.6 percent by 2020. \nAnalysts said Aldi's first move online will cause trepidation among Britain's big four, already nervous over the possible launch of Amazon Fresh in the UK. \n\"Aldi adds yet another string to its bow that will be a major worry to the likes of Ocado, Sainsbury's and Tesco,\" said Julie Palmer, partner at consultancy Begbies Traynor (LSE: BEG.L - news ) . \nAldi, Britain's seventh largest grocer with a 5.6 percent market share according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel, made an operating profit of 260.3 million pounds ($395 million) in 2014, down from 271.4 million the previous year, reflecting price cuts and higher staff costs. \nThat profit fall came despite sales increasing 31 percent to a record 6.89 billion pounds as the company opened new outlets. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has 598 stores in the UK and is targeting 1,000 by 2022. \nWhile rivals are cutting capital expenditure, Aldi invested a record 438 million pounds in stores and distribution centres in 2014.
