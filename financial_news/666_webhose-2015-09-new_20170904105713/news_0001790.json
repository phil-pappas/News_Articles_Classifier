The higher the share of the market you own the more problematic it becomes to engineer a restructuring if needed down the line,\" said Luca Cazzulani, rate strategist at UniCredit, who estimates the limit would be reached in Portugal as soon as the current trillion-euro QE programme ends in September 2016.\n\"This is the trade-off, but I don't know where they would put themselves in this trade-off.\"\nCREDIBILITY\nWorking out how long extended QE might last is difficult. Analysts must make assumptions on the future price of the bonds and the pace of government debt issuance, among others. Bonds from Italy, Spain or Portugal that the ECB bought at the height of the crisis under a previous scheme called the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), which count toward the totals, further complicates the picture.\nCazzulani, who does not include future debt issuance in his estimates, says the ECB could buy German debt for seven more months at today's 60 billion euros per month pace after the current scheme ends.\nCiti strategists, who assume no change in the pace of debt issuance but do not include SMP purchases, say extended QE would first run into ECB limit in Finland, then in Germany, at around the same time in October 2017.\nThat may seem as a long way off, but ratings agency Standard & Poor's has said it expects QE to reach 2.4 trillion and be extended to mid-2018.\nIf the limit were reached in Finland or Portugal, \"they would fudge it\", says Harvinder Sian, global head of G10 rates strategy at Citi. \"These countries are not systemically important.\"\nIn practice, they would probably slow down bond purchases in these countries before the limit was reached.\nIn the end, discussion of limits on QE, which risk leaving the ECB without ammunition, may be academic.\n\"If the ECB wants to do it, they will do it and ignore any of the previous limits they previously imposed on themselves,\" said Marius Daheim, senior fixed income strategist at SEB.\n\"If they feel it really is economically necessary to expand QE they will not back off just because it would violate 25 or 33 percent buying restrictions. That could be the maximum loss of credibility they could impose on themselves.\" (Editing by Alison Williams )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:23:44.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
