That was not as high as the national figure of 154 per cent rise, which was spurred on by New South Wales landing a whopping 248 per cent jump.\nREA Group sale director Toby Balazs said there had been a 48 per cent jump in project volumes this year alone over 2014’s result.\n“There’s definitely a lot more people interested in buying off-the-plan apartments than there was three years ago as they are starting to realise the benefits of inner city living,” he said.\n“Already we have 353 new apartments currently listed on our site which is the highest volume we’ve had since August 2012. It’s great news for people looking for a new apartment as now more than ever, there’s so much choice in finding the perfect home to suit their lifestyle needs.”\nQueensland saw new apartment projects go from 53 three years ago to 120 this year, according to REA Queensland sales manager Marini Peries - led by those with two to three bedroom units.\n“The current market shows that this style of apartment is what people are after.”\nBrisbane was also considered a lot more affordable than southern states, with a quarter of those viewing new apartments coming from interstate.\nNational developer Metro marketing director Ken Woodley said his firm alone had a pipeline of 2,232 apartments for Brisbane - on top of the 1,707 units currently under construction.\nHe said low vacancy rates were driving demand with particular interest from southern investors in the 5 per cent rental yields being achieved in Brisbane.\nAs well, he said, “the affordability factor is a major driver compared to prices in Sydney and Melbourne”. Price points in Brisbane have stayed “relatively flat” for the last seven to eight years, he said.\n“Our research shows that people are increasingly looking to move from established apartments to the newer high-rise developments due to the amenities and lifestyle facilities available. This is helping to drive the demand in new projects,” he said.\nKyle Nawrocki, 25, has moved into a single bedroom, single bathroom, single car space unit in Oxford Towers – in bustling Fortitude Valley.\n“It’s nice and central which is amazing,” he said. “I like that they’ve made the building a community as well. we have a Facebook page for the tower. It’s pet friendly too. That was a big for me. It’s hard to find one which has all that.”\nThe best part, he said, was unwinding on the roof at the end of a long day alongside other residents.\n“We’re all in the same boat,” he said, “Really hard working, focused on our career, but you can still have a social drink on the rooftop.”\nOriginally published as Apartments double in three years ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde&h=Apartments+double+in+three+years", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fnihpu6h-1227510409463", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde&title=Apartments+double+in+three+years", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Apartments+double+in+three+years&c=APARTMENT+living+is+fast+becoming+the+21st+century+equivalent+of+the+iconic+60s+combi+van+-+a+lifestyle+must-have+that%26%238217%3Bs+seen+production+levels+more+than+double.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/new-apartments-double-in-three-years-with-20-somethings-leading-demand-for-inner-city-living/story-fndbalka-1227510409463?sv=6beb589c4405cad6439864b12906efde&title=Apartments+double+in+three+years"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T03:04:26.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
