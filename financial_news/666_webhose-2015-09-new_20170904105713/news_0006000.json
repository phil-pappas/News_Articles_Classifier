ComScore gained in extended trading after the announcement, rising as high as $45, suggesting the deal could be worth as much as $51.75 a share to Rentrak stockholders.\nThe merger represents a new challenge to Nielsen Holdings Plc, which produces the TV audience ratings that underpin advertising rates and does a range of research for media and consumer products companies. The deal combines two big players in media measurement -- ComScore tracks Web activity while Rentrak reports on TV viewing, DVD sales and the movie box-office, as well as some online activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:51:48.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
