The figures cover the year to August and were compiled by researcher at Consumer Intelligence. \nThe price changes relate to the average of the cheapest five deals available across distribution channels, including price comparison sites and direct from insurers. They will later be reflected in official inflation statistics. \nYounger drivers have traditionally paid more for their car insurance due to the greater statistical likelihood that they will be involved in costly accidents. \nThe trend has been changing, however, with the introduction of “black box” insurance policies that are priced using information collected by a “telematics” computer fitted to each car. \nThings such as speed, braking and time of use are recorded to provide insurers with even greater detail upon which to underwrite policies. Good driving is rewarded with lower prices. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has made the best advertised deals for younger drivers significantly cheaper although those with poor driving habits will pay more. Consumer Intelligence said 46pc of the most competitive quotes for under-25s now come from telematics providers compared with 32.5pc in October 2013. \nOver the past two years, the average best price for the under-25s has fallen 20.6pc, compared to a 13pc rise for the over-50s and a 6.7pc increase for the 25-49 group. \nThere is some evidence that insurers are getting tougher on older drivers, who find cover harder and more expensive to get as they age . \nYear-on-year price falls for the under-25s peaked in May when the cost had fallen 10.3pc in 12 months. \nFigures from June showed that 22pc of young make drivers and 14pc of young female drivers now use telematics policies. \nThe way the policies work, with the best deal being reserved for the best drivers, means that other young drivers - those with poor driving habits - are paying more. \nYounger drivers still pay higher average premiums. The average cheapest premium for all motorists in August 2015 was £696, but for motorists aged under 25 it was £1,680 while drivers aged 25-49 paid £481 and those aged 50-plus paid £258. \nIan Hughes, chief executive of Consumer Intelligence, said: “Older drivers are to an extent helping to fund the premium reductions for younger motorists and need to ensure they are receiving the best value for money from their insurer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:28:02.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
