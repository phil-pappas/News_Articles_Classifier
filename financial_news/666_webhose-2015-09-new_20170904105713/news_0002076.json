Dow member ExxonMobil rose 2.0 percent, Anadarko Petroleum (Other OTC: ANDKU - news ) tacked on 5.2 percent and Weatherford International (NYSE: WFT - news ) gained 5.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:28:38.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
