We can learn a lot from different cultures, which have different investment practices,” he said.\nRIL is keen to build a unique platform for start-ups to engage in its own ecosystem of businesses, and potentially partner for large scale enterprises, which could be worth around USD 5 billion, and direct consumer opportunities.\nStart-ups have already begun engaging RIL in areas of logistics, supply chain management and corporate security, Gupta said.\n“While the first batch was just a pilot, and now that we’ve started actively, the top three or five companies that succeed will work with our business units,” he said.\nGenNext Innovation Hub is expanding in significant ways, besides this collaborative accelerator programme with Microsoft, he pointed out.\nThere are 20-30 other companies that are more mature where the Hub is facilitating them to work directly with the businesses, he said.\nGoing forward, RIL is also looking at creating localised hubs in other cities to create a wide web of entrepreneurship talent.\n“We have not yet taken a decision whether we will do it alone or in partnership with a global accelerator, but we’re moving in that direction,” Gupta said, adding the idea is to create a groundswell of entrepreneurs.\nWith its second batch, the accelerator programme is looking at companies in the broad areas of instant credit scores and lending, instant bill payment in restaurants, real-time advertising on public screens, operational intelligence for the Internet of Things applications, and audio-video call-based consultation with doctors among others.\n“The programme is mutually beneficial as start-ups need large clients and large companies need start-ups to fuel innovation,” Gupta said.\nGenNext Ventures, which has an “evergreen corpus”, and a global scope, may pick up to 15 per cent stake in some of the companies that make it to the next round of GenNext Innovation Hub. This would validate their idea to get further funding, he said.\n 11, 2015 10:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:48:00.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
