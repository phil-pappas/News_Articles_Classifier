Even as more than half of states have moved forward with decriminalizing or approving medical marijuana for specific conditions, it remains a federally illicit substance, further muddying the waters when it comes to prescribing, dispensing and reimbursement.\nDr. Robert Goldberg, Chief Medical Officer at pharmacy and ancillary benefits manager Healthesystems, will offer a clinical perspective on the topic Saturday September 26th at the 2015 Western Occupational Health Conference (WOHC). The presentation Medical Marijuana: Issues for Workers’ Compensation & Workplace Safety takes a look at current evidence for the potential effectiveness of cannabis in conditions that include chronic pain, as well as forward-looking recommendations for addressing the potential impact on workplace safety.\n“The viability of cannabis as a treatment option for chronic pain is growing every day due to changing attitudes and, consequently, regulation,” said Dr. Goldberg. “Increasingly the question is no longer whether medical marijuana is an option, but rather how it should be managed by the workers’ compensation system and in the workplace. Policies are needed that emphasize worker and public safety. Until those policies are in place, we are all in a difficult position to make decisions regarding medical marijuana.”\nPublic opinion towards medical marijuana has grown overwhelmingly positive. A recent CBS News survey found that 80% of Americans support legalization. Physicians in a number of states are recommending marijuana for relief of chronic pain or related anxiety, depression or insomnia, and some judges are now ordering carriers to reimburse injured workers for medical cannabis.\nWOHC 2015 is held by the Western Occupational & Environmental Medical Association at the Loews Ventana Canyon in Tucson, Arizona. Dr. Goldberg will present Medical Marijuana: Issues for Workers’ Compensation & Workplace Safety on Saturday, September 26th at 10:45 a.m.\nHealthesystems is highly engaged in public policy education and advocacy.
