Announces Three-for-Two Stock Split \nJONESTOWN, PA --(Marketwired - September 01, 2015) - Jonestown Bank & Trust Co. (JBT) ( OTC PINK : JNES ) announced that its Board of Directors declared a three-for-two split in JBT common stock in the form of a stock dividend. \nThe stock dividend is payable to stockholders of record on September 10, 2015, and is expected to be distributed to shareholders on September 17, 2015. The stock split will increase JBT's outstanding shares from approximately 1.5 million shares prior to the split to approximately 2.25 million shares. \nAs a result of the stock split, each shareholder will receive one additional share of stock for every two shares owned as of September 10, 2015. For example, a shareholder owning 200 shares of JBT stock and currently receiving a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, or a total of $46.00, will, after the actions outlined above take effect, own 300 shares of stock and receive the same aggregate dividend of $46.00. The Bank anticipates continuing to pay its consistent dividend stream, but it is not guaranteed. \nShareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares that they otherwise would have been entitled to receive in connection with the split, except that those shareholders participating in JBT's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan will have fractional shares credited to their accounts. The price paid for fractional shares will be based on the average closing price of a share of common stock reported on the OTC: Pink for the five trading days prior to the record date. \nTroy A. Peters, JBT's Chief Executive Officer stated, \"JBT has a strong and stable shareholder base, and we appreciate our long-term shareholders. This split is intended to improve the liquidity for our stock by making more shares available in the market, and to make our stock more accessible and attractive to new investors. The Board of Directors decided to effect the stock split after careful consideration and coming to the conclusion that the potential benefits of broader ownership positively affect all shareholders.\" \nAbout Jonestown Bank & Trust Co. : \nFounded in 1873, Jonestown Bank & Trust Co.
