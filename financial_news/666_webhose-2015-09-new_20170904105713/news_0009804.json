The product is a food supplement WFP uses to treat malnutrition. \nTreatment of moderate acute malnutrition is one of the key services that the Tawila Nutrition Centre offers to the displaced people living in Argo, Dali and Rwanda camps in North Darfur's Tawila locality. Baby Mahadia and her two siblings are among those who benefit from the services the centre offers. \nAt the centre, all children under five are screened for malnutrition by measuring their weight in relation to their height, their height in relation to age and the circumference of their mid-upper arm. Like Mahdia, malnourished children are given the food supplement until they reach a healthy weight and their measurements show they are healthy. \nPregnant women and nursing mothers are also screened by the measurement of their mid-upper arm circumference and are put on the same feeding course if they found to be malnourished. \nIn addition to the feeding programme , the centre also gives mothers awareness sessions on health and nutrition such as the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, preparation of highly nutritious meals with local ingredients and general food hygiene. For each session the mother attends, she receives a ration of food for her family. \nThe Mothers' Club \n\"The training and the ration have helped me whip up some healthy and delicious dishes that my children enjoy. I also exchange recipes with other mothers who belong to the \"Mothers Club\" that we had to form after completing the training,\" said Hawa. \"I can even ask them to watch over my children when I have to step out of the house to do some errands and I volunteer to take their children to the centre for check-ups and routine monitoring in case they are unable to do so,\" Hawa said. \nSudan is one of 34 countries in the world with the highest burden of undernutrition. One in every three children aged under five is stunted and one out of every six children weighs too little for his or her height. Four states have acute malnutrition levels one of which is the state of North Darfur. \nIn 2015, WFP plans to respond to the nutritional needs of vulnerable people especially mothers and their children through a variety of interventions that include a supplementary feeding programme for all children under five, and targeted supplementary feeding for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition among children under five and nursing and pregnant mothers. In conflict-affected region of Darfur, nearly 300,000 children aged under five, pregnant and nursing mothers will receive treatment for moderate acute malnutrition. An additional 128,000 malnourished children under five, pregnant women and nursing mothers from eastern and central Sudan will also receive treatment. \nEuropean Commission's Humanitarian and Civil Protection Department (ECHO) is WFP's main partner in its efforts to treat moderate acute malnutrition amongst vulnerable people in Sudan.
