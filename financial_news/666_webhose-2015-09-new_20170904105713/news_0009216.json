But they’ve been smoked out of many hiding places by now.\nWith the biotech crunch of last week, the healthcare group, as tracked by the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ( XLV ), is now down for the year. Healthcare has been a multi-year leader, a growth-value-demographics-merger bullish thesis in one package.\nThis leaves only the consumer discretionary sector up slightly for 2015, thanks mostly to retailers and consumer durables stocks.\nDo all the “safe” hiding places need to be exposed for the market to finally get that flush of surrender that so many seem to be watching for?\nGet the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App \nIf not surrender, investors have remained steadily in retreat for weeks, driving most of the typical measures of public mood toward anxious extremes that often allow for a decent rally.\nThis contrarian logic hasn’t worked too well in recent weeks, hinting that the market is redefining what “extreme sentiment” means in a deep correction versus the dip-buying environment of the past few years.\nThis bull market had already flattened out in the year preceding the tumble into the correction in July, which has undercut the longer-term view of the trend.\nThe twelve-month average level of the S&P 500 has dropped for two straight months , something that has only happened twice since 1995 – both as bear markets got underway.\nWhile the current valuation of the stock market is unchallenging around 15-times forecast corporate earnings – assuming those forecasts are roughly right – the nasty setback in corporate credit keeps stocks from appearing reliably cheap.\n[While not a magic indicator, the free cash flow yield of S&P 500 companies is less than 5%, while junk debt yields 7.7%. This bull market has done its best work when free cash flow yields exceeded junk yields.]\nSo many people are assuming the S&P 500 must at least “re-test” its August low of 1867, down more than 3% from here, it might be tempting to take the other side.\nPlenty more are using the 2011 panic as a guide, which would mean a drop below 1750. Now that we have Congressional dysfunction and a threatened debt-ceiling standoff on the radar, maybe traders are over-extrapolating the similarities.\nEven if it’s hard to play the hero and bet on the world not ending soon by buying emerging-market stocks or junk bonds, those are the sectors at least to watch for clues about when the Dow might make an important stand.\nThe U.S. stock market, at the moment, can not heal itself.\nFinance Investment & Company Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:36:47.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
