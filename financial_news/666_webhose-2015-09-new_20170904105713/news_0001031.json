As we [Durban] increase the numbers . we will increase the frequency of flights, and then move on to direct flights,\" he said.\nExperts say that new flights, or increased frequencies of flights, will have huge financial benefits.\nKatie Bland, director of routes for UK company UBM, said that Las Vegas, which hosted the Routes Summit in 2013, negotiated a new daily direct British Airways flight to and from London.\n\"This translated to an economic benefit, directly and indirectly, of $100-million.\n\"They were also able to negotiate about 120 new weekly flights since 2010, with an estimated economic benefit of $450-million,\" she said.\nAirports Company of SA spokesman Colin Naidoo said: \"It's good news; we have to build on it.\"\nA second airline, widely believed to be Turkish Airlines, is expected to announce this week that it will be flying to Durban.\nLike those of Qatar Airways, these \"tag flights\" will also go through Johannesburg.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:51:46.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
