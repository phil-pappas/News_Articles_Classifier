He used the funds for personal expenses including home appliances, electronics, dental services and airline tickets to visit a vacation home, according to the U.S. attorney.\nHe allegedly gave his collaborators a 10 percent cut of any money they helped him pilfer, according to the indictment.\nThe company said it had employed Rae for about 16 years and spokeswoman Diane Zappas said the missing funds were discovered through QVC's regular internal audit process.\nRae is charged with seven counts of mail fraud, 25 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and three counts of money laundering.\nJohn R. Hodde, 53, of Aubrey, Texas, and Michael H. Keppler, 55, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, who allegedly assisted Rae by submitting false invoices from their companies, were each separately charged with two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for their participation.\nIf convicted on all charges, Rae could spend the rest of his life in prison and be forced to pay full restitution.\nHodde and Keppler could face sentences of up to 40 years and also could be forced to pay full restitution and a $500,000 fine.\nRae has posted $10,000 bail and will appear in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia on Oct. 1, according to court documents.
