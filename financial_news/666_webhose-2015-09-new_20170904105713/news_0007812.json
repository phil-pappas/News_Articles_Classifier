Mr Walker says the Treasurer Scott Morrison's revived idea about downsizing has little chance of succeeding. Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Ben Potter Peter Walker, a retired engineer who lives in Upper Ferntree Gully east of Melbourne, has news for Scott Morrison: the Treasurer's plan to encourage older Australians to unlock the wealth in their homes by \"downsizing\" won't work.\nMr Morrison said on Wednesday that he would dust off an idea to encourage retirees to sell their family home, buy a smaller one and use the surplus cash for living expenses by exempting it from the pension assets test.\n\"It sounds like a really good idea but it's crap because you cannot do it,\" Mr Walker, 76, told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"The areas where you can get a downsized house are a long way away from where all our friends are or where our kids live.\"\nScott Morrison's idea for releasing value from older Australians' homes has received a cold response from at least one retiree. Mark Graham Mr Morrison has the backing of Productivity Commissioner Karen Chester in his quest to unlock some of the wealth that older Australians have locked up in housing, which is worth almost $1 trillion.\nThe idea is that some of this value can be converted to cash to boost retirement income – especially for retirees like the Walkers who have little or no superannuation.\nBut there is disagreement about how best to do it. Reverse mortgages – loans against the family home, with interest added to the principal – gave the idea a bad name when introduced a decade ago.\nSome retired home owners ended up owing more than their homes were worth because they lived longer than expected or sold early and incurred high \"break fees\", and could be kicked out before they died.\n Downsizing can work for some retirees but for many it releases insufficient cash.\nMr Walker and his wife Lynette, a 75-year-old teacher of deaf students, took another path. They realised $109,000 in cash by selling half the equity in their home to Homesafe Solutions, a joint venture of Bendigo & Adelaide Bank and Melbourne actuary Peter Szabo.\nThe conditions were that they could live in it until they both died or went into care and they would always own at least a half share.\nMr Szabo says these features should be enshrined in regulation to dispel fears about reverse mortgages, spur a larger \"home equity release\" market and deliver more competitive deals.\nThe government should insist that for a product to be eligible for any assets test exemption \"the right of the home owners to live there for the rest of their lives has to be guaranteed – no 'ifs', no 'buts',\" Mr Szabo said.\nThat would eliminate the scariest feature for home owners, and heavy-handed legislation enacted by the former Labor government, which deterred lenders, could be repealed, he said.\nHome equity loans come at a cost. The lender takes the longevity risk and has to price in the interest, and the cash paid to the Walkers was much less than half of Mr Walker's estimate of the market value of the home – about $500,000.\nBut he has no regrets. \"It's removed the worry,\" he said.\nThe appeal for the government was that unlocking housing wealth could solve the problem of retirees without super, Mr Szabo said.\n\"The amount of wealth we have got in the family home – if it's not used for retirement, the country has got a problem.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-09-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:07:04.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
