They then switch off the controls when the car is on the road, allowing it to spew out harmful levels of emissions. \n- Ignored warnings - \nAccording to German media reports at the weekend, Volkswagen ignored warnings from staff and a supplier years ago that the emission test rigging software was illegal. \nThe scandal has tarnished VW's name, left it exposed to up to 18 billion dollars (16 billion euros) in US fines, and wiped a third off its stock market value in a week. \nVolkswagen's top-of-the-range automaker Audi (LSE: 0FG8.L - news ) said that 2.1 million of its diesel cars worldwide are among the 11 million fitted with the so-called defeat devices. Czech subsidiary Skoda said 1.2 million of its vehicles were affected. \nThe environmentalist group Greenpeace lashed out at VW's piecemeal communication of the scandal, especially after new CEO Mueller promised a \"ruthless\" investigation into the affair and a \"fresh start\". \nIn addition to Germany, national authorities in several other countries have announced probes. And lawsuits are being filed, including class-action suits in the United States. \nVW's diesel vehicles are coming under close regulatory scrutiny worldwide and France has even extended the checks to cars made by other manufacturers. \nVW was not immediately available on Monday to comment on the news of the criminal investigation against Winterkorn, or media reports suggesting the group had suspended a number of managers in its R&D division. \n- Incalculable costs - \nWith the carmaker facing the possibility of having to recall as many as 2.8 million vehicles in Germany alone, the direct and indirect costs of the affair are still incalculable. \nVW has already said it will set aside 6.5 billion euros in provisions in the third quarter. But analysts at DZ Bank suggested it could be 1.0-3.0 billion euros more. \nOn top of that sum, VW also faces onerous regulatory fines, including up to $18 billion in the United States. And the fallout on customer purchases cannot yet be estimated. \nInvestors appear to fear that more bad news is still to come. \nAfter losing 34 percent of their value or around 25 billion euros last week, VW shares were again the biggest losers on the Frankfurt stock exchange Monday, where they showed a loss of as much as 9.3 percent in intraday trade. They ended the day 7.5 percent lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:01:33.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
