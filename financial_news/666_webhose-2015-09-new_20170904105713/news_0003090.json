Bernie Sanders, a socialist who has made campaign finance reform a centerpiece of his candidacy. Early polling shows him within striking distance in the two earliest state contests , Iowa and New Hampshire.\nCampaign finance reform has also received some attention in the Republican primary. During the first prime-time Republican presidential debate last month, current front-runner Donald Trump described the campaign finance system as \"broken,\" citing his experience as a prominent donor to various politicians.\n\"I give to everybody. When they call, I give, and you know what? When I need something from them, two years, three years later, I call, they are there for me,\" he said.\nAt least one entrant in the race is dedicating his candidacy exclusively to the issue of campaign finance reform. Harvard law professor and campaign finance reform advocate Lawrence Lessig announced Sunday he would enter the Democratic primary and run on a platform solely committed to reforming the electoral process.\nAl Jazeera and Reuters", "external_links": ["http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/06/438113499/harvard-law-professor-crowdfunds-1-million-launches-presidential-bid", "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/08/trump-just-made-case-for-campaign-finance-reform"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:23:45.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
