The mine was expected to produce about 82,000 tonnes per year for 22 years.\n\"Now that we're generating cash flow as a business we want to start putting some of that capital back to work as seed capital in juniors,\" Garofalo said.\nGarofalo said so-called \"junior\" exploration companies struggling to find capital amid slumping metal prices regularly pitch their projects to Hudbay, a medium-sized miner that quadrupled its copper output in the last quarter.\n\"Right now we're trying to separate the wheat from the chaff,\" Garofalo said.\nHudbay recently moved its engineering team in Peru to Arizona to work on the design of its Rosemont project, a process that should take about eight to 10 months, Garofalo said.\nHudbay has been waiting for U.S. officials to issue an environmental permit for Rosemont.\n\"While the permitting is going on one track, on a parallel track we're doing the engineering,\" Garofalo said.\nHe said he hopes construction on Rosemont to start next year.\n(Reporting by Mitra Taj; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:07:06.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
