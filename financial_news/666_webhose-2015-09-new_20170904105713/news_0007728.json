Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Jamie Briggs should be titled 'Minister for the Future'. Decisions the newly appointed Minister for Cities makes will profoundly influence the lifestyle, health and wealth of generations to come .\nDespite a romantic attachment to the Wide Brown Land, Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world.\nAs far back as 2010, 89 per cent of the population already lived in urban areas, according to the World Health Organisation. That will only increase.\nAustralia is hurtling towards denser living, as soaring land prices and longer commutes make people opt for smaller homes closer to employment and other opportunities.\nJust five years ago, approvals of new apartments were half the number of standalone homes. Now, they are almost equal .\nIt will be up to Briggs and his boss, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, to make Australia's denser living a workable reality. It's not a matter of rules about apartments being big enough and getting enough sunlight, which are state government responsibilities anyway. It's the much harder matter of winning the cooperation of portfolios as distinct as transport, education and health - and their own vested interests - to make high density urban living an attractive enough alternative to put an end to the equally romantic attachment to the suburban block.\nIt's a big ask.\n\"This is going to be the most important and critical challenge for – or opportunity for – the new portfolio and the government at large,\" says Ken Maher, the former chairman of architecture firm Hassell and a director of NSW government development body Urban Growth.\n \"We know dense cities are in a sense sustainable, but they're only sustainable if they have very good public transport systems. If we don't get our cities right in terms of amenity, comfort, opportunity, equity and so on, then it won't drive innovation successfully into the future as Malcolm Turnbull is so keen to aspire to.\"\nBetter denser living requires making decisions that cost money, for example, making space available for parks, which will only have a longer-term payoff in terms of health benefits and social benefits.\n\"While cities are becoming bigger, people are feeling more socially excluded than they ever have,\" says Shahana McKenzie, chief executive officer of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects. \"When you put a playground into an area, it activates the community to go somewhere and do something. More people would cycle to work if was a safe route. That is green infrastructure, creating those safe travel routes.\"\nAnd it requires a greater willingness by planning authorities to recognise good design in apartments and buildings, rather than just stand behind processes or blunt tools like planning regulations, says John Carfi, developer Mirvac's head of residential.\n\"It needs skills, ability, political will to assess a development on its merit,\" Carfi says. \"We're a big advocate of getting better design, but blunt instruments don't work.\"\nHaving a federal minister overseeing different streams of responsibility is a huge step forward, says Carfi's colleague and Mirvac's head of head of cities and urban renewal David Rolls.\n\"Sometimes, it gets caught up in the mire of local versus state politics,\" Rolls says.\nBut Australia stands in a better position to promote development of urban cities than it has under previous administrations, Maher says.\n\"[Paul] Keating had many of the intellectual skills but was not always able to bring people with him. And it might be said that [Gough] Whitlam had the ability to bring people with him but not necessarily to deliver the outcomes. We've got a tantalising promise here that there could be both,\" he says.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-09-21T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:03:53.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
