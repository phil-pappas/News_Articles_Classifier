French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said reports of Russian troops would complicate efforts to find such a solution.\nSpeaking on the conflict between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, Stoltenberg said an often violated ceasefire seemed to be more observed now than for a long time before, but the situation remained fragile.\nGovernment and separatist representatives agreed in late August to strive to end all violations from last Tuesday.\nPresident Petro Poroshenko said on Tuesday the country still faced the threat of a full-scale Russian military attack despite several days of relative calm.
