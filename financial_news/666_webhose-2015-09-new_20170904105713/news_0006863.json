The public deficit is set to fall from 3.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2015 to 3.3 percent next year, before falling below the European Union-mandated threshold of 3 percent in 2017.\nThe government also stuck to previous growth forecasts of 1 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent next year, in line with the consensus of international organisations. Inflation will reach 0.1 percent this year, before picking up to 1.0 percent in 2016.\nIn a statement responding to the downgrade on Friday, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said recent economic and budgetary data showed the government’s capacity to revive the economy and vowed to press ahead with reforms.\n“The government remains firmly committed to continuing and increasing its reform policies aimed at upholding potential growth and employment in the French economy,” he said in a statement.\nMoody’s said it saw France’s potential annual growth rate at about 1.5 percent over the medium term.\nFrance would continue to be plagued with a high rate of structural unemployment, relatively weak corporate profit margins, and a loss of global export market share due to rigidities in its labour and product markets, the ratings agency said.\n 21, 2015 9:00 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:18:25.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
