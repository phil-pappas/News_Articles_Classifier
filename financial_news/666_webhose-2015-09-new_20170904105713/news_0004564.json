MTN, Vodacom and Cell C are set to be buyers of Autopage's subcriber base and parts of its handset books. \nIn a market update, Altron highlighted the following: \n- The cash consideration to be received by Autopage as a result of the disposal of its MTN, Cell C and Vodacom subscriber bases to the purchasers will equal approximately R1.46bn plus VAT (value added tax). \n- MTN has agreed to purchase Autopage's handset receivables book pertaining to its subscriber base for a purchase price of approximately R219m plus VAT. \n- Cell C and Vodacom have agreed to the billing and collection of Autopage's handset receivables book pertaining to their respective subscriber bases less agreed administration charges that they may incur. \nAltron said the disposal is subject to the conclusion of certain service level, prepaid services, handset receivable services and escrow agreements. \nIn terms of JSE requirements, Altron also needs shareholder approval for the disposal to go ahead. \nThe company subsequently said that shareholders will be posted within 60 days of the date of this announcement and that they will also receive a notice of general meeting. \nMeanwhile, the company has also highlighted how the disposal could benefit Altron. \n\"The Autopage Disposal Consideration proceeds and cash realised as a result of the sale of the handset receivables books will be used to reduce the overall Altron group debt and restore cash to the company's balance sheet,\" said Altron in the market update. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:18:19.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
