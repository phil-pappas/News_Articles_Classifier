Time to show the real thing. pic.twitter.com/oXMrucs8wJ\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 29, 2015 The Model X is more than a year behind schedule, with Musk saying repeatedly that the company wanted to get every aspect of the SUV right before large-scale production would start. Buyers reserving their Model X now can expect to get the car in early 2016, according to Tesla’s website.\nRead more: 4 things to know about the Model X\nBuyers have to shell out $5,000 to reserve it, which is double the amount for buyers looking to reserve a Tesla Model S (such buyers are looking at a November delivery date for their sedans). Tesla has not disclosed the X’s base price, but those who signed up for a fully loaded “Signature” model will pay at least $132,000, and up to $144,000 with add-ons such as “ludicrous” speed mode and other accessories.\nBesides the Model X’s signature falcon wings — unlike yesterday’s gull wings, these are said to be better at negotiating tighter spaces and low heights — the SUV will have “independently operable” back-row seats, although it is not entirely clear what the company means by that.\nMarketWatch reporter Claudia Assis and tech editor Jeremy C. Owens will attend Tuesday night’s event, so follow them on Twitter and check the website for updates.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://t.co/R1Z6eMTUbo", "https://twitter.com/ClaudiaAssisMW", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/648764066823954432", "http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx", "https://twitter.com/jowens510", "http://t.co/oXMrucs8wJ"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:41:41.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
