Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Passed over by Tony Abbott two years ago when he appointed only one woman to his inner-circle, Kelly O'Dwyer has leapt into cabinet and will do a job previously held by two men.\nAs both Minister for Small Business and as Assistant Treasurer she replaces Bruce Billson and Josh Frydenberg respectively.\nHer workload will be considerable with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull placing her at the heart of what many in the business community will be his government's economic raison d'etre – tax reform.\nThe Prime Minister signalled that Ms Dwyer would play a vital role in overhauling the tax system, with many experts calling for the government to make changes to the goods and services tax, company and income taxes, as well as concessions that are regarded as overly generous, particularly in the superannuation system.\n\"The Assistant Treasurer is in effect the minister for revenue and is responsible for the tax system which is at the very centre of our whole productivity agenda, indeed at the very centre of the small business agenda,\" Mr Turnbull said on Sunday.\n\"It is vital we have a tax system that is fair, efficient and creates the right incentives so that we can get the gains in productivity we need,\" he said.\nMs O'Dwyer will also be appointed to cabinet's powerhouse expenditure review committee, at the centre of government budget process, potentially making her one of Mr Turnbull's most powerful ministers.\nLawyer A lawyer by training, Ms O'Dwyer's elevation builds on her experience as head of a parliamentary committee that looked into housing last year and her role as a staffer to former treasurer Peter Costello, where she worked as a policy expert on competition, foreign investment, corporate and securities law, accounting, and corporate governance.\nFinancial Services Council acting chief executive Andrew Bragg urged Ms O'Dwyer to swiftly implement planned changes arising from financial system inquiry, which the government was scheduled to formally respond to the night after Tony Abbott's ousting last week.\nMr Bragg said this included controversial changes to superannuation board governance arrangements, increasing industry competition and cutting fees.\n\"It is critical that this important reform agenda to improve the governance of the superannuation industry, increase competition, bring down fees, improve the focus on the life insurance industry, and redraw ASIC is implemented as quickly as possible,\" Mr Bragg said. \"It has already taken too long\".\nBy contrast, Industry Super Australia deputy chief executive Robbie Campo called on Ms O'Dwyer to reconsider the government's planned shake-up of superannuation boards and the default super system.\n\"She has an opportunity to reconsider the government's planned unnecessary and heavy-handed changes to the strongest-performing part of the super sector,\" Ms Campo said.\nFormer small business minister Bruce Billson, one of the biggest losers from Mr Turnbull's cabinet shake-up, said he had hoped to keep his job, which involved implementing the government's response to the Harper competition review.\n\"Having made this ambition clear, Prime Minister Turnbull and I spoke today and I was advised that I would not be provided that opportunity.\n\"My admiration and deep affection for the enterprising men and women of Australia and my passion for the ground-breaking policy work and initiatives we have pursued in partnership remain undiminished; however my ability to pursue this work at a cabinet level has ended.\"\nMr Billson said he would now \"reflect on the next stage of my political career\" with his family and supporters, and looked forward to continuing in his seat.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-20T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:46:36.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
