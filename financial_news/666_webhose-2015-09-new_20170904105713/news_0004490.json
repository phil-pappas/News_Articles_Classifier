We pay all the taxes we owe wherever we do business.\"\nThe finance ministry report said the Apple subsidiary had understated its revenues by 8.8 billion yuan and its costs by 3.4 billion yuan. It had also overstated its profits by 5.4 billion yuan.\nChina levied around $140 million in back taxes from Microsoft Corp at the end of last year.\n($1 = 6.3770 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Shanghai newsroom; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Mark Potter and Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:46:12.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
