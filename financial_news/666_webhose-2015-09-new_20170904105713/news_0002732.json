Ms Rhoda Kalema, a former minister and a delegate in the Constituent Assembly that made the 1995 Constitution, even invited government to consider starting a practical skills-oriented polytechnic university in each of the major regions of Uganda. \nThe government has long appeared convinced about the issues Ms Kalema raised, having launched the Skilling Uganda programme in 2012, with a view to reforming and driving technical education. \nThat was a major statement of intent, and the nascent steps taken are laudable. Yet, as usual, the challenge is in implementing the programme. This was a 10-year programme (2011-2021) and after four years, we are yet to get out of gear one. Key structures of the programme, such as the Skills Development Authority, are still not in place, and funding to the sector remained poor. \nHowever, opportunities will not wait for Uganda to get organized. They will come and those who are prepared will take them. A case in point is the oil and gas sector. \nWe reported last week that the energy ministry was set to present the draft Petroleum (Exploration, Development and Production) Regulations. Among other things, these regulations define goods and services that must be provided by Ugandans unless they are not locally available. \nThe National Petroleum Authority, for instance, is required to assess the capacity of the welding industry, in the hope that fabrication and welding services can be procured locally in Uganda. \nWhile the sector is not a mass employer, the biggest number of jobs there require practical, technical skills - as opposed to high-sounding university degrees. \nIf Ugandans are to take up most of these jobs, the government needs to speed up standardized training of Ugandan technicians. Uganda and the East African states should also consider stepping up efforts to have technicians certified here - as opposed to going to countries such as Trinidad and Tobago.
