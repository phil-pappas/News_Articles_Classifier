Brookside Capital, HarbourVest, VT Technology Ventures, and Osage Venture Partners also participated in this round. SevOne will use the financing to accelerate its growth through new technologies and markets, meeting the growing demands of organizations transforming their business for the always-on mobile economy and the Internet of Things (IoT). The funding comes at a time when mobility sits at the heart of a new and vibrant ecosystem that is uniting the digital and physical worlds. New mobile and broadband connectivity, coupled with ever-expanding virtualized cloud services, are driving the mobile economy and creating a flood of data. Organizations are continually under pressure to interpret this data to unlock real-time business opportunities, reveal competitive differentiators, or optimize everyday operations. Legacy management solutions weren’t built for the mobile economy, and simply can’t provide the power required to deliver real-time insight and business value. The patented SevOne Cluster™ architecture solves this fundamental problem, arming the world’s top carriers and enterprises with solutions to harness the power of their digital infrastructure and deliver on the promise of the mobile economy. “We are thrilled to invest in SevOne and help them continue on their rapid growth trajectory,” said Will Muggia, CEO of Westfield Capital Management. “We believe their massively scalable data aggregation platform, which is being used by the world’s largest enterprises and service providers, is highly differentiated and disruptive to the digital infrastructure management market.” Bain Capital Ventures originally invested in SevOne in 2012. The funding fueled the expansion of the company’s alliance network and product ecosystem to support the customer journey to new mobile technologies (4G LTE) and the rapid adoption of virtualization technologies such as software-defined networks (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and software-defined data centers (SDDC). Since that time, SevOne has matured its global leadership position in several key markets, including: 40% of the top technology companies 50% of the top fixed and mobile broadband carriers 60% of the top investment services firms “SevOne’s patented architecture is transforming the way the world’s largest enterprises and service providers are managing their digital infrastructure,” said Ben Nye, Managing Director at Bain Capital Ventures. “The company’s rapid growth is driven by forward-thinking companies needing to collect all the data across their end-to-end digital infrastructure in support of mission-critical services.” SevOne is poised for another year of rapid growth. The company continues to invest in its Delaware roots, constructing a 48,000 square foot, state-of-the-art research and development center on the University of Delaware's Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus in Newark, Delaware. The STAR campus facility opens in October, and will build upon the company’s vision of developing next-generation technologies and pushing the boundaries of digital infrastructure management for SevOne customers. “The opportunities and challenges of managing digital infrastructures have never been greater,” said Jack Sweeney, SevOne CEO. “SevOne is uniquely positioned to capitalize upon this demand, allowing the world’s largest datacenter and network operators to unlock the true business potential of their digital infrastructure.” For more information, please visit www.sevone.com .
