Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Deloitte Australia has moved to strengthen its cyber risk services with the acquisition of Australian identity management specialists Qubit Consulting, in the latest example of the big four accounting firms seeking to muscle in on the tech industry.\nThe deal will see all of Qubit's 22 employees move across to Deloitte, with company founders Andrew Hayes and John Jones becoming Deloitte partners from October 1.\nIt is the latest in a stream of acquisitions by Deloitte, and its accounting rivals, as the firms seek to reposition their offerings for the digital era. Qubit specialises in work related to software from US giant Oracle, and its move into the Deloitte portfolio comes months after it acquired another Oracle specialist Dataweave .\nDeloitte cyber risk services leader, Tommy Viljoen, told The Australian Financial Review that the company's acquisition drive was just picking up pace and would continue for some time as clients were looking for assistance with digitally-led business transformation.\nWide remit \"Acquisitions will be focused on all areas of the digital portfolio, but we have a massive investment happening in the cyber space, including a new cyber intelligence centre, which we are putting millions into,\" Mr Viljoen said.\n\"We just don't see the other large accounting firms as being our rivals these days. We see the broader tech group being the rivals. Our focus has changed as we have moved away from the others.\"\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed, but it was not structured as a straightforward acquisition, rather the employees of Qubit are effectively hired by Deloitte. Qubit was founded in 2005 and booked revenue of $5 million in the most recent financial year, which the founders said was still growing year-on-year.\n Mr Hayes said that he and Mr Jones would not find the shift from running a small tech company to being part of Deloitte too much of a stretch, as both had experienced big company culture in previous roles at Sun Microsystems. The Qubit brand will disappear from use once the transaction completes.\n\"We know how large organisations work, so as long as we focus on our team and make sure we get the basics right, we should be all OK,\" Mr Hayes said.\nMr Jones said Qubit staff were also happy with the deal, and would benefit from the shift to Deloitte.\n\"A number of our team members had already been working with Deloitte on the New South Wales identity hub anyway, so they feel part of that team already,\" he said. \"It provides a whole range of different career prospects for the guys that we can't provide as a smaller organisation really.\"\nGrowing threats Deloitte's head of identity access management Trey Gannon said the emergence of the so-called internet of things, where multiple devices are connected together via the internet, meant the company had acquired Qubit to bolster its offerings to match demand.\n\"One of our global projects that we have going on around identity and access management is providing enhanced identity controls for a car maker. We are beginning to see the world of digital identities increasingly include non-human identity,\" Mr Gannon said.\n\"It is critical that organisations have the right cyber controls and identity access management protocols for devices as well as humans to protect their highly confidential data from hackers or disgruntled employees.\"\nThe Qubit acquisition comes just weeks after Deloitte's rival KPMG announced it was buying Australian Microsoft partner Hands-On Systems .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-09-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:10:32.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
