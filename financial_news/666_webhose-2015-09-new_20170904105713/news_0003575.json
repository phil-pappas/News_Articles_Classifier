The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 1.0 percent at 1,401.07, and MSCI's all-country world stock index rebounded slightly, up 0.04 percent.\nWall Street also rebounded in thin trade ahead of the Fed's policy-setting meeting next week.\n\"The knee-jerk reaction on the Fed lift-off is negative,\" Orlando said. \"We think the Fed lift-off is a positive for the economy and stocks, because it means the Fed is rubber-stamping the fact they truly believe the economy is strong enough.\"\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.58 points, or 0.42 percent, to 16,398.98. he S&P 500 added 3.15 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,955.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 10.35 points, or 0.22 percent, to 4,806.60.\nGoldman Sachs, Wall Street's most influential voice in oil trading, slashed its 2016 forecast for U.S. crude prices to $45 a barrel from $57 previously, and Brent to $49.50 down from $62, citing oversupply and concerns over China's economy.\nGoldman also said while not its base case, crude could fall further to near $20 a barrel.\nU.S. crude futures' front-month contract fell 86 cents at $45.06 a barrel. The front-month in Brent, the global benchmark for oil, slid 33 cents to $48.56.\nU.S. Treasury prices gained as stocks fell and as investors focused on whether the Fed will raise rates for the first time in almost a decade when its policy-makers meet next week.\n\"It's all about whether the Fed indicates that they are going to do some kind of tightening,\" said Tom di Galoma, head of rates and credit trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.\nBenchmark 10-year notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 2.1955 percent.\nGerman 10-year yields, the euro zone benchmark, were down 4 basis points at 0.66 percent on growing doubts that the Fed would raise interest rates next week.\nThe dollar was little changed in thin, listless trading ahead of next week's Fed meeting.\nThe dollar index, a basket of currencies valued against the dollar, fell 0.31 percent to 95.164.\n(Additional reporting by Jamie McGeever ; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T20:35:58.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
