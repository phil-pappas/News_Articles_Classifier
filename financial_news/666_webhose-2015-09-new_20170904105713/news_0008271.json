VLP announced that the board of directors of its general partner has approved its decision to purchase the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business from a Valero Energy Corporation VLO subsidiary. The acquisition will cost the partnership $465 million and is anticipated to close on Oct 1, 2015.\n\nThe aforesaid business comprises two terminals that support the East and West refineries of Valero's Corpus Christi terminal. The assets include 134 tanks with a storage capacity of 10.1 million barrels for crude oil, intermediates and refined petroleum products.\n\nThe acquisition will likely be financed by the partnership with a borrowing of $395 million under a subordinated loan agreement with Valero along with the issuance of additional common units and general partner units to Valero subsidiaries of about $70 million. The newly issued units will be so allocated as to facilitate Valero in maintaining its 2% general partner interest.\n\nPost transaction, the partnership intends to enter a 10-year terminaling agreement with an affiliate of Valero. The business to be purchased is estimated to contribute EBITDA of $50 million in its first full year of operation.\n\nThe terms of the transaction were approved by the general partnerâ€™s board, upon fulfillment of certain definitive documentation, once it received a green signal from its conflicts committee.  \n\nValero Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Alon USA Partners, LP ALDW and ReneSola Ltd SOL. Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
