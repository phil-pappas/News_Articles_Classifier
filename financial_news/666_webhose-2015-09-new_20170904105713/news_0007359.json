Don’t be a sucker; you can definitely save on school expenses by seeking alternative means of studying or obtaining your books. \nPrice Shopping \nColleges are required to provide a list of required course materials prior to registration so that students have time to search for used books, e-books and library books at their leisure. Major retailers like Amazon and BN offer reduced price e-books on e-readers and tablets, or even Smartphones. They are also search friendly for pivotal points and acquiring test information. One of the newest features is that of renting school text books; all you have to do is find a site like DealOz, BigWords, CampusBooks or Eagle Saver and rent a book just for one research assignment, paying less than $20 instead of hundreds. You can also sell books you own for cash or buy used books from another owner for a lesser price. You can also turnover a profit by selling your old school books at the end of the term, when stores start to restock their inventory. \nWhen it comes to buying, renting or even sharing for free with other students, finding someone agreeable to sharing may be the toughest part. This is why many students take part in book-selling or trading fairs that are held at the beginning of the semester. This lets you negotiate terms and prices with your peers, one on one, rather than having to pay retailers’ higher prices. Many students have probably taken the same class ahead of you and may be looking to get rid of old study materials to pay for new expenses. \nIt’s best to remember that not all courses actually require you to buy a textbook for class discussion; some professors may make note of “required textbooks” but only do so because it’s required by the university. They may not even use the book in discussion. Sometimes, professors may even allow you to use free or membership websites that allow students to review and quote from “open-source” e-books, which contain peer-reviewed information. Some subjects that do not really change on a regular basis like math or history, would not require frequent updating and so would be ideal. \nLastly, don’t forget the option to buy an earlier edition of a required textbook, which could be discounted up to 40% or more because of new changes. The new book is more expensive because of updated information, but if you read the basics from the old edition and seek out just the newly updated sections, you can save a bundle. International editions also tend to save money , as they have different covers and tend to be sold to different markets and hence come with lower price tags. \nThere is always someone who needs the information that someone else has finished reading. Spread the knowledge around and “pay it forward” by giving other students good deals on material you are finished with. Think creatively and avoid impulsive decision making, which only seems to involve giving your cash away. Saving money may mean all the difference between falling behind in student debt and keeping your budget on track.
