The conference program is now being developed, sponsors are being recruited and early-bird delegate registration is open.\nPeter Harris, Chairman of The Block Chain Conference, said: “We very much want to hear from industry practitioners with first-hand experience of block chain applications and business leaders with insights into future block chain trends in order to consider them for the educational program.”\nUnlike many other events in the crypto-currency space, The Block Chain Conference has a unique focus on block chain and distributed ledger approaches and their potential to underpin game-changing decentralized business applications across a variety of vertical markets.\nDespite being characterized as a development as important as that of the Internet, information and direction on block chain approaches remains scarce and often is presented in overly technical language and without any business context. Thus, a key mission of The Block Chain Conference is to educate business innovators and technology architects from companies deploying enterprise IT of the potential benefits and challenges of leveraging block chains and distributed ledgers.\nThe early results of research being conducted and soon to be published by Lighthouse Partners, which is producing The Block Chain Conference, indicates that established mainstream IT vendors have little to offer their traditional enterprise customers in terms of products, services and thought leadership regarding block chain deployment.\nAs a result of its research findings, Lighthouse decided that the imperative exists and timing is right for an educational business-oriented conference. San Francisco was chosen as the host city because of the large number of innovative block chain technology companies located in the immediate area.\nThose interested in participating in the conference program should contact Peter Harris, Chairman of The Block Chain Conference, via email at pete(at)lighthouse-partners(doT)com.\nPlease include this information in your events calendar:\nConference Name: The Block Chain Conference\nConference Website: http://www.theblockchainconference.com\nDate: Wednesday, February 10th, 2016\nVenue: Mission Bay Conference Center, UCSF Mission Bay Campus, San Francisco\nWho Should Attend: Senior business innovation and product marketing executives, and senior technologists from companies deploying enterprise IT systems. 18+ only without specific dispensation.\nRegistration Fee: $395 early bird registration open now, $495 from December 1st, 2015.\nConference Producer: Lighthouse Partners, Inc.\nConference Chair: Peter Harris\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12967141.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/09/prweb12967141.htm"], "published": "2015-09-17T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:22:23.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
