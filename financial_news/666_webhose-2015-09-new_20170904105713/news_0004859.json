Those details haven’t been finalized and management may still change, the people said. The group has a portfolio of $1 billion, according to the company’s website .\nThe decision largely completes GE’s withdrawal from the alternative investment field. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has been unwinding its massive lending arm, GE Capital, to better focus on manufacturing. It agreed to sell most of its real estate portfolio to Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo & Co. for $23 billion in April and in June the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought its U.S. direct-lending business for $12 billion.\nArdian, which has $50 billion in assets under management, has acquired GE assets before. In March last year, the firm bought 350 stakes in buyout funds of U.S. market managers for about $1 billion.\nSpokesmen for GE and Evercore declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Paris-based Ardian didn’t respond to e-mail requests seeking comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.geequity.com/our-team\\", "http://www.geequity.com/GECA_Document/GE_Capital_Equity_FactSheet_Web.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-09-24T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:55:52.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
