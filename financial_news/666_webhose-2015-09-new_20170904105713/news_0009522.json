Meanwhile, those surveyed said they pay more attention to 401(k) investment fees (64%) than ATM fees (60%), airline baggage fees (50%) or gym sign-up fees (49%). \nHowever, those findings don't always mean that workers know what they're doing with their 401(k). Nearly half (47%) say that materials explaining their 401(k) plan investments are more confusing than materials explaining their health and medical benefits. That isn't helpful when roughly three in ten workers (29%) have either decreased or not made any changes to their 401(k) savings rate in the last two years as 25% have taken a loan from their 401(k) to pay for their home or to cover everyday bills.
