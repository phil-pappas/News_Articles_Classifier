This move recognizes CCE’s long-term investment in and commitment to sustainability. \nThe DJSI, reviewed annually by the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee and RobecoSAM, is a global index which tracks the financial performance of leading sustainability-driven companies. It is based on an analysis of financially material economic, environmental and social factors. Companies are only listed in the annual ranking if they are best in class within their industry for sustainability. \nIn total, 3,000 companies were evaluated for inclusion in the index, with just 3 beverage companies being successful in being named to the DJSI World Index. Coca-Cola Enterprises’ inclusion is due to its success integrating sustainability into its core decision-making, and delivering sound long-term plans for sustainable development. \nJohn F. Brock, Chairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said: “This listing is the result of placing sustainability at the heart of our business. We consider the sustainability impacts of every decision we make and work hard to take a leadership position in the soft drinks industry. We’ve set ambitious goals and will continue to push ourselves to reach our 2020 targets. The insight gained from DJSI’s analysis of CCE will prove invaluable, helping us to better understand the business value of our sustainability initiatives.” \nThe recognition of CCE by the DJSI follows the company’s release of revised sustainability commitments in June as part of its 10 th Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report. \nJoe Franses, Director, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability, Coca-Cola Enterprises, comments: “When we launched our Sustainability Plan in 2011, we set targets that would really stretch us and we’re proud our performance so far has been recognized in the 2015 DJSI. We’ve passed some major milestones, including a 29 percent reduction in our operational carbon footprint and a 17 percent reduction in our water usage, and believe this is a result of close collaboration with our stakeholders and supply chain.” \nFor additional information on the DJSI, please visit: http://www.sustainability-indices.com/ . – ENDS – \nNotes to Editor \nAbout CCE \nCoca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. is the leading Western European marketer, producer, and distributor of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and one of the world’s largest independent Coca-Cola bottlers.
