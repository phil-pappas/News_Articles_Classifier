Teamwork is invariably one of them. So is honesty. You're also likely to find innovation, optimism, passion and courage. But how much value is there, really, in corporate values?\nWhen Enron went bust, it had respect and excellence as two of its values. Oh, and integrity, too. Seriously, integrity. When One.Tel went under, its values included 'make it better' and 'create value in everything you do'. Fat lot of good that did. And when Lehman Brothers collapsed, it was espousing 'ethical business practices' and 'a clear understanding of right and wrong'. That turned out well, didn't it?\nOne reason for this incongruence between an organisation's stated values and its employees' evident behaviour can be attributed to the difficulty in dictating to someone not just what they should be but who they should be.\nAn example of this could be seen in an organisation I once worked for, which introduced a new set of values without consulting any staff members. One of those values was entrepreneurship. On the face of it, that aspiration is fair enough. Except the value was in conflict with the natural disposition of most of the workforce. Those who didn't embrace risk-taking, creativity and boldness – all of which are embodiments of entrepreneurship – were suddenly outcast, rendered incompatible with the organisation for which they'd been working.\nAdvertisement What should have been an exercise in uniting a group of people and creating a more robust culture instead became something quite toxic. And ineffective.\nMy former employer isn't the only one. In a recent study published in the Journal of Financial Economics a few weeks ago, researchers sought to discover whether the declaration of an organisation's values has any impact on its performance. Five hundred businesses were studied. In regards to short-term performance, the scholars found zero correlation. So what about long-term performance? Well, similarly, there was no correlation.\nTo determine performance, the researchers analysed two main variables. The first was profitability. The second was the number of class-action lawsuits brought against the company. And yet on neither of these measures was it even remotely apparent the pronouncement of values gave the organisation any advantage over its competitors. Only on one metric – customer satisfaction – was there evidence to indicate values made a difference but, even then, not enough of a difference to constitute any boost to the bottom line.\nAs the professors note: \"Advertised values do not seem to be very important, possibly because it is easy to claim them, so everybody does.\"\nWhat they're saying is that it's effortless for any organisation to come up with a set of values they think are essential, but promoting those values and actually living them day-to-day are two very different things.\nOne area where they might carry some weight is during the recruitment process. When candidates are browsing a potential employer's website to determine whether it's worth working there, they might be swayed to apply by what the organisation is displaying as its core values. The challenge, though, is that if the reality ends up contradicting the rhetoric, it's almost certain these new employees will be resigning as soon as they find a quick way out.\nSo values might be a great revenue stream for the management consulting industry. They're perfect, too, for cliché-ridden business books. They even give you something nice to hang on an otherwise bare wall. But you're ultimately better off identifying the values that already exist within your organisation and then concentrating instead on how to leverage the best of what you already have.\nIt's hard to disagree with the academics who ran the aforementioned study: \"Many of these advertised values are simply cheap talk.\"\nWhat do you think? Are corporate values meaningless?\nTwitter: @jamesadonis", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jamesadonis"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:46:21.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
