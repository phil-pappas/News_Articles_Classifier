For the time being, the carmaker has displayed the car in North America in its US-specific trim and the sale will take place somewhere at the end of the year. The NextGen Honda Civic has been built on a brand new platform and gets a fastback styling to lure customers. Moreover, the vehicle will be offered in various body designs including sedan, hatchback, coupe and two high-performance first-ever Civic Type-R models.\nAs far as Indian launch is concerned, the company will probably bring the car into the country in near future because as of now, Honda India is still planning to re-launch Civic in the country. Furthermore, 9th generation Civic is still at carmaker’s Tapukara plant in Rajasthan. So, if it gets a timely approval to roll out, we may soon get to welcome the 10th generation Civic too, most probably next year. The sedan will slot in between Honda City and Honda Accord in the Indian market.\nThe newly designed 2015 Civic line-up of cars are nearly 2 inches wider than the older ones and 1.2 inches longer between the wheels, but are still 68 pounds lighter. This results in a spacious cabin inside and a more nimble appearance outside. As per the company officials, the updated models will have new power mills with newer transmission along with suspensions that would make the next generation Civic vehicles more proficient and fun to ride on.\nShedding more light on the engine specs, globally the car will get its power from a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder motor and a direct-injected and turbocharged inline-4 1.5-liter i-VTEC motor. In terms of transmission, the engines have been coupled with an option of continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) or a 6-speed manual gearbox. However, the 1.5-litre i-VTEC motor will only be available with a differentiated CVT.\nMoving to the designs, the newly showcased Civic sedan can be easily differentiated from its predecessors more because of it’s new fastback rear profile. (CarDekho)\nMoving to the designs, the newly showcased Civic sedan can be easily differentiated from its predecessors more because of it’s new fastback rear profile. In addition to this, a muscular front overhang with a longer and insistently moulded hood add to the flamboyancy of the car. Add on to this are LED headlights and daytime running LEDs with C-shaped tail lamps making the appearance of the vehicle quite pleasurable to eyes.\nInside the cabin too, updates can be seen in the form of new 7-inch HD touchscreen infotainment unit that has been made compatible to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nOther specifications like chassis has been designed using exhaustive use of ultra-high strength steel, so this has made possible to enhance the torsional rigidity of the car nearly by 25 percent. Moreover, the company also claims to have reduced 58 percent cabin air leaks reduction in new generation vehicle. This would mean that there would be lower NVHs.\nGoing by launch details, sedan Civic will first go on sale followed by a sleek coupe in early 2016. After this, the hatchback and Si and Type-R high-performance versions will make their way to the US markets.\n 21, 2015 7:18 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.cardekho.com/carmodels/Honda/Honda_City"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:18:06.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
