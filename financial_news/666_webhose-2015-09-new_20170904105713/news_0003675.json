Photo: John Shakespeare\nWhile the size of Rupert Murdoch 's pay packet was getting everyone's attention on Wednesday - 21st Century Fox revealed that his remuneration dropped slightly to $US27.9 million ($39.8 million) last year - people might have missed a more seismic development at the media giant.\nHe has opened the boardroom doors at Fox to an activist investor with giant killing credentials.\nValue Act founder, Jeffrey Ubbens , was appointed as a 21st Century Fox director this week after signing what is effectively a non-aggression pact with the company.\nHe has agreed not to take any hostile action against the entertainment giant -- at least not before its shareholder meeting late next year.\nAdvertisement And Murdoch is officially welcoming him with open arms.\n\"Our board and senior management team have developed a highly-valued relationship with Jeff and we are pleased he has accepted the board's invitation to stand for election,\" said Rupert and his co-executive chairman, Lachlan Murdoch , in the official press release.\nBut the press release does not include the incredibly detailed non-aggression pact with Ubbens to ensure he does not go rogue on Murdoch and use his 5.6 per cent voting stake to undermine the board, or, executives of the company.\nThis includes making \"any statement or announcement that constitutes an attack on or otherwise disparages the company ... or any of the company's past, present or future officers or directors appointed during the term of the nomination agreement.\"\nThe peacekeeping fine print is important, as Murdoch knows just how much trouble can be caused by activist investors.\nThe family nearly lost its grip on its media empire last year when rebel investors led a revolt that came close to unstitching the two-class share structure, which ensures the Murdochs control the company despite owning just 12 per cent of the stock.\nYet for now, from Murdoch's print media flagship, News Corp's Wall Street Journal , we just get the news on how friendly Ubbens is with the Murdochs.\nThis includes being invited by the Murdochs last week to meet with Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi .\nMissing from the account is the story of how Value Act quietly agitated for change at Microsoft, getting a boardroom appointment and helping to remove its legendary CEO, Steve Ballmer .\nAll without a single word of disparagement.\nUbbens once said how a boardroom appointment has two benefits.\n\"You can be an incredibly huge resource,\" he said. \"And you can better also challenge the CEO since you have that much information.\"\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:54:37.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
