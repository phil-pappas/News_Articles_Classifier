In addition, we have received a priming grant from the Dublin LEO and, earlier this year we received CSF funding from Enterprise Ireland which has given us a great boost. We are currently in the process of looking for outside investment.” \nFuture plans? “Ireland is a great place for start-ups but our future plans are to really focus on exporting. We are on the Tesco Tastebud National programme where they nurture promising products and the next step is Tastebud Export, so that will be very beneficial to our export plans as the UK alone has a market more than 10 times the size of Ireland.
