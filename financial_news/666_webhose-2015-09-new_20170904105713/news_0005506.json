Bloomberg Share on twitter by Michael Smith It wasn't great timing for Australian investors. A sell-off in global sharemarkets arrived at the tail-end of one of the most lacklustre corporate earnings seasons in years, fuelling the pessimism in the local market. But investors should not panic yet.\nJitters around China's growth prospects had a bigger impact on company valuations than the results themselves and there were few bombshells in the full-year numbers. However, the results have confirmed that growth is going to be increasingly hard to find for listed companies in almost every sector. Momentum is slowing and the faltering growth of recent years is not just confined to the resources sector.\nThe challenge for investors will be finding those gems that still have double-digit profit growth potential. The other options are taking a punt on those oversold during the sell-off at the end of August or play it safe with the stable dividend payers. There is however no low-hanging fruit. Most companies have already taken the knife to costs and fixed their balance sheets in the years immediately following the credit crisis. This has been overtaken by the focus on dividends, which has come at the expense of growth. In short, profit momentum is slowing but it isn't going backwards either. Citi's equities strategist Tony Brennan says consensus forecasts envisage 4 per cent earnings per share (EPS) growth moving into 2016 compared with 8 per cent growth at this point in the last few years. \"The earnings growth beyond resources is now looking more mixed, and may mean weaker market earnings growth in financial year 2016 than for a number of years,\" Brennan says, noting EPS growth for the market ex-resources at this time of the year is usually 6 to 8 per cent compared with 4 per cent this time round.\nCiti notes that Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Woolworths, Suncorp and Insurance Australia Group reported slower earnings for the year. The slowing economy also impacted CSL, Amcor and Brambles although their exposure to US dollar earnings offshore will be boosted by the weaker Australian currency.\nThere were exceptions of course. Macquarie Group continued to under promise and over deliver with a result that puts it on course for pre-GFC earnings levels. Insurers QBE and AMP also did well, while Qantas's earnings are nearing the $1 billion mark after staging a dramatic turnaround thanks to lower fuel prices, depreciation charges, and improved market conditions.\nNervousness The extreme volatility in global markets have had a far bigger impact on share prices than the actual numbers themselves, although extreme market reactions to disappointing results highlights the nervousness amongst investors. Ansell shares fell almost 16 per cent after warning volatile exchange rates could hurt revenues this year. But the market rout means many companies look cheap and fund managers say the banks, which have lost around a quarter of their peak value, are good buys. Multibillion dollar capital raisings by the banks overshadowed earnings growth.\nThe other challenge for companies though is the economy. There is little doubt Australia's economy is slowing. Reduced mining and construction activity resulted in June quarter gross domestic product growth of just 0.2 per cent compared to expectations of 0.4 per cent. This means companies will find it tougher to generate revenue growth going forward. Productivity gains are needed to generate growth but there are no signs that is about to happen either.\n Resources earnings have been hammered by falling commodity prices and miners are winding back capital investment, with a trickle on effect to anyone exposed to the industry. Competition is intensifying elsewhere, particularly in consumer-facing businesses such as supermarkets, telecoms and insurance, but airlines and food and beverage companies reported strong results despite the impact of low wages growth on consumer sentiment.\nOne of the underlying themes from earnings season was that many companies fell within market expectations for the 2015 financial year but the outlook was disappointing. Analysts are worried that slow revenue growth means it will be harder to sustain margins. Big misses are unusual given the regulatory obligations to tell the market if you are going to fall well short of consensus market forecasts. Providing guidance a year out is tougher but many companies are either withholding guidance or tipping lower-than-expected growth. One example is Boral. The construction company's shares fell on the day it announced its best result in seven years. Chief executive Mike Kane wasn't impressed but investors said this was because of the disappointing outlook statement, which tipped flat earnings in its core construction division (for more on this see Mastermind p12). Deutsche Bank analysts have cut earnings estimates for the 2016 financial year for two-thirds of the companies that reported which is well above average. It downgraded forward earnings by 2 per cent but says this falls to zero once you throw in the dilution from share issuances. There are many lessons for next year. Debt is dangerous, companies subject to adverse regulatory changes are in danger of earnings misses, industrials who take their eye off the consumer are in trouble, and there is only room in the mining sector for the big boys.\nUpside surprises Wesfarmers was one of the outstanding performers during earnings season. Chief executive Richard Goyder has demonstrated the benefits of heavy capital investment and it continues to deliver strong retail profit growth. Woolworths by contrast is in trouble, not helped by a leadership vacuum as its chief executive and chairman step down. Wesfarmers' posted an 8.3 per cent lift in underlying net profit to $2.4 billion after Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks posted double-digit profit growth, while Target showed signs of recovery.\nMedibank Private was the big upside surprise of the earnings season. Australia's largest private health insurer had been a bit of a let-down since its hyped market debut and investors were becoming increasingly nervous about the impact of competition on its margins. But Medibank beat prospectus forecasts with a $285 million profit, sending its shares 16 per cent higher on the day.\nDuds You know an earnings result is bad when the chief executive goes at the same time. This is what happened to Santos when the company announced boss David Knox was leaving after seven years. This followed a 82 per cent fall in first-half profit due to falling oil prices. High debt levels mean the company has no room to move and a strategic review is underway to look at its options.\nBHP Billiton is struggling to convince the market that it is sacrificing growth in favour of maintaining a strong dividend payout ratio. Views are mixed on whether the mining giant's approach to shareholder returns is the right approach after it posted its lowest profit in more than a decade. Given the miner's dividend yield is now better than the banks, it is a good example of the market's ongoing focus on shareholder returns even in the face of slowing earnings growth.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-09T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:25:02.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
