Empire’s new program focuses on those companies who operate on or around water with both clean and high mods which need to comply with maritime Workers Compensation regulations, from vessel in navigation, Jones Act regulations to recreational or service workers. Accommodating a wide range of classes including fisherman and tour services, boat service and repair contractors, marina operations, bridge painters and builders, offshore oil and many more, Empire Underwriters’ new program provides coverage with options like first dollar coverage, loss sensitive rating plans, high deductible options and monthly payroll reporting.\n“We are excited with the expansion of our Workers Comp offering. For years our producers have been telling us about the lack of viable options when it came to finding Workers Comp coverage for their Marine based clients. Our agent partners nationwide, from New York to California are telling us they need solutions, capacity and speed,” said Robert Linero, CEO of Empire Underwriters. “We wanted to pass the power of nationally recognized A Rated Carriers along to our producers and their clients.”\n“Empire is aggressively appointing new producers to market our growing lineup of solutions. We are looking for producers in every state, which are looking to expand their offerings and accommodate their already growing book of business. Empire Underwriters is growing at an exponential rate with the mission to add value and service to our offerings so our partners can grow with us,” noted Rusty Ellis, Vice President of Property and Casualty at Empire Underwriters.\nAbout Empire Underwriters:\nEmpire Underwriters is a National Insurance Wholesaler, Excess and Surplus line facility and Program Manager serving Producers in 46 states.
