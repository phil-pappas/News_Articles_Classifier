New York's stands at $8.75. \nMeanwhile, several cities from Seattle to San Francisco have a $15 minimum wage, and US President Barack Obama has recommended a federal minimum wage of $12 per hour. \nUnder Cuomo's plan, wage increases would be implemented gradually, taking effect in New York City by 2018, and elsewhere in the state by 2021.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:16:07.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
