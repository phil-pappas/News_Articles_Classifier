Karl Hilzinger by Joyce Moullakis Edmund Tadros A lower Australian currency, favourable financing costs, and limited organic growth options make conditions conducive for an increase in mergers and acquisitions in fiscal 2016, including mega-deals, law firm Herbert Smith Freehills says.\nIn the seventh edition of its Australian Public M&A Report, the law firm suggested that higher levels of activity in the later half of fiscal 2015 were continuing, making conditions \"appear ripe\" for deal making. The report, which focuses on the listed market, will be sent to clients later this week.\n\"The tide may have turned and boards have more confidence,\" Paul Branston, a Freehills partner and co-author of the report, said. He expects a stronger fiscal 2016 for mergers and acquisitions, as interest rates remain low, foreign acquirers benefit from lower prices in the listed market and a depreciation in the Australian dollar, and Australian companies seek expansion through acquisition. \"There can be a bit of momentum and confidence as a result of larger deals ... people are prepared to press the button.\"\nThe busy September period for Australian mergers and acquisitions continued on Monday, as phone and internet companies M2 Group and Vocus Communications announced plans for a $3 billion merger . That followed other bids in September, including Woodside Petroleum's $11.6 billion tilt for Oil Search, and US rival Equifax's offer for Sydney-based Veda .\nMr Branston also pointed to more activity stemming from a \"re-alignment of vendor expectations\" with what acquirers were prepared to pay. He noted, however, that financial market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in markets like China, continued to pose a risk to activity levels.\nIn September 2014, the Freehills report predicted a busy fiscal 2015 in the listed market, which didn't eventuate. The report put total deal value at $28 billion in the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, down from $43 billion in the year earlier but more than double the $12 billion in fiscal 2013.\nJust two bidding wars There were seven deals of more than $1 billion, or mega-deals, announced in fiscal 2015, including Federation Centre's marriage to Novion Property Group and Japan Post's acquisition of Toll Holdings . The report also noted there were just two bidding wars for listed targets over the period.\n Seventy per cent of public deals were successful in fiscal 2015, compared to a 60 per cent success rate in the year earlier. Cash continued to be favoured for acquisitions and was a component of the consideration offered in 73 per cent of transactions.\n\"A bidder offering exclusively cash consideration was likely to be successful three out of four times â€“ a noticeably higher success rate for cash-only transactions compared to the fiscal 2012-14 period,\" the report said. Bids offering a premium of 20 per cent to 40 per cent were most popular last fiscal year, while scheme of arrangements accounted for 45 per cent of listed transactions, compared to 55 per cent for takeovers. Foreign bidders were particularly targeting the energy and resources sectors in the 2015 fiscal year.\nBut much has been said in 2015 about Australian deal activity lagging a global surge in transaction volume. Mega-deals such as the $US245 billion ($348 billion) proposed tie-up between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller have captured investor attention.\nIntralinks global chief executive Ron Hovsepian said internationally the environment for deal making remained robust in the middle market, despite a slowdown in some geographies, while larger companies were very active.\n\"If you're a global or multinational company now is the time to go out and look [for mergers and acquisitions],\" Mr Hovsepian told Fairfax Media. \"There are going to be more big strategic deals.\"\nIntralinks is a technology and dataroom company, with insights into the pipeline for mergers and acquisitions.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/merger_deals_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/toll-becomes-part-of-japan-post-as-investors-accept-65b-takeover-20150513-gh0e1m.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:03:28.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
