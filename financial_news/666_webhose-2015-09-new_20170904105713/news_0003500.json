Andrew Meares In fact, that slightly understated the problem is because Newspoll is just one of several published opinion polls. Pollster John Stirton says that the Abbott government has trailed the ALP in the two-party preferred vote in 180 various opinion polls, once the Galaxy, Essential and Ipsos polls are included.\nBy contrast, Kevin Rudd's government had only fallen behind for one opinion poll when he was shafted by the ALP in his first term.\nWhile Mr Turnbull talked about the \"trajectory\", in fact, the polls are not really bouncing around. For the last three months, Newspoll has been unchanged with Labor taking 54 per cent and the Coalition 46 per cent.\nThe last time the Coalition led in any poll was April 2014. But its ratings collapsed after the May 2014 budget when the government announced a host of spending cuts and was accused of breaking its election promises. After the May budget the Abbott government's share of the vote fell to 44 per cent in the Fairfax poll.\n They recovered slightly before falling to 46 per cent just after Mr Abbott named Prince Phillip as an Australian knight and he faced a spill motion in the Coalition party room.\nThe Coalition's ratings improved slightly after this year's budget in which Mr Abbott announced that the \"budget emergency\" that he had used to justify the 2014 budget had been largely solved and he would drop several of his unpopular spending cuts. But ratings have now fallen back close to the lows seen in February.\nMr Stirton says that polls asking which Liberal is the preferred leader suggest that Mr Turnbull could help reverse this trend. Mr Turnbull has scored almost double Mr Abbott as preferred leader even during Mr Abbott's honeymoon period after the last Federal election. Mr Turnbull now rates over 40 per cent as preferred prime minister compared to under 20 per cent for the prime minister.\nThe only caveat is that Mr Abbott has been more popular among Coalition voters than Mr Turnbull at least since he replaced Mr Turnbull as Liberal Party leader in 2009.\n\"The main problem will be appealing to the conservative base,\" Mr Stirton said. \"But the other aspect of that is that the base have nowhere else to go.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:09:52.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
