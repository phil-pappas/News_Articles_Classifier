The ringgit was largely unmoved.\nThe severity of the ringgit's depreciation prompted Najib to form an economic task force, including some of the country's top financiers, to find ways to restore confidence.\n\"The ringgit's decline is not expected to have adverse impact on government debt as 97 percent of the debt is denominated in ringgit and mostly funded by domestic sources,\" Najib said.\nThe Prime Minister's failure to explain how 1MDB racked up $11 billion debt, or who deposited over $600 million in a bank account held in his name, or why has led to mounting public unease over his leadership.\nThe prime minister has denied wrongdoing.\nHe said on Monday that the rationalisation plan for 1MDB is on track. He also reiterated that there were no plans to introduce capital controls, adding that the government was on track to achieve fiscal consolidation target for 2015.
