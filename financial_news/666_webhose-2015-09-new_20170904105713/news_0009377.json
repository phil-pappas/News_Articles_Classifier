Consequently, the (Fed) is less likely to raise rates in September and more likely to begin tightening later this year.\" \nSome analysts said the Wall Street selloff was magnified by the Chinese market close and the long Labor Day holiday weekend in the United States, where markets will remain shuttered on Monday. \n\"We have a three-day weekend here in the US, China will open again on Monday and it has been closed the last two days... So no one wants to be a hero while standing at the barbecue on Sunday night, worried about if Shanghai will be up or down six percent,\" said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management. \n\"I would expect next week to be less volatile than this week,\" said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so, he reminded, \"markets are looking at the global situation, and taking into account China and market volatility. Any information that is worrying out of China could push markets lower.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T05:07:50.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
