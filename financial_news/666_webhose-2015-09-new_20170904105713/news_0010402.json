Then it was replicated in Western Railways between Churchgate and Dahanu section.\nDeveloped by the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) “utsonmobile” – the paperless unreserved ticketing feature in mobile application aims to eliminate the need for printing of unreserved tickets.\nPrabhu said railways will sign an agreement with ISRO for using geospatial technology and satellite images in the rail sector.\nAs per plan, railways will use remote-sensing technology at unmanned level crossings to warn road users and also for other usage such as mapping of stations and rail routes in partnership with ISRO.\nHe said cash/smart card operated ticket-vending machine (CoTVM) which was made operational at the New Delhi station will be installed at other stations also.\nCoTVM is an unmanned self-operated kiosk which can be used by passengers themselves to buy unreserved tickets through currency/coins as well as smart cards. These kiosks have easy graphical interface for ticket transaction so that the user can operate these machines.\nThe kiosk accepts currency/coin of all denominations of Rs 5 and above. The machine does not accept soiled/cut/glued/taped/colored notes and accepts currency notes of Gandhi series.\nCoTVMs aims to reduce queue length at existing ticket counters by providing an alternate unmanned ticketing solution and mode of payment.\nPrabhu said both passenger and freight business are important for railways and the ‘Parichaalan’ mobile app for freight operators will help in real-time decision-making.\n‘Parichaalan’, a user-friendly app, represents data in a pictorial and graphical manner that is easily comprehensible and also makes the information dynamic and current in nature in the freight sector.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 9:15 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:32:08.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
