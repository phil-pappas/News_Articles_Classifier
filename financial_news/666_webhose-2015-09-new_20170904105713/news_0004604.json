In the rollover, T-bill holders - mostly Greek banks - renew their positions instead of getting paid on the maturing paper they hold.\nThe sale's bid-to-cover ratio was 1.30, unchanged from the last sale. The amount raised included 300 million euros in non-competitive bids.\nSettlement will be on Sept. 18, the same day that 1.6 billion euros of six-month bills mature.
