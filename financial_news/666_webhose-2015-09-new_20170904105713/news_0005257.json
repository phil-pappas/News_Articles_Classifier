And brought in many tourists who come to her summer school. Foto Breccola by Anne Maria Nicholson \"One bullet hole, two and a third.\" Cheryl Porter traces her index finger over the punctured leather cover of an ancient book, propped on a table in the library of an historic Italian seminary.\n\"This book was used for target practice after Napoleon invaded Italy. Someone made these holes by firing a musket into it.\" Cheryl says.\nShe opens the book with a reverent air, honed by her 30-year journey from Perth schoolteacher to world authority on old manuscripts, and gently turns pages splattered by the bullets.\n\"There was a lot of destruction in that period,\" she says of the seminary library that rests inside the medieval walls of Montefiascone, a beautiful grey stone hilltop village 100 kilometres north of Rome. \"But we've stopped the rot.\"\nThis ancient book was used for target practice at the time of Napoleon's invasion of Italy. The bullet damage caused by their muskets is now being repaired by the Montefiascone Conservation Project. Foto Breccola The musket-shattered book may be a curiosity among the 5000 theological, philosophical and scientific tomes that withstood Napoleon's war at the end of the 1700s, bombings during World War II and the ravages of time. But it's been a magnet for Cheryl and hundreds of book lovers who have streamed to the summer school she started 25 years ago as a way of funding a rescue mission that has also unexpectedly spiked the town's struggling economy.\n\"We're archaeologists of the book\", she says, \"Because this one was blown apart, we can see exactly how it was made. So like all the books here, we cleaned it up but we decided to leave it damaged.\"\nWater hits precious pages She takes a shoebox off a shelf inside one of the rooms that currently serves as a makeshift library while the original one awaits structural repair.\nThe town of Montefiascone. \"Look at this! Fred, Flora and Fiona!\"\nThree mummified rats lie forlornly on a pile of tissue paper inside the box.\n\"We found these on the book shelves when we first started cleaning the library.\"\nRats, birds' nests, insects and, worst of all, evidence of water damage, confronted the small group of people who rediscovered the library in the 1980s after it had been closed for nearly a century.\nCheryl Porter works as a freelance Collections Care Consultant. She is the director of the Montefiascone Library Conservation Project in Italy. Foto Breccola Showers in a bathroom built for the seminarians above had leaked through the ceiling for decades, the water seeping into the precious pages.\nThat early vanguard included a West Australian friend of Cheryl Porter, Anthea Bulloch, who has called Montefiascone home for more than 40 years, and local businessman and historian Giancarlo Breccola.\nAlarmed by the decay and potential loss of the treasure trove, they asked Cheryl, who was studying book conservation in London, what could be done.\nInterrupted reverie Martin Fordham in the town of Montefiascone. Supplied \"One of the bottom shelves was full of black slime,\" she recalled. \"You couldn't recognise that they were books and many were lost.\"\nThe sight would have deeply distressed Cardinal Marcantonio Barbarigo who founded the seminary in the 1600s. The son of wealthy Venetians, he rose to be a Vatican favourite.\n\"He was a visionary and brought in all kinds of books,\" Cheryl says. She points to a shelf of leather-bound tomes as though they are a lineup of handsome Latin lovers rather than old books.\n\"That's the white library, made of vellum with Italian bindings. The southern European books used to be regarded as second rate to the gold-embossed dark leather German books. But they're sexy, aren't they?\"\nHer reverie is interrupted by the sound of singing coming from elsewhere in the seminary.\nA minor religious revolution When Cheryl first visited here from London where she was raising her family, she was in her late 30s and vocations at the seminary had dwindled to nothing.\n\"We had the place to ourselves over the summer,\" she said.\nNow at the song-inspiring age of 64, she is observing a minor religious revolution. A new generation of seminarians has moved in and some are singing in a mass in an adjacent chapel. The numbers are still far short of the golden era when 130 young men trained here.\nYet an Argentinian-based order, the Religious Family of the Incarnate Word, has recruited more than 70 trainees.\nPorter smiles a greeting to one she knows. Dominic Clovis, 25, and two of his six brothers are studying here for the priesthood, the new face of the modern Catholic Church on which the survival of the books may well have to rely.\nWitnesses to 700 years It's another sweltering day in one of the hottest summers people in these parts can remember. The humidity hangs heavily in the air around the books and piles of loose manuscripts, silent witnesses of 700 years of religious education and political tumult that persist to this day.\nCheryl gathered a team of international experts to ensure their survival, among them Nicolas Barker, the head of conservation at the British Library. In 1987 she persuaded him to travel to Italy where he was instantly converted to the cause of saving the unique collection.\nHis influence attracted many others to the extent that today, Montefiascone is on the map world-wide among conservators. The summer school provides the rare opportunity to handle ancient books and to recreate everything from mediaeval parchment poetry books to an early Islamic Koran.\nIt's also become a hub for developing new techniques.\n\"We started with lots of hands and knees work, taking every book off the shelf and cleaning it. Volunteers came from everywhere and then paying students so we had money.\nVacuum packing a library \"Now we can test out new equipment and new ideas of conservation,\" she says.\nVacuum packing books was developed here five years ago.\n\"It's simple and cheap and halts any further damage to the books. Nothing can live in it so it kills the insects and mould. The system's now being used in other libraries.\"\nCheryl Porter cuts a svelte figure as she guides me up steep stone staircases to a grand room at the top of the seminary where the summer school is in session.\nA dozen students from eight countries are taking part in Chicago preservation expert Scott Devine's book binding course. A rooster crows loudly, competing with his lecture and reminding everyone in the steaming hot room, they are in the middle of rural Italy. The mercury outside has hit the high 30s but inside, the students still manage to withstand 10-hour days, each paying nearly $1000 for a week's training, as they apply the secrets of an ancient craft to creating their own old-style books from new materials.\nIn a corner of the room, Cheryl has the equipment for the classes she teaches on replicating colours used in European medieval and Islamic manuscripts.\nA home in Montefiascone \"These are cochineal from the Mediterranean,\" she says, emptying a small plastic bag onto a table, of tiny insects famous for yielding a scarlet dye. She shows me a pot of colour extracted from the insects and how it matches the red of the manuscripts contained in the seminary.\n\"I teach the students how to make these colours from the original recipes.\"\nMany students and teachers return year after year, addicted to the \"Monte\" experience and bringing much needed money into the community. Some, like Nicolas Barker and another Australian, Perth archivist Martin Fordham, have been so seduced by Montefiascone that they have bought homes there.\n\"The Monte experience is like no other. It's the way of life and the beautiful people and surroundings,\" says Martin Fordham.\nNew life blood for old town He discovered the summer course while working in London in 1997, enrolled for book binding and volunteered to help with cleaning the books.\n\"I turned up and met Chezza [Porter's nickname]. At first I was the only bloke here with 13 women. We were sleeping in dormitories in the seminary at night and slaving in the library in the day.\"\nFordham and his wife Anna have since become annual visitors, staying in an apartment they bought on the edge of town. They spend a considerable amount of money, as do their Australian friends who join them for holidays.\nThe cash injection is a life blood for the town because, with the economy in disarray, Italians are doing it tough. Yet for one month every year, the locals know they can rely on revenue brought in by more than a hundred visitors associated with the summer school who pile into hotels and apartments.\nGiancarlo Breccola, who runs an optical store, sees the benefits of their spending on accommodation, restaurants and prized Italian clothing and shoes. All because of the rare books which were almost lost.\nThe 70-year-old town's go-to historian is grateful to Porter and the others who, along with himself rescued the books. But he explains to me in Italian that, with the death of the old priests who initially supported the project, the future of the library is uncertain.\nHe believes the new generation of priests passing through the seminary have no cultural attachment.\nCheryl Porter shares his concern. The biggest challenge is reopening the original library, a long room with vaulted ceiling and remnants of mediaeval paintings. Although fund-raising and fees from the school paid for much restoration, it is now sealed shut. Structural damage has rendered it unsafe and there's no commitment by the seminary to fix it.\n\"We're not sure about our future,\" she says. \"But we're crossing our fingers we can stay here, the books can remain and the library will reopen.\"\nThe Montefiascone Conservation Project has a website and its own Facebook page.\nAnne Maria Nicholson is a Sydney-based journalist and novelist.\nof", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Montefiascone-Conservation-Project-141672325861479/timeline/", "http://monteproject.co.uk/en/"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:10:21.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
