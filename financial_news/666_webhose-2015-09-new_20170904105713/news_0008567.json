Indeed, all eyes are on how quickly US production falls.” \nThe report said that the number of oil drilling rigs in the US declined in the week ending September 4, down by 13 units to 662 rigs. The overall rig count in the US - which is seen as a key barometer for the industry - is now down 864 units year-on-year. \nA 50pc slump in the price of oil to levels well below $50 per barrel is putting pressure on higher cost producers outside Opec - which pumps about a third of the world's crude - in spiralling a price war. Opec has continued to pump over its target ceiling of 30 million bpd in a bid to seize back market share from the threat in sees from the rapid growth in US oil output. \nHowever, the strategy has also caused bitter divisions within the cartel, with members such as Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran supporting the idea of an emergency meeting to discuss revising current strategy. \nMost Opec countries depend almost entirely on oil receipts for the majority of their foreign currency earnings. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) the richest and most steadfast members, such as Saudi Arabia, are being forced to revise their budgets and cut spending to adapt to lower prices, which investment banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) now say could fall to as low as $20 per barrel. \nThe pain is being felt most accutely by higher cost producers in the developed world, such as the North Sea, where thousands of jobs have been lost since last November. \nOpec said: \"In the current oil price environment, the UK Continental Shelf remains an unattractive area for investment given steep decline rates, high de-commissioning costs and an unfavourable fiscal regime.\" \nThis is not the first time that Opec has fought a price war with its rivals. In the 1980s the cartel sparred with the emerging North Sea, which was then seen as one of the biggest rivals to its unchecked dominance of global oil markets. \nOn the demand side, Opec warned that growth would slow next year. The group now expects world oil demand to rise by 1.29 million bpd after a downward revision of around 500,000 bpd amid weaker prospects for the global economy and China. \nThe uncertainty surrounding oil supply policies and the general weakness in demand growth has also led to higher levels of volatility in energy markets. \nCommerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) said: “Oil prices remain extremely prone to fluctuation. After surging by nearly 30pc at the end of August, they have already shed half of their gains again since the beginning of September.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:06:17.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
