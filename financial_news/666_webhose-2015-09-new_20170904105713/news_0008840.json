Is she correct? \nNo, she is mistaken. Lagos-Ibadan is actually Phase II of the Lagos-Kano project. Abuja-Kaduna is Phase I. The Lagos-Kano contract was awarded in 2006 by the Obasanjo government for $8.3bn. It was to be funded with a $2.5bn soft loan from the China Exim Bank and the rest from the Excess Crude Account which, at the time, had about $50bn in it. Obasanjo had secured the agreement of the three tiers of government for this funding arrangement. He had also obtained the approval of the National Assembly for the loan. \nSo what went wrong? \nThe contract was signed in October 2006 and the Chinese contractor immediately started work with the ground-breaking perform by Obasanjo at Kajola in November, 2006. Obasanjo left in May 2007 but managed to cause a problem by not fully making the down payment of about $2bn to the contractor. The down payment was due 14 days after contract execution. Instead, he paid only $250m and asked that the balance be obtained from the China Exim Bank loan. \nThis was the first hitch the contract would run into. When Yar'Adua took the saddle, there were all sorts of rumours flying about that the contract award did not follow due process, was inflated and was not in the budget. Yar'Adua set up a ministerial committee co-chaired by Mrs Allison-Madueke, Minister of Transport and Usman Shamsudeen, Minister of Finance to investigate the contract, and their report was scathing. It is claimed that Yar'Adua considered cancelling the contract but was mindful of the huge cost of contract default and the implications for diplomatic relations with China. \nSo what happened? \nWell, while all these were going on, no payment was forthcoming to the contractor and work ground to a halt. The stock of the contractor also crashed on the Chinese capital markets as a result of the threat to the contract. Isa Bio became the Minister of Transport and suddenly we were being told that there was no money for the Lagos to Kano modernization project. Apparently the three tiers of government now preferred to share the money in the Excess Crude Account rather than fund Obasanjo's railway modernization project. The focus for the railways now shifted to rehabilitation of the legacy narrow gauge system which Obasanjo had ignored. I believe that Bio and Yar'Adua were misled into believing that the legacy railway system could be rehabilitated in just 10 months. Indeed, Bio promised Yar'Adua that rail services would resume on a rehabilitated narrow Lagos-Kano gauge before the end of 2009. This was, of course, a pie in the sky. The 25 new locomotives that Yar'Adua bought started to arrive in early 2010 but the rehabilitation was nowhere near completion. \nSo when were the rehabilitations completed? \nWell, the rehabilitation of Lagos-Kano was completed in December 2012 while Port-Harcourt to Gombe was allegedly completed in January 2015 but that is not the end of the story. The scope of the contracts had omitted a critical part of the infrastructure, which are the passing loops and railway sidings. \nSo what became of the Lagos-Kano modernization contract and the China Exim Bank loan? \nAfter what would seem an eternity, it was resolved that the contract would proceed in phases with Kaduna-Abuja as Phase I, Lagos-Ibadan as Phase II, Ibadan-Ilorin as Phase III, Ilorin-Minna as Phase IV, Minna-Kano and Minna-Abuja as Phase V. Quite clearly, the implication is that the project could cost more than the $8.3bn contracted in 2006 and take longer than four years. Indeed, the Phase I from Kaduna-Abuja was only allegedly completed in December 2014. The Phase II from Lagos to Ibadan was instructed in 2012 for $1.5bn but three years later, construction is yet to commence as we speak. The then Minister of Transport, Idris Umar, told us in 2012 that Lagos-Ibadan would be completed in 2015 and that it would be funded with $1bn of the China Exim Bank loan with the federal government footing the balance of $500m. This is the $1bn Chinese loan that is now in dispute. What we know is that the Phase I Abuja-Kaduna was instructed at $874m and was funded with $500m of the China Exim Bank loan with the federal government making up the balance largely through SURE-P. \nSo the question is: Where is the balance of the original $2.5bn China Exim Bank loan taken for the Lagos-Kano modernization project as only $500m of it has been utilised for the project? We also know that there were appropriations for Lagos-Ibadan in the budgets of 2012, 2013 and 2014 totalling N13bn. So why has it not started? \nDoes it mean that this project has been abandoned? \nI would hope not. What is, however, inexplicable is that while the Lagos-Kano project was floundering supposedly due to lack of funding, the Jonathan government saw it fit to enter into another agreement for a whopping $12bn for the coastal railway. This is what we mean by strategic incoherence and is the bane of our railway development. \nIs this the railway line to Otuoke? \nWell, it links Otuoke but it is from Lagos to Calabar.
