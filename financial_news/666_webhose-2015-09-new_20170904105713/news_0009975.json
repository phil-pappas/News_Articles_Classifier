These include Sands China, Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment, SJM Holdings, Melco Entertainment and MGM China .\nBut even with the slump, China's only legal gambling hub still rakes in more than five times the revenue of Las Vegas.\nAnalysts expect revenue to improve in second half of the year with the opening of Melco's movie-themed Studio City resort on Oct. 27 and remain optimistic about the territory's long-term prospects, noting that just 2-3 percent of China's 1.4 billion population has visited Macau.\nShares of Hong Kong-listed casino operators were down between 2-4 percent ahead of the middday break. They have lost some 32-45 percent since the start of the year, underperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index which has fallen 9 percent in the same period.\n(Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Edwina Gibbs )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:05:21.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
