Photo: Reuters\n Chinese stocks are nowhere near bottoming out, said George Magnus, a senior independent economic adviser to UBS Group who correctly predicted in July the rout would deepen.\nPolicy makers should stop intervening in the market and allow the Shanghai Composite Index fall to between 2500 and 2800, in line with its long-run average, Mr Magnus said.\nFor equities to rally from there, investors needed to see improving company profits and evidence that the government was committed to reform, he said. The Shanghai gauge slipped to 3160.17 on Wednesday, before markets shut for a two-day holiday.\n\"When the equity market was falling in August, some people said this is a buying opportunity, that this is a multi-year bull market,\" said Mr Magnus.\nAdvertisement \"I don't think we will see that unless there is a very significant change in the politics of China. We need to see significant change in the way in which the economy is working and in the way in which the reform is working and both of these things are on the rack at the moment.\"\nThe Shanghai Composite has tumbled 39 per cent since June 12, when the gauge reached its highest in more than seven years as mainland investors borrowed record amounts of funds to buy equities.\nThe gains were never justified given the weak growth backdrop, according to Mr Magnus. Analysts expect China's economy to expand 6.9 per cent this year, the slowest pace in 25 years.\nFrom the start of 2010, the Shanghai Composite traded roughly between 2000 and 3000 until the end of last year. Now, even after a rout that erased $US5 trillion in value, valuations on mainland bourses are among the highest in the world and dual-listed shares cost more than twice as much on the mainland as in Hong Kong.\nIn July, Mr Magnus said Chinese equities would extend their retreat by as much as 35 per cent to the 2500-2800 trading range. The measure has since fallen 17 per cent.\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.4 per cent at 10.24am in Hong Kong, heading for its lowest level since March 2014.\nIn an effort to stop to the plunge, China's regulators have banned major shareholders from selling stakes, suspended new listings and asked brokerages to help boost the market.\nIn the latest salvo, the China Financial Futures Exchange on Wednesday moved to limit trading of stock-index futures by lowering the bar for \"abnormal trading\" and increasing margin requirements and settlement fees. A Caijing magazine reporter was detained for spreading false information, Xinhua News Agency reported last month.\nConfidence needed \"You've really got to have confidence that they're not going to arrest journalists who spread rumours about the market, to have confidence they are going to allow market forces to some degree influence resource allocation,\" before stocks can rally, said Mr Magnus.\n\"You've got to have some confidence about openness and transparency and the rule of law.\"\nChina's economic policy makers have been just as busy as stock-market regulators, cutting interest rates five times since November and easing bank lending restrictions to bolster growth.\nAn official manufacturing gauge fell to the lowest reading in three years in August, while profits at the nation's industrial companies declined 2.9 per cent in July.\n\"What we know now is that the rise in the market took place without any reference to what was going on in the economy or to the profits,\" said Mr Magnus. \"I don't see any major risk of reigniting the boom in the equity market.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:20:14.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
