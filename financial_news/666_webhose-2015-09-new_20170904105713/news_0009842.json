However, investors piled into the sector on Thursday on hopes a UK food retailer will be on Mr Wiese’s next shopping list. \nHaving been linked with a potential takeover of Morrisons in recent times, traders suggested his bullish comments on the sector may mean it’s time to invest. Mr Wiese already holds a 19pc stake in the frozen food chain Iceland, through his investment vehicle, Brait. * There's really only one UK supermarket that Africa's bargain hunting billionaire could buy A survey of UK consumers by the UBS research unit Evidence Lab revealed that Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, was improving in “value for money”. UBS upgraded the stock from “sell” to “neutral” and raised its target price by 10p to 175p, as analysts reckon the shares are pricing in consensus downgrades. UBS’s study suggested consumers don’t view the supermarket as appealing as its competitors. \nAndrew Gwynn, of UBS, said the key question boss David Potts must address when the company publishes its half-year results next week is “what is Morrisons’ point of difference?” \nHowever, analysts are not hopeful Mr Potts, who took the helm just six months ago, will announce significant changes to strategy. Instead, they anticipate an update on chatter that Morrisons is looking to offload its fledgling convenience store business. The stock leapt 7.7p, or 4.7pc, to 170.8p. Tesco advanced 2.5pc to 189.6p, while Sainsbury’s rose 2.6pc to 243.3p. \nThe FTSE 100 rallied in afternoon trading, buoyed by the European Central Bank’s (ECB) dovish economic projections , which pointed to the likelihood of an extension to its quantitative easing (QE) measures. \nFollowing the ECB’s policy update, Alastair McCaig, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , warned that comments from the Bank of England suggesting market turmoil in China will only have a mild effect on the UK’s economic projections, now “look even less credible”. Nonetheless, the blue-chip index recorded its biggest one-day gain in a week, jumping 110.79 points, or 1.82pc, to 6,194.10. * ECB live: Dovish Draghi drives down the euro after promising more QE 'if necessary' European bourses also rose following ECB president Mario Draghi’s commitment to boost QE if needed. The CAC in Paris advanced 2.2pc and the German DAX rose 2.7pc. \nJameel Ahmad, of ForexTime, said the closure of Chinese stock markets -to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War - also helped boost global shares. \n“The closure of the Shanghai Composite Index and the consequent pause in volatility is having a positive impact, as European markets attempt to rebuild some losses from heavy selling earlier in the week,” Mr Ahmad added. \nMining stocks soared higher as traders adopted a “no China, no worries” mentality. In recent weeks, investors have been concerned the ailing health of the Chinese economy will hit demand for commodities . However, any such fears subsided on Thursday as miners bounced back from record lows. \nDespite Standard & Poor’s slashing Glencore’s outlook to “negative” from “stable”, the group climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 after rising 8.2p, or 6.6pc, to 131p. Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) added 6pc to close at 725p, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) inched 4.3pc higher to £11.10 and Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) rose 3.3pc to 596.5p. \nMr Draghi’s comments boosted the mining industry further, following Rio Tinto’s positive market outlook. The firm expects global steel demand to grow 2.5pc every year until 2030, sending its shares up 3.3pc to £23.41. \nThe airline industry also flew higher, with easyJet surging 90p, or 5.4pc, to £17.62 after it raised its profit outlook for the year . The low-cost carrier now expects full-year pre-tax profits to be in the region of £675m to £700m. \nTrevor Green, of Aviva Investors, said the earnings upgrade showed the airline’s disciplined approach to capacity allocation is working. \n“EasyJet (Other OTC: EJTTF - news ) is also benefiting from the improving discretionary income UK consumers are seeing,” he added. \nInternational Airlines Group also joined the top 10 FTSE risers. Just a day after the company took Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) officially under its wings, it celebrated an 8.6pc rise in traffic in August, compared with the previous year. The stock was up 22p at 564.5p. \nAfter the bulk of FTSE 100 constituents were left nursing hefty losses earlier in the week, investors cheered as just four shares tumbled into the red on Thursday. Weir Group fell 15p to £13.28 after it was demoted from the FTSE 100 into the mid-cap index in the latest quarterly review. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also became a target for Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , which slashed its target price from £19.50 to £16. \nFinally, Aim-lised Lifeline Scientific (LSE: LSIC.L - news ) rose 3pc to 203p after receiving regulatory approval for its LifePort Kidney Transporter, to be sold in China. The device preserves deceased-donor kidneys, transplanted out of normal surgery hours (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:57:29.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
