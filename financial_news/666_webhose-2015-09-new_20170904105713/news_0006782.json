Grillo will continue in his role as President and COO of Lebenthal Wealth Advisors, reporting to Ms. Lebenthal.\n“These management changes are a significant event in the development of Lebenthal,” said Jeffrey B. Lane, Chairman of Lebenthal. “I’ve known and worked with Barbara for over 25 years, and her experience running complex financial services organizations, her leadership skills and her ability to maintain strategic vision while managing operational issues will serve us well going forward. At the same time, Alex is the heart and soul of the Lebenthal brand, and now she will be bringing her energy and brilliance more closely to bear at Lebenthal Wealth Advisors. We have made tremendous progress in the growth of Lebenthal, and I have never been more excited by the opportunities before us.”\nMr. Lane added, “I want to thank Frank Campanale for his service to the firm and for the role he has played in creating and building Lebenthal Wealth Advisors to this point, and to wish him well as he moves on to the next step in his life’s journey.”\nBarbara Yastine is a seasoned financial services leader. Prior to joining Lebenthal, she was Chair, CEO and President of Ally Bank, the $100 billion bank subsidiary of Ally Financial. She joined Ally in 2010 as CAO.

Jeff, Alex, and Jimmy are building a robust platform that focuses on three main businesses—asset management, wealth management and capital markets. As the financial services marketplace continues to evolve since the financial crisis, with challenges to legacy business models, increased regulatory scrutiny, and greater demands for customer satisfaction, Lebenthal is well-positioned to be a differentiated and profitable boutique. I look forward to joining this leadership team and pushing the company forward.”\nMs. Lebenthal said, “My passion for serving clients is something I inherited from my grandmother and my dad, and I am excited to bring this passion to help grow our existing wealth management business and to continue to attract talented, customer-focused financial advisors to our unique culture and brand.
