It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) buys all its programming from third-party production companies and has broadcast such shows as Big Brother, Homeland and Friends. \nA spokeswoman for the Department of Media said no decision had been taken regarding the \"reform of Channel 4\". The Financial Times reported earlier this year that a sale of Channel 4 could raise more than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 bln). \n\"Channel 4 has an important remit and we are looking at a range of options as to how to continue to deliver this, including options put forward by Channel 4,\" the spokeswoman said.
