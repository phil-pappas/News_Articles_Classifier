Chris McLennan Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Kids on holiday in the South Pacific have long been able to make a grass skirt, rattle a few drums and pick frangipani thanks to the all-important Kids Clubs offered at virtually all resorts. Now Jean-Michel Cousteau Resort has taken the concept of kids activities to a new level, launching a program giving children the chance to experience the local school.\nCousteau is a former coconut plantation turned five-star resort on the northern Fijian island of Savusavu long popular with wealthy Australian families. Its 'Connect with Kids' program allows school-aged kids to spend a day at a local primary school participating in classroom activities. The resort's general manager Bart Simpson said the program would allow kids to learn firsthand about a different culture.\n\"By offering the Connect with Kids program, we hope to reinforce the importance of travelling to our young guests, broaden their curiosity, and ideally, make a friend along the way,\" he said.\nYoungsters participating in the program are paired with a local child of their own age for the day before undertaking recreational and educational activities and being treated to traditional Fijian snacks like tapioca cake.\nPeninsula hotels offer junior guests the chance to spend a day with the hotel's pastry chef, learning about how to make desserts. After visiting the school the kids are encouraged to stay in touch through a pen pal program.\nThe resort has attracted young families because it provides tired parents with children under five the chance for total relaxation given the kids are taken care of by a nanny between 8am and 9pm as part of the price. Children up to 13 are partnered with a buddy and have free access to the Bula Club, which features swimming pools, waterslides and a live band each afternoon.\nEducation is the new luxury Educational programs for kids have become one of the fastest growing features at many family-friendly and high-end resorts and hotels the world over.\n The five-star, 69-room Belmond Napasai Resort in Koh Samui launched a range of 'my first job' activities earlier this year, teaching children aged three to 12 practical skills, such as how to be a pastry chef, a beautician, a florist, a dancer, a cocktail maker or a gardner. There's even a juniors crash course in engineering for the ambitious young guest.\nThe blue-ribbon Peninsula hotels also offer extensive kids programs under their 'Academy' program - including the chance for junior guests to spend a day with the hotel's pastry chef, learning about how to make desserts. You can imagine that would put a smile on the average parent's face.\nBut these experiences come at a price.\nThe minimum price for two adults to stay at the Jean-Michel Cousteau Resort is $1170 a night. If you're looking to splurge, you can pay up to $3500. For this you get your own plunge pool and private waterfall.\nA room at The Peninsula Paris starts at around $1257 a night, and can exceed $5500 if your wallet can take it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-16T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:04:39.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
