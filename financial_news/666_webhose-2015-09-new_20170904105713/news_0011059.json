Alex Ellinghausen by Joanna Mather One of the last official acts of Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick will be to lobby male business leaders to oppose a plan to reduce access to paid parental leave.\nThe \"Champions of Change\" group includes the male bosses of some of Australia's biggest companies. They are closely aligned with Ms Broderick and have pledged to support gender equality and boost the number of women in leadership.\nBut the two dozen or so anointed change champions have been silent on the government's plan to crack down on so-called \"double dippers\" , disappointing women's groups.\n\"I'll be on their case,\" she told the National Press Club. \"You're right, where are the men speaking out on these issues?\"\nMs Broderick was responding to questions about the plan from journalists in Canberra during her final public appearance as sex discrimination commissioner after eight years.\nShe opposes the government's plan to deny access to the taxpayer-funded paid parental leave scheme, worth $11,500, if a new parent is eligible for a more generous employer-sponsored plan. The change will save nearly $1 billion.\nLabor reversal It is unclear if the changes will get through the Senate and Labor has signalled a reversal should it win government.\n Prime Minister Tony Abbott was attacked for promising a very generous paid parental leave scheme, which he later dumped.\nCritics said he should divert the extra money to childcare and the Coalition has since promised an extra $3.5 billion in this area .\nMs Broderick told the press club she was proud to have been part of the initial push for a universal paid parental leave scheme.\n\"I think having a strong paid parental leave scheme is absolutely fundamental to women making progress in our nation,\" she said.\nMale Champions of Change was established by Ms Broderick and 20 other leaders from business and the government in 2010.\nMembers of the group now enjoy much kudos for their champion status â€“ an event in Sydney last week attracted 700 people.\nMs Broderick said the group supported the existing leave arrangements.\n\"I can't speak for the male champions of change but I know one of the things they are focussing on is that paid parental leave should not be a career detriment,\" she said.\nCareer accelerant \"Indeed it should be the opposite, should be a career accelerant because that's what's going to be necessary to get women, particularly at the most senior levels.\"\nMs Broderick applauded the work of male champions in promoting flexible work arrangements. She said the \"All Roles Flex\" initiative launched by Telstra had now been picked up by ANZ, Westpac, PwC and the ASX.\nLegislation to change paid parental leave is being examined by a Senate committee.\nThe Human Rights Commission, the agency within which Ms Broderick's sex commissioner role sits, has warned that the paid parental leave changes would breach international human rights laws and increase the gender pay gap.\nOf the more than 50 other submissions to the senate committee inquiry, there were none from big businesses.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/the-surprise-winners-of-flexible-work-at-telstra-20150825-gj7a0v.html"], "published": "2015-09-02T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:07:54.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
