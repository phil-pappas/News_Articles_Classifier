It will also increase employment potential for local labourers for project activities,” an official statement, issued after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), said.\nBids from interested parties have already been invited on the basis of provisions of the model concession agreement. The Centre would provide grant of up to 40% of the total project cost as viability gap funding (VGF).\nThe project was in 2011 awarded during the UPA-II regime to Ashoka Buildcon and a concession agreement in March, 2012. However, due to non-fulfilment of condition precedents by the NHAI as per the provisions of the agreement, the pact was terminated on mutual consent.\n 22, 2015 3:23 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:30:44.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
