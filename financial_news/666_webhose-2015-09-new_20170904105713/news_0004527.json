More Boardroom trades, September 19 \nOf the 29 most popular funds on these lists, only 51.73 per cent performed better than average over the five years to the end of August, according to a study by the consumer finance website Boring Money , based on figures from Morningstar. Fund companies cannot pay to feature on the recommended lists, although fund selectors do take fee structures charged to the investor into account. \nThe numbers raise concerns that the lists, which direct billions in investments by retail consumers each year, may be failing to help investors identify the most successful funds. \n“I was surprised by that — I would have thought, looking at the names on the list, that you would have had a much stronger showing,” said Holly Mackay, founder of Boring Money. \n“I’m a proponent of active management but when you look at this it does make you wonder whether people would be better off going for passive funds, paying less and sticking with the middle ground.” \nPassive funds, which seek to track an index rather than outperform it, tend to be cheaper than those that are actively managed. \nFunds that performed worse than average over five years include Schroders’ Income Maximiser product, M&G Global Dividend and Man GLG’s Japan CoreAlpha, while outperformers include Newton Global Income, Jupiter European and Franklin UK Mid Cap. \nA report by Platforum, a consultancy, in July said “select lists of investments are increasingly considered to be a key element of direct platforms”, with several companies working on new initiatives to promote their lists. Ms Mackay estimates the lists direct about £4.5bn of fund flows each year. \nRead more \nThe researchers looked at funds most often included, then cut out BlackRock’s Gold and General as it is included in the “specialist” sector which includes a broad variety of funds. Each fund researched appears on the recommended lists of between four and seven big platforms. \nOverall, the funds’ performance over the past three years was no better than over five, with only 48 per cent outperforming the sector average. \nSome of the funds, such as Aberdeen Asia Pacific , underperformed over five years but show much better performance over longer timeframes. \nMichelle McGrade, chief investment officer at TD Direct, said in response: “The most important factor when making the right investment is timing, and recommended lists leave investors to their own devices and their own timing. \n“Unfortunately, the wider investing audience are prone to follow the best past returns — buying after periods of good performance and selling after periods of bad.” \nSelect lists are generally designed to be “all-encompassing”, she added. “We aim to have a mix of long-term talent and rising stars, and to provide a range of styles.” \nMs Mackay said that customers already invested in a product that was not performing well must balance the possibility of it improving with the “opportunity cost of hanging around in an underperforming fund”. \nMost fund supermarkets now also offer “model portfolios” which are run and rebalanced on behalf of investors, though these tend to involve extra fees. \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said three quarters of funds on Hargreaves’ popular Wealth 150 list outperformed their sectors over five years, by an average of 19 per cent. \n“Over a five-year investment period, that’s a good result, because while there is a reasonable chance that skill will come to the fore, bad luck can still play a part in returns,” he said. \nHowever, Hargreaves’ data were based on slightly different figures which take account of funds that have closed or moved sector during the period, bringing down the sector averages. \nMs Mackay said that “as a very minimum, you would expect fund selectors not to include the funds which were going to be closed or fail”.
