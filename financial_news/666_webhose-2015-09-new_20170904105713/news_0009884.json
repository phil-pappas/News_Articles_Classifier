They feel the order has shattered the faith of victims who waited for 19 years to see the industrialists behind bars. Activist lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says the traumatic experience gives an impression that the judicial parameters for awarding sentence vary for the rich and the poor.\nSenior advocate KTS Tulsi, who represented the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy, said that Ansals should have been convicted under Section 304 IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), which carries a rigorous imprisonment of a maximum of 10 years.\nAccording to lawyer Rahul Gupta, the law regarding sentencing should be consistently applied irrespective of the background of the accused and punishments can’t be different depending on the social status of the litigant.\nThis is not the first time that the rich and the mighty have escaped with mild punishment. Of all the ‘man-made’ disasters that have occurred in India, corporate negligence has probably caused the most—Bhopal gas tragedy, Uphaar fire and AMRI hospital fire are no exceptions.\nThe 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy sparked a furious debate on safety standards not maintained by corporate houses and a humiliatingly small sentence to the accused.\nAlthough the employees of Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL) were convicted in 2010 of causing death by negligence, the verdict came too late. The guilty, including UCIL chairman Keshub Mahindra at the time, were sentenced to a mere two years in prison with a petty fine of $2,000 each. Warren Anderson, the chairman of UCC—the parent company—fled to the US and lived freely till he died in September last year.\nDespite calls for stricter regulation and laws for safety models, India’s corporate landscape still looks the same. The Kolkata AMRI hospital fire of 2011 is another example. In the AMRI case, the owners (RS Goenka, SK Todi and other directors) were taken into custody on the charge of culpable homicide. Within a month, Ficci urged the West Bengal government to release the directors who were not responsible in day-to-day functioning of the hospital. The hospital later announced a compensation of R5 lakh for the kin of each of the deceased.\nIn all these cases, the judicial system rarely acted as a deterrent—mild punishments meted out to offenders do little to deter others. The lack of strict laws, a lacklustre attitude towards safety and corruption increase the threat of such disasters. Ironically, the victims suffer the wrath of the judicial system.\nWhile courts are adopting lenient views, the Kejriwal-led Delhi government is ready to make a law which provides for stringent punishment to those responsible for man-made disasters.\nNeelam Krishnamurthy, who lost both her children in the tragedy, said, “As the SC has not given any punishment, we want a law where people are given at least 10-15 years of punishment.”\nSharper, well-defined laws explicitly stating basic safety norms, stringent and quicker punishment for the guilty and uniformity in sentencing by the courts should be kept in mind while framing new laws for dealing with disasters.\nTime-bound decisions and fast-track trials in such cases can bring some improvement and act as better deterrents.\nindu.bhan@expressindia.com\nFirst Published on September 02, 2015 12:34 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:08:43.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
