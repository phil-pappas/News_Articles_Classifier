At 0850 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 2%, France's CAC 40 was 2.2% higher and Germany's DAX was up 2.1%. \nThe Stoxx 600 autos and parts index was the standout gainer, up 3.7% on news that China has halved sales tax on small cars in a bid to boost the automobile market. \n\"European markets are trading higher this morning managing to build on yesterday's late bounce on the back of firmer markets across Asia overnight,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) appears that at least in Asia 'bears' are taking some money off the table in light of today being the last trading day of the month/quarter and some stock markets having had the worst quarter in several years. There is also news that China will cut the small passenger vehicle purchase tax which is another sign that China continues to work to implement new measures to strengthen the economy.\" Huber said this was much-needed good news for European car makers, especially with the Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) scandal still looming heavily over the entire sector. \nSupermarket retailer Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) surged after the company said it expects full-year underlying pre-tax profit to be moderately ahead of its £548m forecast. Peers followed suit, with Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Morrison both firmly in the black. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in commodity trader Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) rallied after it put out a media statement saying it has taken proactive steps to position the company to withstand current commodity market conditions. \"Our business remains operationally and financially robust - we have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues,\" it said. \nThe stock tumbled 29% on Monday to its lowest since the IPO in 2011, after analysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) said Glencore had no equity value at current spot prices. \nElsewhere, shares in French electrical goods retailer Darty (Other OTC: KESAF - news ) rocketed after books and music retailer Fnac said it has made a proposal to buy the company for £533m. \nData released earlier showed German retail sales suffered an unexpected monthly decline, although a sharp yearly increase indicated private consumption remains a key driver for the economy. \nAccording to the Federal Statistics Office, retail sales fell 0.4% month-on-month compared with a 1.6% rise in July and falling short of analysts' expectations for a 0.2% gain. \nOn a year-on-year basis, retail sales grew 2.5%, missing consensus expectations for a 3.1% increase and below the 3.8% year-on-year increase registered in the previous month. \nAmong individual sectors, online and mail-order sales continued to grow strongly in August, although sales in textiles, clothing, shoes and leather goods slumped 10% year-on-year. \nOn Tuesday, Germany's headline CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) fell short of analysts' expectations, leading to speculations the European Central Bank might need to extend its quantitative easing programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:32:18.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
