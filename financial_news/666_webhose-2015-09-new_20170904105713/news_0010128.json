Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Like many baby boomers, retired Canberra public servant Ian Giles has profited handsomely by investing in real estate over the past few years.\nBut unlike compatriots who have ploughed their cash into the booming Sydney and Melbourne property markets, Giles bet on the United States.\nThe decision may seem ironic, given that the imploding US housing market was at the epicentre of the global financial crisis that brought the world economy to its knees in 2008.\nBut the combination of crashing US house prices from 2007 to 2011, and a soaring Australian dollar between 2011 and 2013, presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for one of the greatest property plays ever by Australians.\n\"I could see the potential of investing in US property because you knew it was going to come back,\" Giles says. \"The Australian dollar was also getting near parity.\"\nGiles, 66, invested more than 20 per cent of his self-managed superannuation fund in a US residential property fund set up by local financial planning firm Dixon Advisory in 2011.\nHe is not alone. Thousands of local retail and institutional investors have jumped into US property in recent years.\nThe $117 billion Future Fund, Australian Super and REST Industry Super have all stepped up their exposures to US property, while Sydney-based Spire Capital has co-invested in apartments and office buildings on behalf of its wealthy clients and institutions.\n In hindsight the strategy seems like a no-brainer. US property prices fell 30 to 50 per cent in major markets in the crash. Values were bound to recover when the economy picked up and unemployment rate fell, as it has from 10 per cent to 5.3 per cent.\nSimilarly, the Australian dollar was unlikely to stay above $US1 forever, and this week dipped to below US70¢.\nSpire Capital director Matthew Cook says the firm invested about $62 million for a 6 per cent stake in a US real estate fund controlling 52 residential apartment complexes and 10 office buildings.\nThe Australian dollar was trading at US91¢ when Spire invested in 2013.\nWhile property price appreciation and rental dividends have generated most of the 66 per cent in returns over the last two years for the Spire ROC II fund, the currency plunge has delivered about one-fifth of the profits.\n\"We intentionally kept the fund unhedged for currency,\" Cook says, adding that he thinks the dollar will fall towards US60¢ and has an option to take out a hedge to lock in the exchange rate gains if it does.\nBack in Canberra, Giles is one of about 4500 individuals invested in Dixon's ASX-listed US residential property investment trust, which controls more than $800 million in assets.\nThe fund has acquired more than 2000 housing units in the past four years across the New York metropolitan area, including Manhattan, Brooklyn, New Jersey and Queens.\nDixon's US Masters Residential Property Fund has delivered total returns of 57.4 per cent, or 11.5 per cent annually, since its inception in June 2011.\nInside one of the brownstone houses at Van Vorst Park in Jersey City, about a dozen tradesmen are putting the finishing touches to the run-down property Dixon's fund bought in April 2013.\nChecking over the house, Dixon Advisory US chief executive Alan Dixon says anyone who bought US real estate a few years ago has \"made great money because the market had so over-corrected\".\nNew York investment giant Blackstone Group spent about $US8 billion on 50,000 US residential properties after the price crash, snapping up entire streets and neighbourhoods of distressed houses.\nBlackstone global real estate head Jonathan Gray says the fund is still buying houses in the country's south-east states such as Florida and California.\n\"What we like about the housing market is the fundamentals are growing,\" Gray says.\nThe rental homes that Blackstone owns are 97 per cent occupied. Rental demand across the US is strong.\nBefore the recession, the US was building about 1 million new homes a year. Today, it is building about 650,000 a year, meaning the supply of homes for renters is more limited.\nUS home ownership rates have slumped to their lowest since 1967, 63.4 per cent.\nThe trend is partly a hangover from the recession, with some would-be home buyers struggling to save a deposit or access bank credit.\nThere has also been a societal shift in favour of renting to increase lifestyle flexibility and to live closer to work in cities.\nFrom Sydney, Cook says Spire is seeking to capitalise on the American shift to renting. It is focusing on investing in \"essential and affordable\" accommodation like multifamily apartments that rent for $US1500 a month and seniors' accommodation leasing for $US3000 to $US4000.\n\"We believe investing in those segments is a very strong risk mitigant against raising interest rates or a macro event,\" Cook's offsider at Spire, Dale Holmes says.\nStill, highly paid finance and technology executives working in New York are coughing up $US10,000 to $US15,000 a month for some rental homes acquired by Dixon's fund.\nAt 268 Barrow Street in Jersey City, Dixon has transformed an 1850s-era four-unit, four-storey property into a five-bedroom modern family home.\nThe property cost $US1.085 million and the fund has spent a further $US1.16 million on renovations.\n\"We're going to give it the Jamie Durie Backyard Blitz,\" Dixon says.\nThe property is listed for an asking rent of $US11,000 a month.\n\"There is a surprisingly good depth of people who can afford that,\" he says.\nA nearby home is renting for $US10,000 a month to an English couple who are on a two-year work posting. They work in finance and have a combined annual income of more than $US1 million. Such big salaries are not unusual in New York.\nThe renovation strategy at the more premium end of the market is a marked departure from Dixon's original 2011 foray that involved swooping on homes at bargain-basement prices from mortgagors who could not afford to repay their banks during the recession.\nInitially, Dixon acquired hundreds of homes for around $US250,000 to $US300,000 each in working class suburbs on the outskirts of Manhattan that had peaked in value at about $US500,000 in 2006. Their values have since recovered to about $US400,000.\nThe more recent bet on robust demand persisting for expensive rental properties at the premium end of the market will likely depend on the New York economy and housing market remaining strong and not falling off a cliff like last time.\nIn a sign the American economy is strengthening, the US Federal Reserve is poised to soon raise interest rates for the first time in more than nine years.\nPricey properties at downtown Jersey City and Park Slope in Brooklyn are about a 30-minute commute to midtown Manhattan.\nThe old-industrial neighbourhoods have grown in attractiveness among professionals since the crime and drug scene was overtaken by gentrification, just like Fitzroy in Melbourne and Surry Hills in Sydney.\nMarc Wesson, president of Friends of Van Vorst Park in Jersey City, says he wouldn't let his children play in the \"drug addict hangout\" local park in the early 1990s.\nNow, young professionals and families, artists and a big gay community have moved in, as have top chefs and trendy cafes on Newark Avenue.\nTennis courts, a gazebo and mums pushing strollers dot the park and kids fill the playground.\nWall Street banks like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are shifting their back offices to lower-cost Jersey, helping to boost rental demand from workers.\nAround the local neighbourhoods, house prices have grown at about 8 to 10 per cent annually over the last four years.\nThe Australian money that is flowing in and pushing up prices is not going unnoticed.\n\"Market values are insane, thanks a lot to Dixon,\" says Wesson, who has personally benefited from the price appreciation.\n\"It's very difficult to buy a brownstone because he's inthere first with cash and very hard to compete against.\"\nGiles says the plunging dollar has raised a dilemma. \"One of my big questions now is with the dollar falling to the low 70s, you're really talking about a 25 per cent profit if you sell now,\" Giles says.\nDixon says he has no plans to sell the properties in the near future, expressing faith in continued capital appreciation and rental yields for investors.\n\"It all depends where prices get to,\" Dixon says.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-04T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:53:34.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
