Steven Siewert Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston One of Australia's wealthiest young property developers, Shaun Bonett, is pleading with political interests to support the country's free trade agreement with China saying such foreign investment could be essential for underpinning property values.\nMr Bonett, whose wealth is estimated at $478 million by the BRW Rich List, has office buildings and shopping centres across Australia and has been funding some property purchases with finance from the the fifth largest bank in the world, the Bank of China.\n\"Our free trade agreement with China is essential in ensuring that China's relationship with Australia remains a long-term focus, which should continue to have a favourable influence on the valuation and demand for Australian property,\" Mr Bonett told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"Any delay of the free trade agreement being passed in both houses of Parliament is likely to cause a significant destabilising reaction in the Australian market, which has benefited by the increased credibility that this agreement has given it at a global level.\"\nChevron Renaissance shopping centre on the Gold Coast was purchased by Precision Group and financed by the Bank of China China is now the largest foreign buyer of Australian real estate spending $12.4 billion in fiscal 2014, according to the Foreign Investment Review Board. However since then, there have been significant Chinese investments in real estate including the China Investment Corporation's purchase of Morgan Stanley's Investa Office business for more than $2.45 billion , representing one of the largest property transaction in Australia's history.\nMr Bonett, who appointed a senior Chinese official to the board of his business Precision Group in July, has just purchased a distressed shopping centre on the Gold Coast for $74 million with debt financing from the Bank of China .\n'Vile xenophobic scare' He said the free-trade deal was the product of years of diplomacy and was critical in helping other Australian property businesses like his to attract investment and help steer the country's economy through a transition away from resources into construction, tourism and services.\n \"The trade agreement will enable the adjustments of its economic structure, Australia should gradually shift from a mining concentrated country and realise new economic growth through increased tourism, food production and tertiary industries.\"\nThe free-trade deal has blown up as a major political issue with unions starting an advertising campaign against components of the deal and federal Labor party backing the union demands for changes.\nFederal Trade Ministers Andrew Robb has labelled the push back by Labor as \"vile xenophobic scare based on falsehoods\".\nThe free trade agreement is one of several areas of diplomacy Mr Bonett said Australia had so far made the right decision on. He mentioned the settlement of the Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) clearing system in Australia, which was jointly developed by the Bank of China and the Australian Securities Exchange.\nHe said the clearing system was a \"monumental event\" in the history of financial co-operation between the two countries and that it made transactions more efficient and less costly.\nHe also said the federal government's signing of a memorandum to apply for its accession into the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank would also greatly benefit property through increased capital flows for infrastructure development.\n\"Currently, all states in Australia have problems of lacking investment in infrastructure from our state governments' fiscal revenues. These governments will be challenged to satisfy the demands of a growing population in the years to come. Chinese companies have a great deal of experience and advantage in areas such as infrastructure construction, which Australia can benefit from.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-09-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:09:57.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
