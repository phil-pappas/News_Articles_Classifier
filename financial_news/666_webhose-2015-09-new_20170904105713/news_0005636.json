Increasing number of power plants in the Asia-Pacific region would positively contribute to investments in water and wastewater treatment, and is another driving factor for increase in industrial pumps. The surge in chemical industry is also a key driver for growth in industrial pumps market. Asia accounts for half of the global chemical sales in 2010, and it is projected that it would account for 66% percent of global chemical sales by 2030. \nThe global motor soft starter market has been primarily segmented on the basis of Voltage which includes, low and medium voltage soft starters. Secondly; it has been segmented on the basis of Rated Power into Soft starters up to 100 kW and soft starters Above 100 kW. The Third type of segmentation is by application which includes; Pumps, Fans, Compressors and Others. \nThe market has been further segmented on the basis of industry into Oil & gas, Water & wastewater, Power generation, Mining and others that constitutes industries such as chemicals & petrochemicals, cement and Pulp & paper industries. Lastly; the market is segmented based on the various regional markets into North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. \nLow voltage motor soft starter find more usage as compared to medium voltage motor soft starter due to large number of low voltage motors employed in industries such as oil & gas, water & wastewater etc. Although the Low voltage motor soft starters find more applications in industry the medium voltage motor soft starters is expected to grow at a higher growth rate during the forecast period yet the dominance of low voltage motor soft starters is likely to continue. \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:28:26.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
