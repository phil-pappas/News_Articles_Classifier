Founded in 2007, CSG Actuarial, LLC began as an actuarial consulting firm, but has since expanded its offerings to accommodate the needs of insurance agents, agencies, marketing organizations, and more. With a fine-tuned understanding of the insurance marketplace, and a wealth of rate, underwriting, and market information, CSG Actuarial has been able to develop some of the most accurate, unbiased databases and rate quoting tools available in the market today.\nThe company’s newest offering, the Agent Database, has been compiled using CSG Actuarial’s proprietary agent-scoring methodology, which allows the company to group agents by the products they sell and the companies they write business for. All major product lines and companies are available to choose from, and clients can customize their own lists from the database to meet their individual needs.\n“Our actuarial consulting background allows us to bring a unique perspective to offering unbiased data and information to the insurance industry.” says Bryan Neary, Founder and Principal of CSG Actuarial, “The new Agent Database of over 550,000 agents is just another facet in the spectrum of value-adding products and services we offer to agents, agencies, companies, and marketing organizations.”\nTo learn more, visit http://www.csgactuarial.com or call (855) 861-8776.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jc2dhY3R1YXJpYWwuY29t"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:06:30.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
