The bank estimates the value at £238 \nTSB current account customers can earn up to £238 a year as part of a package unveiled today that pays 5pc cash on savings and contactless spending. \nEvery customer with a \"classic plus\" account is eligible if they set up online banking and pay £500 a month into the bank but the generous payouts will end in December next year. \nThe deal doubles cash payouts TSB customers currently receive as competition continues to heat up in the savings market . Since 2013, the challenger bank has paid 5pc on the first £2,000 saved in a current account, earning savers £100 a year before tax. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , TSB account holders can earn an extra £81 a year with a 5pc regular saver account if they deposit the maximum £250 a month. \nOn top of this, their contactless spending will receive 5pc cashback, capped at £5 a month, paying an extra £60 over the course of a year. \nThese earnings will be taxed until April 2016, when the Government will scrap the tax paid on the first £1,000 of savings interest. \nMore details: TSB Classic Plus* \n= Verdict = \nTSB's regular saver fails to beat 6pc regular savers attached to current accounts with First Direct, M&S Bank and HSBC Advance. \nBut the TSB account is also less restrictive than higher-paying rivals savers have access to their funds and if they make a withdrawal they will not be penalised, unlike other accounts which will cut the interest rate. \n• Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) offers £144 'loyal customer' current account perk \nIn a statement TSB said it offers a \"fresh approach\" by paying perks without attaching onerous conditions to its current account, which was launched two years ago when TSB split from Lloyds. \nRival accounts offering in-credit interest usually require customers to set up direct debits and pay a higher deposit each month. \nOther interest-paying accounts on the market include Santander's popular 123 current account (3pc on balances up to £20,000) and Nationwide's FlexDirect (5pc on balances up to £2,500). \nBut Santander, for example, requires two direct debits as a condition of receiving £60-a-year interest payments, while Nationwide imposes a higher deposit requirement of £1,000 a month. \n\"We believe there is no other bank account that gives you more and asks for less,\" said Jatin Patel, products director at TSB. \nAndrew Hagger of Moneycomms said: \"While it's an improvement on the existing deal, it's only available for the next 16 months and won't be suitable for everybody.\" \n• Interest rates: bookmark this page for the latest predictions \nChart: how to earn £1,000 in savings interest \nMr Hagger warned that savers with more than £2,000 to save could be better off with Santander's 3pc interest payments. \n\"But with TSB, you have unlimited instant access to your savings, unlike other accounts where access to funds is not permitted or severely restricted,\" he added. \nCustomers get \"something for nothing\" with the new TSB deal, according to Charlotte Nelson, of Moneyfacts.co.uk, a savings analyst. \n\"However, contactless spending is capped at the first £100 so they could be better off using a cashback offer which doesn’t limit spend,\" she said. \nCashback payouts with a Santander 123 credit card, for example, pays tired cashback of between 1pc and 3pc on supermarket shopping and travel. The 3pc paid on petrol and train fares is capped at £300 a month. \n* Starred links are provided by a Telegraph commercial partner.
