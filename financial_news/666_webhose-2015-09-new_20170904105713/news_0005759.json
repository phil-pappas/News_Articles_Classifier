Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Dominic White Malcolm Turnbull should avoid spin-doctors and hubristic advertising, beware the public's BS detector, keep it short, and stifle his tendency to talk down to people, according to leading marketers and pollsters.\nThe job of selling \"brand Turnbull\" to the electorate will be made far easier if the new Prime Minister can rise above politics and address its angst about the post-mining boom economy's future, says Tony Mitchelmore.\nMr Mitchelmore, the managing director of research company Visibility who worked in qualitative research and communications strategy for Kevin Rudd, said focus groups describe Mr Turnbull with words like \"successful, confident, smart, knowledgeable, capable and well educated\".\nThe bad news is that some group members also call him \"self-centred, self-interested, smug, and overconfident\".\n\"When he gets verbose he can start sounding condescending, verging on arrogant, and your average voter can start taking personal issue with that,\" Mr Mitchelmore said.\n\"He's got to be succinct.\"\nThat may prove a challenge for the erudite politician who has promised an end to the three-word sloganeering of the Abbott-era.\nBut John Howard's former ad man Scott Whybin, who helped smash the Coalition's GST regime through the public acceptance barrier, says Turnbull's best bet is to be himself.\n \"I don't think marketing should be involved in everyday speeches,\" said Mr Whybin, chairman at Whybin TBWA. \"People want to see the real person. We've now got such an exposure through social media and all the channels we've got that our 'BS detector' is much more finely-tuned.\"\nMr Whybin added: \" Brand Turnbull should mean honesty, integrity and vision and poll cycle-free government. He has a massive opportunity for authenticity.\n\"As an advertising man I see his opportunity to be himself because I think his training as a businessman and lawyer, and working with people like Kerry Packer has enabled him to be very nimble of his feet – as opposed to stuck in a doldrums of some spin doctor mentality.\n'Don't let the spin doctors infect him' \"God knows, don't let the spin doctors infect him.\"\nBut advertising around the Prime Minister should stick to his policies rather than his personality, warned Mr Whybin.\n\"Tony, if he was honest, never really was a fan of advertising but John was – not to promote John Howard but to explain policies. I think Malcolm sits closer to John but it remains to be seen. For now he should be worried about formulating policies.\n\"From a marketing point of view, I would let him ride rather than attach hubris to him by overtly campaigning pro-Turnbull rather than pro-policy,\" he added.\nDee Madigan, creative director and owner of Campaign Edge, said Mr Turnbull's ability to appear authentic on issues will be hamstrung on policies such as climate change and gay marriage, due to the more socially conservative elements in the Coalition.\n\"The danger is, he will be seen like a hollow man because we know he believes in climate change and what he thinks of Tony Abbott's climate change policy, we know he supports gay marriage … and that's problematic for him I think,\" Ms Madigan said.\nHer biggest piece of advice for Mr Turnbull? \"Be very, very careful about talking down to people. He has a tendency to be a bit Ruddesque in the way he speaks to people, which can come across quite patronising.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-09-20T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:04:41.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
