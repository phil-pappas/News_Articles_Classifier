This as a strong and clear expression of shared solidarity across our European Union and its institutions.” \nThe EIB, as the EU Bank, has stated it is ready to assist in financing basic infrastructure associated with housing and catering to the medical and schooling needs of refugees, and also in terms of supporting initiatives in the areas of education and integration. The proposal also states that the EIB would offer loans at special conditions in order to ensure that no profit is drawn from this human catastrophe. \nFurther discussion on this issue has taken place amongst EU Ministers at Ecofin today. \nMinister Harris will continue to represent the Irish Government on behalf of the Minister for Finance at Ecofin and Eurogroup discussions this evening and into tomorrow. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:58:00.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
