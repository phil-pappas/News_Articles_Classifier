What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about whether people receiving a disability benefit can suspend at their full retirement age and reinstate at 70. Question : Is it true that if you are disabled, you can’t suspend your retirement benefit (to which you disability benefit converts at full retirement age) upon reaching full retirement age and start it again at 70 at a higher level? Answer : Disabled workers, upon reaching full retirement age, have their disability benefit automatically converted into their retirement benefit. And like any other worker who has filed for his/her retirement benefit, they can suspend it and restart it again at 70 at what is now a 32 percent higher value reflecting the addition to the benefit of delayed retirement credits.
