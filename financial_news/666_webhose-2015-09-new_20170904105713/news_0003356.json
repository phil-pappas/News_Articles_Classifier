Bloomberg by Dominic White Rod Sims has fired a googly at the Murdochs' latest Australian media land grab.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman has never been afraid to tackle ticklish issues.\nHe proved as much in July when he put the family on notice over Foxtel's push for 15 per cent of Ten Network Holdings.\nNow Sims has gone one step further, spelling out his concerns explicitly in a typically frank statement of issues that will surprise some in the industry who had assumed the long-planned deal would be a shoo-in with the watchdog.\nThe ACCC has pushed its enquiry out until October 22, expressing concerns that the complex deal will result in \"an alignment of interests\" between the pay TV giant - which is owned by News Corp and Telstra - and the free-to-air network.\nThe watchdog warned that the upshot could favour Ten in the bidding for sports content against other free-to-air television providers and reduce or \"even eliminate\" competition between Foxtel and Ten for the supply of advertising services.\nFoxtel now needs to dissuade Sims that the deal will \"substantially lessen competition\" in sports rights and in the supply of free-to-air television services.\nThe juiciest bit comes on page 9 where the ACCC warns that it may view Lachlan Murdoch's 8.52 per cent stake in Ten (through his private investment vehicle Illyria) as aligned with the interests of News and Foxtel, potentially making it \"in effect the largest shareholding block in Ten\".\n The regulator is also looking at \"the fact that Lachlan was previously interim chief executive officer of Ten, chairman of Ten and a member of the Ten board, and has significant experience and reputation in the media industry.\"\nJames Packer's 8.5 per cent stake in Ten has been drawn into the enquiry too. The ACCC notes that Lachlan (through IIIyria) previously had an agreement Packer - that ran from November 2010 to March 2014 - to act in concert when voting their shares in Ten.\nSims, it appears, is leaving no stone unturned, and by the time he's done will have spent more than a third of the year considering the deal.\nNow it's over to Foxtel and Ten to make a fresh case as to why Sims is overly concerned. They have until September 28 to make a confidential submission.\nTheir rivals will be planning their own submissions too, in their case against a deal that will reshape Australian media if it goes ahead.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/murdoch_media_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-14T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:09:52.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
