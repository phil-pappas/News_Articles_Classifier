A full 42% said they were \"concerned\" or \"very concerned\" with losing their job. \nMaybe some of it has to do with the need for change after rising up the ladder. Senior managers (63%) were more likely to be contemplating an exit than middle managers (39%) and non-management employees (32%). \nOr maybe it just has to do with age and the fact that younger workers are still exploring life's opportunities. Millennials were the most likely (44%) to say they were seriously considering leaving versus 29% of those between the ages of 50 and 64.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:40:59.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
