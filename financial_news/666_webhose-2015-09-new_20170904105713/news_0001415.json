Getty Images Share on twitter by Karen Maley Citigroup has issued a grim warning on the health of the global economy, with its chief economist Willem Buiter estimating there is a 55 per cent chance of a global recession in the next two years, which will force central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe to beef up their monetary stimulus.\nBuiter's sombre prediction comes as investors have become increasingly fearful that the US central bank may decide to raise its key interest rate next week , which has been stuck at close to zero since December 2008.\nIn his latest report, the highly regarded Buiter argues that unlike previous global slowdowns which have been triggered by problems in the United States, this time the slump will be led by the emerging markets, and in particular by China.\n\"We consider China to be at high and rapidly rising risk of a cyclical hard landing, \" Buiter says, pointing to its excess capacity in key sectors, as well as the steep declines in Chinese share and property prices.\n\"Should China enter a recession – and with Russia and Brazil already in recession – we believe that many other emerging markets, already weakened will follow, driven in part by the effects of China's downturn on the demand for their exports and, for the commodity exporters, on commodity prices.\"\nAccording to Buiter, global growth has been faltering in the past few years as a modest pick up in economic activity in developed countries has been swamped by the brutal slowdown in the emerging world.\nGrowth lower than forecast Growth in most emerging markets has been lower than forecast, even in the \"success stories\" such as India, and central and eastern Europe.\n But, he sees China is the most significant underperformer, with its growth rate now around 4 per cent, well below Beijing's target of 7 per cent for this year.\nBuiter says that the although the emerging markets will be the main casualties of slowing Chinese growth, the developed world will feel a chill from a drop in global trade, given that China accounted for around one-seventh of global commerce in 2013.\nGlobal financial markets could also feel some turbulence, particularly if China starts selling some of its US bonds, or if the US dollar surges as investors flock to \"safe havens\".\nAlthough some investors are hopeful that China could about to unveil new spending initiatives to boost flagging growth, Buiter is sceptical. \"The policy response to the weakening of domestic (and external) demand in China is likely to be too little and too late.\"\nHe warns that the Chinese economy is not a centrally planned command economy, but \"is a messy market economy of the state-capitalist/crony-capitalist variety, where policy ambitions are not matched with effective policy instruments.\"\nWhat's more, Buiter notes that Beijing's mishandling of the bursting of its housing and share market bubbles, as well as last month's kerfuffle over the yuan \"don't inspire confidence in the ability of the authorities to prevent a cyclical hard landing for China\".\nAlthough a 2016 recession could be avoided if the developed world eased monetary and fiscal policies, Buiter argues that most rich countries are running low on ammunition, either because interest rates are already close to zero, or because governments are already straining under large debt burdens.\n\"Today, the interest rate is out of commission as a policy instrument in most developed markets and fiscal space is more severely constrained than in 2008 almost everywhere,\" he says.\nPressure on central banks As a result, he says, there will be pressure on the central banks in Europe, the United States and Japan to provide extra monetary stimulus, by boosting or renewing their bond buying programs, even though these have become progressively less effective in boosting growth.\nBut even though he expects to see central banks in the US, the UK, Europe and Japan flooding the market with liquidity, Buiter predicts \"this will not be enough to prevent most advanced economies from performing worse in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015\".\nAlthough he believes that we're unlikely to see a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis or a Depression-like slump in economic activity, he warns that the outlook could become more worrying if investors suddenly panic about growing government debts, or if politicians resort to protectionism or currency devaluations.\nBuiter is conscious that his gloomy prognosis is at odds with many other leading economists who are more sanguine that advanced economies will be insulated from the problems in China.\nHowever, he notes that \"economists seldom call recessions, downturn, recoveries or periods of boom, unless they are staring them in the face\", adding that \"we believe this may be one of those times\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-10T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:08:21.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
