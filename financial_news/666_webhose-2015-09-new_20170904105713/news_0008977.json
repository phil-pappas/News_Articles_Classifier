The brokerage said that insurers have been constantly reducing their equity holdings, which should mean that they are better placed to invest more capital in overseas business expansion, which in turn leads to a higher return on equity.\nExporters were in demand as well. Toyota Motor Corp jumped 3.5 percent and Nissan Motor Co surged 3.0 percent.\nThe broader Topix rose 1.9 percent to 1,493.67 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 1.9 percent to 13,416.56.\n(Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T05:39:39.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
