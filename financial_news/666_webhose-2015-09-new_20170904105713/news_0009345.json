The agreement extends Just Energy's credit facility for an additional three years to September 1, 2018. The line has been set at $277.5 million with an accordion for Just Energy to draw up to $350 million. \n\"We are extremely pleased with the agreement reached with a number of our traditional banking partners and the addition of new partners,\" says Deb Merril, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Just Energy. \"The Board and management team have taken swift action over the past year to place the Company on secure financial footing which has now allowed the Company to access the credit markets and secure increased capacity, a longer term arrangement and favorable rates. Securing the new credit facility validates our Company's strong business model and long-term outlook, and reflects strong lender confidence in Just Energy while providing the Company with increased financial flexibility to support our growth strategy, which focuses on new geographies, innovative products that meet customers' changing demands, and new energy management solutions that will continue to disrupt the traditional utility model.\" \n\"The new facility, combined with strong earnings and cash flow generation, exceeds our working capital liquidity needs and our expected growth investment requirements for the next three years,\" added Pat McCullough, Just Energy's CFO. \"Debt reduction remains a clear priority for Just Energy. Over the past year, we have reduced our debt by $359.7 million, or 34.7%. While much has been accomplished to improve the overall balance sheet and debt position, management feels there's more that can be done. Securing the favorable credit facility was the next step in a logical, financially prudent plan to further reduce debt. We are now positioned to unlock non-core asset divestiture proceeds to be utilized for certain debt restructuring and to continue supporting our annual dividend commitment to our shareholders.\" \nAbout Just Energy Group Inc.: \nEstablished in 1997, Just Energy (NYSE:JE)(TSX:JE) is an energy management solutions provider specializing in electricity, natural gas, solar and green energy.
