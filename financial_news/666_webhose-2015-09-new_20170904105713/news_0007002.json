Purchasers have been supposed to figure out proper tax payments in the past. \nThe program comes as the state is trying to plug a $200 million shortfall in the operating budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. \nA special legislative session failed to fix the problem, and another one begins Tuesday. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T13:59:00.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
