Fluor will also share its expertise on proprietary engineering and project execution tools and systems with selected Sasol Group Technology employees through on-the-job participation. Projects covered in the agreement range from conceptual studies to full engineering, procurement and construction management. \n“We are delighted that Sasol has selected Fluor as its partner to execute a wide range of projects across their facilities in South Africa,” said Taco de Haan, president of Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals Europe, Africa and Middle East business line. “With this collaboration agreement our organizations will work jointly to maximize capital efficiency across a broad range of Sasol projects. This marks the continuation of a successful relationship that has spanned more than half a century and includes some of South Africa’s landmark projects.” \nFluor’s relationship with Sasol dates back to the award of the first project in Sasolburg in the early 1960s. In 1975, Fluor was named the managing contractor by Sasol to provide engineering, procurement and construction management services for Sasol II, and later for Sasol III, the oil-from-coal complexes, and has since supported various other Sasol projects. \nAbout Fluor Corporation \nFluor Corporation ( FLR ) is a global engineering and construction firm that designs and builds some of the world's most complex projects.
