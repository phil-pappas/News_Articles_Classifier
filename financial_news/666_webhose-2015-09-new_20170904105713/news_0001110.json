AAP Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Former construction union official Dave Hanna said he told union national secretary Michael O'Connor that tonnes of documents were removed from the union's Queensland office on the day subpoenas were issued by the trade union royal commission.\nGiving evidence to the commission on Tuesday, Mr Hanna, a former Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union national president, accused the union's Queensland secretary, Michael Ravbar, of organising the removal because the union was about to receive an order from the commission to produce papers.\nMr Hanna said Mr Ravbar had banners put over the office security cameras to ensure the removal of the documents could not be recorded. He said CFMEU documents were shredded \"for a day or two\" by staff.\nMr Hanna said he later showed Mr O'Connor a copy of the receipt for the tip truck that was used to dump the tonnes of union documents into a Queensland tip in April last year.\nCFMEU's Michael O'Connor. Mr Hanna, said he showed Mr O'Connor a copy of the receipt for the tip truck. AAP Section 39 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act carries a maximum prison term of five years for the destruction of documents.\n\"I just said [to Mr O'Connor] we got rid of the documents from the office,\" Mr Hanna said. \"This is a receipt for the tip truck that took the documents away from the property.\"\nOn Monday, under cross-examination, Mr Hanna denied showing a receipt to Mr O'Connor.\nAt the time he spoke to Mr O'Connor, the union's senior officials were meeting to consider a complaint by Mr Ravbar against Mr Hanna alleging he obtained thousands of dollars to pay for the IVF treatment of a union organiser and his partner.\n Mr Hanna told the commission on Tuesday that he was \"angry\" and told Mr O'Connor that he could not believe that Mr Ravbar was \"trying to chop off my head\". He said he told Mr O'Connor that the documents were moved from the union office on the same day that the union was supposed to receive the commission order to hand over documents.\nMr Hanna said Mr O'Connor was pre-occupied doing paperwork and glanced at the receipt. \"I took it that he thought I was just trying one on and, you know, trying to do a bit of tit for tat,\" he said.\nMr Hanna said after Mr Ravbar made the complaint about the IVF allegations, which led to Mr Hanna's resignation, he drove out to the tip truck company and obtained a copy of the receipt.\nHe said the receipt had been made out to him. He said he deleted his name, and added Mr Ravbar's name and the CFMEU, before showing it to Mr O'Connor.\nMr Hanna also provided further details about how a horse float was used to take the tonnes of papers from the CFMEU office to his property.\nAfter staff unsuccessfully tried to burn them, Mr Hanna said he ordered the truck, telling the company \"they need to be dumped in a secure fashion and covered\".\nHe said he used a backhoe to load the boxes of documents onto the truck, and dirt was put on top of the documents to hold them down.\nCFMEU bookkeeper Cherie Shaw told the hearing that Mr Hanna later told her to \"get rid\" of the receipt recording the $770 payment for the tip truck hire.\nLeo Skourdoumbis, who was secretly recorded being told by Mr Hanna about the documents destruction, told the hearing on Tuesday that he did not take action over the allegations because he regarded it as the latest unfounded claim by Mr Hanna in his dispute with Mr Ravbar.\nOn Tuesday, the commission released the full transcript of the secretly recorded conversation in which Mr Skourdoumbis, who was appointed to investigate Mr Hanna, gives him a \"heads up\" that he will not be recommending Mr Hanna be charged by the union over the IVF payments.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-22T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:59:30.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
