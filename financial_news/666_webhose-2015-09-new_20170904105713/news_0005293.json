We do not want governments regulating this because they will always regulate the wrong thing. We know that from history,\" Ms Westacott said on Thursday. \"It's hugely important that boards have conversations on these issues.\" Speaking at an Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce event in Sydney, Ms Westacott and AMP Capital managing director Stephen Dunne acknowledged it is difficult for boards to reconcile a desire to adhere to a moral code while fulfilling their ultimate responsibility to their shareholders. But Ms Westacott said most people want to be proud of their organisations. \"Ultimately, organisations are people so when we talk about organisations we're talking about people. People innovate, people decide whether to act ethically,\" she said. Mr Dunne said only $30 billion out of $2 trillion invested in superannuation funds was centred on ethical investing, but that Australians are taking increasing notice of where their money is going. \"We're only now starting to see individuals understand they're part of a system and they need to be accountable not only for themselves and not only to their firm but they need to have a broader view of the industry they are part of,\" he said.
