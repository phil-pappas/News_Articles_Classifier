Photo: Channel Ten\nWhile Sam Wood and Snezana Markovski declared their love in the season finale of The Bachelor last night, there's something we can all learn from the hit show.\nSo while we're saying goodbye after 16 drama-fuelled episodes, there are some key takeouts that you – yes, you – can apply to your own life right now.\nAnd no, I'm not referring to your love life!\nIf you really want to live happily ever after, The Bachelor has taught us a thing or two about how you should approach banking.\nAdvertisement Just like your life partner, your bank should be there for you on your life journey, in good times and bad times, and help you when you need them most.\nHere's how to bank like The Bachelor:\nKeep an open mind There's nothing wrong with exploring your options (hey, it's the entire premise of the show and the ratings have proven its popularity!). The key is, to keep an open mind – just like Sam did when Snezana Markovski dropped that bombshell in the very first episode of the season. But the fact that she had a daughter did not bother Sam – rather, as we now all know, this didn't affect his overall decision when it came to choosing who he wanted in his future. The lesson here is, withhold all judgement until you do your research. It's ok to switch If you treat your banks like a singleton looking for the perfect \"one\", you won't feel ashamed to switch around. When you're after a banking product that satisfies your needs, you need to look after your number one – you! And if your bank doesn't come to the party with what you need or want, then switch to one that will. Just like The Bachelor's polygamous dating soirees, you need to make sure your bank is compatible with you, so get out there and be a little promiscuous while on your search. Don't commit until you're ready Never jump into the deep end until you've had a good think about what you need and understand what you're getting. Because when the honeymoon's over (and for Sam's case, when the cameras are gone) you want to make sure you've made the right choice. Just like the women on the show, banks are super competitive and it can become catty out there, especially if they know you're \"shopping around\". And if it doesn't work out, you can always find something better.\nMichelle Hutchison is the money expert for finder.com.au , one of the biggest online comparison networks in Australia, and the newly launched finder.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.finder.com.au/bank-accounts"], "published": "2015-09-18T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:24:32.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
