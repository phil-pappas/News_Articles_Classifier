Picture: TREVOR SAMSON Related articles NEWS ANALYSIS: Muthambi stance on SABC’s Motsoeneng sets bad precedent SABC’s executive purges ‘have cost more than R42m’ Court to deliberate on Madonsela’s legal clout In this article Companies and organisations: Democratic Alliance | South African Broadcasting Corporation | Public Protector People: Thuli Madonsela SUPREME Court of Appeal justices suggested on Friday that using the word \"binding\" when it came to the findings of the public protector was \"unhelpful\" and \"misleading\".\nWhether Thuli Madonsela’s reports are binding on their subjects has been the subject of prologued an increasingly heated debate. It was a central question in the court battle between the SABC, Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, the Democratic Alliance and the Public Protector over her report into CEO Hlaudi Motsoeneng.\nIn her report \"When Governance and Ethics Fail\", Ms Madonsela directed that Mr Motsoeneng, then acting, face a disciplinary process for dishonesty over his matric qualifications, increasing his salary by over R1m in a single year and purging of senior staff. Following the report, the SABC did not initiate a disciplinary process and instead, a few months later, appointed him permanently.\nThe DA then went to court asking it to set aside the permanent appointment (Part B) and, in the meantime, to compel the SABC to embark on the disciplinary process and also suspend Mr Motsoeneng (Part A).\nThe High Court granted the DA’s Part A application, saying that although the public protector’s findings were not binding, they could not be ignored and could only be rejected if there was a rational basis to do so.\nOn Friday some of the justices of the Supreme Court of Appeal were critical of the High Court judgment, saying that it was hard to find a \"consistent thread\"; that it was internally contradictory and that parts of it were \"at war with each other\".\nThe justices seemed baffled by the use of \"binding\" as a concept, saying it was not helpful in understanding what the constitution meant when it gave the public protector the power to \"take appropriate remedial action.\"\nIn an exchange between the SABC’s counsel, Hamilton Maenetje SC, and Justice Mahomed Navsa, Mr Maenetje agree that, in terms of the constitution, the public protector was a \"watchdog\" whose teeth were the \"remedial action\" that she was entitled to take under the Constitution.\n\"So the next thing we have to figure out is how long and how sharp are the teeth,\" he said.\nMr Maenetje defended the high court position that, while a public protector report could not be ignored, it could be rejected if there was a rational basis to do so. The rejection had to be justified he said.\nBut this too was met with a number of questions, with some of the justices asking who would determine whether it was rational and what basis, in law, there could be for a parallel process.\nIn Mr Motsoeneng’s case, the SABC established a panel of attorneys to review the report. On this Justica Navsa said it could become never-ending, a case of \"Who guards the guardian’s guardian?\"\"We could go on forever, with everybody second-guessing\".\nMs Madonsela’s counsel, Gilbert Marcus SC, agreed to dispense with the word binding saying the remedial action taken by the public protector \"has legal effect unless, and until, set aside\" by a court.\nHe said that even though Ms Madonsela was accountable to Parliament, this was purely a reporting accountability and even Parliament could not set aside her remedial action.\n\"It’s a reporting function, nothing more,\" he said.\nMr Marcus also disagreed with the idea that, once the public protector had released her final report, there could be further \"engagement\" with the public protector.\n\"There has to be an end to the process,\" he said.\nA large portion of the hearing was also spent debating a way to resolve the \"problem\" that there was still Part B of the case, yet to be heard by the High Court.\nSuggestions from the bench that the parties allow the disciplinary process to go ahead, then let the high court hear Part B, and leave the \"deep philosophical questions\" about th public protectors powers for a later date, was rejected by the DA.\nCounsel for Mr Motsoeneng, Norman Arendse SC, said his client would be happy with it as he wanted to clear his name. But the DA’s counsel, Anton Katz SC, said if Mr Hlaudi was not suspended — as per the High Court order — the disciplinary process would be \"severely compromised\".\nJudgment was reserved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T14:37:13.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
