Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Will it or won't it? It's the question the world's been asking for at least the past few months, as the US Federal Reserve mulls its first rate rise in six years .\nDeutsche Bank has now revised its rate rise forecast from September to October, as several prominent economists stress global markets are too volatile to withstand the move.\nRegardless of whether it's this month, next month or even next year, an important question investors should ask is how it would affect your portfolio? As the anecdote goes, when the US sneezes the world catches a cold and even if its economic indicators suggest the US economy could withstand a small rise, there could be a short-term ripple effect that will rattle your investment picks.\nAnalysts say some impacts could be almost immediate, while others would be more gradual and some asset classes won't feel a pinch.\nBONDS A US interest rate rise could be welcome news for bond investors who have trudged through years of low yields.\n\"We forget sometimes that higher interest rates are ultimately a good thing for some investors [including those in] bonds because it means the amount of income they're earning has gone up,\" said Jeffrey Johnson, head of investment strategy at Vanguard Australia.\nA Fed rate rise would also encourage more investors into the bond market, which could offset a significant lift in yield or downward move in prices though, he said.\n And just because the US bond market may get a kick, doesn't mean all markets will fall in line.\n\"One of the concerns we have is people assume that that a Fed rate rise means bond markets globally are going to see higher yields and we believe that is a misplaced,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"Historically we've seen quite a few periods where yield movements have varied from one country and one bond market to another and we would urge investors to remember that with their bond portfolio global diversification works to their benefit.\"\nHe compels investors to not try and time the market or to forget the prospect of a rate rise has already been timed into the market.\n\"If you look at the Treasury bond market, forward yield curves price in a rate rise among short term bonds, but there's less of a move upwards in the years ahead in intermediate to long term bonds,\" he said.\nCASH Cash is another asset class that has been in the doldrums for some time, which is great if you have a mortgage but can be punishing if you're trying to save the safe way or are retired.\nA Fed rate rise is unlikely to shift cash rates in either direction - at least not quickly, according to Mr Johnson.\n\"So from the standpoint of Australian investors, what's going to be very critical for the cash rate here is the health of the economy locally and the direction that the Reserve Bank takes with the cash rate,\" he said.\n\"On those factors, the market is not pricing in an increase.\"\nIn fact, based on local economic factors there's some indication the RBA could cut rates, Mr Johnson said.\nThe result there would be even lower returns for investors with a heavy concentration in conservative assets, like cash and term deposits.\nSHARES The sharemarket has been volatile in the past few weeks, partly in anticipation of the first major parting of ways in global rate policy since the global financial crisis.\n\"This policy divergence is really creating a lot of volatility in markets; you add on top of that slowdown in China and some concerns about the authority's ability to manage the Chinese economy and you get extreme volatility,\" said Stephen Halmarick, head of economic and market research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management.\nA US rate rise could actually settle markets, which have been reacting to speculation, said Mr Halmarick.\n\"A lot of people are saying they shouldn't raise rates because there's a lot of volatility in markets, they should wait, but who's to say by waiting the volatility will die down? It may get worse.\n\"My view is the Fed should tighten this week and at least then we'll have more certainty in markets.\"\nFor long-term investors, there's little reason to get caught up in the hysteria and realign your portfolio for what could be just a blip.\n\"If they do tighten this week, they'll accompany the tightening with a pretty dovish statement emphasising how gradual the process is going to be,\" he said.\nThe winners from a Fed rate rise would be industries leveraged to a lower dollar, like tourism, education, financial services and exports, he said.\nPROPERTY Property investors needn't be too worried about the Fed raising rates, but the flow-on consequences could be worth keeping an eye on.\nThe next real litmus test will be if the Reserve Bank of Australia lifts the cash rate in February, something that could re-spark the interests of foreign investors who appear to have fled the market, according to Louis Christopher, an analyst at SQM research.\nThe Fed's next move won't be directly negligible, he said, but the impacts likely to trickle down may have an impact on buyer sentiment.\n\"It may well mean that the RBA doesn't need to cut rates. At the moment, the market is pricing in that the RBA will have to cut rates by February next year – that's what the market believes might happen,\" he said.\n\"If the Fed lifts rates, that may put the RBA on the sidelines. If we do get that [RBA] rate cut, that would definitely stimulate the market place.\n\"I am well aware if the Fed does lift rates, it would put downward pressure on our dollar, which would actually be positive for the housing market,\" he said.\nBut Mr Christopher said there are a number of pressure points for the property market – some pushing an expansion, others dampening demand, and the true impact will come from a combination of factors.\n\"You've got the Australia Prudential Regulation Authority trying to put the brakes on. I'm getting some anecdotal evidence that overseas foreign investors have stopped buying. You've got the lower Australian dollar and low interest rates overall, which is helping the market. You've got the mining downturn that's affecting all mining-related property markets, then you've got a booming NSW state economy. It's quite a mix out there.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-countdown-to-fed-20150913-gjlrni.html", "https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-09-14T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:03:55.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
