Mahindra improves the most (+44 points), followed by Renault (+28) and Nissan (+23), it said.\n“Consumers are likely to have a more favourable opinion of a brand that has been in the market for several years versus one that is a recent entrant,” JD Power Asia Pacific Executive Director Mohit Arora said.\nFor a relatively new entrant, the progression of brand influence depends on how a brand engages and builds relationships with its initial base of customers, thereby creating a positive word of mouth, he added.\nAccording to the survey, Datsun (555) and Mitsubishi (580) are among brands with the lowest influence.\nThe 2015 study is based on interviews with 8,507 car owners who have owned their vehicles from 30 to 42 months and were asked to compare two vehicle brands.\nThe study was fielded from January through April 2015 across 30 cities in India.\n 16, 2015 3:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T06:14:50.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
