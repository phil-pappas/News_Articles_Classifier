In the broad landscape of ChatApps, there still is no ChatApp that is \"Social Network Included\". And yet more and more users are asking for social networking websites to be included in Instant Messaging Apps to bridge the divide between these two competing media.\nThis is the result of an exclusive survey on ChatApps conducted by ChatSim - the world’s first Instant Messaging Mobile Operator ( http://www.chatsim.com ). It was presented officially at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco (September 21-23, 2015), the world’s most important competition in the field of technological innovation and the go-to event for the launch of revolutionary start-ups. ChatSim was created as the world’s first SIM card that lets you chat free of charge, anywhere and with no limits, even without Wi-Fi using Instant Messaging Apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook\nMessenger, WeChat and many other apps available for smartphones and tablets.\nWhat’s better than a survey on ChatApps by ChatSim, the SIM card designed specifically for chatting? Once again, Manuel Zanella, (38 years old), ChatSim CEO - and already founder and CEO of Zeromobile, Italy’s first Global Mobile Operator for low-cost roaming ( http://www.zeromobile.it ) - came up with this idea and tasked his company’s R&D Dept. with conducting the survey.\n\"It is the first survey on the world of Instant Messaging that has involved users who use a SIM card designed specifically for chatting as their main means of communication.\" As Zanella stressed, \"This is what makes our survey different from all other surveys on the world of social media in general. We decided to present the data at a venue as lively and important as TechCrunch in San Francisco where we’ve already launched successfully other ChatSim products, including ChatSim World, the world’ most efficient and advanced SIM card designed for chatting.\"\nThe survey by ChatSim was conducted on 1000 interviewees in August 2015. The information considered the points of view of both men and women divided into age groups. The data shows that ChatApp users are aged 25 to 50 years of age. Use is almost identical in the 25-35 and 35-50 age groups.\nWith regard to the operating system used, Android stands at 54% of users and iOS at 40%. This shows that iOS users are above the world average of users.\nWhen asked \"What ChatApp do you usually use?\", the data confirms that WhatsApp ranks first, accounting for 75% of the apps. Facebook Messenger comes in second at 5%, followed by Wechat at 4% and Telegram at 3.4%. The figures for all other apps are almost negligible.\nWith regard to the second most used app, the figures speak for themselves: Messenger wins hands down with 40%. WhatsApp stands at 12%. Adding this figure to the one discussed above, almost 90% of users use WhatsApp as their first or second app. Telegram beats WeChat.\nThe survey also showed that 1 out of 4 users has 3 IM apps installed on their mobile device and 40% have 4 or more apps. Just 13% have one app alone. Conclusion: while WhatsApp is number one by far, users tend to try other IM apps as well. About 40% of users use 2 or 3 IM apps and just 27% use one.\nWhatsApp is considered the best app by 2 out of 3 users. Messenger follows with 6%. The main reason is that it can be used on several devices, as confirmed by 54% of users. What is even more important than it being for free and having no ads is that registration is easy. According to the results, 2 out of 3 users are willing to pay for the app and/or to receive ads.\nLooking at usage time, it is interesting to note that 30% of users use apps between 30 minutes and 1 hours a day. About 30% use them for less than half an hour and 16% for 1 to 2 hours.\nText messages are the most commonly shared content accounting for 90% of cases, followed by photos at 75%. Emoji rank third at 55%. Videos reach a mere 27%.\nFiles are exchanged in 10% of cases. In over 80% of cases, apps are used to message with friends and 72% with close relatives. They are used a lot for work too (1 out of 2 users).\nOne last interesting finding is that 75% of users say that IM apps are the most important. Calls account for just 4%. The figure for text messages is negligible. As shown in other recent surveys (e.g., the Digital, Social & Mobile 2015 report by We Are Social), the decline of calls and text messages as well as traditional social networks is a matter of fact.\nAnd yet when asked \"If you could invent a ChatApp, what characteristics would it have?\", the majority of users said that it should be able to include social networks in Instant Messaging Apps. About 30% of interviewees indicated this as the most important option. Zanella concluded saying, \"It is a very interesting tip to bridge the ‘divide’ between social networks and ChatApps. Social networks should perhaps reinvent themselves becoming apps to stop this feared decline.\"\nThanks to ChatSim, you can chat for free and with no limits at all, exchanging text messages and emoji for a year with just 10.
