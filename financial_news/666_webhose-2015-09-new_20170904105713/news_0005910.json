It is not easy to imitate and that is possibly an entry barrier to smaller insurance and reinsurance companies,\" Blunck said.\nA report this week said cyber insurance could triple to $7.5 billion in annual premiums by 2020.\nSwiss Re also said simply closing the protection gap - by making more natural disasters and other risks insurable - could help stabilise price levels.\nSome observers see a risk of greater losses from natural catastrophes after several benign years. Natural catastrophes in emerging markets also tend to be under-insured, providing a growth opportunity.\nMunich Re said growth in primary insurance would accelerate to 3 percent per year in 2015-2017 from 1 percent in the previous seven years, with Asia-Pacific and Latin America leading the pack. This would help underpin reinsurance growth of 1 percent per year in 2015-2017, it said.\nHannover Re also said increased demand should improve pricing.\nHowever, reinsurers' hoped-for rise in demand may not happen quickly and with enough volume to make a big dent in the current over-supply of reinsurance capital, which continues to drive down prices.\nCredit ratings agencies still expect price declines in single digit percentages, compared with double-digit falls in the past few years.\nReinsurance prices and returns have dropped in recent years, driven down by reduced demand as insurance company clients chose to keep more risk, and profit, on their own books.\nCheaper products such as catastrophe bonds have also provided an alternative to traditional reinsurance and attracted yield-hungry institutional investors, who have enjoyed a windfall from years of below-normal damage claims from hurricanes or earthquakes.\nMunich Re said that while the pressure on reinsurance prices had lessened, it had not ended.\n\"This is not a trend that goes into the reverse direction; it was (just) a slower rate reduction,\" Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek said.\n\"Price competition is not over,\" he added.
