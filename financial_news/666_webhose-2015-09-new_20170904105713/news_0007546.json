We just don't have enough airline capacity, we don't have enough transportation capacity, we certainly don't have enough hotel capacity,\" Mr Bekier told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney. \n\"We don't have enough language skills, our signs are not in foreign languages, we may not be competitive enough with our visa regulations.\" \nEcho is focused on the hotel part of the equation, having recently won the right to build a new five-hotel casino resort in Brisbane. But Mr Bekier says more needs to be done to catch the wave of cashed-up Chinese travellers now looking beyond Hong Kong and Macau for their next holiday. \nThere are between two and four million millionaires in China now, Mr Bekier estimates, and their taste is for business class flights and five-star hotels when they take a holiday. \n\"We are now at the cusp of the wave hitting Australia and other markets,\" Mr Bekier said. \n\"What excites us is this isn't just a wave. This is a rising sea level because behind the first wave of tourists that are now coming there's millions more.\" \nMr Bekier said Australia was taking too long to simplify entry requirements for Chinese tourists while competing holiday destinations were aggressively chasing market share. \n\"I think I called it an arms race: around the world right now there's about $1.3 trillion of tourism infrastructure being developed,\" he said. \n\"Countries are making it easy for people to come and visit not just once but multiple times. \n\"That's what we have to compete against. We can't just sit back and say `well our beaches are better'.\" \nEcho is focusing on the next wave of \"mass-affluent\" punters who follow in the wake of high-roller pioneers. \nMr Bekier said China would be the key market for the next 30 years but also that China was \"shorthand\" for the broader Asian region, which will also generate wealthy tourists as more people move into the middle class. \nHe also said competition with James Packer's new high-end casino at Barangaroo would be a positive for Sydney when the $2 billion facility opens in 2019. \n\"I think for the international VIP, Sydney as a destination will become a lot more interesting because now you will have two high-end casinos with two separate experiences across the harbour, with two separate credit opportunities,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:28:13.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
