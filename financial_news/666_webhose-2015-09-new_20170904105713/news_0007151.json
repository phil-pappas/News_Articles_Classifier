Louise Kennerley by Sally Rose Equip Super has bought a 27 per cent stake in local start-up Clover to launch a \"robo-advice\" platform in early 2016 aimed at improving engagement with younger fund members.\n\"We want to make superannuation more relevant to our younger members and help them balance the competing interests of saving for retirement with all the other important things they want to spend money on now,\" Equip Super chief executive Danielle Press said.\n\"It simply doesn't resonate to just keep telling people in their 30s and 40s to save more for retirement when they have university debts, mortgages, and school fees on their mind. Our members need personalised advice.\"\nMs Press said she hoped the $7 billion fund's new platform for goals-based online advice would fill a gap in the market.\nClover co-founder and chief executive Harry Chemay (pictured third from left) and the rest of the six person Clover team. Supplied \"It is aimed at those people who don't want to use a full financial planning service. Many busy working people would also rather use an online tool at a time that suits them than the phone contact service\".\nUndisclosed sum Equip previously employed Clover co-founder and chief executive Harry Chemay as a senior consultant on the development of its MyPension product.\nMs Press would not disclose how much Equip paid for the 27 per cent stake in Clover, but said she was confident the deal would benefit her fund's members.\n \"We looked very hard for an off-the-shelf solution in the US, UK or Europe that we could adapt to the local market but couldn't find anything suitable so decided to work with a trusted partner on developing a custom platform,\" Ms Press said.\n\"To to bring a team of developers in house would have cost substantially more and risked leaving us with a platform that had legacy issues in a few years' time. This way we can make sure the technology we need can continue to evolve in a sustainable way\".\nIt is also hoped that the improved online advice service will help the public offer fund attract more younger members.\nEquip Super is a non-profit industry fund with $7 billion in funds under management on behalf of 48,000 members. More than half, 55 per cent, of Equip members are 30 to 49, the demographic being targeted by its investment in online advice. The average member balance is $146,000.\nIt is the biggest investment in technology the fund has made since Ms Press took the reins as CEO five years ago.\nBusiness plan Ahead of the government's formal response to last year's financial system inquiry chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, super funds with less than $10 billion in funds under management are under increasing pressure from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to show how they are delivering value to members .\nSuperannuation research house Chant West has calculated about 80 super funds are at risk of being deemed \"sub-scale\" in the coming years . These funds are set to create a growing market for the sort of technology Equip and Clover are developing.\nAfter Equip's \"robo-advice\" platform is rolled out early in 2016, it is anticipated Clover will start selling solutions based on the technology to other funds.\n\"It's easier to order a pizza online and track its progress to your door than it is to set your financial goals online and track their progress to attainment. We aim to change that,\" Mr Chemay said.\n\"The future of personal financial management is online, secure, inexpensive and available 24/7 at the click of a mouse or touch of a screen\".\nTo date, most robo-advice solutions have targeted self-managed superannuation funds and non-superannuation investors rather than members of managed funds.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/chant-west-says-80-super-funds-should-be-closed-20150803-giq6if.html"], "published": "2015-09-28T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:59:17.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
