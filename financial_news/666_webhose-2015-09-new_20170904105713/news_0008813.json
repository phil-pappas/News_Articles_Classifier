Initially commodity-focused, these commodity trading advisers' funds now invest across futures markets and are typically computer driven.\nMore from the Financial Times:\nInflows put hedge funds' business model to the test\nLoeb ruling raises hurdles for activists\nWhen to ditch an underperforming hedge fund\nThese investors, along with \"smart beta\" passive equity strategies that have become increasingly popular, adjust their exposures according to algorithms in response to market moves, and spikes in volatility can trigger a rash of automated selling.\n\"These technical factors can push the market away from fundamentals,\" Marko Kolanovic, a senior JPMorgan strategist, noted in a widely circulated report last week. \"The obvious risk is if these technical flows outsize fundamental buyers.\n\"In the current environment of low liquidity, they may cause a market crash such as the one we saw on [August 24]. These investors are selling equities and will negatively impact the market over coming days and weeks.\"\nChina's stock slump hit this fund particularly hard Risk parity is the strategy that has aroused the most attention recently, and now boasts as much as $600bn of assets under management, excluding leverage that multiplies its influence. These funds seek to create a blended but dynamically adjusted portfolio of stocks, bonds and commodities balanced by the respective volatility of the asset classes, rather than traditional capital allocations.\nThe strategy was pioneered by Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world, and its mostly superlative performance has helped it spread to pension funds and insurers across the world and spurred imitators at other asset managers.\nHowever, risk parity funds first came unstuck in 2013, when bond markets were severely rattled by the Federal Reserve's plans to unwind its quantitative easing programme, and are now suffering another bad summer. A JPMorgan index of 17 RP funds lost more than 8 per cent between the beginning of May and the end of last month, compared with the S&P 500's 6.5 per cent drop over that time.\nSome analysts and investors fear a self-reinforcing cycle of selling, as RP funds and other volatility-sensitive trading strategies respond to the recent bout of turmoil. Mr Kolanovic estimates that the selling pressure could reach $300bn over the next three weeks, and some big traditional investors are perturbed at the consequences.\nHedge funds are still beating you during selloff \"Risk parity has definitely contributed to the volatility,\" said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance. \"There's not enough liquidity when all the elephants are trying to squeeze through the door.\"\nTod Nasser, the investment head of Pacific Life Insurance Company, stresses that the markets have tumbled mainly due to fundamental concerns, but also argues that risk parity has aggravated the recent turbulence. \"We've seen some extreme moves over very short periods that have been triggered by some very large flows,\" he said.\nMr Cooperman, meanwhile, maintains his faith that US stocks will end the year higher. \"If the US equity bull market is over, it will be the oddest ending to a bull market in the postwar period,\" his letter added. \"We believe that the bulk of US equity market damage has been done.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3719a682-4a2d-11e5-9b5d-89a026fda5c9.html#axzz3kXM3G38a", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6a570b56-4aa6-11e5-9b5d-89a026fda5c9.html#axzz3kXM3G38a", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/703cd960-5163-11e5-8642-453585f2cfcd.html#axzz3kXM3G38a"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:01:07.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
