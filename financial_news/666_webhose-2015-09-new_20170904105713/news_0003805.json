Vietnam was on \ncourse for a 2.8 percent gain, while Indonesia and the \nPhilippines headed for a weekly loss. \nSingapore, which was closed on Friday for a polling \nday, posted a weekly gain of 0.9 percent after seven straight \nweeks of falls. \nEnergy shares were outperformers across exchanges, led by a \n6.6 percent surge in Indonesia's Perusahaan Gas Negara \n. Philippine Manila Electric rose 0.9 percent \nand Thai Oil increased 2.9 percent. \nAsian shares rose following gains on Wall Street, while the \ndollar firmed after facing pressure from a rise in the yuan, but \ngains were capped by uncertainty over whether the Federal \nReserve will raise interest rates next week. \nFor Asian Companies click;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T08:09:54.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
