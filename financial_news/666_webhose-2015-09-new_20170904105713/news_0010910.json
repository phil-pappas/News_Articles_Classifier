The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer.\nThe framework requires RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs every year in August starting from August 2015.\nSystemically important banks are perceived as banks that are ‘Too Big To Fail (TBTF)’. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks at the time of distress. Due to this perception, these banks enjoy certain advantages in the funding markets.\nHowever, the perceived expectation of government support amplifies risk-taking, reduces market discipline, creates competitive distortions, and increases the probability of distress in the future.\nIn October 2010, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommended that all member countries needed to have in place a framework to reduce risks attributable to Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) in their jurisdictions.\nBased on the data as on March 31, 2013, it is expected that about four to six banks may be designated as D-SIBs under various buckets.\nSome banks, due to their size, cross-jurisdictional activities, complexity, lack of substitutability and interconnectedness, become systemically important.\nThe disorderly failure of these banks has the potential to cause significant disruption to the essential services they provide to the banking system, and in turn, to the overall economic activity.\nTherefore, the continued functioning of systemically important banks is critical for the uninterrupted availability of essential banking services to the real economy, RBI said.\nThe assessment methodology adopted by RBI is primarily based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) methodology for identifying the G-SIBs with suitable modifications to capture domestic importance of a bank.\nThe indicators which would be used for assessment are: size, interconnectedness, substitutability and complexity. Based on the sample of banks chosen for computation of their systemic importance, a relative composite systemic importance score of the banks will be computed. RBI will determine a cut-off score beyond which banks will be considered as D-SIBs.\nFirst Published on August 31, 2015 7:40 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:59:17.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
