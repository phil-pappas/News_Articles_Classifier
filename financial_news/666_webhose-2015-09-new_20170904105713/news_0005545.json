The company was charged for not disclosing the safety concerns related to the faulty ignition switches to regulators, in turn misleading consumers. The automaker signed a deferred-prosecution agreement as part of the settlement.\n\nGeneral Motors made a formal apology for the delay in informing the concerned regulators about the defective switches. The company is presently focusing on investigating the issue.\n\nUnder the recently penned settlement agreement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has agreed to delay action on the charges against General Motors for three years. Moreover, if the company manages to fulfill the terms of the agreement, the federal prosecutors may eventually dismiss the charges.\n\nPer the terms laid down, General Motors will have to cooperate with the federal government that will create an independent monitor to analyze the automaker’s policies and procedures associated with safety issues and recalls. The company will also have to pay a fine of $900 million, which is likely to be reflected in its third-quarter results.\n\nGeneral Motors is also conducting an efficient internal investigation and providing the details to the government. The automaker also laid off wrongdoers. In addition, General Motors launched a program to compensate the victims and families affected by crashes caused by the ignition switch problem and has set a compensation fund of over $600 million.\n\nGeneral Motors has been in the doldrums for delaying the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches, which led to shutting down of the engine and prevented front air bag deployment in the event of a crash. The company announced a recall pertaining to this issue in Feb 2014, although the problem was identified way back in 2001.\n\nThe automaker is undertaking many initiatives to prevent such issues in future. General Motors’ Global Vehicle Engineering organization was restructured in order to improve cross-system integration and to deliver more consistent performance along with addressing functional safety and compliance in vehicle development. The company also implemented new policies and procedures to accelerate the repair of recalled vehicles.\n\n General Motors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nBetter-ranked stocks in the auto industry include Ford Motor Co. F, PACCAR Inc. PCAR and Penske Automotive Group, Inc. PAG, all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
