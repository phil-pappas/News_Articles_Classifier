Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Angus Grigg The Chinese government has tightened restrictions on cash withdrawals from foreign ATMs, a move which could affect tourism spending in Australia and even spill over into the local property market .\nThe crackdown comes three days before the beginning of the week-long national holiday, which will see an influx of big spending Chinese tourists into Australia.\nIt's the latest effort by Beijing to prevent a sharp devaluation of the yuan , which has come under sustained pressure in recent months from record capital outflows as the economy slows.\n\"There is a very big fear from the top leadership that China will experience large capital flight,\" said the chief China economist at ANZ, Liu Li-gang. \"This is an effort to close loop holes and prevent the yuan from depreciating further.\"\nA customer checks his phone as he sits on the set of an Australia promotion at a Chinese shopping mall. Dave Tacon The new rules limit overseas cash withdrawals from China's Union Pay service to a total of 50,000 yuan ($10,800) for the period between October 1 and December 31 this year.\nFor 2016 the limit for an individual is an annual 100,000 yuan ($21,800), according to an announcement posted on the website of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday.\nUnder the old rules, there was a daily limit of 10,000 yuan.\nThis is the first time China has sought to place an annual cap on overseas cash withdrawals from Union Pay and follows a similar crackdown on bank transfers earlier this month.\n \"Cash withdrawals via Union Pay were one of the known legal ways to get money out of the country,\" said one banker who asked not to be named.\nHe said it was possible to withdraw as much as $2,000 a day from a single Chinese account using the Union Pay service at an Australian ATM. He said this process could be repeated from multiple Chinese bank accounts and could easily see $70,000 taken out of China in a single week.\n\"It's a slow process but it's not hard to see how this could form the deposit for a pretty good apartment,\" he said.\nAnother banking industry source said the crackdown on overseas cash withdrawals was a sure sign there was significant \"capital leakage\" via this channel.\n\"It always surprised me that Union Pay was not regulated more strongly,\" he said.\nCash withdrawals are popular among Chinese tourists as they often attract lower fees than using a credit card or debit card.\nMany Chinese students also use cash withdrawals from Union Pay cards to cover living expenses and tuition while overseas.\n\"[The new regulation] just makes it that little bit more difficult to get money out of the country,\" said ANZ's Mr Liu. \"It will be a speed bump for a few months.\"\nHe said there could be some impact on luxury goods retailers and others which rely on discretionary spending, like restaurants.\nIt is unclear at this stage if China's banking system is sophisticated enough to prevent overseas cash withdrawals from multiple accounts held in the same name.\nUnion Pay confirmed to The Australian Financial Review the new restrictions don't apply to purchases using its debit card via a foreign point-of-sale machine.\nCash withdrawals overseas were the easiest way to get around China's closed capital account, which only allows individuals to transfer $US50,000 out of the country each year.\nChina has previously tolerated the many \"grey channels\" used to get around this rule, but has tightened up enforcement in recent months amid fears of capital flight.\nTwo weeks ago the AFR was told Chinese banks had set-up watch lists to monitor unusual foreign exchange transactions.\nThis has seen a crack down on family and friends of those wanting to purchase foreign property, using their US$50,000 quota to transfer money into a single overseas account.\nThe purchaser would often then pay back friends and family in China and then use the offshore money to put down a deposit on an apartment.\nHowever, Chinese banks are now tracking the source of funds for overseas bank accounts which have received more than US$200,000 within 90 days, according to one bank manager, who works in Shanghai for one of the major state-owned banks.\nThe crackdown is also said to be affecting trading companies, which have been asked to submit more supporting documents to verify transactions, according reports in the local media.\nAccording to Bloomberg calculations, China saw a record $US141.7 billion leave the country in August, up from $US125 billion in July, which was also a record high.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-29T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:11:58.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
