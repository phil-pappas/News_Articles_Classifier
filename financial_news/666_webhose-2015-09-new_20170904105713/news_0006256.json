When Mulder boarded another vessel to sail alongside, the yacht’s quiet power came into focus. “I was overwhelmed by the silence. How can such a big object cut through the water without making any sound?” Writer Finn-Olaf Jones expanded on Mulder’s impression of the Swan 115: “It’s more like a floating sculpture than a sailboat. It’s a work of art.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:40:55.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
