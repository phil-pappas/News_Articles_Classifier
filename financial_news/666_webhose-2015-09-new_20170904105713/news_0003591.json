Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The man who was a key part of Peter Costello's success as federal treasurer has come on board as Scott Morrison's chief of staff.\nPhil Gaetjens, worked as Mr Costello's chief of staff from March 1997 until November 2007 and was a principal architect of the GST tax reform package.\nIt comes as former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, who was also involved in introducing the GST, says he would advise Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to defer the tax reform package until after the next election .\nMr Gaetjens has spent the past four years as the secretary treasury for the NSW Liberal government.\nIn April, he announced he wanted to come home to Canberra to spend more time with his family,who are based in the national capital.\nHe stayed on to help NSW Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian implement her first budget which was delivered in June.\nAfter Labor was elected in 2007, Mr Gaetjens worked back a Treasury, spend more than two years in Singapore as the director of the APEC Policy Support Unit and, in 2011, was secretary of the review into the distribution of the GST revenue, undertaken by Nick Greiner, John Brumby and Bruce Carter.\nMr Morrison is close to Mr Costello and confides in him frequently. He sought his advice on what to do on the night of the leadership spill when he was being offered the deputy leadership and, by extension, the treasury, by Tony Abbott, as Mr Abbott sought to save his leadership.\n Mr Morrison plans to model his operations on that of Mr Costello and has picked up other Costello staffers, including Robert Jeremenko who will continue putting together the tax white paper, as he was doing for Joe Hockey.\nAs Treasurer, Mr Morrison will lead the budget razor gang, or the expenditure review committee, with Prime Minister malcolm Turnbull providing \"strategic direction\", as occurred under Mr Costello and John Howard.\nMr Costello was Australia's longest serving treasurer and one of its most successful.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-23T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T07:06:57.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
