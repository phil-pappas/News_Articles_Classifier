Photo: Make\nWynyard railway station, one of the busiest in the city, is set to get a major facelift as part of the $1 billion Wynyard Place project which has been given the green light.\nIt will add more cranes to Sydney's already congested 130 crane-laden skyline and will be carried out amid the pedestrianisation of George Street.\nSydney is in the grip of a building boom with more than $10 billion of new projects across the city from the planned $1 billion upgrade of Circular Quay, including the new $200 million ferry terminals, sweeping out to the $6 billion Barangarooâ€‹ South precinct and the $1 billion-plus International Convention Centre.\nThe suburbs are also alive to the sound of jack hammers.\nAdvertisement Development of Wynyard Place will entail the consolidation of four buildings immediately adjacent to Wynyard Station into one unified centre, including a 27-floor office tower, four levels of retail space and basement parking.\nWith its modern glass facade and natural light, companies such as Google are said to be interested as potential anchor tenants.\nOwners Brookfield Property Partners said in addition to a new modern state-of-the-art office tower at 10 Carrington Street, the project will include the restoration of the historic Shell House and Wynyard Lane.\nUnder the scheme the George Street entrance to Wynyard will be transformed into a grand transit hall and public concourse with new retail and food offerings.\nAt the York Street end of Wynyard will be the new Barangaroo Walk to connect to the 60,000-plus new workers at the western end of the city.\nThe project, which yesterday received State Significant Development (SSD) approval, will start as soon as it gains the final nod from the NSW Government, with completion scheduled for mid-2019.\nBrookfield Property Partners' Australian president and chief operating officer, Kurt Wilkinson, said Wynyard Place will provide \"exceptional amenities and an exciting environment that will draw people together to work, shop, meet and relax\".\nWynyard Place has been designed by international architectural firm Make in collaboration with Sydney-based Architectus.\nMr Wilkinson said the office tower will maximise natural light access and provides large floor space to accommodate the new style of hot desking demanded in a modern business.\nBut before the gain will come the pain, with high-vis vests and dust masks being the necessary attire for workers along George Street for the coming few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:53:04.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
