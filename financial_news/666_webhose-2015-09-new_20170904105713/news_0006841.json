Peter Rae by Phillip Coorey Laura Tingle Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison believes he can increase revenue by growing the economy instead of the overall tax take, putting the government and the Labor opposition at odds over the best way to pay down the budget deficit .\nMr Morrison drew a distinction between his plans and those of shadow treasurer Chris Bowen as the government braced to punch a $20 billion hole in forecast revenue over the next decade by dropping plans to cut university funding in the face of ongoing Senate opposition.\nOn Wednesday Mr Morrison stirred controversy by claiming Australia had a spending problem, not a revenue problem.\nHe told The Australian Financial Review on Thursday he could balance the budget through a combination of spending cuts and reforms to stimulate economic growth which would produce more revenue.\nHe said any changes to the tax mix under the reform package the government will take to the next election would aim to boost productivity and growth but would not result in an overall increase in the tax take and consequently, there would be no increase in the forecast ratio of tax to GDP.\n\"We need to restructure the tax mix to ensure it grows the economy,\" he said.\n\"That's what will drive the revenue rather than lifting the overall [tax] burden.\"\nHe would also seek to stimulate growth through changes to competition laws, welfare and through the free trade agreements.\n The spending-to-GDP ratio was still at 26 per cent, the same level as during the global financial crisis and \"my view is to focus on controlling spending pressures\".\nDifficult decisions Mr Bowen said this week Mr Morrison was being unrealistic. Any honest appraisal of the debt and deficit situation would require a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, in addition to measures to stimulate growth.\n\"We need to have both revenue and spending measures on the table, and of course we need to be engendering growth because economic growth delivers a return to the budget bottom line as well, so we need to be always at our core having policies which facilitate economic growth, innovation, entrepreneurialism and growth,\" he said.\n\"That is very important. But that alone won't be enough. Yes, difficult decisions are necessary.\"\nThe $20 billion saving in education was forecast from the controversial move in the 2014 budget to cut university funding by 20 per cent and make other cuts alongside plans to deregulate fees.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and new Education Minister Simon Birmingham indicated this week that the proposed deregulation of fees will be reviewed.\nIt seems as if the government will still try to find some way of increasing fee flexibility, even if it radically changes the deregulation proposal. However, the prospects of it continuing with the savage funding cuts look much less likely.\nSources say the expenditure review committee will have to make a decision within weeks – before the release of the mid-year budget review – on whether to simply dump the university funding cuts or acknowledge the cuts will not be able to proceed in the coming financial year and roll over existing funding agreements.\nHowever, given the massive political damage the cuts have caused the Coalition, the indications are that it will go back to the drawing board on university funding.\nThe government will have to take the education debate back to the beginning and try to explain the reasons why it is seeking major reforms.\nGovernment sources argue that if the Coalition is not able to book the savings, Labor's policy proposals announced this week will also suffer. But the opposition insists it is funding its proposals from changes to multinational tax and superannuation tax concessions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:15:39.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
