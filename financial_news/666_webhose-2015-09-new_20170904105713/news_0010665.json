FXCM Ordered to Pay More Than $843,000 Over Revelation Forex FXCM failed to identify or report warning signs in violation of its own compliance procedures Advertising Print This Post The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Tuesday filed and simultaneously settled charges against Forex Capital Markets (NYSE: FXCM), for failing to diligently supervise its employees’ handling of accounts held by Revelation Forex Fund. The fraudulent foreign currency exchange pool , Revelation Forex Fund was operated by Kevin G. White and two legal entities he controlled. According to the CFTC, FXCM failed to follow its compliance procedures that require that it “know all of its customers” and that its employees identify and promptly report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities. The CFTC sued White and his entities in July 2013, for their fraudulent scheme and subsequently entered into a consent order for permanent injunction against them. He pled guilty in December 2013 to numerous charges of fraud, including the embezzlement of approximately $1.8 million in client funds. White was sentenced to over eight years of prison for mail fraud. Although FXCM was aware of warning signs that Revelation Forex was a fraud, FXCM failed to identify or report these warning signs in violation of its own compliance procedures, or that White’s operation of websites on behalf of the entities violated their exemption from registering as a commodity pool operator. The CFTC also finds that FXCM failed to respond fully to its document request and, in doing so, violated a previous commission order. The CFTC requires FXCM to pay a civil monetary penalty of $700,000; disgorge commissions and fees of $143,922.50 it earned from the Revelation Forex accounts, which attracted nearly $7.4 million in investments; and comply with certain undertakings including hiring a third-party compliance consultant to review and report on the supervisory issues.
