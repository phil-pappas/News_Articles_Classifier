Supplied Share on twitter by Misa Han When Heather Ridout spoke up for the idea of same-sex marriage in 2010, the reaction was one of shock. Here was the head of the Australian Industry Group, the country's peak employer advocate, wading into a social and political minefield that had until then been seen as a far-left 'Greens agenda'.\nWhat a difference five years makes. Today there are nearly 700 businesses who have publicly declared their support for marriage equality. And they are not just the usual suspects and fringe businesses, like gay dating app Grindr.\nWith AGL Energy now announcing it has hitched itself to the marriage equality bandwagon, there will be 12 companies in the ASX50 who publicly support same-sex marriage. These include Telstra and the big four banks and together make up half of the ASX50 market cap.\nWhen Ridout made her 2010 call-to-arms neither of the major parties had came out in support of marriage equality.\n\"Back in 2010 I expressed a personal view because I have enormous respect for the institution and I think that commitment and respect can be shown between people of the same gender as well as people of different genders,\" Ridout says. \"That was my view and it's even more so now. I have a number of gay friends who have children and I don't see why their parents cannot be married.\"\nOf course it hasn't always been this way.\nInitial doubts Rodney Croome, national director for Australian Marriage Equality, tells of how corporates were once too shy to align themselves with such a social issue. But he says it is these same companies that are now jumping on the bandwagon in the name of diversity and inclusion for staff and customers. \"CEOs and boards had lingering concerns about whether they may be too political but when we explained that [they are] values everyone can share, those concerns tend to evaporate,\" Croome says.\n Microsoft Australia managing director Pip Marlow appeared as the cover girl in a rainbow-clad, full-page newspaper ad in support of the marriage equality campaign. Her participation has been all about supporting her LGBTI employees and customers. \"To me it's been 100 per cent positive, as an employer of choice for everyone,\" she says. PwC diversity council head Paul Zahra, the cover boy for the campaign, says there are business benefits in participating in the campaign on top of productivity gains and employee engagement.\nBut not all businesses are buying in. There are still 38 companies in the ASX50 who have not signed up for the campaign. While major consumer brands like Wesfarmers, Kmart and Target have signed up for the campaign, Woolworths and ALDI did not. The German supermarket chain said it has not been asked to participate in the discussion and, in any case, it does not \"align itself with any discussions or debate outside of the retail landscape.\" Woolworths did not responded to request for comment.\nCorporates 'liable for any detriments' Meanwhile, anti same-sex marriage groups are fighting a losing battle when it comes to enlisting corporate support. When the full-page ad was published in June, the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney sent a letter to corporates accusing them of \"overstepping their purpose\" by supporting the marriage equality campaign.\nCorporates who have signed onto the campaign are seemingly unfazed and no corporate has pulled their support after receiving the letter. Social justice law firm Maurice Blackburn principal Liberty Sanger said the firm was unwavering in its support for the campaign, despite having many Catholic employees and clients.\n\"We employ many Catholics, we work for many Catholics.\" she says. \"In my experience being of religious faith does not mean we are against marriage equality. I want to suggest before they call on their parishes to boycott they apply the 24-hour rule [to pause and reflect].\"\nBeyond sending the letter, the Catholic church has no clear plan on what it intends to do about those businesses who have come out in support of same-sex marriage.\n\"Although unaware of what specific action may lie ahead in the whole same-sex marriage debate, the Church has been and will continue to be a contributor to the public debate about same-sex marriage,\" the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney said in a statement.\nThere is also no corporate which has publicly come out in support of Marriage Alliance's anti-same-sex marriage campaign. The alliance has not responded to multiple requests for comment.\nBut leader of the Christian Democratic Party and long-term opponent of same-sex marriage Reverend Fred Nile thinks corporates who have signed up to the campaign are imposing \"a cultural expectation which in effect suppresses their beliefs and freedoms to religion, speech and traditions\".\n\"I believe that all corporations must be liable for any detriments caused by their suppressive actions against employees who believe in traditional marriage,\" Reverend Nile said in a statement.\nTop down approach While in principle support for marriage equality is growing, there is little agreement on exactly how to bring it about.\nQantas boss Alan Joyce believes marriage equality can be achieved through a parliamentary vote. \"I'm not sure if a plebiscite or referendum is the way to go, it should be decided in Parliament. In Ireland there was a constitutional issue, that meant it had to go to a referendum,\" Joyce says. Australia's constitution has no such issue.\nMeanwhile, Commonwealth Bank boss Ian Narev personally supports same-sex marriage and agreed to sign up the bank for the campaign, but he is less sure about the best way to achieve marriage equality. \"I'm not the expert on how to get it done, I just think progress needs to be made,\" he says.\nNarev may take heed from the way the bank handled the matter internally. When the Commonwealth Bank made the decision to put its logo on the marriage equality campaign, it did not take a formal poll to ask every single banker where they stood on the issue. Instead, it decided to take action because it was already supporting LGBTI staff through an internal network called Unity. Supporting marriage equality, therefore, seemed like a natural progression for the bank.\n\"When the opportunity arose to put our logo to something like that, we just saw it was a natural step to all of the diversity things we've been doing,\" CBA's Unity co-chair David Brine says.\nThe decision to support marriage equality at accounting firm EY also came from the top. \"It wasn't a hard decision. Tony Johnson [EY chief executive] made that decision himself, we had a consultation process, there was a general support and we got on with it,\" EY talent leader McGregor Dixon said.\nWhile getting 700 corporate logos on rainbow ads seem like a big win, the game is far from over for Australian businesses. With Tony Abbott calling for a plebiscite or referendum after the next election, corporates may yet be dragged into a campaign that needs real skin in the game.\nAustralian Marriage Equality's Croome says if a plebiscite or referendum went ahead, he expected corporates to come out and campaign for marriage equality among their staff and customers.\n\"In the US corporates played a key role in those public votes by getting information out to staff and customers when they had a public vote on the issue. If we go to a plebiscite they would be able to inform their staff and customers about issues at stake and we hope they would be able to play a constructive role in that debate.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-09-02T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:09:05.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
