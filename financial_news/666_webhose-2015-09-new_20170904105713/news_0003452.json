Ross Swanborough by Jonathan Barrett The head of Australia's only major listed shipbuilder, Perth-headquartered Austal, says the company would consider buying a shipyard in South Australia if it meant securing a portion of multibillion-dollar defence contracts.\nThe comments come amid heated jibes between states competing for naval contracts to build Australian navy corvettes and frigates, with construction expected to begin in Adelaide in 2018.\nAustal chief executive Andrew Bellamy told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday he did not want to get involved in a highly politicised regional debate.\n\"We are an Australian company that has built 15 per cent of the US Navy's fleet,\" said Mr Bellamy, who is in the United States.\n\"It's not about geography, it's about being able to deliver. But if the government was to ask us to buy a shipyard in South Australia and build some frigates, we'd look at that,\" Mr Bellamy said.\nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott promised work on the corvettes – generally less complex and smaller vessels than frigates – would begin in Adelaide in 2018, with the frigate build to start roughly two years later.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten has accused the government of awarding \"political prizes\" to South Australia, where the Liberal Party is flagging amid fallout over declining numbers of automotive manufacturing jobs.\nThe issue was magnified by an apparent move by the federal government to award a major contract to build submarines overseas, rather than in South Australia.\n Anger out west The decision to centre billions of dollars worth of naval shipbuilding out of Adelaide has, in particular, angered Western Australia, which has its own shipyards south of Perth; and is home to a major shipbuilder that has built naval vessels for other countries including the United States and Oman.\nWest Australian Liberal Treasurer Mike Nahan has labelled the South Australian shipbuilding industry a \"basket case\"; while South Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill said Mr Nahan's approach was \"destructive\".\nA group calling itself the WA Defence Shipbuilding Council is being formed to devise defence contract bid strategies.\nThe group will include several interested parties, including the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA and the office of Liberal Senator from Western Australia Linda Reynolds, who had a career in the army before entering politics.\n\"The businesses located at Henderson and Fremantle have experience in successfully delivering large, complex projects and a competitive tender process would recognise that capability,\" CCIWA chief executive Deidre Willmott said.\nSenator Marise Payne, the former human services minister who replaced Kevin Andrews as Minister for Defence in last week's cabinet reshuffle, said the forthcoming defence white paper would still be released soon despite the portfolio changes. The paper is designed to set a course for defence for the next two decades.\nMr Bellamy said that it was important the changes in government did not upset the timing of the defence contracts.\n\"The most important thing is that the changes in leadership don't impact the timing of these important decisions,\" Mr Bellamy said. \"Essentially, we need to rebuild the navy to protect sovereignty.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T21:06:18.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
