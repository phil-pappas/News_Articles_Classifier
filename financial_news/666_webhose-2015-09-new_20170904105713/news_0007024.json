Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell One of the world's most successful technology investors, who spotted the potential of Skype and Chinese mega search engine Baidu when they were barely more than ideas, has joined a global venture fund based in Melbourne.\nRoderick Thomson has joined the Global Pure Alpha Fund as investment director and co-chairman alongside Trimantium Capital founder and co-chair of the GPA Fund Phillip Kingston. The fund will give Australian investors exposure to growing Asian, US and Israeli tech firms.\n\"Roderick and I connected over the idea of global venture and taking domestic capital to the very best ideas we can find,\" Mr Kingston said. \"We're not interested in early stage, this fund is about big plays.\"\nWhile the fund's full size has not been disclosed, Mr Kingston said its average investment size would be between $25 million and $50 million, with the capacity to sign multiple $200 million cheques if the right opportunities arose.\nMr Thomson has been a venture investor for more than 30 years and has backed Skype, Virgin Mobile, Baidu, Focus Media, KongZhong and Instinet.\nHe is co-chairman and managing director of another fund he launched, Draper Fisher Jurvetson ePlanet Ventures, which has $US700 million ($988 million) in funds under management.\nMr Thomson told Fairfax Media the Global Pure Alpha Fund would be focused on technology companies based in China, the United States and Israel, and would provide a new opportunity for local institutional investors.\n\"The fund is unique in Australia because it provides access to deals with proven entrepreneurs and investors across the globe,\" Mr Thomson said.\n \"Australian institutional investors currently lack access to these kinds of deals, both in quantum and quality. We then enhance our fund's alpha through high concentration and exceptional hands-on support to entrepreneurs.\"\nThe fund will also explore options in Britain and south-east Asia.\nLarge-scale investments Mr Kingston also oversees an earlier stage fund within the suite of companies that make up Trimantium Capital.\nHowever, the Global Pure Alpha fund targets larger-scale companies that are a few years away from an IPO or trade sale, with significant potential for growth.\n\"It's venture rather than private equity, as we're all about top-line growth,\" Mr Kingston said.\n\"We'll still look at acquisitions, financial engineering and cost side work but the primary question is can we grow it and does it have the legs to be a global, billion-dollar business.\"\nMr Thomson and Mr Kingston will focus their investments on financial technology companies and health technology companies.\n\"It's about fundamental services that are non-cyclical, non-seasonal and non-discretionary with a technology play [that] gives them edge,\" Mr Kingston said.\nThe Global Pure Alpha Fund will be based in Melbourne and denominated in US dollars. The fund will invest in any country where a promising deal exists, but it is likely to make its first investments in more developed technology ecosystems than Australia.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/116041942547218769712/posts"], "published": "2015-09-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:09:17.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
