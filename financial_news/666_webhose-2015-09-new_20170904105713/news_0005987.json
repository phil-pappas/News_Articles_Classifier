(NYSE MKT: MSTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its molecular adhesion and sealant technology (MAST) platform to develop novel therapies for sickle cell disease, heart failure, and stroke, today announced that it signed an amendment to the Company's existing Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (NYSE: HTGC ).  The agreement provides for a $15 million debt facility, $5 million of which was funded to the Company on August 11 , 2015.  Prior to the amendment, the Company was only able to access the second advance of $10 million if it achieved certain clinical development and financial milestones by December 31, 2015 , which included receipt of $15 million in net cash proceeds from a strategic partnership and/or equity financing.  The amendment removed those funding conditions and the Company drew the second advance on September 28 , 2015.  Under the amended agreement, the net cash proceeds condition is deferred until April 30, 2016 , a date which is expected to follow top-line data from EPIC, and this requirement would be eliminated entirely upon achievement of positive data from EPIC.  If the clinical and updated financial conditions are not met, the second advance of $10 million would be repaid on April 30, 2016 , without any prepayment penalty. Brandi Roberts , the Company's Chief Financial Officer, said: \"We are pleased to have the ongoing support of Hercules, a highly recognized leader in growth financing.  We believe that the accelerated funding underscores Hercules' confidence in Mast and our development programs.  The funds received under the loan agreement provide us with additional financial resources and flexibility as we near the completion of enrollment in EPIC and prepare to submit a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration.\"\nAbout Mast Therapeutics \nMast Therapeutics, Inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego , California.  The Company is leveraging its MAST platform , derived from over two decades of clinical, nonclinical and manufacturing experience with purified and non-purified poloxamers, to develop vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188), its lead product candidate, for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions typically characterized by impaired microvascular blood flow and damaged cell membranes. The Company is also developing AIR001, a sodium nitrite solution for inhalation via nebulizer, for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).\nVepoloxamer is an investigational new drug being tested in a pivotal Phase 3 study called EPIC for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.
