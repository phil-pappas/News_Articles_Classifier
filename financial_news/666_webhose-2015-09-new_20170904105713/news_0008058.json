Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Maurice Newman, the former chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council, has warned new PM Malcolm Turnbull to keep the conservative right wing of the Liberal Party on side or risk a party split.\nIn a valedictory interview after serving 21 months as head of the main body for facilitating dialogue between business and government, Newman said Turnbull had every right to dump him following Tony Abbott's removal.\n\"There was little chance I would have survived under Turnbull because I am not his type of businessman,\" he says.\n\"I am not in favour of renewable energy subsidies, I am not a believer in man-made global warming and I believe in smaller government. To be fair about it, he is the Prime Minister and he's entitled to choose who he wants and I accept that.\n\"I don't appeal to those on the left because I am a rational economist. I believe in markets and they believe in government and political power.\"\nNewman admits that Turnbull's strategy of winning the middle ground of politics is a sound one and that this poses a problem for Labor and the Greens. But, he says, Turnbull has to be careful that he does not alienate the right wing conservative forces in the Liberal Party, including South Australian Liberal MP Cory Bernardi and NSW Liberal senator David Leyonhjelm.\nNewman would not rule out the possibility that a separate party of conservatives could be formed next year.\nHe said he had never spoken to Abbott about the possibility of him joining a breakaway conservative party but it would not surprise him if he was enlisted to the cause.\n Newman has made it clear in various newspaper columns that he thinks Australia is in economic trouble but does not realise how bad it is. He thinks Australians are not cognisant of the decline in the standard of living, the lack of real wages growth and the threat of a downgrade in the country's AAA credit rating from excess debt.\nHe is also concerned about developments in the housing market and the excessive amount of residential housing exposure in the balance sheets of the major banks.\nKeeping with the theme of elevated risk in mortgages, Newman is chairman of the LoanRQ, which trades as Morgij Analytics, provides credit industry participants a standardised way to evaluate, compare and monitor mortgage risk.\nThe company, which raised about $15 million in pre-IPO funding earlier this year, sells a software that uses 23 credit and risk variables to calculate an expected loss measure of risk and subsequently a credit score.\nNewman will remain busy without the chairmanship of the Business Advisory Council. He is a director of QIC and is a senior adviser to Marsh, which owns Oliver Wyman, an investor in LoanRQ.\nNewman is on the boards of four different charities including the Bradman Foundation, the Macquarie University Foundation and the Taronga Foundation.\nM2 had to merge The mantra of get big or get swamped is behind the $3 billion merger of Vocus Communications with M2 Group .\nAfter 15 years of growth by acquisition, M2 founder Vaughan Bowen and his fellow board members realised some months ago that the company needed one last dance partner before the music stopped.\nM2 shares were in decline and looked to be headed further south when talks began with Vocus, which is another shining example of the expand by acquisition growth strategy. Vocus has yet to wrap up its recent takeover of Amcom.\nVocus had the infrastructure to kick start a new phase of growth at M2, but in order to get the deal done, it had to cover the recent losses in M2's market value.\nVocus founder James Spenceley was happy to hand M2 shareholders a 25 per cent premium in order to get his hands on 8 per cent of the Australian broadband market.\nHe is creating an integrated telecommunications company that will deliver claimed synergy benefits of $40 million. But probably the biggest gains will come from the revenue opportunities from a business that offers products and services to both large and small businesses.\nOne of the examples used yesterday in meetings with fund managers was the opportunities presented to Vocus from owning the M2 customer base in small and medium sized companies. Vocus has contracts in 3500 buildings. These contracts can now be extended to the smaller businesses in the same buildings.\nThe merged business will earn about half its revenue from consumers and half from business. M2 will no longer have to rely on Telstra's network in order to deliver broadband services. It can shift its customers on to Vocus fibre.\nThat is a smart move ahead of the rollout of the government-owned NBN. The merger of Vocus with M2 will mark the last big fixed line merger in the telco industry given the recent comments by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\nThere is still the possibility that the merged Vocus and M2 will pick up the privately-owned NextGen fibre network. But that deal is not essential to make the current merger proposal work.\nAnother potential deal that excites bankers is the possible takeover of Vodafone Australia. Its mobile network is a great asset, but without a fixed line business it lacks the strategic presence to match Telstra and Optus.\nShow of hands United States fund manager Fidelity is stepping up its efforts to improve shareholder democracy in Australia by warning a range of companies to stop using a show of hands to ram through motions at annual general meetings.\nPaul Taylor, head of Australian equities at Fidelity Australia, has written to every company in which Fidelity owns more than 5 per cent of the issued capital.\nThat threshold for the Fidelity warning letter is significant because a shareholder with more than 5 per cent ownership can enforce a poll for each resolution.\nFidelity has long opposed the way some companies use voting by hand as a way to push through motions at AGMs or other company meetings as opposed to a vote by poll of all shareholders weighted by ownership.\nVoting by a show of hands is allowed under Section 250J(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. It allows one person owning one share to have the same vote as a large shareholder.\nTaylor's letter to boards was to let them know that Fidelity thinks a show of hands is poor corporate governance, even when it is used for minor motions. He thinks a show of hands is often used for theatrical purposes at meetings.\nThe letter says that Fidelity appreciates that a show of hands may be used innocently and that there are costs involved in having a poll of all shareholders.\nBut Fidelity doesn't think that these costs outweigh the potential distortion that could take place.\nTaylor has, in effect, told companies that Fidelity may turn up at meetings to use its shareholding to formally request voting by poll.\nIt would prefer it if companies voluntarily abandon the practice of relying on a show of hands.\nThere have been examples of companies using a show of hands to ram through resolutions that would have gone against the interests of incumbent directors.\nInfomedia used a show of hands in 2013 to defeat a \"first strike\" against its remuneration report. A first strike requires 25 per cent of the issued capital to vote against a remuneration report.\nHarvey Norman in 2014 used a show of hands to pass its financial statements, remuneration report and declare a dividend.\nGreencross and Reckon have also used a show of hands to push through resolutions.\nMore pain for iron ore Analysts at Citi are blaming Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill iron ore mine in Western Australia for its latest bearish iron ore price forecasts.\nThey say a shake-out is coming in the iron ore market in 2016 which will push prices below $US40 a tonne.\n\"The largest source of incremental supply is coming from Roy Hill,\" the Citi analysts say in a note to client.\n\"At 55 million tonnes a year, the new mine represents four per cent of current seaborne supply. Production has already commenced, with the company having built 19 million tonnes of stockpiles, with first shipments expected sometime in October.\"\nThe analysts say the ramp-up schedule has been accelerated, with the company now targeting a full 55 million tonnes a year run rate by the end of 2016.\nRoy Hill's ore matches the main industry pricing benchmarks so it will have an impact across the industry.\nThe only bright side to the Citi analysis is that the plunge in prices has driven out the marginal suppliers of iron ore. \"Over the past 18 months, non-mainstream suppliers have progressively been driven out of China's import market,\" they said.\n\"Australia and Brazil now account for around 85 per cent of Chinese iron ore imports – 65 per cent from Australia and 20 per cent from Brazil. This is up from 70 per cent in 2013.\"\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-28T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:04:02.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
