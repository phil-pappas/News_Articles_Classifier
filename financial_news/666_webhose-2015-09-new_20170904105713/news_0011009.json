Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Misa Han Bad news for students who have spent too much time in the library: PwC is removing candidates' academic results from the final stage of law-graduate recruitment .\nTo get a law graduate job at PwC candidates had to jump through all the usual hoops including an online personality questionnaire, video interview, group activity and face-to-face interview with senior team members.\nBut at the final stage, the accounting firm hid the candidates' test scores and academic transcripts from interviewers to remove any unconscious bias .\n\"It's a good idea because as a candidate I had a lot more to offer than just my marks,\" said Macquarie University student Jana Kiriazidis, one of just eight candidates out of 600 applicants who landed a law-graduate job at PwC .\nHowever, she concedes the practice could disadvantage people who have good marks and spent a lot of time studying.\nShe said the process worked in her favour because she was an all-rounder: she had done an internship at Cochlear, worked as a legal assistant and was a keen soccer player.\nThe recruitment policy also better reflected the nature of the role at PwC, she said. \"It's about building relationships with clients, it's not about sitting at a desk.\"\nPwC legal partner Tim Blue said blacking out academic transcripts at the final stage of the interview helped the firm to get a good mix of candidates from diverse universities and academic disciplines.\n \"We know that our people need to have excellent business and commercial acumen, not just be brilliant lawyers, and that's why we didn't want to just go with the candidates with the highest score,\" he said.\nThe candidates still had to meet the minimum academic standard to get to the final stage of the interview.\nUnder the leadership of Tony O'Malley and Mr Blue, both former King & Wood Mallesons managing partners, PwC is aggressively hiring lawyers in plans to double its legal practice over the next two years.\n'Blind CV' on the rise PwC is not the only firm that is moving towards a \"blind policy\" to weed out unconscious bias from the graduate recruitment process. Four years ago, KWM introduced a blind CV process which removes name, address, gender and school from the initial graduate recruitment screening process.\nIn addition to removing unconscious bias based on high school and postcode, this has the effect of concealing the candidate's ethnicity and potential family connection to prominent lawyers.\nKing & Wood Mallesons head of people and development Kathryn Bellion said the blind process was successful in removing an interviewer's affinity bias.\n\"This bias leads us to favour people who are similar to ourselves, for example, [those] who live in the same suburb as us, went to the same school etc. We remove this information and therefore the likelihood of affinity bias occurring.\n\"Decision-making should then be more focused on the candidate's relevant experience, skills and technical ability,\" Ms Bellion said.\nThe law firm uses the blind policy for graduate recruitment in some cities, but Ms Bellion said that it plans to expand it to other areas of recruitment over time.\nLaw graduate employment levels remain at their worst on record , with nearly one in four graduates still looking for full-time work four months after graduation. Even some of the legal industry's brightest minds have said they are not pushing their children to follow their footsteps and enter the legal industry .\nNo more than two candidates came from the same university. In contrast, when Mr Blue was a law graduate half his graduate cohort came from Sydney University and the other half from UNSW.\n\"We wanted to treat them as equal and not base the decision on what law school we [the interviewers] went to.\"\nHe said it helped the firm to pick candidates who were commercially savvy.\nMs Kiriazidis is among the first batch of law graduates for PwC as the big four accounting firms aggressively hire lawyers to take a chunk out of the legal services market .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-09-03T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:10:10.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
