Peter Braig by Larry Schlesinger As Sydney prepares for one of its biggest auction weekends of the year with nearly 1200 auctions scheduled, an increasing number of vendors are choosing to sell their home ahead of auction, but often for very different reasons.\nIn the sought-after eastern suburbs - where the clearance was 86 per cent last weekend compared with a city-wide average of 70.7 per cent according to CoreLogic RP Data - buyers who have missed out previously are approaching estate agents with very strong offers in the hopes of securing an early sale.\nBut in the middle and outer suburbs, where clearance rates have fallen more steeply and where the number of people coming to open for inspections has dropped, jittery vendors are accepting pre-auction offers, sometimes under the Quote: d price guide.\nSouthern jitters In Port Hacking in Sydney's Sutherland shire, vendors accepted a $1.55 million offer on their four-bedroom family home that had a price guide of $1.65 million. The property was due to be auctioned on Saturday morning.\n\"It would have been a terrible auction,\" said Raine & Horne Miranda principal Anthony Bouteris who marketed the property.\n\"In four weeks we only had nine groups go through the home, even though we did a half page ad in the newspapers and big ads on the internet.\n\"I told the owners, if we take this to auction, we'll only have one buyer turning up,\" he told the Financial Review.\n Mr Bouteris said the market has changed in the last four weeks with fewer people coming to open home inspections and buyers being more careful and \"not rushing to pay big dollars\".\nInvestor interest has also subsided following bank changes to lending criteria, he said.\n\"Demand is dropping, so it will have an impact on prices,\" he said.\nDifferent story in the east But in the eastern suburbs, agents had a different story to tell.\nSimon Platt from Ray White Coogee & Bondi Junction said he had sold two homes this week ahead of auction, with one, a three-bedroom weatherboard home in Botany selling just seven days into the marketing campaign for $960,000.\n\"The buyer had missed on two previous auctions and had engaged a buyer's agent. He literally came in all guns blazing with a very strong offer,\" Mr Platt said.\nThe home at 1487 Botany Road had been advertised with a price guide of $850,000 to $900,000 and was being sold by Melbourne investors.\n\"They told me 'Get something with a nine in front of it and we will be thrilled',\" Mr Platt said. \"The original offer was $905,000 and we were able to negotiate it up to $960,000.\"\nThe other property he sold ahead of auction was a 1930s three-bedroom cottage in Kingsford, near the University of NSW, which sold on Thursday night for $1.61 million after two-buyers fought it.\n\"We were expecting $1.4 to $1.5 million at auction,\" Mr Platt said.\nWhile desperation at not missing out had driven these deals, Mr Platt did note that enquiries were falling. \"Instead of getting 30 per property, we're getting 15 or 20.\"\nBut, he said he thought rates would need to go up before there was an impact on prices in the Eastern Suburbs. \"There has been no lessening in buying capacity yet,\" he said.\nNorthern pragmatism North of the city, Ray White Wahroonga agent David Walker sold a three-bedroom home on Nerang Street ahead of a planned auction on Saturday for $1.4 million.\nThe home had expectations above $1.3 million. Mr Walker said on the Upper North Shore it was more about buyers making good offers than vendor nervousness driving sales.\nSimon Harrison of Belle Property Lane Cove claimed a suburb record with a pre-auction sale of a 34 Myee Crescent, a four-bedroom home overlooking the Lane Cove River, which sold for $2.9 million.\n\"The buyer wanted to avoid the auction if possible and came in with an offer that was quite a bit above the next best offer.\nIn the north, auctions are fairly competitive, some buyers want to avoid the stress and a lot have missed out on opportunites,\" Mr Harrison said.\nLower North Shore Century 21 agent Christina Livermore said older vendors were very keen to sell prior.\n\"They get a bit nervous and anxious about the auction and not knowing the outcome.\" Ms Livermore sold a one bedroom apartment in Crows Nest for $575,000, slightly above price guide of $560,000.\n\"In this instance, the vendor was going overseas shortly and wanted to have clarity. I rang all the prospective buyers and no one offered anything higher.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:02:41.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
