Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Duty lawyers will be employed at hospitals in domestic violence \"hotspots\" as part of a $40 million-plus package fighting domestic violence, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will announce on Thursday.\nIt will be the first major announcement of the Turnbull government, with the initial $41.5 million expected to more than double in coming months as federal and state governments move closer to a national domestic violence order scheme, which will involve information sharing across state borders.\nMr Turnbull will meet in Melbourne domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty and former Victorian police chief Ken Lay, who were appointed in April by the Council of Australian Governments under then prime minister Tony Abbott, to advise how to introduce a national domestic violence order scheme.\nThe latest tranche of funding to fight domestic violence will include $15 million over three years to train hospital staff in areas of high domestic violence and will involve employing duty lawyers at hospitals so that women can access timely and free legal advice on site, at an estimated cost of $1.6 million over three years.\nAnother $13.5 million over three years will spent on \"DV-alert\" training for police, social workers, emergency department staff and community workers, and half a million dollars of specialised training for doctors.\nThere will be $2.5 million allocated to extra police and nursing support for Indigenous women in remote areas, and $5 million in school education to change the attitudes of young people about violence towards women.\nMr Turnbull said on Monday that \"real men don't hit women\", after appointing Michaelia Cash as the Minister for Women who will be responsible for delivering the government's existing $100 million plan to reduce violence against women, announced under former prime minister Tony Abbott.\n\"The issue of family violence, or domestic violence as it's often called, which is just violence against women – which is the way I would prefer to describe it – is an enormous one,\" Mr Turnbull told Channel 9's Today show.\n \"It has been overlooked to some extent, ignored for far too long, and we must have zero tolerance for it.\"\nThe most significant domestic violence commitment remains the national domestic violence order (DVO) scheme, which the Council of Australian government agreed should be developed by the end of 2015 but is now not expected to be properly in place until the end of 2016.\nWhile the legal framework is on track to be in place by December, the technology issues associated with introducing a system to share information on live DVOs between states and territories is expected to take longer.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-09-23T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:07:47.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
