Source: Supplied\nThe development precinct covers 54,000 square metres alongside Eagle Farm racecourse, located six kilometres outside Brisbane’s CBD.\nThe contract involves Mirvac delivering the $850M residential precinct which combines horse racing with “Brisbane’s newest destination for food, retail and lush public parkland”.\nBrisbane Racing Club chairman Neville Bell was confident the development would keep the racecourse as the Queensland epicentre of thoroughbred racing and breathe new life into the area.\n“We are pleased to welcome them to this exciting venture,” he said of Mirvac. Eagle Farm has thrown some of the best parties over the years, with Fashions of the Field generating a buzz for patrons such as 2011’s Melbourne Cup Day winners Stephanie Nasternak from Mt Cotton, Alyse-Grace Robertson from Bulimba and Sally Forman from New Farm.
