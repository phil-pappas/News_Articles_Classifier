It is locked in an aggressive price war with its rivals, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc, which are going after each others' subscribers with deep discounts and promotions that have weighed on growth.\nSprint also skipped the airwaves auction called the \"AWS-3\" spectrum sale that concluded earlier this year.
