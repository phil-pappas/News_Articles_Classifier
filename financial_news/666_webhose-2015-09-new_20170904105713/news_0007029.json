We are on full throttle with the steering wheel straight.\" \nTeam (NYSE: TISI - news ) mate Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, qualified 16th but will start 15th. \nAlonso said the grid position ultimately made little difference in the current circumstances to a team that ranks as the sport's second most successful in history but is currently languishing in ninth place out of 10 in the constructors' standings. \n\"If you overtake cars at the start, or you start in front of them because of penalties, they will pass you on lap one so it's even more frustrating,\" he said. \n\"Nothing has changed. We will try to do our race, to learn things on the car and finish as high up as possible. It's not the best situation, but unfortunately it is the way it is at the moment because we are not competitive at all.\" (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T21:21:44.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
