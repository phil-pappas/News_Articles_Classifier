Only now she is using credit cards.\n\"I use them often for my daily spending -- particularly for unexpected costs,\" says Alfaro, who lives with her mother. \"So if I need a new jacket or new part for my bike, it goes on my credit cards.\"\nOver the course of her studies, Alfaro estimates she has accumulated $7,000 of credit card debt, along with another $25,000 in student loans.\n\"I try to pay just over the minimum, and everything else I earn goes to help out,\" she says, adding her mother brought her and her brother from El Salvador in the early 1990s to escape poverty and civil war.\n\"My mom came here, not speaking English, with just $150.\"\nA single mom, she incurred a lot of high-interest debt to help make ends meet, and consequently never could set enough money aside for a down payment to buy a home.\n\"So we're still renting.\"\nWhile Alfaro's story is unique in many respects, one aspect that's not is the reliance on credit cards to stretch her budget.\nShe is among tens of thousands students using credit cards to help finance the cost of their education, says Michael Barkman, the Manitoba chairman of the Canadian Federation of Students.\nHe says few reliable statistics exist on student credit card debt, in part because budget cuts have prompted Statistics Canada to discontinue collecting data on it.\nYet the most recent data from 2010 revealed students, who rely on loans from private and public sources, graduating with a four-year degree have an average credit card debt of about $9,600.\n\"We figure the number is probably higher because the biggest problem with this data is it's reliant on self-reporting,\" says Barkman, adding credit card debt is likely under-reported as a result.\nA lack of hard numbers aside, the organization that lobbies for better funding for education contends credit card use to cover the cost of education is rising.\n\"From our point of view, it's definitely related to the increasing cost of education whether that's tuition, textbooks, rent and food,\" Barkman says.\nGenerally, students are more comfortable using plastic than ever before, with many now carrying multiple cards.\nA 2014 survey of 22,500 students by the Canadian University Survey Consortium found the number of students with three or more credit cards increased to 12 per cent from seven per cent between 2012 and 2014.\nThe study also found 62 per cent of respondents had at least one card with an ongoing balance of more than $2,200.\nThe head of the Credit Counselling Society, one of Canada's largest debt-counselling agencies, says those numbers aren't surprising. Many current students and graduates seek help managing heavy debt loads. And often the sorest spot among their finances is credit card debt because the associated interest rate can be 20 per cent or higher.\n\"What we see are young adults who have got in over the heads,\" says Scott Hannah, CEO of the Vancouver-based, non-profit agency.\n\"They usually start with one card with a limit of $1,000, and over the course of a very short period of time, that turns into to two or three cards with limits around $3,000 each.\"\nSome of their problems arise due to a lack of financial literacy. For example, they may not know cash advances carry higher rates or missing monthly payments can result in a rate hike.\n\"The phrase 'young and dumb' fits pretty aptly when it comes to credit because they often don't know how to deal with it,\" says Richard Moxley, a Calgary-based credit adviser and author of The Nine Rules of Credit.\n\"They're just out of high school and get a credit card, and the problem is either their parents don't know how to handle it or they never learned in school.\"\nYet credit cards have become a necessary evil. Without one, it's difficult for a student to build a credit score, which becomes important once they graduate, find work and look to borrow to buy a car or a home.\n\"A lot of people think because they had student loans, paid utilities, rent and their cellphone bills that they will have good credit, but none of those shows up in a meaningful way on a credit report,\" Moxley says. \"That's worse than having bad credit because if creditors have no record on your history, they assume you are the worst credit risk.\"\nHe suggests most students can benefit from having a credit card as long as they use it sparingly. That means getting a no-fee, low-limit card to pay one bill monthly (such as mobile phone expenses).\n\"If they pay it off on time every month over their studies, they'll have an amazing credit score.\"\nYet many are not using their credit cards sparingly. Instead, students often use them as a way to extend their budget out of necessity -- and they have no means to pay off the balance at the end of the month so they're accumulating more and more high-interest debt, Barkman says.\nOver time, more money goes toward debt with less of it available for necessities.\n\"To us it's an indication the loan system is a bad way to fund post-secondary education,\" he says.\nAccording to a 2014 policy paper by the federation, students are graduating with an average student-loan debt of about $20,000. It further states the effect of credit card debt is \"not insignificant.\"\nAnd the hangover from this debt affects more than just graduates. It has a broader economic impact, too, because it delays the ability to start a family and buy a home -- life milestones essential to the well-being of the economy.\nThat's why the federation has been pushing governments to move from a means-tested loan system to a means-tested grant system, so students are not saddled with debt upon graduation.\n\"We believe it would be a better return on investment for government,\" Barkman says, adding Newfoundland already has replaced its loan program with a grant-based system.\nWhile the plan has been in place only a few months, its provincial government estimates grants will reduce debt loads upon graduation to $14,800 from about $26,000 (the remaining debt is largely from the federal student-loan program).\n\"What this points to is the current system is ineffective because it leads to high levels of debt, making it harder for graduates to find work, start a family, buy a car or save for the future,\" Barkman says.\nMoreover, it's clear the student-loan system is inadequate because so many students are using credit cards to cover tuition, books and living costs, he adds.\nDespite her rising credit card balances, Alfaro says she remains optimistic about her future -- even if debt from her education may ultimately stand in the way of building a better life.\n\"Compared to the life my mom had in El Salvador, I feel very privileged,\" she says. \"And once I get out of debt, I plan on helping my family buy our first home.\"\n\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T16:02:57.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
