Andrew Harnik by Margaret Talev, Ilya Arkhipov and Nicole Gaouette World leaders remain divided over how to end the carnage in Syria after the first face-to-face talks between the presidents of Russia and the US ended without signs of a significant breakthrough.\nMr Putin, wrapping up a one-day visit to New York, told reporters on Monday that his 90-minute meeting with Mr Obama at the United Nations was \"frank,\" yet added that \"relations between Russia and the United States are unfortunately at a pretty low level.\"\nWith Russia sending troops and weapons to bolster embattled President Bashar al-Assad, the deteriorating situation in Syria took centre stage on the first day of the annual UN General Assembly. Western leaders differ over their willingness to coordinate anti-terror attacks with Syria's government, hampering an agreement to end a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more.\nThe prospect of an accord on Syria had been dangled heading into this week's UN gathering, as leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister David Cameron signalled more flexibility in their stance toward Mr Assad, who they have previously called on to step aside. In his speech to world leaders Monday morning, Mr Obama said he was willing to cooperate on the issue. But only so far.\n\"The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia or Iran, to resolve the conflict,\" Mr Obama said from the UN podium. \"But we must recognise there cannot be -- after so much bloodshed, so much carnage -- a return to the pre- war status quo.\"\nMr Putin said the strained ties with the US, which has criticised Russia's annexation of Crimea, shouldn't get in the way of them working together on Syria. With control of Syria divided between the government and a collection of Islamic terror groups, the two nations did at least agree that their militaries will communicate to try to avoid conflicts.\nMr Obama, who was hosting a summit on countering extremism Tuesday in New York, left the meeting without speaking to reporters. An administration official said the two leaders were on board to explore a political resolution including ways to potentially bring in different parts of the Syrian opposition, but no formal mechanism was established.\nOne major bone of contention is over Western support for anti-Assad rebels, which Mr Putin said amounted to illegal support for groups he considers to be terrorists. Turkey and France were among nations holding firm to their position that Mr Assad should go.\n \"Turkey cannot move forward with Assad in charge,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters. \"Assad can't be trusted to manage Syria's transition to peace.\"\nWhile ruling out the use of ground troops in Syria, Mr Putin kept open the possibility of Russia joining Western nations and Assad's government in coordinating airstrikes in Syria while underlining that such actions, currently being undertaken by the US, France and Australia without the government's support, are \"illegal.\"\nMr Putin also made clear he thinks the US and others shouldn't be weighing in on the fate of Mr Assad, a long-time ally of Russia. He said he respects \"my colleagues the US president and the French president, but I don't think they're Syrian citizens so I don't think they should be involved in deciding the future. It's up to the Syrian people to decide that.\"\nRussia will introduce a resolution September 30 backing political and military coordination among nations, which would also include the governments of Syria and Iran, according to a Security Council diplomat who is familiar with the proposal. Four vetoes cast by Russia and China at the Security Council have limited intervention in the crisis that erupted in 2011 with protesters demanding Mr Assad's ouster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:49:07.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
