When the Company uses words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"estimate\" or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, it is making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, this press release states that the Company's monthly dividend rate on the Company's common stock is $0.0175 per share. A possible implication of this statement is that the Company will continuously pay monthly dividends on the Company's common stock of $0.0175 per share, or $0.21 per share per year in the future. The Company's dividend rates are set and may be reset from time to time by its Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors will consider many factors when setting dividend rates, including the Company's historical and projected income, normalized funds from operations, the then current and expected needs and availability of cash to pay the Company's obligations, distributions which may be required to be paid to maintain the Company's tax status as a real estate investment trust and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors in its discretion. Accordingly, future dividend rates may be increased or decreased and there is no assurance as to the rate at which future dividends will be paid. For these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements in this press release. Additional factors are discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available for review at www.sec.gov . The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward‚Äêlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof.
