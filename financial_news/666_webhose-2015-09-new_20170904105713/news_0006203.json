But this time they did something very different. Instead of the usual high volume, arena-venue electric performance, there were only two band members sitting with acoustic guitars. Presto, the “MTV Unplugged” series was born, and later that year, the first of many similar formatted episodes was broadcast to the delight of many fans.Musicians say that the true test of a song’s quality is how it sounds when performed unplugged, i.e. acoustically. It makes sense to me. An unplugged version strips the song down to its bare components, free of distractions such as powerful percussion, impressive visuals, and elaborate choreography. (For those that prefer classical, I also think the same can be said of piano reductions of orchestral works.)The field of “investment strategy” can be seen in the same light. These experts--many of them self-proclaimed--opine on everything related to investing. Their narratives address where the stock market is headed and what an investor should do to target the best returns possible. There almost seems to be as many strategists as there are professional rock bands.While elaborate visuals such as 3 dimensional graphs, new statistical concepts and high confidence deliveries are certainly entertaining, how would we receive investment strategies if they were delivered to us unplugged? Would certain strategies seem more durable through their simple themes, and others shown to be of questionable value when all the distracting elements are removed?The fact that we listen at all to investment strategists is a mystery to some. Perhaps it is our tendency to view the field through a science-like analytic lens. Investing is not a science, but I think it’s closer to being a science than music is. Investing’s natural language is numbers and it yields to mathematical analysis. This gives us hope that strategists may lead us to a code of successful investing, so we listen with the goal of gleaning some basic rules that can guide us to wealth creation.Sometimes it’s challenging getting to the basic message out of the delivery though. In order to get the most out of strategists, I would make the following recommendations. You need to reduce the various narratives to an unplugged version in your mind. That is, strip the comments down to their basic elements. If the basic unplugged elements make sense, then I would accept the recommendations as being at least viable. But in the music analogy, what types of elements would “sound good” unplugged? There are not many rules of thumb involving investments, but there are a couple, and they are far easier to identify than the corresponding rules of good music. These are mine: In the long view, the market tends to move upward. When academics model stocks, they include two basic drivers: a random fluctuating function on top of a slow but increasing stock price over time. It might seem puzzling that there would be a constant “optimistic” increasing component that reflects an ever-upward stock price over time. There is certainly no scientific proof of this, but history has definitely demonstrated this over the years. Our markets tend to want to go up rather than down. Look at almost any stock that hasn’t filed for bankruptcy. Although you may have to zoom out pretty far on the price graph, most of these stocks have an underlying positive grind. This can be vexing to a short seller that expects a stock to decrease in value, maybe even to the point of going to zero. It’s like trying to keep a soccer ball underwater. Stocks have a natural buoyancy that requires a concentrated grip to keep them down.Not a good enough answer for you? Then strip the argument down to more basic evolutionary anthropology. We are simply genetically wired to improve ourselves in order to optimize our survival. If that were not the case, we would never have left the Stone Age! This translates to incredible human tenacity, with a strong dose of basic optimism. These traits are reflected in the corporations we run. We want our companies to survive, grow and their stocks to appreciate accordingly. U.S. capital markets are the best in the world . I’m not sure anyone could possibly challenge this statement. There are so many features of the US capital markets that clearly place us on top of all the other stock trading nations. For example we know the US formulated our “circuit breakers” (halts on trading stocks) with great care, forming the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms in the late 1980’s. The Task Force was comprised of many experts, and provided full transparency for all to analyze. These curbs continue to be analyzed for potential improvements for the benefit of investors. I’m not certain how China constructed their stock market circuit breakers, but the recent behavior of their markets would suggest considerable shortcomings exist.Our corporate governance model is the best in the world, too, ensuring optimal positioning for corporate policy for publically traded companies and their shareholders. Annual meetings, proxies and many other policy instruments help all investors to maintain confidence in the public disclosure process. Like any market, the U.S. can have weak periods of performance, but in the long run its outstanding infrastructure and surveillance processes should continue to bolster investor confidence and attract a wide shareholder base from around the world. The risk/reward balance eventually comes back to roost. There are extended periods when higher returns simply don’t reflect the underlying risk of their constitution. There are frequent times when everyone piles into riskier investments because “this time it’s different.” Think of things like the tulip mania of the 1600s or the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Sooner or later you get wacked by a high risk investment, even though you thought the risk was mitigated somehow. Heads beat hearts. I’m not talking about coins or cards here. Have you ever gotten so lost that you wonder “How on earth did I end up here ?” Everyone has at some point lost their way while travelling in new areas. Investing can be like that too. You hear the siren’s song of higher returns with less risk, or a unique opportunity that seems to offer more upside with less risk. Or how about high turnover? Watching your portfolio daily to see if you should make changes due to nothing material about the stocks, only price changes? These are all symptoms of the the heart talking.It is most difficult not to give into emotions when managing stocks. You can watch the Dow open down 1,000 points a couple of days ago, just don’t panic and take action. Trying to make a decision in periods of high volatility is like trying to play chess in a windstorm. Practice extreme discipline and you should be better off in the long run. Decisions made with the head will always beat any other method in the long run.The next time you are digesting an investment strategists’ advice with its detailed graphs, analysis and associated fanfare, remember the musician’s rule of thumb: How would this sound unplugged? If it can be reduced to the simple concepts highlighted above, it is durable lasting advice. And by the way, I still enjoy hearing “Dead or Alive” unplugged.
