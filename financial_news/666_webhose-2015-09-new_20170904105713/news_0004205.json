The reign of near-zero interest rate is anticipated to end and smart investors are planning for the inevitable outcome of a rate hike. Added to this, the recent crash in the Chinese equity markets sent jitters among investors across the globe. Though this crash has been attributed to a normal correction in the market and misinformed panic about the country’s outlook, shares have plunged on Wall Street.In this temperamental scenario, it is essential to maintain some standpoints. Investors, especially now, should scout for less volatility and high payout to shield themselves from the downturns in equities.In fact, after the 2011 European debt crisis or 2008 mortgage meltdown, long-term investors with a strong focus on high-quality stocks emerged as winners on a total-return basis. Further, if you are an investor who has already retired or on the verge of retirement and focusing on income, you need to think about where stocks are going to be in a decade or two, instead of a couple of months.The prudent course of action for most investors, then, will be to rely upon stable dividend payers with a strong growth potential to sustain dividends even during a downturn. Moreover, it’s better if these stocks are less volatile. 4 Picks with High Growth and Dividend We hereby zero in on four stocks based on the following credentials: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), beta of less than 1 and a dividend yield of at least 3%.
