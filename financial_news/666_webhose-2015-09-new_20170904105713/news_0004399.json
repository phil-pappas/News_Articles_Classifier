Countries buying defence equipment such as the Typhoon do not see the sale as buying from a company, they see it as buying from Britain.” \nHe added that Britain is lagging behind rivals such as France in its efforts to promote defence exports and that the US the world’s biggest military exporter has the most effective system, with the products effectively being sold by the military . \nAlthough ADS has not looked into how much its proposals would cost, Mr Everitt said the financial impact would be marginal to the MoD and would formalise the current haphazard process, as well as ultimately strengthening the forces through the UK having a stronger economy. \n“Buyers want to talk to the people who use the equipment and service the equipment, not businessmen,” he added. \nThe chief executive of one leading British defence company that derives a large proportion of its revenue from exports said: \"We get pretty good support from UKTI but if serving troops were to act for us that would give an incredible boost. \n\"As we become less and less dependent on the MoD for revenues and look abroad for more of our sales, any extra support would be welcome. We recently closed a sale where we had ex-military staff working on the sale and their recent experience of using the products in an operational environment was invaluable - there is no substitute for that sort of insight.\" \nThe defence chief added that he thought serving troops working on export sales would deliver a \"significant flowback\" to the MoD through a stronger economy. \nThe call came as the trade body reported that UK annual sales of security products rose by £500m to £8.5bn in 2014, though the amount of exports was relatively flat at £3.4bn. \nAccording to ADS data, Britain’s total export sales of security systems ranging from sensors and alarms to communications and anti-hacking software and more traditional defence products such as aircraft and weapons was £13bn in 2013, up from £11.5bn the year before. \nA spokesman for the MoD said: “The UK is the second-biggest defence exporter in the world with only the US ahead of us. The Government continues to work closely with the UK defence sector in pursuit of export opportunities, providing wide ranging and effective support.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:29:24.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
