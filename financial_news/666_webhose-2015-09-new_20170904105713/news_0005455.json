Defence by Simon Evans The three main unions involved in the construction of naval ships and submarines at the government-owned shipbuilder ASC have agreed with South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill to minimise industrial action to enhance the chances of a new fleet of submarines being built in Adelaide.\nThe accord mirrors a similar deal struck more than a decade ago by Kevin Scarce, the man who is presiding over South Australia's Nuclear Industry Royal Commission, when he spearheaded a winning bid by the state to win an $8 billion-plus contract to build Australia's new air warfare destroyers.\nMr Scarce, a former Rear Admiral in the Australian Navy who later went on to become governor, was at the forefront of a similar agreement with unions which ensured a stable industrial relations environment on the ASC facility at Osborne, near Port Adelaide, to help win a destroyer contract in 2006.\nMr Weatherill has written to the new federal Minister for Defence, Marise Payne, outlining the benefits of building submarines in Adelaide and the stability of the industrial relations climate on site.\nHe said \"any fair analysis of the situation\" and all of the factors now at play including economics, job creation and capabilities should result in the federal government committing to building the submarines locally. The three unions involved are the Australian Workers Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the Communications, Electrical and Plumbers Union.\nMr Weatherill said he was working closely with the unions so that industrial action would be \"minimised\" in a local construction of the next generation of submarines.\nThree competing bids from France, Japan and Germany are all being assessed by the federal government as part of a decision about whether the submarines should be built in South Australia, or overseas, or in a \"hybrid\" project using aspects of both.\nThe removal of Tony Abbott as prime minister on September 14 and his replacement with Malcolm Turnbull is widely viewed as assisting the chances of a local construction of the submarines project. Senior federal frontbencher and South Australian Liberal Christopher Pyne switched his support behind Mr Turnbull in the leadership ballot in part because serious anti-Abbott sentiment in his home state meant there was a real prospect that the Liberals would lose seemingly safe federal seats at the next election.\n Mr Weatherill said his government had been very consistent all the way through in pushing hard the interests of South Australia, which gets 25 per cent of Australia's total defence spending and it was clear that the previous Abbott Government had been impacted by the political events surrounding the car industry and defence policy. \"That has been bad for them,\" Mr Weatherill said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:48:45.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
