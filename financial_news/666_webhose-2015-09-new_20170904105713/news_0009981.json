We look at the best places to start and to raise a family in England \nIf you are planning to start a family and want to live somewhere with great facilities, a strong NCT network and excellent school provision, you should consider moving up North. \nThe North West of England has come out on top in an index tracking the best regions for families in the UK. \nThe Family Friendliness Index, calculated by PropertyDetective.com, examined facilities, schools, crime rates and other factors to come up with a list of the best areas for parents and children in England. \nThree of the top five locations in the overall index are situated in the North West: Shrigley Road in Bollington, near Macclesfield, Lower Cophurst Lane in Chorley, and Tame Lane in Delph, near Manchester. \nMaking up the rest of the top five were Coachways in Mapperley, near Nottingham and Packington Lane, Packington, in the East Midlands. \nWhen the results were broken down, the best place to start a family was also Shrigley Road. The best place to raise a family was found to be Bentley’s Farm Lane, Higher Whitley, which is also in the North West, near Warrington. \nScroll down for the full lists. \nThe study considered functional needs for families (local amenities and facilities) and emotional needs (supportive communities and networks). \nFamily friendliness was assessed based on the quality of local schools and green areas as well as the provision of NCT networks and places where families can meet up. \nThe results were then split into the best places to start a family and the best places to raise a family, taking into account the different needs of babies and small children to school-age kids and teenagers. \nShrigley Road scored particularly highly on provision of activities and Bentley’s Farm Lane scored well for schools. \nIf you are looking to compromise on a place that scores highly for both starting and raising a family, another North West location is the top pick - Poynton in East Cheshire. \nDespite the high premium on house prices, South East England did not do so well in the report. Only a handful of locations within commuting distance of London made the top 100. \nBut the good news, according to the report, is “every place is a good place to start a family” since almost every area has good opportunities for families looking to settle down. \nThe good and less good areas are widely dispersed, meaning it is impossible to label an entire region a bad location for families. \nProperty Detective founder Barry Bridges said: “There is a definite North-South divide when it comes to starting or raising a family. \n“For those starting a family, the North appears to be the best choice with 8 out of 10 locations North of the Midlands; for raising a family the reverse is true with 8 out of 10 of the top locations being in the South.” \n= The top ten places to start a family = *Shrigley Road, Bollington *Coachways, Mapperley *Packington Lane, Packington *Lower Cophurst Lane, Chorley *Tame Lane, Delph *Belmont Road, Bolton *Birch Lane, Flaunden *Bradgate Road, Newtown Linford *Tockholes Road, Darwen *Snodland Road, Snodland = The top ten places to raise a family = *Bentley’s Farm Lane, Higher Whitley *Snakemoor Lane, Southampton *Brentwood Road, Brentwood *Little Green Lane, Croxley Green *Ashley Road, Altrincham *Forstal Road, Aylesford *Hinckley Road, Thurlaston *School Road, Hurst *Harrow Road, Warlingham *Charlton Road, Keynsham", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:51:29.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
