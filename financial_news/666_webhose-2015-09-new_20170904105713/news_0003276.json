The latest reading compared with the median estimate of 1.8 percent in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. \n\"Looking ahead, we expect both measures of inflation to rebound over the coming quarters,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. \nHe added that steep falls in pig numbers will keep food prices high while declines in global commodity prices mean both inflation measures should strengthen due to a weaker base of comparison \"which ought to help assuage any lingering concerns over deflation\". \nGrowth in China's gross domestic product (GDP) hit a 24-year low last year, expanding 7.3 percent amid a steady slowdown from years of double-digit expansions. GDP has slowed further this year, expanding 7.0 percent in each of the first two quarters. \nPremier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday that the government is capable of maintaining high economic growth, trying to stem fears about slowing economic growth that have sent global financial markets on a rollercoaster ride recently. \nLi's comments came after China it will adopt \"stronger\" fiscal policies to support growth. \nThe inflation survey collects prices from more than 63,000 outlets including grocery stores, supermarkets, shopping malls and agricultural trade markets across 500 cities and counties in the country, according to the NBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:50:42.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
