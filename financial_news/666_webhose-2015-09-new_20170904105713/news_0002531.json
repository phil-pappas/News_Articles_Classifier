While having a lot of money certainly makes it easier to be healthy and build more wealth, its the habits of successful people that help them maintain their fortunes over the years. Learn how to be successful by adopting these healthy habits of the rich and famous. 9 Healthy Habits of Successful People 1. They Know How to Focus \nSuccessful people get as many, if not more, emails, phone calls and social media pings than you. But when it comes to working on their careers, they don’t let others distract them. Bill Gates, for example, is famous for his biannual “Think Week,” when he hides away from employees, friends and family to study pounds of reports and brainstorm about the future. \nA 2009 Stanford study found that multitasking is woefully inefficient, too. The study revealed that multitaskers don’t pay attention, have as good memory control or switch between tasks as well as those who tackle one task at a time. So, the next time you start opening up more than one email at a time or work on several documents at once — or even think about reading the news as a small break when you’re in the midst of a task — don’t. 2. They Know How to Say No \nYou have the same amount of hours in the day as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett . But while you might busy yourself on social media or with the latest gossip magazines, they are the masters of saying no to time wasters. \nWhen a Harvard student asked Bill Gates for the best piece of advice he ever got, Gates said it was from fellow billionaire Warren Buffett — a master of saying no. Gates explained that he once saw Buffett’s calendar and was surprised at how blank it was. When he asked Buffett how he managed to be successful and have so much free time, the Oracle of Omaha advised him to learn to say no to activities that don’t contribute to your success. \nRead: 30 Best Quotes From Warren Buffett 3. They Crave Knowledge \nWith the digital age, information is constant and easily accessible — so take advantage of it. Building knowledge in your field will move you forward in life, and set you up for success. Just ask Warren Buffett, who told the Columbia University School of Business that the biggest key to his success has been reading a tower of reports and trade publications every day: \n“Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” 4. They Are Productive Every Morning \nStudies show that people who get up early in the mornings are primed for success. Take a study by Harvard biologist Christoph Randler, for example, which found people whose performance peaks in the morning — morning people — are better positioned for success. \nEven if you’re not a morning person, Duke behavioral scientist Dan Ariely argued that the two hours after you are fully awake are your most productive. In a Ask Me Anything on Reddit conversation, he said most people waste time on emails and social media in the mornings, when they’re most primed to be tackling the biggest tasks of the day. 5. They Don’t Give Up \nNo one is perfect — Larry Ellison, Jeff Bezos and even Oprah have made mistakes. But what they have in common is they didn’t let setbacks turn them away from their goals. \nIn short, they have true grit, one of the key factors for success, according to a West Point study. This study found that grit — or perseverance — was a major indicator of future success at the military academy, alongside traditional predictors like SAT scores and high school rank. So the next time you stumble along your path to success, remind yourself that you’re the only one who gets to decide when you quit. 6. They Don’t Complain \nMost of the time, complaining is a waste of time, and wasting time is not a recipe for success. Rather than complain about traffic, long lines and other nuisances they can’t control, successful people stay focused. On this, life coach Jay Cataldo said: \n“They do what needs to be done, whether or not they feel like it in the moment. So stop whining and start winning.” \nRead: 21 Habits of Highly Successful Billionaires Like Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban 7. They Exercise \nAmong other factors, physical inactivity is consistently linked to poor academic performance and lower educational attainment, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No doubt, many of the country’s most successful people are known for their strict exercise regimes, which keep them in top physical and mental shape . \nConsider the workout regimes of these successful celebrities. English businessman and investor Sir Richard Branson regularly kite surfs, swims, plays tennis and runs marathons. Oprah does 45 minutes of cardio six days a week and strength training four to five times a week. Even President Barack Obama exercises 45 minutes a day, trading between strength training and cardio. 8. They Are Not Afraid to Fail \nNo one likes to fail — but fearing it can stop you from chasing your dreams. Successful people understand that, but they know it is better to try and fail than to never try at all. At least in failure, you have the opportunity to learn how not to approach a task. \nBillionaire Sara Blakely, who founded Spanx, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that her father encouraged her to embrace failure. Rather than fear the outcome of her failure, she said, she was taught to see the value in it. 9. They Don’t Feel Sorry for Themselves \nEveryone gets a bad break once in a while. Some people get more than others. But the truly successful don’t waste time feeling sorry for themselves, wrote Amy Morin, a psychotherapist and author of “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do.” \nShe argued that mentally strong people don’t dwell on their failures or ill fortune. Instead, they focus on what they can do — either to improve their situation or move on to success. \nKeep Reading: 15 Best Quotes About Financial Success \nWhether you vow to cut social media out of your morning routine or ditch the gossip magazines for a hearty book, you can adopt healthy habits to maximize your potential for success.
