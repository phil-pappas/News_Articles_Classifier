Aaron Bunch Share on twitter by Shaun Drummond Digital CC, the first bitcoin \"miner\" in the world to be publicly listed , has dropped its original business in favour of using bitcoin's distributed ledger, known as blockchain, as a cheap way to transfer money to people in developing countries.\nThe company began beta testing on Tuesday its first product, called AirPocket, which is an app being used by 50 people to transfer money between the United States and the Dominican Republic.\nExecutive chairman and BRW Young Rich lister Zhenya Tsvetnenko said a decision was made to shift from the original business – which involved solving complex algorithms with powerful computers to verify bitcoin transactions, known as mining – because the company was losing money. This is somewhat ironic for the company, which was known first as DigitalBTC, given it listed on the Australian Securities Exchange via a reverse takeover of resource company Macro Energy .\n\"As much as we believe that bitcoin as a financial instrument can be a valuable tool, we basically have the opinion that it is going to take longer than we thought,\" Mr Tsvetnenko said.\n\"When we saw the big drop in the value of bitcoin, just like a traditional miner, we had to look for something else to do. We have been slowly winding down our bitcoin mining operations and we will be progressively moving away from using it as a currency.\"\nSince Digital CC listed in June 2014, the value of a bitcoin has fallen 61 per cent to $US239 ($340).\n\"Fortunately for us we were able to take what we learnt – the [intellectual property] related to blockchain and then apply this to something that is a lot more longlasting.\"\nNet loss The company reported revenue of $US36.6 million for its 2015 financial year on August 31, and a net loss of $US6.8 million, mainly because of a big fall in the value of bitcoin during the year. However, the result is a 69 per cent improvement on its loss for 2013-14.\nThe stock's value has fallen 60 per cent since its share price leapt to 38¢ when it listed as DigitalBTC in June 2014. It was last trading at 15¢.\nOnce beta testing is complete at the end of 2015, the company will start a pilot of the app in early 2016. It plans to make money by charging a fee per transaction.\nMr Tsvetnenko said for now the company was concentrating on Latin Americans working in the US sending money back to relatives, many of whom don't have bank accounts. He said $US80 billion was transferred annually from the US to Latin America.\nMuch of the money ends up in the hands of people living in rural areas, who have to travel long distances to get to remittance provider offices. Instead, Mr Tsvetnenko will recruit \"Air Agents\", which do have bank accounts in the country where the recipient lives, to act as \"mobile tellers\". They will just need a smartphone to turn the digital exchange of value via the blockchain into cash for the recipient.\n\"If you are in the US, you load your account with some funds, send them to your relative in Mexico. They will receive a six-digit number, called an air code, that represents the value of the money sent. This is recorded on the blockchain, so there is irrefutable evidence of the transaction,\" he said.\n\"The recipient types the air code into the mobile app and the air agent hands out the money minus a small fee.\"\nMuch cheaper fees He reckons the total fees Digital CC and its air tellers will charge will be much less than traditional remittance companies like Western Union and MoneyGram, because they don't have to spend any money on \"infrastructure\" like offices and computer servers.\n\"We're still relying on the traditional banking system to move large amounts of funds. What makes us different is we store our transaction records on blockchain, allowing for much better security, KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering security.\"\nCompanies using the blockchain – a record of all bitcoin transactions that resides on users' computers rather in a central location such a bank ledger – to exchange currency are looking to replace centuries-old methods of transferring currency that rely on credits and debits of \"nostro\" and \"vostro\" accounts at banks.\nAustralia's large banks are trialling the blockchain distributed ledger with Ripple Labs to do currency exchange . Ripple is targeting any company with big stores of cash around the world to act as transfer agents, including global hedge funds.\nBitcoin Group is slated to become the second bitcoin company to list on the ASX in November, after several false starts . It is also looking to make money from bitcoin mining.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DrummondShaun"], "published": "2015-09-29T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:07:53.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
