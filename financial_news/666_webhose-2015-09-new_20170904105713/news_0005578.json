Luis Ascui Share on twitter by Michael Smith Australia Post boss Ahmed Fahour is delighted that Malcolm Turnbull is now running the country. The two are on the same page when it comes to understanding the challenges of digital disruption and Turnbull has backed his efforts to re-invent the postal group as an e-commerce and parcels delivery company.\nThe change of leadership will not have a profound impact on Australia Post's strategic direction though. Fahour has largely achieved what he set out to achieve two years ago, backed by Turnbull in his former role as communications minister.\nThe regulatory changes that mean Australia Post is now allowed to offer a two-speed letter delivery system cleared Parliament last week.\nThis was an important step in Fahour's long-running push to alleviate the government-owned entity of obligations no longer relevant in the digital world.\nAhmed Fahour is the master of talking up Australia Post's financial challenges to get the political and regulatory support he needs for change. David Rowe His next hurdle is convincing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to let him raise the basic postage stamp rate to $1 from 70¢ in January. Fahour is the master of talking up Australia Post's financial challenges to get the political and regulatory support he needs for change, making him one of the few chief executives in the country who actively talks up heavy losses.\nThe terminal decline of Australia Post's letters business was borne out by the post group's latest financial results out on Friday.\nParcels deliver more The 206-year-old postal group delivered its first annual loss in three decades and parcels now account for more than half its revenues for the first time in its history. Ordinary letter volumes fell 10.3 per cent in the year, which was at the top end of forecasts for an 8 to 11 per cent decline. There has been a rapid decline in letter volumes, which peaked in 2008.\n Parcels, on the other hand, are booming, generating about $3.2 billion in revenue compared with $1.3 billion in 2010. The parcels business and other commercial services have been able to absorb the letters losses in previous years. The company's $222 million after-tax loss included a provision of $190 million to pay for a restructure of the letters business.\nFahour's focus is now on delivering on the opportunities in e-commerce that he has been investing in since 2010 and capitalising on cross-border opportunities. The falling Australian dollar is expected to open more doors in Asia, where outbound parcel volumes from Australia have doubled. An example of this is a partnership with Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.\nAustralia Post has a stretched target of returning to the black next year although this will depend on the ACCC's ruling about stamp prices. Fahour says this will affect less than 1 per cent of all volumes for consumers. The price of Christmas cards and concession stamps will be frozen.\nBut ACCC chairman Rod Sims is not one to be swayed by Australia Post's warnings about profitability. He told Chanticleer on Friday that the issue was complex and would not be a rubber-stamp decision. There are issues around bulk mail and the cost between parcels and letters that need to be weighed up. The ACCC is expected to make a decision by late November.\nFahour and various government ministers have indicated privatisation is not on the agenda, although selling off the parcels business clearly makes sense for a government in need of a budget boost. Fahour's salary is always a bone of contention with unions, but the chief executive will earn $2 million less this year after foregoing a bonus.\nTransfield under fire A German company made headlines around the world this week for refusing to sell razor wire to Hungary, which is cracking down on refugees trying to cross its borders. When a company puts ethics over profits, there is an inevitable blaze of glowing publicity.\nAustralia's Transfield Services does not have that luxury. It is in the firing line from a new breed ot social activists seeking easy targets to try and overturn government policy they believe is resulting in horrendous human rights violations.\nTransfield, as the company providing services at the detention centres, has been caught in the crossfire. It cannot afford to take the high moral ground and abandon its $2 billion-plus contract to provide services at detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island. As a public company, this would be in breach of its obligation to shareholders.\nBut the litany of alleged human rights abuses at the detention centres and a string of parliamentary inquiries have left a question mark over how the centres are managed.\nTransfield chairman Diane Smith-Gander is now reportedly no longer in the running for the chairmanship of Tourism Australia because of the fallout from the detention centre campaign, and lobbyists this week dug out company data recording alarming rates of reported assaults and incidents of self-harm by asylum seekers at Nauru.\nThe company confirmed on Friday it was changing its name to Broadspectrum, abandoning the Transfield name, which belongs to a privately-owned investment company owned by brothers Luca and Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, whose father founded the group.\nName change 'a coincidence' The brothers sold their 11.3 per cent stake in Transfield Services last year and have no further involvement in the company. Transfield boss Graeme Hunt says the timing of the name change is an \"unfortunate coincidence\" and was in the works long before the fallout over the detention centre contracts.\nBut it is no secret the brothers, who have been praised for their philanthropy, were horrified last year when Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was asked to step down as chairman of Sydney's Biennale arts festival by artists because of the Transfield link to the detention centres. They want to put as much distance from the issue as they can.\nTransfield is vulnerable at the moment because there is a window for lobbyists to put maximum pressure on the company and its shareholders not to renew the contract in the hope the government will unwind the policy around detention centres altogether.\nDespite the litany of allegations of human rights abuses and several parliamentary inquiries, Transfield was still named preferred tenderer to keep the contract for another five years. That decision will be made next month.\nHunt says the data released to the media this week has been exaggerated and some of the reported assaults included things such as children throwing rocks at each other in the playground, or parental discipline.\nHunt understands only too well the pressure facing public companies under fire from environmental or other social activists. \"It is requiring companies to spend a lot more time being able to respond to what might be minority views. That's not to say those views are wrong or right, but relative to the proportion of the community … you could argue that a public company is an easy area to focus on. We welcome the scrutiny,\" he told Chanticleer.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:03:40.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
