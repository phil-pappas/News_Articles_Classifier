A recovery in prices, and cheaper development costs will be needed to incentivise investments needed to deliver new supply to meet growing demand, Mr Cutt argued.\nHowever, \"the near term will be volatile until the imbalance of approximately 2 million barrels per day works through\".\nBHP flagged in July that iron ore was the only one of its four key \"pillars\", the other three being copper, petroleum and metallurgical coal, set to grow in 2015.\n\"BHP was supposed to have this fantastic growth profile in the [US onshore] dry gasfields and it hasn't eventuated,\" Deutsche analyst Paul Young told the AFR .\nThe company's Blackhawk oil and gasfield is the only field in the US onshore business that works at current prices.\nBHP will have to push production of shale liquids harder to make up for turning off much of the shale gas production sent into the red by the oil price collapse. Liquids production increased 67 per cent last year.â€‹ The new strategy could reduce the life of the shale investment, putting it well short of the longevity of other key assets in BHP\"s broader portfolio.\nIt is racing to push costs down in the Permian in an attempt to emulate its success at Blackhawk.\nBHP has also raised doubts about its commitment to swing its US onshore oil and gas division into cash-flow-positive territory this financial year, saying in July that it required an average crude oil price of $US60 and national benchmark gas price of $3, well above current prices. Benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, is languishing near $US45 a barrel.\nBut Mr Cutt on Wednesday said the resources house looks to have found a new potential top-tier liquids site in Western Australia north of Karratha, and could drill there from 2018.\nAs for the Haynesville project Mr Cutt said \"it is among the best unconventional gas plays in the world\".\nBHP's great oil exploration hope is its offshore Trinidad and Tobago acreage, but even if drilling is successful in 2016 it will not be developed until next decade.\n\"They are still looking at the next five years without one new conventional oil project coming online,\" Mr Young told the AFR last month.\n\"The only way they can really offset that gap is to buy a company. And you put that down the list because very rarely, as you've seen in the past, do companies create value by doing so.\"\nIt was also very rare that good tier-one assets came up for sale in oil. They were generally held by the majors, so if BHP wanted a project it could bring into development in the next five years it would probably have to buy an existing project partner out, he said. Most of BHP's peers have expansion coming in the next five years and a longer reserve life in conventional oil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:52:10.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
