During the trip, organized by the American Chamber of Commerce Panama, the team met with executives representing multinational corporations and informed them on the advantages of growing their business at the mixed-use development. “The business recruitment mission provided an opportunity for the delegation to ensure that international company leaders and global investors in the Atlanta market are aware of what the Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area has to offer,” said Leo Gonzalez, Administrator of Panama Pacifico Agency.\nIn addition to conducting one-on-one meetings with corporate executives representing diverse industry sectors such as R&D, high tech, and logistics, the Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area team participated in business roundtable and special networking events. The team utilized the meetings to establish and maintain relationships with key company leaders located in the Atlanta area.\nSome of the key information shared during the business meetings included the Special Economic Area’s favorable regulations such as special tax, labor, and legal incentives to companies that open a facility on the site, as well as the onsite One-Stop-Shop, which reduces red-tape with 17 government agencies available and onsite customs operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nWhile in Atlanta, the Panama Pacifico delegates also maximized their travel by meeting with international and trade media. During the interviews, Mr. Gonzalez provided details on growth opportunities at Panama Pacifico for international businesses based in the Southeast looking to locate near the Panama Canal. He also touted Panama’s other infrastructure assets including Tocumen International Airport, which offers the highest number of international flights in Latin America; the Panama Pacifico International Airport; the Balboa and Colon ports; and the Pan American Highway, the world’s longest highway.\n“Our goal is to attract investments and create job opportunities in Panama Pacifico. The meetings in Atlanta were very productive and fostered the creation of key business relationships with target companies in the Southeast,” said Gonzalez.\nAbout Panama Pacífico\nPanama Pacifico is a mixed-use master planned community located on the former U.S. Howard Air Force Base near the Panama Canal and just 15 minutes from downtown Panama City.
