We have increased investment in our people and our customer proposition, particularly in relation to free returns trials.\" \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is unclear whether Mr Robertson, a former advertising executive, has plans to continue corporate life after he steps down from the company he founded. \nAsos, which declined to comment on the management changes, saw its shares close slightly down on Tuesday, valuing the company at £2.5bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:42:14.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
