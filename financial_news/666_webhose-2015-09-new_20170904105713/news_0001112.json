Analysts say they could reach a mutual \"no first-use\" pact on cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, evoking Cold War no first-strike agreements on nuclear weapons. \nOn other issues, however, they could just agree to disagree. Xi has already brushed off US concerns of its expansion in the South China Sea. \nOn alleged Chinese industrial espionage and commercial cyber-theft, Xi acknowledged the issue and called it a \"crime\" that affects both sides. \nWashington has threatened punitive sanctions against senior Chinese officials, implying government tolerance if not support for the hackers. \nBut Xi simply proposed a new \"high level\" committee on the problem and said it was a matter for law enforcement, suggesting he sees the sanctions threat as unjustified. \nIn another issue the White House has spotlighted, a new Chinese security law that threatens foreign non-governmental organizations operating in the country, Xi assured that NGOs had a role \"so long as their activities are beneficial to the Chinese people.\" \nBut he added that the foreign NGOs in China \"need to obey Chinese law and carry out activities in accordance with the law.\" \nFor China's part, Xi called for the United States to loosen controls on the export to China or Chinese companies of a range of civilian technologies. \nAnd he made reference to China's request for the US to expel or extradite Chinese fugitives of corruption charges that Beijing says are hiding in the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:31:16.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
