It is a vote of confidence in our long-term economic plan.\" \nThe deal with UKEF will come amid criticism levelled by GE against the US government over uncertain prospects for the country's Export-Import Bank. \nJeff Immelt, the GE chairman and chief executive, who was present at Thursday's signing with UKEF, is expected to deliver another veiled rebuke to Republican opponents of ExIm Bank by warning that \"in today's competitive environment, countries that have a strong export credit agency will attract investment.\" \nMr Immelt is expected to say: \"We are fortunate to have the support of UKEF - one of the most flexible [export credit agencies] in the world. \n\"The UK is pro-export and pro-manufacturing.\" \nCritics of Britain's export performance say the Government has been too slow to deliver the required resource to UKEF and complained that its overseas trade strategy, which is led by UK Trade & Investment, is often ponderous and of little value to smaller companies (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:06:27.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
