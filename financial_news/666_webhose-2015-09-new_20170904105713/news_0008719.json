MCP_0003.JPG Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Wesfarmers-owned grocery retailer Coles has partnered with residential developer TOGA Group for the proposed redevelopment of the Surry Hills Shopping Village in Sydney that could include more than 300 apartments above it.\nRather than risk losing a key inner-city supermarket site, the ASX-listed Wesfarmers exercised its first rights over the shopping centre, at a price of near $100 million, after the centre was put up for sale earlier in the year.\nA development application for a mixed use project is expected to be submitted in the coming weeks\n\"Coles has exercised its first right to purchase the Surry Hills Shopping Village and is currently liaising with property development company TOGA to develop plans which will revitalise the shopping centre,\" a Coles spokesperson said.\n\"To ensure the proposed development is in line with community expectations, TOGA and Coles have been consulting with local residents and existing tenants to seek their feedback. One option under consideration is the development of apartments as part of a mixed use redevelopment.\"\nTOGA did not return a request for comment.\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed in May that China-based developer Auswin TWT had lobbed a near $100 million bid for the centre on the corner of Cleveland and Baptist streets . The property, which sits on a 1.5 hectare sites, was marketed by Ray White Commercial's Scott Timbrell and Jeff Moxham.\nBut Wesfarmers had first right of refusal and the ASX-listed group chose to keep its foothold in a valuable inner-city location – as well as leverage its real estate in the strong Sydney housing market – and matched the offer.\n Currently the site boasts a full-scale Coles and a Liquorland, and a range of other stores such as a chemist, newsagency and medical centre, which combined turn over $3.4 million a year.\nBut the real appeal is the development potential. There have been suggestions the site could yield more than 300 units as well as 8000 square metres of additional retail space.\nThe owner, a private family, bought the site for $6.3 million nearly 30 years ago.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-09-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:06:46.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
