When your child graduates in four years, and he will, right? Then you can either hang onto the rental and use it as a retirement home once its paid off, or you can do a 1031 exchange, deferring the tax on the capital gain so long as you buy another \"like-kind\" property, possibly in a location you prefer to retire to. Gene Rivers of Tallahassee, Florida, home to Florida State University and a handful of other nearby smaller colleges, is one of the truly outstanding real estate professionals in this country. Gene knows real estate and he knows the real estate business. So it's no surprise that he is approached by 25-30 parents a year with kids going to one of the nearby universities who want to buy a rental property for their children to live in and rent a couple to some roommates. After all, Gene helped his own son buy a house that his son then lived in with roommates while going to college. Who's The landlord? First, Gene says, the young college person has to be responsible enough to screen potential tenants or roommates, do a credit check if need be, sign agreements, collect the rent and not let the place fall apart. \"Parents cannot be absentee landlords, Gene says. If your child is not the manager type that's fine.\" You just need to know that going into arrangement to avoid stress for your studying student and yourself. Know who the landlord is and what the responsibilities are. Choosing A Rental Property The typical rental property is around $125,000 with about 1,200 square feet of living space, has three bedrooms and two baths and is move-in ready. Properties with more durable materials like tile (with dark grout), stainless and granite will need less repair over time. Carpets last about three years. Charging Rent You should be able to get for rent at least the what the colleges are charging for a bed in a dorm - about $500 - $600 a bed per month is average in Tallahassee. Each college market is different. It's usually a lot higher in places like Boston, Washington, New York and San Francisco. Many small private colleges are located in picturesque rural settings, but may bring a lot less, in say, Wooster, Ohio. In some markets you can offer an appliance package with a washer and dryer hookup and charge an extra $150 - $200 per month. Financing The Deal And Getting Positive Cash-Flow With a 20% down-payment of $25,000, and a $100,000 mortgage at 3.5% for thirty years the monthly payment will be $449 month, or $714 a month over 15 years, plus taxes and insurance. With $1,000 - $1,200 month in rents coming in, you will cover your expenses and could actually use the net cash flow (if any) to pay your child for being the property manager. Your child won't pay much, if any, federal tax on that income if it is under the 2015 standard deduction of $6,200 for single tax filers, and that after-tax income can be directed to pay for food, tuition, books or whatever costs need covered. What's more, based on the FAFSA aid form, college kids get an income protection allowance in the federal college aid eligibility formula of $6,310, the income won't affect your child's need-based financial aid eligibility either.Of course this is a rather simplified example of rents and costs and it won't work out to be exactly this neat and affordable, but you can see how your child is getting free room and board for managing some roommates and learning responsibility to boot. Current Real Estate Market Rivers says that nationally home sales have returned to their 2005 levels, rents have skyrocketed due to the financial crisis and the sudden demand for rentals by those who no longer could get a loan or wanted to let the real estate market settle in again before buying, and because the economy was so bad that interest rates on loans dropped to record lows, it has made rental properties an even more attractive investment. 3-4% Appreciation On Your Investment Home prices nationally inflate 3-4% on while you are collecting rents, so your investment is appreciating slowly but steadily while your child is in college. If you want to sell it when graduation comes around you can, and you'll probably have earned more on your $25,000 investment than you would in the bank, and because you made that investment, it allowed your child to get nearly free room and board. Tax Savings Furthermore, there is the tax savings you will pick up, what real estate investors call the three Ds: Depreciation, deductions and deferral, meaning that you can depreciate 1/27.5 of the property every year, deduct a lot of expenses and defer the capital gain on the property by virtue of a 1031 exchange, especially after all of that depreciation, and not pay capital gains tax if you buy a like-kind property. Seven More Valuable Insights \"It sounds like a pretty good thing, and it is,\" Rivers says. Here are some additional insights that Gene provided to make the experience and the investment a great return.\n\"If you have an in-state student renter, have the parents sign the lease, not the student. That way if the kid skips out on the rent, you can file a judgment against the parents. you cannot do that with a student residing out-of-state.\" t \"You don't have to be really close to campus to rent to college students. Most kids have cars these days, can get a ride or, at some colleges, even have shuttles to and from off-campus housing. Also, its quieter away from campus and more responsible students like that. Graduate students are excellent renters and tell other graduate students when your rental may be available. t \"Alumni move back. If this is where you want to retire, your kid's college rental may become your retirement property someday.\" t \"AARP found that more elderly people are retiring to a university town with a medical center, the arts, the campus activities and the reasonable housing prices. Florida State University has a medical geriatric program.\" t \"Real estate in college markets is more stable, with steadier rent, but you usually don't get hyper-appreciation.\" t \"The numbers don't work the same on properties above about $250,000. It's still a good investment, it's just that your child isn't living rent-free.\" t \"Insurance on a rental is less than an owner-occupied home because you aren't insuring contents, but the landlord should beef up the liability coverage on his own policy or get a liability umbrella policy.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.ringtherivers.com/"], "published": "2015-09-01T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T04:09:56.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
