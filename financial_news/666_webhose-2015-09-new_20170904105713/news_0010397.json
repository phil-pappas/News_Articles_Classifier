He started his life working in sawmills in the mountains and still remembers, as a 19-year-old, running with other sawmillers to escape the great fires of the summer of 1939.\nThey ran as hard as they could to get into the Rubicon river. He still tells the story nearly 80 years later as if it was yesterday. \"The two old fellas didn't make it, son.\"\nThey couldn't run faster than the fire. He now has a place 50 metres from the river, and that's where he'll be if a bush fire comes again.\nIllustration: Cathy Wilcox.\nBut not if I have my way. We'll get him out before he is directly threatened. He has a point, however, about the dangers we all face in this changing world. It's called global warming and you either believe it or you don't.\nAdvertisement Charlie, our clever economist who's helped us pick so many changes in the economic environment over the years, is also a scientist. He's about to bring out a fourth report on the climate and it won't be good news.\nSo why doesn't everyone believe the science of climate change? Charlie reckons its because his colleagues, the scientists, are introverted folk who speak a language of their own.\nMeanwhile, all those who don't want to believe simply label them eggheads or some other anti-intellectual label, just so they avoid change and get on with life \"as normal\". Or so they think.\nFact is there is no \"normal\" life without water. In fact there is no life at all. Just look at the fiasco taking place right now in California. Back in the '90s they built a desalination plant as a result of a bad drought but after a number of years of good rain they dismantled the plant and sold it to the Israelis.\nTwenty years on, California is entering the fourth year of an historic drought and water supplies are seriously threatened.\nSo the government has decided that it has no option other than to rebuild the \"desal\" plant, but this time the biggest in the western hemisphere.\nThis time they will surely take the long-term view, something that governments are not traditionally good at, but the reality of climate change demands we look ahead.\nAn exception was the Bracks government in Victoria, which, in recent times has been criticised for the plant it built in response to a terrible drought and then \"mothballed\" in 2012 when the rains came.\nBut its day will come and possibly sooner rather than later. El Nino is developing quickly and sucking the moisture out of the vast region of the western pacific from Kuala Lumpur to Hobart.\nAs a possible sign of what's to come, stream flows for July of the water sources of more than half of Victoria are down to just 20 per cent of the seasonal average.\nAustralia heads to Paris in December for the Climate Change Conference. Right now, we seem to be sitting on the fence trying to appeal to the forward-looking people in the world and, at the same time, hanging on to values of the 1950s.\nCoal is good, wind power is noisy and who needs a desalination plant? Madness!\nThe economy has stalled, with the latest quarterly GDP figures showing growth in Australia of less than 1 per cent, so I'm going to stick with Charlie. He's been telling this column for over a year that we're on a road to nowhere unless we look ahead and be prepared to adapt to a changing world of both markets and climate.\nChanging our views about water is fundamental because absolutely nothing works without it â€“ even whisky.\nI think my old dad got it right. Water is a lifesaver. It was for him in 1939 as they leapt into the river.\nIf the economy continues to collapse, we all might end up trying to jump into the river too. But it won't help because there will be no water in it.\nThe food bowl that is Australia could easily turn into the dust bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:45:54.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
