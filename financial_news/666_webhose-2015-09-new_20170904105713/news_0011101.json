PUBLISHED: 00:55, Wed, Sep 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 08:28, Wed, Sep 2, 2015 GETTY China's economy has a huge global impact \nAs the world's second largest-economy, the colossal nation has a huge affect on global markets, including Britain. London's FTSE 100 has shed billions of pounds in value since it hit a peak in April and the loss has recently been driven by fears over China's economy. Last week the index dropped £70billion in one day alone, now dubbed ' Black Monday ', following huge sell-offs in the Shanghai Composite Index. The record low inflation we're seeing in Britain is also in part down to a slowing economy in China. But we're just at the beginning of China's dip, and some economists are terrified about how bad it could get.This is why everyone is so worried about the so-called dragon economy: China's rapid rise in investment-based growth is one that has been seen in Asia before with Japan and South Korea. But experts say that China's scale of growth is both unprecedented in both duration and scale. RBS China's investment growth has been higher than Japan or South Korea \nAt the same time China has run up debt at a very fast pace in recent years. Countries that have followed the same well-trodden path have witnessed spectacular downturns. RBS Is China's credit-fuelled boom a disaster waiting to happen \nGrowth in China is now slowing but no one really knows exactly by how much, as figures released by officials are largely deemed to be unreliable. However, world trade has become extremely sluggish and experts think that China is behind the dip. RBS China's slowing economy is thought to behind a dip world trade \nSlowing trade affects the rate of economic growth in countries. The biggest impact of a slowdown is on emerging and developing markets, particularly those in Asia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. However, a number of eurozone economies, notably Germany, are powered by a large amount of exports to China.As an open market economy Britain isn't sheltered from a global slowdown, even though exports to China are relatively small.Perhaps more worrying is the UK's financial sector's exposure to China, which has rocketed in recent years. RBS Britain's exposure to China is worrying Related articles Panic-buy BOTTLED WATER and tins of food, says Gordon Brown's... \nIn light of slowing jobs and activity and the stcok makrt crash, a credit crunch in China could hit the UK particularly hard. Experts say that everyone was worrying about the impact of Greece on the world economy, but in fact a crash in China's economy could prove to be far more disastrous. RBS The world's exposure to China is far larger than Greece \nFaced with low inflation and an uncertain situation in China, critics now think the Bank of England (BoE) is now likely to keep the base rate lower for longer . But it means that, unlike the downturn witnessed in 2008, the Bank would have one less weapon in its armoury to help ease the effect on the economy. Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, said: \"By keeping rates so low policymakers took the risk that they would face a crisis without having room to cut rates, and their bluff has been called. \"This is unfortunately where the world has got to by keeping ultra-loose monetary policy in place for far too long after the crisis of 2008, in our view.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:09:44.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
