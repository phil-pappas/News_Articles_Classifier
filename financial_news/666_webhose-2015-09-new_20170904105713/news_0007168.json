Australian shares dipped 0.1 percent.\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 erased an early Federal Reserve-driven rally and closed slightly lower amid a selloff in biotech shares, and the Nasdaq lost 1 percent. The Dow , however, managed to rise 0.7 percent.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen last Thursday revived prospects of an interest rate hike before year-end, easing concerns about slowing global growth that helped the dollar and risk assets, which have been buffeted by fears over China's sputtering economy.\nStrong second quarter U.S. GDP data released on Friday further sharpened the case for the Fed to raise rates in 2015.\nFocus now turns to this Friday's all-important U.S. non-farm payrolls as the markets try to gauge whether labour market conditions are strong enough for the Fed to tighten monetary policy.\nThe dollar was little changed at 120.48 yen after edging up to a two-week high of 121.24 on Friday as U.S. Treasury yields rose on the strong U.S. GDP numbers and expectations of a Fed hike in 2015.\nThe euro was also steady, at $1.1187 after shedding 0.3 percent overnight.\n\"In terms of price action, we uphold our view of further dollar outperformance versus the emerging market currencies as risk premia remains elevated on China growth, outflows, and policy opacity concerns,\" wrote strategists at Barclays.\n\"Compared with developed countries, we expect the dollar to appreciate particularly vis-a-vis the euro, as we think the European Central Bank will have to ease monetary conditions at some point before year-end in order to meet its inflation target.\"\nIn commodities, the lacklustre mood in equity markets spilled over and U.S. crude oil futures lost 0.6 percent to $45.42 a barrel.\nGold treaded water after being hit by a stronger dollar. Spot gold was little changed at $1,146.25 an ounce after dropping 0.7 percent on Friday.\nPlatinum, hit recently on fears demand for the metal used in diesel engines would diminish in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, nudged up 0.3 percent to $946.65 an ounce after losing 1 percent overnight.
