The most prominent of the design feature enhancements help make supporting multiple device formats more efficient, by permitting one data visualization to optimally serve multiple screen sizes, with minimal extra effort. Other design-related enhancements include more centralized and shareable design style options, which are especially useful for maintaining a uniform look and feel across dashboards and reports for cloud application providers who embed InetSoft's visualization technology into their vertical or horizontal solution. Enterprise customers will notice a user interface refresh. Both OEM partners and enterprises will notice performance enhancements due to a restructuring of stored query and data source connection information.\n“Our product development goals are centered on making data intelligence easier and more efficient, both for enterprises and solution providers,” comments Mark Flaherty, CMO at InetSoft. “Self-service access to information is a capability of most business intelligence applications, but solving the data management problems most organizations face is what makes ours a data intelligence solution. This product release continues our march to making the delivery of ubiquitous business intelligence more attainable and efficient.”\nInetSoft's Style Intelligence is a data intelligence platform. At its foundation is a powerful data mashup engine that enables fast and flexible transformation of data from disparate sources, which can either supplement or obviate a data warehouse solution. At the development level, a unified interface allows for easy and advanced data manipulation and design of interactive dashboards, visual analyses, and published reporting. At the consumption level, self-service is maximized for a range of users, from casual business or consumer-type browsers to power users and data scientists.\nAs a cloud-ready, fully scalable enterprise-grade platform with granular security, multi-tenancy support, and multiple integration points, it serves both enterprises and solution providers. In either environment, ease of deployment and ease of use are chief development principles that help lower the time investment and total cost of ownership - and make the solution attractive to organizations of any size, with or without BI expertise.\nTo learn more about InetSoft’s Style Intelligence, view a demo, read customer reviews, and download a free evaluation copy, please visit https://www.inetsoft.com/products/StyleIntelligence/ .\nAbout InetSoft\nSince 1996, InetSoft has been delivering easy, agile, and robust business intelligence software that makes it possible for organizations and solution providers of all sizes to deploy or embed full-featured business intelligence solutions.
