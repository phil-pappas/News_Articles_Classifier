PUBLISHED: 13:32, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:51, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 GETTY Flights to America are getting cheaper \nNo-frills carrier WOW air will launch the cut-price fares tomorrow on flights scheduled between October 1 to 15 December 2015, and 10 January to 10 March 2016.Skúli Mogensen, owner and chief executive of WOW air, said: “Modern travellers are smart travellers. \"They prefer to spend less money on airfares so that they can spend more on experiencing their destination. We are thrilled to be able to make transatlantic travel accessible for people who otherwise would not be able to afford it. \"We made a promise to keep offering low fares and these new £99 fares are proof of this.”The tickets sound a great deal for budget-conscious travellers, but there are a few snags to watch out for. The main drawback is the £99 tickets are one-way only and journeys are limited to routes from London Gatwick to either Boston or Washington DC. However, a return journey will work out at still very competitive price of £227 including taxes, according to the airline.
