Under consideration are rules that could put requirements on student-loan servicers to help lower some borrowers’ monthly payments and change the way they process payments to lessen the chance of default. They could also address debt-collection tactics when borrowers fall behind on payments.\nThe consumer regulator is expected to submit a report to the White House as soon as Tuesday that describes student-loan-servicing problems as a big priority for the agency, while calling for changes to servicing and raising the question of whether new rules are needed. CFPB director Richard Cordray is also slated to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday.\nAny new rules would likely have an impact on borrowers of all ages, including parents and other adults who have cosigned for students’ loans. It could also represent the strongest move yet by the four-year-old CFPB to try to arrest the increasing prevalence of default among student loans.\nWith servicing, the CFPB is tackling student loans in the broadest way possible. The bureau doesn’t have oversight over federal student lending, which is handled by the Education Department and accounts for 93% of outstanding student debt, according to MeasureOne, a San Francisco-based firm that tracks student loans. Instead, the bureau’s oversight is in student servicing, an industry comprised of fewer than 10 major firms including major banks, which handle payments on both federal and private student loans. The bureau also oversees private student loan originations.\nLoan defaults among students can have a domino effect on other parts of the economy because they result in lower credit scores for student borrowers as well as cosigners, limiting their access to mortgages and other types of financing.\nIn addition to focusing on borrowers who are behind on payments, the CFPB is also looking at servicing problems impacting those who are on time, but who through lost paperwork or other loan servicer mistakes are erroneously reported as late in paying.\nAny new rules could be a year or more away, with the report serving as the first step in a long process. The bureau plans to use all the tools in its arsenal—enforcement actions, rulemaking and supervision of banks and other student loan servicers —to safeguard borrowers, according to people familiar with the CFPB’s thinking.\nAs part of its efforts, CFPB is considering steps that would put a halt to practices that have been compared with the robo-signing problems that led to banks being fined billions of dollars during the foreclosure crisis five years ago.\nWrite to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:40:42.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
