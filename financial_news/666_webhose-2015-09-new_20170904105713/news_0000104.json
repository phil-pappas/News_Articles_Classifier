The services will assist customers to optimize their operation and maximize uptime. Moreover, it will help farmers improve overall farm efficiency by reducing maintenance and input costs while ensuring superior yields.\n\nFor ages, agricultural farmers have faced various risks including soil tailoring, crop management, climate change and so on. It was difficult for farmers to correlate production techniques and crop yields with land variability which limited their ability to develop the effective soil/plant treatment strategies that could have enhanced production. The introduction of precision farming supports production inputs management.\n\nFuse is AGCO’s next-generation approach to precision agriculture that connects the entire crop cycle from enterprise planning to planting, crop care, harvesting and grain storage. It also provides mixed-fleet farming operations, improved access to farm data, resulting in enhanced productivity and profitability.\n\nFuse blends the right machines, technology and parts supported by AGCO Service and AGCO Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS). The service will enable growers to make more informed business decisions through preventative maintenance, machine condition monitoring and year-round consultation.\n\nFuse Connected Services will be launched at select AGCO dealers in North America and Western Europe in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. At launch, two to three service packages will be available, varying by region, with various stages of firsthand support from dealers.\n\nLevel one will allow customers to conduct self-monitoring, data transfer and management plus set-up, calibration and operation support from the global Fuse Contact Center via phone, live chat and email. Higher level packages will offer proactive, remote condition monitoring by dealer experts, off-season inspections and reviews, operational consultation and training. Specific service packages and pricing will vary based on individual customer needs and dealer capabilities.\n\nServices will be phased in gradually this year and next, starting with Challenger and Gleaner dealers in North America, followed by Challenger and Fendt dealers in Western Europe in the first half of 2016. Other markets are expected to begin piloting and offering Fuse Connected Services in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMost of the Fuse Connected Services will be enabled by a new release of AGCO’s AgCommand telemetry product. Future releases of AgCommand will further enhance AGCO dealers’ customer support and remote monitoring capabilities.\n\nDuluth, GA-based AGCO is a global leader focused on the design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural machinery. AGCO supports more productive farming through a full line of tractors, combines, hay tools, sprayers, forage equipment, tillage, implements, grain storage and protein production systems, as well as related replacement parts.\n\nAGCO currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other favorably ranked stocks in the sector include Lindsay Corporation LNN, Titan International Inc. TWI and ACCO Brands Corporation ACCO.
