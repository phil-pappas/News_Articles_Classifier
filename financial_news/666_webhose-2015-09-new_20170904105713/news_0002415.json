Apple's chief design officer, Jonathan Ive, describes the collaboration this way: \"Apple and Hermès make very different products, but they reflect the deep appreciation of quality design. Both companies are motivated by a sincere pursuit of excellence and the desire to create something that is not compromised.\"\nHermès artistic director Pierre-Alexis Dumas says the collaboration is an extension of the brand's commitment to creating elegant, creative and functional objects for everyday life. \" I see it as the establishment of an alliance in excellence; like horse and carriage, a perfect team,\" Dumas says.\nA marriage with value The real value in the Hermès-Apple Watch marriage comes from the publicity it creates, invaluable in terms of media exposure, social and otherwise, and the message it sends to a new audience for each brand.\n The Hermès name won't translate to a massive sales uplift, but does suggest the Apple Watch has a credibility few other devices enjoy. After all, the Parisian brand isn't known for associating itself with things that don't last.\nIt introduces a world of exclusive luxury and fastidious detail to Apple's cool tech-savvy pool, enhancing it rather than disturbing it.\nIf that's a benefit for Apple, for Hermès the trade-off is just as delicious: it puts it in touch with folk it has barely met to date, and suggests it's a company with not just a stellar past, but also a cutting edge future.\nThe benefit for the consumer – in either camp – is a widening of choice and the ability to luxe-up an everyday device. They're getting either the most expensive Apple Watch yet, or the least expensive Hermes timepiece.\nThat win-win comes with a pretty steep price, the beautifully buffed Hermès bands add several hundred dollars to the price of a standard Apple Watch.\nBut as we know from the amounts paid for a covetable handbag, that's no obstacle when you're talking must-have exclusivity.\nThe straps The Hermès Single Tour strap matched with the 38 mm stainless steel cased Apple comes in fauve Barenia leather, noir box leather and capucine Swift leather, while the Single Tour strap matched with the 42 mm stainless steel case comes in fauve Barenia leather and noir box leather.\nThe Double Tour pairs with the 38 mm stainless steel case and is available in fauve Barenia leather and bleu jean, capucine and etain Swift leather. The Cuff pairs with the 42 mm stainless steel case and is available in fauve Barenia leather only.\nThe cases Across the collection, each stainless steel case features an etching of the Hermès signature and includes a customisable face with three exclusive dial designs inspired by Clipper, Cape Cod and Espace Hermès watches.\nPricing and availability The Apple Watch Hermès starts at $1700 for the 38 mm stainless steel case with the Single Tour, $1780 for the 42 mm stainless steel case with the Single Tour, $1950 for the 38 mm stainless steel case with the Double Tour and $2350 for the 42 mm stainless steel case with the Cuff. The collection will be available at select Apple retail stores, select Hermès stores, specialty stores and department stores beginning October 5 in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the US.\nwatch-next.com", "external_links": ["http://www.watch-next.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:09:35.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
