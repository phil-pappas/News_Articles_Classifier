Bloomberg Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan The New Zealand dollar plunged almost 1.5 per cent on Thursday after the country's central bank cut interest rates for the third time this year in an attempt to head off slowing growth amid weak dairy prices and softness in construction.\nIn early local trade, the kiwi was buying around US63¢, compared with nearly US64¢ just before the Reserve Bank of New Zealand announced a quarter-percentage-point cut to the official cash rate, to 2.75 per cent . It followed two consecutive cuts, in June and July.\nThe Australian dollar, which is also one of the vulnerable commodity currencies, lost about US0.2¢, to US69.85¢, on the news, but picked up more than 1 per cent against the kiwi.\nThe RBNZ cut was widely expected, and came in response to slowing growth in the country because of a slump in the price of dairy products, New Zealand's principal export, and weaker construction activity.\nOvernight, the Bank of Canada remained on hold at 0.5 per cent as widely expected , with concern voiced regarding China, emerging markets, and global growth.\nResources and agriculture exporters' currencies have been under heavy pressure in recent months amid weak prices, concerns about China's slowing growth and expectations of an interest rate rise in the US.\nRBNZ governor Graeme Wheeler noted on Thursday that the domestic economy was growing at an annual rate of 2 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent when the bank last cut rates.\n\"Concerns about softer growth, particularly in China and East Asia, have led to elevated volatility in financial markets and renewed falls in commodity prices,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Domestically, the economy is adjusting to the sharp decline in export prices, and the consequent fall in the exchange rate.\n \"Activity has also slowed due to the plateauing of construction activity in Canterbury, and a weakening in business and consumer confidence.\"\nMr Wheeler left the door wide open to further interest rate cuts, saying \"some further easing in the official cash rate seems likely\".\nCapital Economics on Thursday said it still expected the country's growth rate to ease further, to 1.8 per cent by March next year, and for unemployment to climb as high as 6.5 per cent, from 5.8 per cent now.\nThese estimates compare with the RBNZ's own forecasts of 2.1 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively.\n\"We are not expecting a recession - although we wouldn't be very surprised if there was one - but we do think that even after today's downward revisions the RBNZ's new economic forecasts are still a bit too optimistic,\" said Capital Economics' chief Australia and New Zealand economist, Paul Dales.", "external_links": ["http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2015/mps-10-sept-2015.html", "http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2015/09/fad-press-release-2015-09-09/", "https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-09-10T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:09:11.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
