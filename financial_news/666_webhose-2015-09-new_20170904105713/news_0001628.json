As insurers also face investment challenges from the very low interest rate environment, well-capitalised companies are increasingly looking for innovative ways to deploy capital. \nIn the past year, there have been many instances where reinsurers have returned capital to shareholders, or where medium-size companies have used excess funds to finance the recent wave of mergers or acquisitions. A new report from A.M. Best titled, “European Insurers Continue Overseas Expansion Drive but More Focused in Approach,” states that while there has been some industry consolidation involving larger primary groups, for these companies, the need to create scale is not a key driver. Instead, there is a greater focus on emerging markets to enable faster growth, higher margins and more capital-efficient businesses. \nEuropean insurance markets have tended to be stagnant, with muted premium growth in 2014. In general, there are certain countries that are proving particularly attractive to European insurers because of their low insurance penetration and growing gross domestic product. A.M. Best analysed the expansion strategies of the 10 largest European insurance groups, according to gross written premium, and identified key high growth markets in Asia Pacific, Central Eastern Europe, Latin America and Turkey. Carlos Wong-Fupuy, senior director, analytics, said: “Previously, some European insurers were expanding in many territories, but nowadays they are more focused and cautious regarding specific regions as not all overseas strategies have proven successful. A.M. Best notes that the major participants are demonstrating increased discipline, for example, by attempting to shrink their exposures to underperforming risks and cut back on business subject to the most aggressive price competition.” \nSome of the common challenges encountered by European insurers include market competition and limited control of joint ventures, as well as political and economic risks within a given territory. Furthermore, the report notes that there is the danger of treating each region as a homogenous bloc. Insurers may face regulatory risks; for example, a need to invest their assets locally, but financial markets may not be as mature as in a company’s domestic territory. Additionally, where an insurer is involved in a takeover, merger or joint venture with a local entity, there could be integration difficulties linked to cultural differences and ease of doing business. \nYvette Essen, director, research & communications – EMEA and author of the report, added: \"Frequently, insurers engaging in overseas expansion are large and want to create sufficient scale to justify their presence, so competition and margins can become squeezed.\" \nTo access a complimentary copy of this report, please visit http://www3.ambest.com/bestweek/purchase.asp?record_code=241892 . \nA.M.
