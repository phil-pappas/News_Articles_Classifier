H&R Block will start a modified Dutch auction on Wednesday for as much as $1.5 billion in stock, about 16 percent of its market value, the Kansas City, Missouri-based company said in a statement Tuesday.\nThe tax preparer cleared the way for the repurchase plan by selling its banking unit to BofI Holding Inc. and exiting Federal Reserve oversight, a move it had been working on for years.\nH&R Block said it may buy back as much as $3.5 billion of stock by 2019.
