The monetary authority has been buying yuan to support the exchange rate since a surprise devaluation on Aug. 11. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for August dropped to a three-year low, according to figures released Tuesday.\nThe seven-day repo rate, a gauge of interbank funding availability, fell six basis points to 2.36 percent as of 10:12 a.m. in Shanghai, according to National Interbank Funding Center prices. Chinese financial markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday for public holidays.\n“The weak economy needs ample money supply, and the currency-market intervention also needs injections to offset liquidity tightening,” said Zhang Guoyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Tebon Securities Co. “The PBOC will probably continue short-term liquidity injections after the holiday.”\nThe PBOC sold 150 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) of seven-day reverse repos at 2.35 percent on Tuesday, according to a statement on its website. That matched the amount of similar contracts that are maturing, leading to a neutral position in open-market operations.\nThe central bank pumped 140 billion yuan of funds into the financial system on Monday via six-day Short-term Liquidity Operations. That matched the amount of similar contracts sold on Aug. 26 and due Tuesday. The central bank also injected 60 billion yuan via seven-day SLO on Aug. 28.\nThe cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed payment to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell one basis point to 2.41 percent. The yield on the sovereign notes due July 2025 declined one basis point to 3.32 percent, according to data from the National Interbank Funding Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:21:33.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
