Others had sensors that activated pollution controls only at the temperature regulators used during the tests.\n“The concept of a defeat device has always been there, because there’s such an incentive for the manufacturers to cheat on the emissions tests,” said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety .
