Barbara J. Lipman, a project manager at the Federal Reserve Board, and Ann Marie Wiersch, a senior policy analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, gathered together 44 small-business owners – with less than $2 million in annual revenues and between two and 20 employees – for two online focus groups about their lending options and the rise of online and marketplace lenders.The result: A whole bunch of confusion.Although the mom-and-pop participants, about one-quarter of whom had experience with online lenders, initially said it was easy to evaluate credit offers, when they were actually presented with several options many expressed uncertainty or answered questions incorrectly.The authors gave a loan scenario of $40,000 with $52,000 repayment due within a year – repaid as 10% of debit and credit card sales – and asked the small business owners to guess the actual cost of credit. While it’s not actually possible to come up with an APR for such a merchant cash advance without making additional assumptions, the range of answers showed the depth of confusion: “5%,” “a whopping 30%,” and “on the high side of 50%” were a few of the guesses.“Virtually all the focus group participants want clearly stated product features and costs and an easier way to compare product offerings,” Lipman and Wiersch wrote. Or as one study participant put it simply: “Just make the loan descriptions simple and easy to understand for the average person who might not have a CPA license.”", "external_links": ["https://www.clevelandfed.org/People-Search?pid=74ecd0f9-8a2f-48c9-9122-66d92785194e", "https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/Newsroom%20and%20Events/Publications/Special%20Reports/sr%2020150825%20alternative%20lending%20through%20the%20eyes%20of%20mom%20and%20pop%20small%20business%20owners.aspx", "https://www.clevelandfed.org/People-Search?pid=0009907b-7825-4c0a-af3f-1d9d8ed5dd85"], "published": "2015-09-09T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T02:42:20.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
