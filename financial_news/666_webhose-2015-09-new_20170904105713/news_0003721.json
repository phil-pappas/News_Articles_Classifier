Income tax receipts also fell 3.5pc in the year to August, reflecting a drop in self-assessment payments, while corporation tax receipts also edged down. \nNot only was public borrowing higher than expected in August, it was also revised up by £2.2bn in the first four months of this financial year. Fresh data also showed that government borrowing was £90.1bn in the previous fiscal year, higher than the Office for Budget Responsibility's estimate in July of £89.2bn. \nThe Government's fiscal watchdog expects it to borrow £69.5bn this year to plug the gap between receipts and expenditure. \nWhile borrowing of £38.4bn so far this year is still down £4.4bn - or about 10pc compared with a year ago, Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics, said the new figures put the UK on course to \"undershoot last year’s borrowing total of £90bn by only £10bn or so, rather than the £20bn drop that the OBR forecast in its July’s Budget\". \nHowever, she added that it was too early to say that the UK's deficit reduction plans had been blown off course. \n\"We would not read too much into one set of figures, given that the trend had previously been improving for several months. Indeed, we expect growth of tax receipts to recover quickly given that the recent strength of the economic recovery should be feeding through,\" she said. \nA spokesman for the Treasury said: \"We’ve learned there’s no shortcut to fixing the public finances to provide economic security for working people - that’s why while the economy is growing we have to continue with the hard work of identifying savings and making reforms necessary to finish the job and build a resilient economy.” \nMeanwhile, public sector net debt stood at £1,505.5 trillion in August, or 80.6pc of gross domestic product (GDP). \nThe OBR expects Britain's debt share to fall slightly this year to 80.3pc of GDP as the government brings forward a number of asset sales, including its stake in RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:57:05.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
