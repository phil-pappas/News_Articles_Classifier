After being confronted by the newspaper, he said in a statement that he was working in New York City during the 9/11 attacks but was not in the World Trade Center.\n\"As a young man, I made a mistake that I deeply regret and for which apologies may still not be enough,' Rannazzisi posted on Twitter on Wednesday. \"I don't know why I said this. This was inexcusable. I am truly, truly sorry.\"\nRannazzisi's upcoming special on Comedy Central, \"Breaking Dad,\" is scheduled to air on Saturday.\nFollowing the comedian's apology, the network said on Wednesday, \"We are very disappointed to hear about Steve's misrepresentations and are currently determining how we will move forward.\" (Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy ; Toni Reinhold)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:30:37.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
