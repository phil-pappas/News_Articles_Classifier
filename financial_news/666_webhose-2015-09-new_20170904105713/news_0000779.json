While the median rent in Manhattan is still higher, the vacancy rate in Brooklyn is lower, at just 3%, compared to just over 4.1% in Manhattan, according to StreetEasy data scientist Alan Lightfeldt.\nRentals in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Midwood (where the median asking rent in August was $1,900 a month) and Prospect Park South (also $1,900) spent just a median 11 days and 13 days on the market respectively, according to StreetEasy. Comparatively, Manhattan’s hottest rental markets, which included Little Italy, asking median rent price of $3,995 a month in August) Sutton Place ($3,318 a month), and the Upper East Side, ($2,928 a month) took two full weeks, or 14 days to rent. The increase in rental prices in neighborhoods like Prospect Park is their proximity to more desirable neighborhoods like Park Slope, said Lightfeldt. “If you can’t afford Park Slope then Prospect Park is a close second,” he said. \nLightfeldt says that Brooklyn is also continuing to grow as many jobs, including tech and startup-related companies, are locating in the borough. “It’s now possible to live (and work) all your life in Brooklyn, compared to 20 years ago,” said Lightfeldt. \nStill, for those who have to commute to Manhattan, it can take as much as 45 minutes to an hour to get there, especially as the subway becomes more crowded and delays are more frequent. Still, for those who have to commute to Manhattan, it can take as much as 45 minutes to an hour to get there, especially as the subway becomes more crowded and delays are more frequent. \nNot surprisingly, the higher the rent, the slower it is to move, but the slowest-moving Brooklyn market (downtown Brooklyn with a median asking rent of $3,300) spent 30 days on the market. In Manhattan, the slowest-moving market of Midtown South (asking median monthly rent price in August of $3,850) took 48 days to unload. Tribeca in Manhattan, was one of the most expensive markets surveyed by StreetEasy, with a median August monthly rent of $6,500 and spending just over a month, or 32 days on the market. By comparison, downtown Brooklyn is also one of the most expensive markets with a median rent of $3,300 and a median of 30 days on market.\nThe New York sales market was equally as competitive in August with the median resale price of all Manhattan and Brooklyn homes rising to another record high, though the pace of growth is slowing, StreetEasy said. Manhattan resale prices of all home types rose 6.7 % from last year to a record $986,314, as tracked by the Manhattan Price Index. (MPI) . The Brooklyn Price Index (BPI) also reached an all-time high in August, increasing 7.2% year-over-year to $538,563. Last year, prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn grew by 9.2% and 10.4%, respectively, StreetEasy.com said. \nStreetEasy said that homes in both Manhattan and Brooklyn both sold for at least 100% of the seller’s asking price, with the Prospect Park sub-market in Brooklyn being the hottest in both Manhattan and Brooklyn with homes in Prospect Park selling for on average 5% above the sellers initial asking price. \nBuyers in Brooklyn however may get a break this fall. Price growth in Manhattan, StreetEasy predicts, will continue to slow with median resale prices expected to grow by 0.2% over the next month, according to their Manhattan Price Forecast. In Brooklyn, prices will actually decrease 1.6% over the next month, according to their Brooklyn Price Forecast as a result of oversupply, says Lightfeldt. \nA full table of StreetEasy’s neighborhood-by-neighborhood rental report is here:\nFastest moving rental markets in August Brooklyn Neighborhoods Median Asking Rent Median Days on Market Manhattan Neighborhoods Median Asking Rent Median Days on Market Midwood $1,900 11 Little Italy $3,995 14 Prospect Park South $1,900 13 Sutton Place $3,318 14 Boerum HillHill $2,850 14 Upper East Side $2,928 14 Brooklyn Heights $3,295 14 West Village $3,850 15 Slowest moving rental markets in August Brooklyn neighborhoods Median asking rent Median days on market Manhattan neighborhoods Median asking rent Median days on market Downtown Brooklyn $3,300 30 Midtown South $3,850 48 Windsor Terrace $2,700 29 Midtown $4,378 36 Columbia Street Waterfront District $2,500 26 Battery Park City $5,500 34 Kensington $2,100 26 Tribeca $6,500 32 Gravesend $1,750 24 Soho $4,500 29 Source: StreetEasy.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:31:22.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
