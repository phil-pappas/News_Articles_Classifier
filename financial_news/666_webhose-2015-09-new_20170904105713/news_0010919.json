Our strategic response to these issues defines a clear agenda for success.”\nMyer also today posted a net profit after tax for the year to July 25 of $29.8 million, a 69.7 per cent slide over the previous year's $98.5 million profit.\nThe result was weighed down by the $24.5 million costs of closing its Top Ryde and Hurstville stores and other restructuring costs associated with the turnaround plan.\nOn an underlying basis, Myer's profit of $77.5 million was still a 21.3 per cent decline on last year's $98.5 million.\nTotal sales lifted 1.7 per cent over the year to $3.196 billion, while on a comparable stores basis, sales were up 1.1 per cent.\nMyer declined to pay a dividend and said it intends to distribute shareholder returns following the first half of the 2016 financial year.\nThe retailer said it expects net profit after tax over the coming year to be between $64 million and $72 million, excluding restructuring costs, which are forecast at between $35 million and $45 million before tax.\nShare offer to reduce debt, provide flexibility\nThe announced fully underwritten entitlement offer to retail and institutional investors aims to raise about $221 million at 94c per share. In the retail component, shareholders are entitled to two new shares for every five shares they hold.\nThe capital raising will be used to reduce core debt and provide balance sheet flexibility to implement the New Myer strategy.\nThe offer represents a 22 per cent discount on the stock’s last closing price. Myer shares were in a trading halt this morning following the announcement, and last traded at $1.21.\nThe polishing of the balance sheets follows a $600 million debt refinancing in June.\nMr Umbers has only been in the top job since March and recently appointed Grant Devonport as the group’s new chief financial officer as the retailer overhauls its business during a period of significant change within the industry.\nThe moves announced today were a significant step forward for Myer, he said.\n“The board and management have taken prudent action to reset the balance sheet and add financial flexibility to the business,” Mr Umbers said.\nIn late June the retailer cut about 80 jobs from its head office amid a review of its current and future customer base, which formed the basis for its new strategy.\nMyer said the five-year turnaround plan will be an “energetic revitalisation of Australia’s best-loved retailer”.\n“The New Myer strategy is a sustainable business model that will enable us to maintain and improve our competitive position and return the business to sustainable profit growth in the coming years,” the company said.\nThe retailer is expecting to invest between $100 million and $120 million in the business over the coming fiscal year as it reallocates retail space from underperforming categories to new and higher performing lines.\nMyer will also focus on a “narrower and more powerful range” of brands, along with a rollout of Wi-Fi and upgraded fitting rooms and restaurants, cafes and event spaces.\nThe Australian\n Can the ‘new’ Myer bounce back?", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/myer-to-raise-220m-after-profit-slide/story-fni0dcne-1227507308164"], "published": "2015-09-01T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:41:29.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
