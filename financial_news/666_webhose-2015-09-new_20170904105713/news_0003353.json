In line with that, analysts are watching Apple as its stocks climb up.\nOn Monday, Apple announced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are on track to beat last year's sales. Apple (AAPL, +0.84%) also opened higher on the stock market.\nTrudy Muller, a representative from Apple, said in a statement from Forbes , \"Customer response to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus has been extremely positive and preorders this weekend were very strong around the world.\"\nMuller said the units are about to surpass previous year's 10 million sales on the first weekend as the phones became available on September 25.\nCNBC cited on the company blog that Apple is adjusting to meet its demand as their own sales prediction exceeds with preorders in China. \"We are working to catch up as quickly as we can, and we will have iPhone 6S Plus as well as iPhone 6S units available at Apple retail stores when they open next Friday\".\nDaniel Ives, a senior analyst from FBR Capital Market said the preorder record indicates a strong stance for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. In fact, he was persuaded by China's response. \"It shows that they are off to a white-hot start, with China really being front and center as a main driver of initial demand,\" Ives noted.\nAdded to that, analysts say the Upgrade Program helps the company a lot. They see it as a game changer when Apple offered $32.41 Upgrade Program for 16GB iPhone 6S. In that case, if customers would upgrade their phones each year, they will get AppleCare+ for free.\nThrough the Apple Care , customers will have free software support and hardware repairs for two years. That also includes coverage for accidental damage. However, if customers update their phones but don't want to avail the Apple Care+, they will have price cuts in other services from Apple's four wireless carriers.\nApple's stocks have plummeted in the previous weeks due to China's economic downturn. But Apple's 6S and 6S Plus sales implies the company is turning back.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.springboardplatform.com/storage/js/ingage/apingage.min.js", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysomaney/2015/09/15/look-past-apples-first-weekend-orders-data/", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://mgid.com/", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/14/apple-we-are-on-pace-to-beat-last-years-iphone-first-weekend-record.html", "http://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program"], "published": "2015-09-16T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:16:14.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
