Photo: Daniel Munoz\nWhichever party is in power, the other mob routinely try to entice or entrap the governor into saying something less than flattering about the economy and the way the government is or isn't managing it.\nAdvertisement Normally, RBA types play it safe by sticking to matters bearing directly on monetary policy and waving away those on the fiscal (government) side. Opposition members generally make very heavy weather of it.\nBut that normality has been steadily eroded, starting with something close to an impassioned plea (for a central banker) by deputy governor Philip Lowe before the committee 13 months ago and culminating in a speech by governor Stevens in June that effectively said Canberra's denizens were failing the nation and not doing what is needed to restore confidence and get the economy up to speed.\nIn search of animal spirits Yes, there's that confidence word again – the one that keeps surfacing in business reaction to the dumping of Abbott. It's a word that has been concerning the RBA, too, as it beat the bushes in search of animal spirits.\nThere are, therefore, any number of interesting areas to explore with Stevens this Friday, speaking as he will be after the Federal Reserve's decision, but two in particular could be of interest to Labor members.\nFirstly, just what is the RBA seeing on the non-mining investment front, as there have been mixed messages coming from ABS data and business surveys. It's the apparent lack of growth in non-mining investment that has given us two interest rate cuts this year – those animal spirits missing in action and upon whose shoulders the economy will be shaped ahead of the federal election in 12 months' time.\nWe don't get a final score from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 2014-15's non-mining investment growth until next month. Joe Hockey's budget promised 2 per cent growth last financial year, 4 per cent this year and a sharp 7.5 per cent in 2016-17. Most indications are that 2014-15 will print negative and nothing is happening so far this year.\nThe two things keeping the economy growing, albeit below par, are household consumption and dwelling investment. The former is not sustainable without income growth and the latter also has its limits once the shortfall in housing has been met.\nSo, Governor Stevens, what non-mining investment growth are you seeing this year and what can be done about it? As a supplementary (without expecting a real answer), could changing the Prime Minister make a difference to business confidence and what should be done to maximise the opportunity provided by a political circuit breaker?\nCircuit breaker The second and related area of interest is how much further the governor might be pushed on his recommendation that the government borrow to help fund an increased and de-politicised channel of infrastructure investment – a highlight of his June speech.\nHockey made speeches about the government's alleged record infrastructure spending, but it's not happening. Government sector demand outside New South Wales and Victoria is negative. Government investment as a percentage of GDP is at a record low. Even if it wanted to do more, the former coalition leadership has been hoist on its own petard of deficit chants. Explaining a backflip that would involve further blowing out government debt was beyond Abbott and Hockey.\nEnter a new PM. Malcolm Turnbull has promised his right wing enemies that he will maintain several of their policies he personally disagrees with. He explicitly endorsed \"the market\", but that is stopping well short of the right's ideological belief in the private sector doing everything and the government little. (Cue the Institute of Public Affairs \"to do\" list.)\nTurnbull, thankfully, is not a captive of the IPA/Bolt/Jones/Hancock/Murdoch brigade. His promise to explain and communicate economic challenges and policy opens the door to the possibility of change and a positive but still economically conservative vision.\nAnd Stevens and Lowe have gone further than recommending borrowing to invest in more physical infrastructure – they are believers in the importance of human capital as well. Yes, investment in education also costs money, while genuine tax reform costs political capital that the last bloke frittered away on various captain's calls and contradictions.\nSo, Governor Stevens, what level of debt do you think the Australian government could prudently afford as a percentage of GDP? And, if a federal government was to become more willing to borrow to invest, how long would it take before the economy showed the benefits of your recommended action?\nIt could be a most interesting chat with a committee that contains members from both sides who fancy their economic credentials. It also has a new chairman since the RBA's last visit – the member for Bennelong, John Alexander, having taken over from the promoted Kelly O'Dwyer. The former tennis champ's ability in controlling the flow of the match may be tested.", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-06-10.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:36:54.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
