Photo: Louise Kennerley\nSoutheast Asia's biggest bank, DBS Bank, says a squeeze on the margins that big Australian banks make from lending to large corporate clients is here to stay, as it eyes a larger local presence.\nThe Singaporean lender, which received an Australian banking licence in June, on Tuesday said it would target a bigger share of the institutional loan market â€“ lending to companies with market values of about $500 million or more.\nIt believes this market has strong growth potential as Australia's economy becomes more deeply integrated with Asia through more inward investment and growing exports of services.\nChief executive Piyush Gupta said Australia's closer integration with Asia was \"inexorable,\" arguing that further growth in exports of services such as tourism, education, and health care would be the \"next big thing\" for the economy.\nAdvertisement He said DBS was not directly seeking to challenge the market dominance of ANZ Bank, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac. DBS has a market capitalisation of S$52 billion, about half that of Westpac, and its license does not currently allow it to deal with retail customers.\nBut in comments that highlight the competition in lending to large corporations, he said a squeeze on profit margins in this part of the market was likely to persist.\n\"I think the pressure on margins will be there to stay, and one of the things that it results in is that the Australian banks have to get into environments they are not used to,\" Mr Gupta told journalists.\n\"The truth is that we come from an environment where margins are already much tighter,\" he said.\nThe squeeze on institutional lending margins was last month highlighted by ANZ Bank chief Mike Smith, who said the trend was particularly apparent in its domestic institutional loan book. Mr Smith said there was little demand for credit from the top end of town, and competition from international banks was \"fierce.\"\nDBS aims to expand the size of its Australian loan book from about $500 million today to up to $5 billion within a couple of years.\nDBS, which is 29 per cent owned by the Singapore government's sovereign wealth fund Temasek, had \"deep pockets\" and would take a long-term view on the economy's prospects, Mr Gupta said.\n\"Our views are driven by long-term megatrends for what is happening around the region, not where the short-term cycles are,\" Mr Gupta said. \"In that context we are of the belief that Australia's integration into Asia is inexorable.\"\nWhile the resources sector is feeling the pain of weak commodity prices, the bank is expecting growth in inward investment into Australia's services sector, including in hotels, health care and education.\nBefore obtaining the local licence, DBS has already been involved in syndicated lending deals in Australia, including as lead arranger for Woodside Petroleum on some deals, and it has helped to fund various public private partnerships.\nInstead of taking business from the big four lenders, he argued DBS was targeting new business being created by growth in financial flows around the region. He also noted the scaling back of several European banks in the region including RBS, Barclays and Deutsche Bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:09:34.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
