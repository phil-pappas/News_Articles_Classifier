That means an array of government vendors are not getting paid for services they have provided since fiscal 2016 began on July 1.\nThe impasse stems from the governor's insistence on tying enactment of a new budget to passage of his framework for business-friendly changes to state workers' compensation, collective bargaining, tort and property tax laws.\nWithout spending authority, White said his office is facing the prospect of bills no longer being paid. That would affect motorists seeking drivers' services, his office's computer operations and upkeep of the state's Capitol complex in Springfield, he said.\n\"This situation has grown critical, and we are seeking a solution to this problem,\" the five-term Democratic secretary of state wrote in a letter to Rauner that was released on Friday.\nWhite said unpaid computer and software contractors have threatened to quit performing maintenance and data-breach protection services on the secretary of state's sprawling computer network, and some landlords for facilities in which drivers' services offices are based are pursuing default actions against the state for nonpayment of rent.\nOn another front, the unpaid company that provides armored truck service has threatened to discontinue collecting as much as $100,000 in cash per day from secretary of state facilities, he said.\nThe secretary of state also cautioned that daily garbage pickup at the state Capitol could be imperiled because the vendor has threatened to discontinue waste collection until getting paid. White said he is concerned electricity, gas and coal supplies also are at risk because of nonpayment of bills.\nA Rauner aide said on Friday that the governor's office reached out to White about his letter and shares concerns about other cash-starved functions within state agencies under the governor's control.\n\"We hope (White) will also join us in encouraging his friends in the legislature to fulfill their constitutional obligation to pass a truly balanced budget,\" Rauner's spokeswoman, Lyndsey Walters, said.
