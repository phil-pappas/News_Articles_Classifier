Oklahoma nonprofits with programs that focus on career opportunity, education, health care, healthy eating, hunger relief and human services programs are encouraged to apply for funding. The deadline to submit grant requests is September 18. \nLast year, the Walmart Foundation's State Giving Program awarded grants to Oklahoma organizations totaling $37 million. \n\"The Walmart Foundation's State Giving Program is another way we extend our mission to help people live better,\" said Rodney Walker, Walmart vice president and regional general manager. \"In addition to the thousands of community service hours our associates perform and the in-kind donations spread throughout the communities we serve, these State Giving grants allow us to help nonprofit organizations fulfill their mission and continue on their path of service.\" \nFor example, as a 2014 State Giving Program grant recipient, Neighborhood Services Organization (NSO) received a $75,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation to assist with life skills training and resources by providing much needed life skills to young men who age out of foster care. \n\"We're honored to receive this generous grant from the Walmart Foundation,\" said Stacey Ninness, president and CEO of NSO. \"We are the only organization in Oklahoma providing these types of resources to the young men who age out of foster care without the basic life skills they need to survive. They have never been taught to plan and prepare meals, shop for healthy foods or maintain a home kitchen.\" \nLaunched in 2008, associate-led State Advisory Councils work with the Walmart Foundation to help identify needs within their state, review the State Giving Program grant requests and make funding recommendations to the Foundation. Eligible applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in order to meet the program's minimum funding criteria. \nGrant submissions are only accepted online at www.walmartfoundation.org/stategiving . \nAbout Philanthropy at Walmart Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are committed to helping people live better through philanthropic efforts that align with the company's core business strengths.
