And, so, the question has arisen as to whether the Fed and the ECB should recognise that 2.0 per cent inflation in a global economy awash in cheap oil, available workers and money-saving technologies might be too ambitious and should lower their target. ECB President Mario Draghi faced that very question at a news conference on Thursday in Frankfurt, Germany. Draghi was having none of it, at least publicly. He said that lowering the ECB's 2.0 per cent inflation target would represent an admission of failure that could damage the central bank's authority. \"It will test our credibility if we were to change our target, when it's taking more effort to achieve that target,\" he said. In the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, annual inflation is a scant 0.2 per cent. In the United States, the Fed's preferred inflation measure is 0.3 per cent. US inflation hasn't breached 2.0 per cent in more than three years. The major central banks' historically low interest rates and mass bond purchases have failed to offset the pressures of lower energy prices and tepid consumer demand. When the Fed ends its next policy meeting on September 17, it will announce whether it's raising US interest rates after nearly seven years of record lows. In calculating that decision, the Fed must weigh its confidence that inflation will return eventually to 2.0 per cent - one of its mandates. The credibility of the Fed and ECB hinges in part on their ability to achieve that level of inflation. And, as that target remains distant, central bankers must maintain the extraordinary interventions they began with the 2008 global financial meltdown. Lowering an inflation target would carry its own risks. For one thing, it would put countries perilously close to a deflationary trap. In this scenario, consumers would stop spending because goods and services keep becoming cheaper - which then stifles economic growth. That's why economists and analysts say that central banks need to continue supporting economic growth. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz and a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, says the dilemma stems from an overreliance on interest-rate policies to support a floundering Europe. Alternatively, El-Erian argues, governments could have deployed other, budgetary options. \"The fundamental issue is neither the target nor what the ECB can do on its own to meet it,\" he says. \"It is about the lack of a comprehensive policy response that engages the full economic tools available to Europe.\" In the US, the situation is somewhat different in the United States, where the unemployment rate is half the size of Europe's. The US jobless rate has dipped to 5.3 per cent, a nearly normal level that would usually lead the Fed to raise rates. Yet low unemployment has failed to send inflation to the 2.0 per cent target. Some economists caution against a September rate rise by the Fed precisely because of the inflation target: They argue that a rate increase that takes effect before clear evidence of rising prices could choke off consumer and business spending and potentially income growth. \"When the world economy is fragile, you end up restraining demand,\" says Stephen Oliner, a former Fed economist who is now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \"That's why tightening now would be a head-scratcher.
