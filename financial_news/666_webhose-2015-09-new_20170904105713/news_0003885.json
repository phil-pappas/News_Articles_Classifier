The government has promised to take more refugees displaced by the conflict in Syria. Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett The government's promise to take 12,000 more refugees displaced by the conflict in Syria and Iraq has surprised and outflanked Tony Abbott's political critics.\nIt reflects a belated appreciation of the community demand to show greater compassion.\nBut the domestic political sniping over this issue during the past week only obscures the larger reality.\nThere will be no immediate solution to the mass migration of people fleeing not just Syria but many other countries of Africa and the Middle East. Nor is even a viable longer-term response obvious.\nThe sympathetic welcome, especially from Germany, and the international wave of desire to assist those in such need is already creating a powerful new impetus for many more people desperate to leave their homes in search of better, safer lives elsewhere.\nBest hope to escape From Iraq to Nigeria to Libya, hundreds of thousands and potentially millions are also realising that leaving now is their best hope to escape the incessant violence and despair devastating their home countries.\nThat is because it will be before an inevitable political and community backlash as more European citizens begin to fear being overwhelmed by the needs of so many people wanting to join them.\n Many of the Syrian refugees coming to Germany now have already spent periods living in Turkey, for example, which offered a temporary home to about two million who had fled Syria.\nBut this option is increasingly seen as an inferior alternative to the possibility of life in Germany or Sweden or other Western countries.\nFor many other nationalities as well as Syrians, Turkey's main appeal now is as a staging post en route to the West.\nThe news of the flood of refugees reaching Europe and safety gets just as much attention in the countries they come from as those are heading towards.\nWhy wait Why wait any longer – at home or in bordering countries – for help which never comes? Australia's offer is generous in relative terms and does offer welcome hope to many thousands of persecuted minorities.\nIn overall terms, it barely scratches the surface – just like the European response so far.\nAnd despite the widespread praise for the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on this issue, the level of support for her approach is unlikely to last if – when – more refugees keep arriving in vast numbers.\nShe says the decision to offer registration to all Syrians is designed to deal with an emergency situation but this looks more like a rolling emergency than one with any time limit.\nEntire countries have effectively collapsed into any number of warring religious tribes. Syria and Iraq won't ever be restored as functioning states no matter how many air strikes there are against Daesh.\nPolicy criticism Criticism of the likely impact of a semi-open door policy in parts of Europe is not only coming from Merkel's political opponents and a vociferous anti-immigration movement within Germany itself. There is little agreement anywhere on how to deal with such an influx. Some other governments are already blaming Merkel for exacerbating the problem by attracting ever greater numbers.\nBut the meeting of European ministers this week demonstrates their inability to deal with such unprecedented migration levels, even in a community of 500 million.\nThat's despite community pressure on all governments, from the UK to Australia, to take in more Syrian refugees, partly in response to the haunting image of a drowned three-year-old child.\nThis shows the power of a non-stop and totally borderless news cycle and ubiquitous social media as well as the power of compassion.\nBrussels has a plan to settle another 120,000 people over the next two years on top of the 40,000 European governments supposedly agreed to last May to relieve pressure on Italy, Greece and Hungary. But even this lesser target had still not been reached in practice.\nAnd 160,000 compares to the several hundred thousand that have come to Europe this year alone with no sign of that easing off. Just last weekend, as the border with Hungary was reopened, 22,000 arrived by rail for processing in Germany.\nLatest plan President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker was announcing details of the latest plan this week. It includes France committing to take 24,000 people from conflict zones, Germany 31,000, Spain 15,000 and Poland more than 10,000 with the rest somehow distributed among other EU states.\nThose countries not participating would be expected to pay to help those that did. It will take many years, if ever, to sort out those sorts of arguments.\nCountries such as Poland are already resisting assigned targets. Hungary doesn't want to take any Muslims. Other exceptions include the UK, Denmark and Ireland, which always had special opt-out provisions from the EU.\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has been under similar pressure to Abbott but his reaction has been more limited. He has just announced Britain will take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years. They too will be from camps bordering Syria rather than those who reach Europe. This won't fit Merkel's vision of sharing the European burden.\nThere is always moral selectivity involved in helping some and not others trying to escape violence and persecution. The degree of death and destruction in Syria remains beyond most people's imagination. But what of Libya or Afghanistan? Or Nigeria or Eritrea? Or, in Australia's more immediate region, of the violence meted out to the Rohingya in Myanmar?\nThe Abbott government stopped the boats as promised and as the public wanted. Now the public wants something else as well.\nBut it is unclear what lies beyond the immediate humanitarian response to the plight of millions no longer willing to sit waiting in refugee camps or poverty in non-Western countries.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-09-09T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:08:37.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
