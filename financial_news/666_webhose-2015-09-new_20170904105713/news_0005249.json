The size of the country’s branded rice market, which currently stands at $2.4 billion, is expected to rise to $3.5 billion by 2017, it forecasts.\nDomestic rice companies have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate in the range of 20-30% in value terms over the past four years, it said.\nThe country produced 104.8 million tonne of rice in the last crop year through June, down from a record 106.7 million tonne a year before, following a 12% deficit in monsoon showers from the benchmark level.\nIndia — the world’s second largest producer and consumer of rice — accounts for 25% of the global exports of this grain. In the basmati rice segment, particularly, it has a 75% share in the global trade.\nHowever, the report also flagged some challenges as well, especially in the supply chain. The rice milling and processing industry is highly fragmented and a lack of adequate storage capacity results in a waste of significant quantity of grains, including rice. “Given the constraints on land availability, high yielding varieties that require less water and inputs are critical. Although the government has supported the development of such seeds, their high costs keep the penetration low. Additionally, there is a pressing need to infuse professional management in the family-run companies,” it added.\n 25, 2015 12:28 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T10:16:51.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
