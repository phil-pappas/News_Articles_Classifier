Even the cars smell better than taxis.\"\nWith less than three people out of every 100 owning cars in Vietnam, a country of 90 million people, and one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the region, ride-sharing executives are thinking big.\n\"Our goal is to replace private car ownership,\" San Francisco-based Uber Technologies' general manager for Vietnam, Dang Viet Dzung, told Reuters in an interview.\n\"If Uber is available everywhere, so cheap, so reliable, why do you need to buy a car?\"\nUber charges 8,000 dong (27-36 cents) per kilometre compared with 11,000-15,000 dong for taxis in Ho Chi Minh City. The city's taxi rates are more than double those in Bangkok, Manila and Jakarta, according to Vietnam's Association for Consumer Standards and Protection.\nNguyen Tuan Anh, GrabTaxi's general manager for Vietnam, said Vietnam's young population - more than two-thirds of people are under 30 years of age - was \"eager to learn new things\".\nBut he cautioned that many still yearned to own their own car regardless of the cheaper alternatives now available through ride-sharing.\n\"If our service is good enough to provide the convenience that surpasses the need for showing off, then they eventually may take it,\" Tuan Anh told Reuters in an interview.\nBoth operators declined to reveal how many Vietnamese users they had because it could impact market competition.\nLOCAL COMPETITION\nUber and Singapore-based GrabTaxi won't get their own way in Vietnam as local outfits muscle in on the action.\nLeading Vietnamese cab firms Mai Linh and Vinasun will soon launch smartphone apps, adding to those of Xe Cua Toi, LiveTaxi and iMove, which debuts this month.\n\"It will replace, in a couple of years, the conventional system of calling a taxi,\" said iMove's Truong Trong Hao.\nBut in an effort to gain an edge, the domestic players are tailoring their services to fit the Vietnamese market.\nGrabTaxi has introduced a GrabBike motorcycle service, while Uber last month started accepting cash from Vietnamese to get around the lack of credit cards - only 2.5 million in circulation - following similar moves in India and Kenya.\nClear laws aren't here yet, either. Uber isn't illegal, but policymakers are working out how to regulate it.\nKhuat Viet Hung of Vietnam's National Traffic Safety Committee said smartphone apps were permitted to work with \"commercial transport service providers,\" but not offer rides themselves.\nBut the apps' unhindered growth suggests that rule isn't being enforced and authorities are warming to the technology.\n(Editing by Martin Petty and Stephen Coates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:31:36.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
