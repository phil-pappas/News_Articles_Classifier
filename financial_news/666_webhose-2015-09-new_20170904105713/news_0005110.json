Given financial markets need to rely on trust to function effectively the absence of that trust is impairing the effective function of the market.”\nDr Debelle warned the code — which will be principles-based not rules-based — could not eliminate misbehaviour, but would enable it to be identified “sooner rather than later” and flushed out into the open.\nThe RBA has been expected to adopt the code, which aims to remove irregularities and clarify gaps in existing codes, including around stop loss orders, the difference between trading as a principal and a client agent, time stamps and general handling of orders.\nThe move also comes as the global forex market continues a major transition driven by the growth of electronic platforms and high-frequency trading.\n“[It’s] an entirely different market to what it was five or six years ago when basically dealers were the only ones setting prices in the market,” CLS chief executive David Puth, who is chairing a private sector advisory group on the code, said.\n“Even if we hadn’t had scandals the natural place to get to would be to have a single code,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York executive vice president and working group member Simon Potter added. “The urgency for doing that … is there now.”\nPrevious protocols added for various market participants over time no longer reflect the integrated nature of today’s industry, he said. “Sometimes it’s really hard to tell whether a buy side firm is acting a bit like a sell side firm.”\n“Part of what we’re trying to do with the single code is just have one place for all market participants to go.”\nA “reasonable chunk” of the new code will be published around May 2016, Dr Debelle said.\nPromising to build on the “highest common denominators”, it will replace at least six local protocols operating among the largest markets. In all, there will be 15 participating countries in advanced and emerging economies — including the US, UK, Australia and Canada — and it follows work on a global preamble to existing central bank codes written last September.\nIt will cover all participants in the wholesale forex market, although there is some discussion about where that market starts and ends, Dr Debelle said.\nA few specific national circumstances will be encapsulated by local ‘annexes’, and there are ambitions to extend geographically beyond the original 15.\nBut adoption will be voluntary, with local regulators left to decide sanctions in their own jurisdictions. Still, the working group has not ruled out recommending criminal, civil and other charges.\n“We’ll look at all of those,” Dr Debelle said.\nThe UK last year made manipulation of currency markets and six other financial benchmarks a criminal offence, with penalties up to seven years’ imprisonment. In the European Union from 2016, financial market rigging will attract criminal penalties up to four years’ jail.\nThe biggest challenge, Dr Debelle emphasised, will be getting market participants to adopt the new code.\nBut Mr Puth said market participants are “highly motivated” to get the global protocols right. “I think [recent abuses] are something that has really driven the market to come together to say we do need to change this,” he said.\nMeanwhile, a mechanism is envisaged to allow the code’s evolution to keep pace with progressing technologies and other circumstances beyond 2017.\nMarket liquidity is ultimately expected to improve rather than contract as a result of greater clarity of roles, Mr Puth said.\nOriginally published as Global forex code set for May 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/rba-pledges-to-adopt-first-global-forex-code-of-conduct-in-wake-of-market-scandals/story-fni0dcne-1227520712532"], "published": "2015-09-10T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:35:06.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
