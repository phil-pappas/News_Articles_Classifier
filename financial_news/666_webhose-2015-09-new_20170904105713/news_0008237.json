The company plans to deploy the DOT technology in other locations and thereby eradicate the frustration of losing a conference call or video streaming session simply because one is moving into a building. \nThe new smart creative DOTs are connected and powered via standard internet Local Area Network (LAN) cables to indoor radio units that link to a base station. Deployments and upgrades of the fit-in-the-palm DOT are very simple and address growing capacity and coverage requirements. Currently the Digital Office Technology has been deployed in MTN Osu branch office which serves hundreds of customers in a day. \nMTN Ghana has stated that its position as the network of choice, with approximately 15 million subscribers in a 32 million subscriber market, is the result ofsystematic, strategic investments and upgrades that enable the companyto continue to deliver the most reliable voice and mobile broadband network to Ghanaians. \nIn line with its vision of leading the delivery of a bold new digital world, MTN has earmarked $103 Million to invest in its network infrastructure in 2015 after having invested over $2.4 billion from 2006-2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T13:53:48.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
