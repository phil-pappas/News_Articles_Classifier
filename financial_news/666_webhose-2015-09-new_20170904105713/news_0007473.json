A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: China Is Sitting on an Ocean of Diesel Fuel \nThe 62-year-old Porsche chief would take charge as Volkswagen seeks to regain the trust of consumers and regulators after admitting to rigging engines to circumvent pollution controls. The crisis wiped about 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) off VW’s market value this week, forcing Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn to step down on Wednesday as the scandal widened and opened the door for the exit of other top executives.\nAudi development chief Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche development head Wolfgang Hatz are among those who will leave, two people said. Hackenberg, a Winterkorn confidante, was previously responsible for VW brand development and Hatz ran the nameplate’s motor development.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Gross Tells Fed to `Get Off Zero Now!' as Economies Run on Empty \nThe entire auto industry and the methods used for testing vehicles are coming under scrutiny following revelations that VW’s “clean diesel” cars have software intended to defeat emissions tests. The European automakers’ lobby group, the ACEA , placed the blame in VW’s court on Wednesday, issuing a statement saying that “there is no evidence this is an industrywide issue.”\nThe European Union urged all 28 members Thursday to start their own investigations, with Germany, Italy, France and the U.K. among countries in the region to already do so. Japan, India and South Korea have also announced probes into the matter. VW has also asked local prosecutors in Germany to start a criminal probe.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Death Toll From Worst Hajj Tragedy in 25 Years Rises to 717 \nStandard & Poor’s said Thursday that it was considering lowering VW’s long-term rating “by one or more notches” and Moody’s changed its outlook on the automaker to negative. Competing ratings service Fitch said Wednesday it was weighing a cut. VW shares closed little changed in Frankfurt trading after losing 35 percent of their value Monday and Tuesday.\nExecutive ChangesAs part of the reorganization, Winfried Vahland will likely take over for the VW brand’s U.S. chief, Michael Horn, Auto Bild magazine reported, citing unidentified people at the German carmaker. Vahland currently runs the Skoda division and prior to that was responsible for the automaker’s operations in China.\nMueller was already touted as a potential CEO successor when former Chairman Ferdinand Piech failed in a bid to oust Winterkorn in April. He’s run the maker of the 911 sports car since October 2010. Over the past four years, the unit’s earnings have surged by almost two-thirds. Like his predecessor, Mueller is a long-serving Volkswagen employee, joining the Audi division as a toolmaking apprentice in the early 1970s.\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nU.S. Stocks Decline as Investors Crave More Guidance From Fed U.S. Says Chinese Sub That Can Hit U.S. on Patrol Soon Yellen Says She Still Expects Rate Increase This Year Read VW Set to Appoint Mueller as CEO in Sweeping Executive Overhaul on bloomberg.com\nBoard & Management Changes VW Volkswagen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:57:34.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
