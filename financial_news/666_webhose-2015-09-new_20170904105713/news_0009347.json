Apple shares have fallen roughly 2% this year compared to the S&P 500, which is down 7% as of yesterday's market close. \nHowever Apple's performance in August wasn't nearly as bad as several other widely held names.

And when you're done be sure to check out Oppenheimer's stocks to \" buy on weakness .\" \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNumber of Large-Cap Funds Invested: 236 August Return: -7.1% YTD Return: -19.9% \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, B TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates ORACLE CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate ORACLE CORP (ORCL) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels, expanding profit margins, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The gross profit margin for ORACLE CORP is currently very high, coming in at 82.79%. Regardless of ORCL's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. ORCL's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.86 is somewhat low overall, but it is high when compared to the industry average, implying that the management of the debt levels should be evaluated further. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio shows mixed results, the company's quick ratio of 3.98 is very high and demonstrates very strong liquidity. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 11.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 5.4%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. ORACLE CORP's earnings per share declined by 22.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has suffered a declining pattern of earnings per share over the past two years. However, we anticipate this trend to reverse over the coming year. During the past fiscal year, ORACLE CORP reported lower earnings of $2.22 versus $2.39 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.70 versus $2.22).
