To deliver on the promises technology holds, countries need to invest more effectively and ensure that teachers are at the forefront of designing and implementing this change,” said Schleicher.\nThe report found that the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students in digital reading was very similar to the differences in performance in the traditional PISA reading test, despite the vast majority of students using computers whatever their background.\nThis suggests that to reduce inequalities in digital skills, countries need to improve equity in education first.\nTo assess their digital skills, the test required students in 31 countries and economies to use a keyboard and mouse to navigate texts by using tools like hyperlinks, browser button or scrolling, in order to access information, as well as make a chart from data or use screen calculators.\nTop performers were Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong-China, Japan, Canada and Shanghai-China.\nThis reflects closely their performances in the 2012 print-reading test, suggesting that many of the skills essential for online navigation can also be taught and learned using standard, analogue reading techniques.\n 15, 2015 9:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:26:30.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
