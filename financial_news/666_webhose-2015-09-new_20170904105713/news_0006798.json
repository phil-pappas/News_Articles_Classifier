Photo: City of Melbourne\nA Melbourne businessman has been the saviour of Australia's bald men for as long as many can remember.\nWigs and hairpieces have been Abe Lourie's specialities for almost 60 years.\nHis Swanston Street shop, Creative Wigs, is lined with shelves of disembodied mannequins boasting wigs and hairpieces of all colours, sizes and styles.\nFor some, it's a place that restores dignity; for others, it's a solution to a fancy dress party.\nAdvertisement However, for Lourie, 86, it's a place where family and business come together.\nHis daughter, Diane Grosman​, 59, is a store manager and grandson Joel Grosman​, 27, is in charge of marketing.\nGrosman says his grandfather works full-time in the business and has no plans to retire.\n\"He actually said this morning, 'You're going to have to carry me out of here',\" Grosman says.\n\"We're not getting rid of Abe at all, he's an integral part of us. When the time comes, I suppose we'll assess it then, but at the moment we're really happy.\"\nLourie prefers to shun the limelight.\nHowever, his long innings in retail was recently recognised by the City of Melbourne with a platinum award in the 2015 Lord Mayor's Commendations.\nHis daughter received a bronze award for her 10 years in the business. That includes her volunteer work with the Look Good Feel Better program: a service helping cancer patients with skincare, make-up and headwear during their treatment.\nHair loss resulting from chemotherapy or alopecia drives many people through the doors of Creative Wigs.\nThis is both a challenging and rewarding part of the job, Joel Grosman says.\n\"It's very satisfying to help people, but it's also quite challenging,\" he says.\n\"We just want to make people feel comfortable and we help people feel good.\"\nA lot has changed since Lourie started selling ponytails in his CBD pharmacy in 1957. They proved to be popular and led Lourie to import more and start his own showroom above the pharmacy.\n\"It was a very niche market, no one had really tapped into it at the time,\" Grosman says.\n\"There had been wig makers going on for hundreds of years, but for importing and distributing there was nothing really like him.\n\"So he was the first of his kind and it was pretty amazing.\"\nThe family business faces more competition, particularly from online retailers.\nHowever, Creative Wigs has also moved into e-commerce.\n\"There weren't many competitors back in the day, but there are lots of online businesses going on at the moment,\" Grosman says.\n\"We have 56, 57 years in the industry, so we don't worry too much about that.\n\"Abe is a very old-school kind of businessman, but he adapts quite well. The concept of online and social media is a bit foreign to him, so he sort of leaves that to me. He's got full trust in me and he knows that's the future.\"\nWigs, along with other accessories including umbrellas and leather hats, account for $55 million in Australia's $1.1 billion personal accessory trade, research firm IBISWorld figures show.\nThe company's statistics show the US wig and hairpiece sector has grown 3.6 per cent to hit annual revenue of US$299 million. This is mainly credited to rising disposable income.\nHowever, Australia's wig industry may be facing testing times.\nLike Lourie, many industry pioneers are ageing.\nAndrew Barnett, who is a third-generation wig maker at Melbourne's Louis Barnett and Son and Son , has been creating human hair wigs for 50 years.\nHowever, the business may soon be coming to an end.\n\"I have three children and, unfortunately, they've all gone their own way,\" he says.\n\"We're working on it, but I don't have high hopes.\"\nWig making cannot be learnt anywhere else but on the job, Barnett says.\nAnd with just a handful of wig makers in Australia, it's a dying art.\n\"There are not many people now that have the skills; as a matter of fact, there are only three or four others that have the skills here in Australia,\" he says.\n\"Some come in from overseas, but they don't last for long because they go into theatre production.\n\"For me now, I'm getting towards retirement stage. I feel disappointed that nobody's taking it up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T18:08:16.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
