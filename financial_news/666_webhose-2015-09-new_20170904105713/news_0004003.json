To our 3,500 employees in India, today marks an important name change,” Telenor Group Head of Asia Region Morten Karlsen Sorby said.\nIt has changed its tag to ‘Ab life full paisa vasool’ from ‘Sabse Sasta’. Telenor said the company has taken a strong customer-centric approach through initiatives like compensation for call drops.\n“We take responsibility for a call drop as we commit quality service to our customers. Hence, we are extending Call drop reimbursements to all calls — local, STD and ISD. Earlier, it was being offered on local calls only,” Telenor India CEO Vivek Sood said.\nThe Norway-based Telenor entered India through a joint venture with Unitech Wireless, which was branded as Uninor. Unitech has now completely exited from the operations and last year, the Telenor group increased its stake in the Indian entity to 100 per cent.\nEarlier this month, the company had changed the name of the company from Telewings Communications Services to Telenor (India) Communications.\nThe Telenor group has mobile operations in 13 markets in the Nordic region, Central and Eastern Europe and in Asia.\nTelenor India operates in six circles — Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh East and West and ranks fourth in revenue and customer market share.\n“We will continue to offer the most affordable services and deliver innovative solutions like call drop reimbursement and customised product offers. The customer wants us to be fair,” Sood said.\nFirst Published on September 23, 2015 4:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:21:04.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
