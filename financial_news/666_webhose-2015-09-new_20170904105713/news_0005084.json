Theresa Ambrose/iStock Share on twitter by Ruth Liew It's been seven years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers that helped spark the global financial crisis, but experts are now warning that a second GFC may be on the cards as investors remain in debt and forget the lessons of the past.\nTuesday marks the seventh anniversary since the destruction of Lehman Brothers, after the investment banking giant filed for the largest bankruptcy filing in US history .\nEquity Trustees executive general manager corporate trustee services, Harvey Kalman, said what investors had learnt from the collapse was yet to be fully determined.\nLehman had borrowed large amounts to fund its investments, including leveraging and gearing assets, during the years leading up to its demise in 2008. A large chunk of the funds were poured into housing-related assets, which failed following the housing collapse in the US.\n\"Seven years on, there are more controls over the way collective investment product suppliers operate, although it is arguable whether these have gone far enough,\" Mr Kalman said.\n\"In my view a case in point is smaller asset managers that operate a responsible entity where the separation of function is difficult. The regulations are not yet strong enough in this area,\" he argued.\nMatthew Walker, a financial adviser and director at WLM Financial, said Australian investors were heavily in debt with real estate, and some asset managers were also leveraged – indicating many might have forgotten the problems of the past. Data from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Australian Bureau of Statistics show that the percentage of debt to household income was higher than 150 per cent today, compared with about 150 per cent in 2008.\n\"No, I don't think we've learnt the lessons from Lehman. Debt seems to be high, and it's prevalent now. The saving grace is that we're in a low interest environment but we know that that could change at any moment – and what would happen then?\" he said.\n Mr Walker's clients have been busy trimming their exposure to risky assets such as shares, and holding more alternative assets and cash as they brace for another potential GFC.\nGovernments have almost exhausted the levers they have in terms of what they can do to help stimulate economies, while low confidence and anaemic global growth would add fuel to the fire.\nThe comments come after new data from research house Investment Trends showed that more than one out of two Australians say another global financial crisis could be on the way, and numbers among the top three biggest fears that would affect their investment returns.\nWorries about a market crash or second GFC ranked behind China's slowdown and a worsening Australian economy, the data showed.\n\"​Compared to August last year, there's been a significant increase in fear levels among active Australian investors 12 months on,\" said Recep Peker, head of research for wealth management at Investment Trends.\nFinancial adviser Mark Draper, from Gem Capital, noted that housing debt levels in Australia for example are now back at levels that are higher than before the 2008 crisis. \"My view is that Australians are continuing to bet that house prices will continue to be a one-way bet higher, and are prepared to borrow for it,\" he said.\n\"One of the things that provides some comfort at the moment is that there is still a high level of fear among investors – major crisis events tend not to happen when fear levels are so high.\"\nMr Kalman argued that the focus on the financial services sector and the loss of investor confidence that followed the Lehman collapse did bring some benefits to Australian investors.\nSome of these included reforms such as the Future of Financial Advice and Stronger Super, which were still being rolled out and helped buffer investors from massive economic shocks.\n\"While it is impossible to legislate against greed, after the unprecedented focus on the financial services sector's shortcomings, it would be a terrible indictment of it, our legislators and our regulators if we are again facing the same sort of problems that emerged with the Lehman Brothers' collapse,\" Mr Kalman said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-09-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:25:16.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
