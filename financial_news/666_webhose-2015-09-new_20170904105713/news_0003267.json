Aaron Bunch by Julie-anne Sprague It's been a tough year for West Australians. But now it's all about to change.\nWeak iron ore, oil and nickel prices have forced companies and the state government to slash jobs and cut spending.\nBut this week all the economic doom and gloom out west has been swept away as footy fever takes over.\nFor the first time Perth will host four Australian Football League finals after its two teams – the Fremantle Football Club and the West Coast Eagles – finished the home and away season in first and second position.\n\"Go Eagles\" adorns the BHP building in Perth. AFR It puts both teams in a strong position to win the 2015 AFL premiership.\nThe AFL finals series kicks off on Friday night at Perth's Domain Stadium when West Coast play defending premiers Hawthorn. On Saturday, Fremantle host Sydney.\nThe finals are tipped to inject close to $100 million in to the West Australian economy.\n\"There's a whole lot of people coming from the east coast who will get to, hopefully, enjoy some sunshine, some fantastic beaches, wineries in the Swan Valley or if they are feeling more adventurous visit Margaret River,\" said BHP Billiton iron ore president Jimmy Wilson, who is an Eagles fan and advocate for the state economy.\n Woodside in Perth has a well used sign \"Go Freo\", and it's been given an airing this week. Aaron Bunch Photographer Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder, an AFL commissioner and Fremantle Dockers supporter, is going to both games in Perth this weekend.\n\"Two really well run footy clubs with passionate members will embrace Perth being a centrepiece of the first week of the 2015 finals series,\" he said.\n\"Even the forecast wet weather will not dampen the spirits.\"\nBHP, a major Eagles sponsor, has stuck a 256 square metre sign across the 45th floor of its building in the heart of the CBD.\nIt was a tough decision for BHP head of corporate affairs Mark Donovan, who had to approve the sign. He's a Dockers fan.\nA few office towers further St Georges Terrace Woodside has, for the fifth time, put up its 122 square metre \"Go Freo\" banner.\n\"There is Freo fever all over the place,\" said Mike Abbott, a Fremantle fan and, incidentally, who is also Woodside general counsel and senior vice president corporate and legal.\nFremantle Football Club board member and die-hard Dockers supporter Dale Alcock said the finals were providing a \"positive distraction from all the doom and gloom that we have surrounding the economy at the moment and the pictures coming out of Syria\".\nPower and the passion \"It has a positive impact and you may see that reflected in retail sales,\" Mr Alcock, ABN Group managing director, said.\nThe Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA estimates each AFL final is worth $24 million to the state. And you can multiply that by four.\nThe Tourism Council WA estimates the finals will draw 31,600 interstate visitors, who be spending on accommodation, transport, eating and shopping.\nProgrammed managing director Chris Sutherland supports the Dockers but said no matter what team West Australians supported \"there's definitely a spring in the step\".\n\"For the state, it's very exciting,\" Mr Sutherland said.\nSeven Group director Peter Gammell is flying in from Sydney to support the Eagles on Friday night.\nLong-term Eagles fan, BRW rich-lister and property magnate Nigel Satterley, is going too as he hosts a corporate box.\nPerhaps Perth's most conflicted footy-supporting executive this finals series is Fortescue Metals Group chief executive Nev Power.\nMr Power may be a Hawthorn supporter but he has grown to love the Eagles since moving to Perth to take up the Fortescue job in 2011.\n\"I'm going to be glued to this game because I'm an absolutely passionate Eagles supporter except when they play Hawthorn,\" Mr Power said.\n\"If Hawthorn are playing anyone but the Eagles I have no conflict. If the Eagles are playing anyone but the Hawks I have no conflict whatsoever,\" he said.\nFortescue director and Macquarie WA chairman Mark Barnaba is more clear cut about Mr Power's allegiances.\n\"I wouldn't be seen at the game with Nev because he has brown and gold running through his veins!\" Mr Barnaba, a former West Coast chairman, said.\nMr Barnaba, a passionate Eagles fan, said the finals were not just boosting the economy but were lifting morale across the city.\n\"Given what has happened across the resources sector this is a good result for WA, no doubt about it,\" Mr Barnaba said.\nMr Power agrees the state's mood has lifted.\n\"We have two teams doing so well that even the Dockers supporters, who look miserable at the best of times, even they look happy,\" Mr Power said.\n\"It's fantastic. Life has been way too serious. It has lifted the spirits.\"\nFremantle hope to win their first premiership. They were defeated in the 2013 grand final by Hawthorn.\nThe Eagles are hoping to secure their fourth premiership, with their last won against Sydney in 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:04:48.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
