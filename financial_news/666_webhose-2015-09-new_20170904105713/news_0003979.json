The embassy did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.\nNarendra Modi is scheduled to make a rare visit by an Indian leader to Saudi Arabia later this year, part of a strategy of winning investment from cash-rich oil states and to expand cooperation in the energy sector.\nAt the same time, Modi has made improving relations with neighbouring Nepal one of his top priorities, as concerns grow over China’s influence in the Himalayan nation.\n“India needs to carefully balance supporting the ongoing investigation to satisfy Nepal and the Indian public, while not alienating Saudi too much – it is not easy,” said S. Chandrasekharan, director of the South Asia Analysis Group.\nModi’s visit to Nepal in August 2014, soon after coming to power, ranks as one of his early diplomatic successes.
