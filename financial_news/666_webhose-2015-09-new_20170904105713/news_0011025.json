Fares are normally charged on the distance of the journey and the time it takes to get to the destination. \nGett , an Israeli start-up backed by billionaire Len Blavatnik, will cut the fare by 30pc if the journey is more than six miles. The discount will be available outside of peak hours on weekdays. \nThe company claims to have signed up 6,000 drivers in the UK capital, out of a total of 25,000. \nUber, which operates in about 250 cities in 50 countries, has become an object of scorn from traditional taxi companies fighting for survival against the rise of the Silicon Valley challenger, founded in 2009. \nAs Uber’s popular smartphone app can turn anyone into a minicab chauffeur, those drivers can set their own prices for the journeys they make. \nAs a result, the company has become the target of a string of lawsuits around the world for unfair competition. However, the legal action has spread to include drivers themselves. \nOn Tuesday night, a US judge ruled that Uber drivers are entitled to class action status in litigation over whether they are independent contractors or employees. \nThree drivers sued Uber in a federal court in San Francisco, contending they are employees and entitled to reimbursement for expenses, including petrol and vehicle maintenance. The drivers currently pay those costs themselves. \nIn the ruling, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said drivers could sue as a group on the question of whether they are employees or contractors, and over their demand for payment of tips that were not passed on to them. Drivers' attorneys must submit more evidence to sue as a group for reimbursement of other expenses. \nClass action status means the 2013 suit could cover more than 160,000 California drivers, according to court filings, and could give plaintiffs more leverage to negotiate a settlement. \nUber had argued that the drivers should not be allowed to sue as a group because they have little in common and relate to the company in different ways. \nHowever, Mr Chen wrote that there is an \"inherent tension\" in Uber's argument. \n\"On one hand, Uber argues that it has properly classified every single driver as an independent contractor,\" Mr Chen wrote. \nOn the other, he added, Uber argues that individual drivers are so unique that the court, \"unlike, apparently, Uber itself\", cannot make its own determination. \nAn ultimate finding that drivers are employees could raise Uber's costs beyond the lawsuit's scope and force it to pay Social Security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance. \nIn June, a California labour commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor. Uber has appealed that decision. \nIn arguing against class action status, Uber had submitted sworn statements from hundreds of drivers supporting the company. However, Mr Chen rejected this evidence because the statements could have been the product of biased questions. \nThere is simply \"no basis,\" Mr Chen wrote, to support Uber's claim \"that some innumerable legion of drivers prefer to remain independent contractors rather than become employees (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T07:30:51.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
