It's principally incumbent upon the government to focus on the following issues with a view to ensure the safety of the service. \nAverting traffic accidents \nPresently, Ethiopia has one of the highest rates of road accident rates anywhere in the world which claim the lives of thousands and cost millions in damage annually. A number of vehicles crashed against the guard rails along the rail line soon after its first test run in early February. Much care should therefore be taken to prevent the kinds of terrible accidents that occur on roads due to negligence, ineptitude, and laxity in the issuance of driver's license and enforcing road safety regulations from blighting the light rail transit. Otherwise, the country will be forced to pay dearly both in economic and social terms that no amount of ruing can possibly undo. \nInstitutions tasked with looking after road safety responsibilities particularly have to have the necessary manpower, equipment and latest technology so that they may carry out their duties effectively. On its part, the general public owes the obligation to distance itself from acts that jeopardize its own safety and that of the light rail infrastructure including improper embarking and disembarking practices as well as attempting to cross from one side of the rail line to the other at undesignated places or while a railway carriage is in motion. In short all of us are duty-bound to act responsibly and see to it that the light rail transit is not marred by accidents. \nThwarting the commission of crimes \nAnother matter which needs to be paid the utmost attention in relation to the light rail service is how to deal with the perpetration of such crimes acts as theft, sexual or other forms of violence and vandalism. If commuters are to travel securely and in comfort, the activity of all passengers must be closely monitored along the entire length of the route so that criminals do not use the trains as a sanctuary from which they carry out offenses. \nSafeguarding the rail project's assets \nBuilt at a cost of USD 474 million, the light rail transit's operational and other related works alone are expected to run up to USD 110 million. As a project that has led to the expenditure of a significant sum of money on the part of the nation and was funded largely by a loan obtained from the Government of China, the infrastructure needs to be safeguarded vigilantly. The fact that it is expected to generate revenue that can finance other infrastructure projects makes securing its safety doubly important. \nThe power and phone lines found inside the route on which the rail runs as well as the guard rails, stations, stairs, escalators, generators as well as other features of the rail line must be afforded solid protection day and night. It's commuters fed up of the city's inadequate mass transit who will pay the ultimate price if the light rail service is disrupted due to the damage inflicted on it. \nEnsuring the cleanliness of the trains \nOne of the major problems that is thought to affect the light rail service is related to lack of cleanliness that afflicts other means of mass transport. The service can only satisfy commuters if and when the trains are clean and comfortable as those in use in developed countries. Unless all those who use the light rail see to it that it is fit to ride by everyone, including overseas tourists, its lifespan is bound to be numbered and thereby defeat the very purpose it was installed at a huge outlay--to modernize Addis Ababa's transport service and ease the long-standing ordeal its residents have been subjected to. \nProviding insurance coverage to the light rail service \nA critical factor in any modern transport system is insurance coverage. A major national asset like the light rail infrastructure, therefore, has to be insured in order to defray costs incurred as a result of the damage it may sustain. Fortunately, a compulsory third party insurance proclamation that applies to rail transport as well is already in place. Hence, the relevant government agency entrusted with implementing the law must start to put it into effect it in the event of any accident the light rail infrastructure experiences. \nIn general everything possible should be done to ensure that the light rail transit service is safe, secure, to the satisfaction of commuters and a national asset Ethiopians are proud of. In this regard it is incumbent on both the federal government and other pertinent entities to educate the public continuously about the imperative to safeguard infrastructures like the light rail transit through the media. This will go a long way towards guaranteeing that the public keenly participates in safeguarding the entire rail line infrastructure so that it turns out to be value for money and enjoys a long lease on life. The kinds of senseless acts committed on other infrastructures must not be repeated on the light rail transit; it should be zealously safeguarded!
