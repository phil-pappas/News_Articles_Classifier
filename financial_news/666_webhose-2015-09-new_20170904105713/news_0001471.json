Spanish, Italian and Portuguese yields were 2-3 bps lower at 1.98 percent, 1.78 percent and 2.56 percent, respectively.\nTo some analysts, the U.S. economy looked robust enough to justify a hike, but a slowdown in China and a slump in oil and commodity prices hurting the inflation outlook across the world tilted the balance towards a delay of what would be the first hike in a decade.\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said last week's decision to leave rates unchanged was largely a \"risk management\" exercise to be sure recent market volatility would not become a drag on the U.S. economy.\nHe said he still expects the Fed to hike rates later this year.\nThe spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and their lower-yielding German counterpart has widened by almost 15 basis points this month to just over 150 basis points, reflecting the divergent monetary policy outlooks in the two regions.\nOn the supply side, the Netherlands was due to issue 2.5-3.5 billion euros of three-year bonds. The April 2018 bond on offer was issued in January and has never traded with a positive yield.
