(File photo: Bill Klotz) St. Croix Crossing bridge opening to be delayed By: Brian Johnson September 4, 2015 11:02 am 0 \nThe opening of the bridge portion of the $626 million St. Croix Crossing project will be delayed, the Minnesota Department of Transportation said Friday morning. \nThe bridge over the St. Croix River between Oak Park Heights and St. Joseph, Wisconsin, was expected to open to traffic in fall 2016, but MnDOT now says that work will “continue into 2017.” \nMnDOT is blaming project complexities for the delay. \n“This is a very complex engineering project,” MnDOT project director Michael Beer said in a statement Friday. “This is only the second major bridge of its type built in the U.S. and the methods of construction are taking longer than anticipated.” \nBeer said a new completion date will be announced before the end of the year. \nThe project includes approach work on both sides of the river and conversion of the existing Stillwater Lift Bridge into a bike and pedestrian span, as well as the mile-long river crossing. \nMnDOT, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, and the Lunda/Ames Joint Venture, which is building the bridge, are working on a new schedule, MnDOT said. \nTo readers: Please check back later for updates to this story.
