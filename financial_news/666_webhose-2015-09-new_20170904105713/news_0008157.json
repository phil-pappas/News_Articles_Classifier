Headline rates have remained between an average of 13 and 17 per cent even though the cash rate has fallen from 4.75 per cent in October 2011 to 2 per cent now.\nThe strong and consistent message that we got from the first two hearings of the inquiry was that lifting minimum repayments would help everyone.\nSam Dastyari, Labor He said testimony from consumer advocates, regulators and financial advisers showed low-income earners typically pay most of the interest on credit cards because they often only repay the absolute minimum, which means they quickly breach interest-free periods.\nSince April 2011, minimum repayments on credit cards issued in the UK must be enough to cover interest, fees and charges plus 1 per cent of the principal or amount outstanding. Lenders must also display prominent warnings about just paying minimum amounts, including contacting customers if they repeatedly only pay the minimum amount and are at risk of financial difficulty.\nAdvertisement Mr Dastyari said the same rules should apply in Australia. At the moment, banks set the minimum repayment amount. For some this is a flat amount, which does not vary according to the size of the loan. Since 2012 banks must also tell customers how much interest they will pay if they only repay the minimum amount.\n\"The strong and consistent message that we got from the first two hearings of the inquiry was that lifting minimum repayments would help everyone,\" he said.\n\"Both regulators and consumer advocates are in furious agreement that our banks are playing us for mugs on this issue and that things are much better in the UK. It should be simple for banks to set a minimum payment that ensures a debt does not increase.\"\n\"By all accounts the changes the UK introduced have been effective, and we look forward to hearing more about them.\"\nKatherine Temple from the Consumer Action Law Centre told a hearing of the inquiry in Melbourne early in September the terms for credit card loans should also be restricted to three years. At present there is no limit.\n\"The system is set up so that, if you make your minimum repayments, which could mean it will take decades before you pay off your debt, you are still 'paying your bills on time',\" she said.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority in the UK is conducting a market study into credit cards and is due to report its findings in 2016.\nIt has also found that card interest rates have not fallen in line with the cash rate or other personal loan rates this decade. The average rate has stayed at around 16 per cent since January 2009, while the cash rate is 0.5 per cent now and unsecured personal loan rates in the UK are between 5 and 10 per cent.\nA spokeswoman for the Australian Bankers Association said it had yet to decide its view on mandatory minimum repayments.\nThe major banks are due to appear before the inquiry on October 16.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/regulators-say-huge-credit-card-profits-driven-by-poor-people-20150826-gj8ovt"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:25:23.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
