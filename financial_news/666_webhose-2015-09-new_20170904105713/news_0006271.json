In anticipation of the return of the fierce showdown between Cookie and Lucious Lyon, take a look at how the actors’ net worths compare in real life. The ‘Empire’ Lowdown \nFor readers who didn’t manage to catch the first season of “Empire,” it’s a Shakespearean-esque drama that centers around hip-hop music production company Empire Entertainment. Founder and CEO Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard) has been diagnosed with A.L.S. and is looking to pass on his empire to one of his three sons — college-educated executive Andre (Trai Byers); gay singer-songwriter second son Jamal (Jussie Smollett); or the talented but feisty youngest son Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray). \nThrowing her weight around the ring is Lyon’s ex-wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) — recently released from prison after serving 17 years — who is seeking to claim her share of the business and place favored son Jamal at the helm. More Than 17 Million Viewers \n“Empire” was created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, the director and writer behind the 2013 film “The Butler.” The first episode premiered to 9.9 million viewers, and the number of people tuning in only increased from there. Over 17.6 million people watched the season finale 10 weeks later — one of the biggest drama debuts in a decade. \nThe Los Angeles Times reported that “Empire” costs more than $3 million per episode to make, which is in line with network drama budgets. Executive producer Brian Grazer told the LA Times that “the show has been made at a very smart price” and that “it’s not expensive.” \nGrazer hasn’t revealed how much of that $3 million per episode goes toward paying its stars. But according to The Hollywood Reporter, actors can earn anywhere from $15,000 to $150,000 per episode depending on their experience and “star power.” With the success of season one, it’s likely that the stars will be looking to negotiate for a bigger slice of the “Empire” pie in the near future. Watch the ‘Empire’ Season 2 Trailer Taraji P. Henson Net Worth: $6 Million \n“Empire” matriarch Cookie, played by Henson, is a formidable force in the family known for her razor-sharp comebacks, not to mention the fierce right hook she threw in the season one finale. \nHenson is no featherweight when it comes to earnings either, with TV and film credits including “Person of Interest,”“Hustle & Flow” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” for which she received a 2009 Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Henson has also received an Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actress in a drama series for playing Cookie. Her net worth is $6 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com . Terrence Howard Net Worth: $5 Million \nHoward plays Empire patriarch Lucious Lyon, a devious character who pits his sons against each other while doing anything to maintain the status of the company he founded. \nHoward is highly successful, like his character, but without the whole committing crimes and killing off enemies thing. He’s had a lengthy career, with over 80 TV and film credits to his name, including the “Law & Order” franchise, “Mr. Holland’s Opus” and “Hustle & Flow,” for which he received a best actor Oscar nomination in 2006. Gabourey Sidibe Net Worth: $2 Million \nSidibe shot to fame playing the lead role in the film “Precious,” a breakout success that made over four times its $10 million budget following its 2009 release. Her net worth is listed on CelebrityNetWorth.com as $2 million. \nIn season one of “Empire,” Sidibe played Lucious’ hardworking assistant, Becky, at Empire Entertainment. Sidibe is set to return in season two with her character having been promoted to Empire Entertainment’s head of A&R. Jussie Smollett Net Worth: $500,000 \nSmollett plays Jamal Lyon. He cut his acting chops starring in “North,”“The Skinny” and “Ask Me Anything,” as well as TV shows “Coach,”“The Mindy Project” and “Revenge.” Smollett’s net worth currently stands at $500,000, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Bryshere Y. Gray Net Worth: $2 Million \nGray plays youngest son Hakeem Lyon, a hip-hop artist who’s more interested in living the rich-kid lifestyle than learning how to run a music empire. Much of Gray’s net worth comes from his own music career, for which he performed under the stage name Yazz The Greatest at music festivals and as a support artist. According to CelebrityNetWorth.com, Gray is currently worth $2 million. \nRead: ‘Straight Outta Compton’ Movie: Dr. Dre Net Worth, Ice Cube Net Worth and N.W.A.

Byers’ net worth is $1.5 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Kaitlin Doubleday Net Worth: $1.5 Million \nDoubleday plays Andre Lyon’s wife, Rhonda Lyon. Drawing comparisons with Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth, her character is determined to see her husband take his seat at the top of the corporation. \nDoubleday had a breakout role in the movie “Catch Me If You Can” alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. She has also appeared in a number of TV series, including the “CSI” franchise, “Bones,”“Criminal Minds,”“Hung” and “Royal Pains.” CelebrityNetWorth.com lists her net worth as $1.5 million. Lee Daniels Net Worth: $5 Million \nDirecting the hit series is Daniels, whose net worth is $5 million thanks to his success on previous directorial projects, including “Shadowboxer,” “Precious” and “The Butler.” Along with his financial rewards, Daniels has received an Oscar nomination for best director. Danny Strong Net Worth: $5 Million \nNot to be outdone, Strong’s net worth is also $5 million. Strong has had success as an actor, writer and producer. Most recently he played recurring roles on TV series such as “Mad Men” and “Justified” and appeared in films such as “Dangerous Minds,”“Pleasantville” and “The Butler.” He helped write the screenplay for “ The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 .” \nSome of Strong’s net worth has recently gone toward the purchase of a West Hollywood condo for $660,000, located near the set of “Empire.” \nKeep Reading: ‘Orange Is the New Black’ Season 3: Laverne Cox’s Net Worth, Taylor Schilling’s Net Worth and More ‘Empire’ Season 1 Guest Stars \nSeason one of “Empire” featured a number of guest stars, and with the success of the program, it’s expected that even more stars will be jumping to appear in season two.
