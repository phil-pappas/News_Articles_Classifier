These exchange-traded funds also suffered from the negative influence of holding components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average . \nHere's what happened and how to trade the continued bungee-type volatility among these three ETFs, plus seven other sector exchange-traded funds. \nThe implementation of Rule 48 by the New York Stock Exchange provided a double-whammy for ETF pricing. Without bid and ask prices before the opening bell, for both the ETFs and for their components, it was even more difficult to judge prices. This contributed to the panicked trade executions associated with flash crashes. \nThe table below shows 10 sector ETFs, along with their ticker, date and time, opening price, high price, low price, last price, and volume for the first and second five-minute intervals. \nCourtesy of MetaStock Xenith \nThis data clearly shows that when market orders to sell could not find fair prices of execution, the high-frequency trading platforms executed orders at flash-crash panic levels, as the order book was virtually unknown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:09:41.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
