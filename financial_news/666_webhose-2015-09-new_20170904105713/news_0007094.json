Only one water bond has been defeated in the state's history.\n\"The voters know this is a dry state, very much prone to droughts, and increasingly subject to water supply variability due to climate change,\" Meral said.\nThe water bond proposal comes as California reels from its worst drought in over a century. Ongoing dry conditions led Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year to impose the first mandatory water reductions in state history.\nDemocratic state senator Lois Wolk, a key proponent of last year's water bond, known as Proposition 1, said lawmakers should be cautious about over reliance on bonds.\n\"Bond funding alone is not going to fix the staggering ongoing costs for deferred maintenance and operations of our state and local aging and deteriorating water systems,\" she said.\n\"California needs to take a hard look at these growing, ongoing needs and have the difficult conversation about how to meet those needs and fund them now and in the future,\" she said.
