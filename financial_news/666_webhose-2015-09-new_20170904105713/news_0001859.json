The downside of the study, conducted by Alexander L. Brown and Joanna N. Lahey and published in the Journal of Marketing Research , is consumers tended to prefer paying off smaller balances first, regardless of the interest rate, leaving larger balances on higher rate cards longer. \nWhile this method for getting out of debt may seem counter-intuitive, some finance experts say it may not be as bad as one thinks.

In fact, once you pay off one credit card in full you will have one less bill to pay—another achievement.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:41:08.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
