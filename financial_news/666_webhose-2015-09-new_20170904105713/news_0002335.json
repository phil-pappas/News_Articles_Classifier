The SABC also contributed R369 000 to his pension and medical aid fund. \nAccording to the DA, Motsoeneng had received almost a million rand increase from the R2.872m he received while in the acting COO position. \n\"The only problem can be if the SABC is paying Hlaudi more than what it is suppose to be paying. But there is a policy ... processes in place,\" Motsoeneng said, adding that he did not sign off on his own pay cheque or bonuses. \nHe said while his salary may be frowned upon, there were some members of the executive who earned more than he did. \n\"People have been misled. We need to be fair when reporting on matters within the organisation,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, the public broadcaster reported a loss of R395 million during the last financial year. \nAddressing a media conference at the SABC's Johannesburg premises, the public broadcaster's top brass said the losses were because of, among other things, load shedding, downsizing from advertisers and the failure of consumers to pay tv licenses. \nDespite the losses, the SABC bosses said the station was \"doing well\" and had a \"good story to tell\" having secured more local content and taking on more skilled staff on permanent contracts. \nWhile the auditor general had reported that the SABC lost R514 088 to wasteful and fruitless expenditure, the broadcaster's Chief Financial Officer James Aguma explained that stricter measures would be put in place to ensure that workers who contributed to this were brought to book. \nAn auditing company had been hired to look into the SABC and was expected to deliver a report by March 31, 2016, Aguma said. \nDespite the multi-million rand losses, the SABC said it closed the financial year with a cash balance of R1.017bn. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:40:18.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
