As lovely as that sounded, for over 25 years my husband and I assisted in planning weddings and special occasions for our customers and the satisfaction I received from helping people was something I was not ready to give up. It was at this point I ventured into the real estate industry – and instead of helping brides and grooms, I’m helping buyers and sellers! Nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing the look of excitement on my clients’ faces when we find that perfect home! I feel blessed to have found another job I truly love,” says JoAnn Casali of BHHS KoenigRubloff Realty Group.\n“Receiving this award for the fifth time is quite an honor! It means that I have achieved my goal of providing 100 percent customer satisfaction to my clients and I am meeting their needs. It is truly a privilege and honor to be selected as a Five Star Professional for the fifth year in a row! I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to all of my clients who nominated me for this award.
