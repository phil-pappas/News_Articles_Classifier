As the Center would like to explain, the Internet is a pretty slimy place when it comes to getting honest information about mesothelioma compensation. http://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com \nThe Mesothelioma Victims Center says, \"The old saying 'It is best to learn wisdom by the experience of others' sums up why we are so incredibly passionate about making certain that all US Navy Veterans who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma are entitled to instant access to the nation's most skilled mesothelioma lawyers. These attorneys excel in compensation, and in addition we specialize in finding the nation's top treatment centers that have the most experience treating this rare cancer.\" \n\"Please don't think for one second that experience does not matter when it comes to getting the best possible compensation or medical treatment for malignant mesothelioma. The most experienced lawyers get the best possible compensation, and the nation's top treatment facilities get the best possible medical results as we would like to explain anytime to a Veteran or their family with one call to 866-714-6466.\" http://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com \nVital tip from the Mesothelioma Victims Center for a US Navy Veteran, manufacturing, industrial, or building trades worker when it comes to mesothelioma compensation: \n\"We have just become aware that some of the nation's largest mesothelioma marketing law firms are now charging 45% of the gross settlement amount a person with this rare cancer might receive. In addition, they may also be charging for expenses. With one call to 866-714-6466 we provide instant access to the nation's most experienced mesothelioma lawyers -- diagnosed victims of mesothelioma don't need a law firm broker to sell them to another law firm, and don't charge as much.\" http://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com \nHigh risk work groups for exposure to asbestos include US Navy Veterans, power plant workers, shipyard workers, oil refinery workers, steel mill workers, miners, manufacturing workers, plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics, machinists, or construction workers. Typically the exposure to asbestos occurred in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, or 1980's. http://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com \nThe average age for a diagnosed victim of mesothelioma is 72 years old. Frequently victims of mesothelioma are initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia. This year between 2500, and 3000 US citizens will be diagnosed with mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is attributable to exposure to asbestos. \nAccording to the CDC the states indicated with the highest incidence of mesothelioma include Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Washington, and Oregon. \nHowever, based on the calls the Mesothelioma Victims Center receives a diagnosed victim of mesothelioma could live in any state including New York, Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, or Alaska. \nThe Mesothelioma Victims Center says, \"Before you hire a mesothelioma attorney please call us at 866-714-6466, and compare the qualifications of who we consider to be the nation's most skilled mesothelioma attorneys to any other lawyer, or law firm. \n\"When it comes to obtaining the best mesothelioma compensation settlement, the quality of the attorney matters, as we would like to explain anytime.\" http://MesotheliomaVictimsCenter.Com \nFor more information about mesothelioma please refer to the National Institutes of Health's web site related to this rare form of cancer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mesothelioma.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:52:55.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
