It is mechanically activated and makes a discernible sound during administration, which tends to disconcert patients, according to Amy Ross, former president of the International Organization of MS Nurses.\nThis new autoinjector, already available in Europe, reminds patients to take their medicine every other day, and is silent when used. It is customisable, allowing for adjustments in speed and depth of the injection, and has automatic needle retraction.\nAlthough a sizable share of the MS market in the United States has been captured by oral drugs, including Biogen Inc's Tecfidera, reports linking some treatments to serious brain infections have tempered enthusiasm.\nDoctors are now starting patients on injectable therapies - with an eye on long-term safety and efficacy - because many of these patients are quite young, said Ross, estimating about 50 percent to 60 percent of patients today are diagnosed in their 20s and 30s.\nIMS Health estimates Betaseron holds about 5 percent of the United States MS market.\n\"We have to stay competitive, and we think with this autoinjector we have a good chance to stay competitive,\" Klaus Marten, Bayer HealthCare's vice president and general manager of neurology told Reuters.
