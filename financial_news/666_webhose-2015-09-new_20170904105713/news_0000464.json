The gains came as US Federal Reserve officials suggested the central bank may delay tightening monetary policy beyond next month due to turmoil in financial markets. A rate rise would dim the appeal of non-interest bearing assets like gold. \"With that in mind, there's a little bit of breathing room,\" said Eli Tesfaye, senior market strategist for brokerage RJO Futures in Chicago, noting that this \"breathing room\" allowed technical factors to take over. \"This is a classic retracement from low to high.\" Gold prices crossed a key technical retracement level between July's five-and-a-half-year lows and last week's six-and-a-half-week highs, providing a chart-based boost, Tesfaye said. Nonetheless, bullion still plunged 2.3 per cent on the week, as a slew of US economic data suggested stronger growth. US consumer spending picked up in July, data showed on Friday. This followed Thursday's upward revision in US economic growth in the second quarter to 3.7 per cent from the initial estimate of 2.3 per cent. \"The big question for next week is whether the anxiety that crept into the market on Aug 10 when China devalued its currency is going to continue,\" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. Weak gold prices have failed to spur physical demand in Asia, with premiums in India slipping and investors in China still hooked on volatile equities. Palladium rose sharply for the second straight session on physical buying and technical dealings after hitting five-year lows on Wednesday, Tesfaye said. It was up 4.6 per cent to $US585 an ounce on Friday, for its largest two-day gain since 2008. Spot silver was up 0.6 per cent at $US14.56 an ounce, having fallen to a six-year trough of $US13.93 on Wednesday. Silver has dropped nearly five per cent this week, its steepest such decline since February. Platinum was up 1.5 per cent at $US1,016.50 an ounce.
