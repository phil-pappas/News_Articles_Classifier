More Graduates overpay student loans by £45m \nResearch published by HMRC this week identified the self-employed, one of the groups most likely to be affected by the move to digital tax returns, as having particularly poor access to online services. \nWhile 19 per cent of self-employed taxpayers were categorised as “ digitally excluded ” — defined as having no use of the internet — a further 42 per cent fell into the “assisted digital” bracket, where they are expected to need some assistance to interact with the government online. This compares with 10 and 29 per cent respectively across all taxpayers. \n“That such a high proportion of the self-employed is digitally disenfranchised is really quite worrying for HMRC,” said George Bull, senior tax partner at Baker Tilly, adding that their interactions with the tax authority are relatively complex. \nAnita Monteith, technical director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said given that many self-employed taxpayers have no need for the internet in their business, they should not be expected to start filing tax returns online without support. \n“It is unreasonable to take the attitude that anyone who has their own business must have a computer, and it’s wrong,” she said. \nIn total, about 3m taxpayers are estimated by the Revenue to be digitally excluded, with a further 8.6m expected to require assistance to access government services online. While roughly two-fifths of the latter reported in the research that they felt confident doing so with the help of family or friends, most will rely on official assistance. \nMs Monteith said a distinction must be drawn between tax affairs that are easy to conduct online, such as vehicle tax payments, which went online in 2014, and those that are complicated, and often require advice. “The underlying nature of tax is that it is complex, and that means that people need assistance.” \nFollowing large staff cuts and the closure of its network of tax inquiry offices , the Revenue’s resources have struggled at times to meet demand. In 2014-15, only 73 per cent of calls to HMRC were answered, short of HMRC’s target of 80 per cent. \nAlternative support delivered online can offer only limited help, however, to taxpayers whose circumstances are not straightforward, said Ms Monteith. “Having a real person to ask for help is important [but] getting through to someone on the phone has been a real problem, although HMRC has said it is working on this.” \nRobin Williamson, technical director at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said HMRC’s so-called “needs-enhanced support”, a free phone-based service for taxpayers who need help, was “working well”, but too few people who could benefit from the assistance knew about it. \nAs tax returns and benefit applications gradually move online, the LITRG is worried that digitally incapable taxpayers could be left behind. “Our main concern is that people will be pushed into using digital means of communication before they are ready,” said Mr Williamson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T06:21:56.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
