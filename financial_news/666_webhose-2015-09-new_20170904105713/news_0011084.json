The monthly trading volumes on the exchange grew by 35% trading 1538636 contracts recording an all-time high in two years. \nDGCX also registered a year-on-year growth of 67% and year-to-date growth of 18%. The overall Average Daily Volumes (ADV) reached 73268 contracts in the month of August 2015. \nThe exchange also recorded the highest average monthly Open Interest (OI) in August with 91797 contracts surpassing the previous high of 78391 contracts registered last month. An all-time high OI of 125066 contracts was achieved on August 27th 2015. \nThe recent volatility in FX markets also drove substantial volumes on DGCX's Emerging Markets currency products. The Indian Rupee options contracts garnered significant traction with 21221 contracts traded in August in comparison to 9511 contracts traded in July 2015. The Rupee options contract recorded a new high in ADV trading 1011 contracts in August. The Indian Rupee Quanto futures traded 230493 contracts up 69% from July crossing the 1.5 billion US mark in terms of traded value. Volumes in Mini Indian Rupee futures touched 142921 contracts growing 61% from previous month. \nAverage Daily Volumes on DGCX's India Gold Quanto contract also grew by 30% trading 671 contracts in August 2015. The increased appetite in bullion trading is reflective of how investors and traders use gold as an essential investment and hedging tool in times of economic uncertainty. \nGaurang Desai founding member and newly appointed CEO of DGCX said \"Our FX Futures and bullion products are attracting more traders than before as they seek safety in trading and hedging in a well regulated and transparent electronic platform like DGCX. This is validated by the fact that the exchange has witnessed a 20% increase in member participation since January 2015.\" \nVolumes on DGCX S&P BSE Sensex futures jumped 38% in August trading 19023 contracts in comparison to 13820 contracts in July 2015. The contract also recorded the second highest ADV since August 2014 with 906 contracts up 51% from last month. This reflects the recent movements in global stock markets following the devaluation of the Chinese Yuan. \n\"As uncertainty in global markets looms market participants are progressively looking at ways to hedge and manage their price exposure. This is where a secure trading platform like DGCX comes into effect as it offers traders and investors with various hedging and risk management instruments which can soften the impact of market volatility\" concluded Gaurang. \n\n\nWAM/Esraa/Moran", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:13:12.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
