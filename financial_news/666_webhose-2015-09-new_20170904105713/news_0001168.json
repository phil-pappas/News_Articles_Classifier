Photo: Erin Jonasson\nIf you work in a creative industry, chances are you've had someone steal your work. It's a disgusting practice that's not just tantamount to theft – it is theft.\nI was reminded of this recently when someone I know, let's call him Ryan, was asked to pitch a creative concept to a business, which promptly stole his idea and is now running with it in a national marketing campaign.\nThe artwork has been rendered slightly differently to Ryan's initial concept, but it's essentially exactly the same idea.\nIt amazes me that this business thinks it can get away with it. Did they not realise that Ryan would see the campaign and know exactly what's gone on? It makes me sick. And angry.\nAdvertisement So I asked Ursula Hogben, principal and general counsel of law firm LegalVision, about what creative types can do to prevent this from happening. She has a range of practical and legal solutions to this all-too common problem.\nHer first point is that creative types necessarily own the copyright to the work they create. \"Every time you take a photo or draw a design, picture or logo you have copyright in the work and it doesn't need to be registered.\"\nAll you need to do is use the ©, along with your business name or real name if you're a sole trader, as well as the year in which the work was created, to indicate you own the copyright.\nWhen you're pitching creative concepts, Ursula's advice is to ask clients to sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement before showing them the work. \"At the very least, tell them they cannot use the ideas you are going to show them without permission,\" she says.\nHer other advice is not to email any of the concepts through or leave hard copies with the client at the pitch. Once you've been awarded a job, it's also an idea to only send through low-res files, as well as place watermarks on the work until the finished art is complete and paid for.\n\"When they actually engage you, state in the client agreement that you own all the intellectual property until it has been transferred to the client and you own the drafts. Stipulate that the client will only receive the final work once it has been paid for.\"\nThere are also options when it comes to assigning or licencing the work to the client. The approach often depends on the industry and the client. Ursula says if, for example, someone has come up with a design and briefs a designer to execute it, it would be more normal for the artist to assign the work to the client. But that would not necessarily happen if the design is the artist's intellectual property.\nAnother example is photographs. Generally photographers retain copyright of the image and licence its use. Whichever approach is used, it's important to set it out in the client agreement, so there are no misunderstandings.\nIf there's a client agreement in place and the client contravenes it by using the design in a way that's not covered by the agreement, it is possible to seek an injunction to stop the client from doing this.\nIt's also important to understand that the client could still be breaching copyright by using the ideas in the design, not only the design itself. Says Ursula: \"In Australia we have what we call fair dealing; so you can only use someone's work if it's only an insubstantial part. If you're using a substantial part you could be breaching copyright.\"\nThe main message is to ensure you have an agreement in place before sending any creative material to an existing or prospective client. It's unlikely copyright theft would end up before the courts as it would cost too much in legal fees unless it's a really substantial breach. But if there's a formal agreement it's much easier to point out to the client the clause that's been contravened if there is a formal contract.\nSo spend the money on lawyer's fees upfront to develop a contract rather than having to potentially spend much more money down the track to get the client to stop using the work.\nAbove all remember that even though creative work is intangible, stealing it is no different to stealing something tangible like a car or a house.\nHas someone ever stolen your work?
