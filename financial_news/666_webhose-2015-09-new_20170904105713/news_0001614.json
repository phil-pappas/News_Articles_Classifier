Think of a specifications list and you’ll get multiple tabs which meet your requirement. So how do you set yourself apart in that? Micromax does not have an answer with the new P680. And that’s okay.\nSpecs: 8-inch IPS touchscreen (1280×800 pixels) | 1.3GHz quad-core processor | 1GB RAM | 16GB internal memory, microSD card up to 32GB | 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera | Dual-SIM, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | 4000mAh battery | Android 5.0 Lollipop\nDo the specs tell the story?\nYes. I don’t normally advise going by a specifications sheet because what you see and what you get is often different, but the Micromax P680 is exactly what it seems like: a decent tablet and decent battery life. It won’t surprise you. It won’t disappoint you. And that’s okay.\nThe touchscreen response is decent,the cameras get the job done, the Wi-Fi connectivity is as good as anything else in this price range. Honestly, in regular usage, there’s little that makes the P680 stand out. And that’s okay.\nAs the processor and RAM suggests, multi-tasking is a major issue. Switching between apps is extremely slow. But once you are running an app or a game and want to use it, the performance is fine.\nIs there anything beyond the specs?\nThe build quality and general feel of the tablet is lovely. If you are a fan of longer screens with a 16:10 aspect ratio (like most Samsung tablets) over square-ish screens with a 4:3 aspect ratio (like all iPads), then you will be mighty pleased with what Micromax has done here. It feels like a good quality tablet.\nMicromax has preloaded a lot of rubbish apps on the tab. Now, the 16GB of internal memory means the space is not a problem, but these apps are always popping up with in-your-face notifications and ads. It’s incredibly annoying. You also can’t uninstall these apps without rooting, which is even more annoying. I’d suggest you dive into the Settings and set them to never give you notifications.\nThe 3G connectivity on the P680 was among the best I’ve seen on tablets. I’m talking about levels that the Samsung Galaxy Tab Note series gets. If 3G internet connectivity on-the-move is important to you, this is a very good budget tablet.\nWho Should Buy It?\nLike I said, the P680 isn’t an exceptionally good tablet, but it’s not bad either. If you’re looking for an 8-inch tablet for Rs. 10,000 or less, you won’t be disappointed if you buy this.\nThat said, the Digiflip Pro XT811 retails at Rs. 8,000 and offers better multi-tasking performance. The screen of the P680 is slightly better, and I’ve always maintained that the screen is the most important part of the tablet.\nIf you’re a newcomer to the world of Android and won’t multi-task much, then I’d recommend the P680. But if you already know your way around Android, the P680’s multi-tasking woes will be too much for you, so it’s better to go with the Digiflip Pro XT811.\n 28, 2015 6:16 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:48:01.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
