It's not known when the House will vote. \nThe measure also provides $1 billion for lottery payouts. It has already passed the Senate. \nThe Democratic-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner have not agreed on a budget for the fiscal year that started July 1. But federal court orders require billions of dollars to be paid for service programs. \nRepublican Rep. Michael Tryon of suburban Crystal Lake questioned passing the bill when the state lacks money to pay for it. Rauner has indicated he'll veto it. \nThink your friends should see this?
