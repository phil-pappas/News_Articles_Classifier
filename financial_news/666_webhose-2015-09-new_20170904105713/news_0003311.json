The survey, which studied the travel habits of Indian travellers, highlighted that 37 per cent of Indian women travellers have done a solo trip while 33 per cent are open to the idea of travelling solo.\nKavitha Gnanamurthy , senior marketing manager, Skyscanner India said, “It is encouraging to see that Indian women are increasingly breaking stereotypes and travelling alone. The results reveal that Indian women solo travellers prefer domestic destinations as much as overseas ones, and there is a huge potential for the travel and hospitality industry to tap into this growing segment. At the same time, there is an opportunity to further promote Indian destinations to solo travellers all over the world. With Skyscanner’s search ‘Everywhere’ feature, we hope to inspire solo travellers all over the world by providing them with most comprehensive global coverage to choose from.”\nThe Skyscanner survey revealed that while 33 per cent of women travellers preferred a well-planned itinerary to avoid last minute surprises, 26 per cent of respondents preferred a mix of planned and unplanned elements to discover and explore new places in their chosen destination. Around 19 per cent of women were more comfortable planning their solo travel through trusted agents, while 16 per cent of respondents prefer to explore their chosen destination without a planned itinerary or tour.\nAlso the research revealed that 31 per cent of women travellers avoid taking solo trips due to safety and security concerns across domestic and international travel. Fear of boredom (23 per cent), family disagreements (13 per cent) and leave from work (eight per cent) were contributing factors to barriers to solo travel.\nBased on the flight searches performed by Indian travellers on Skyscanner, the most favourable domestic destination for Indian solo travellers is the capital city of Delhi with its amalgamation of various cultures and traditions as well as historic value. This is followed by Mumbai, Goa, Bengaluru and Kolkata. While major Indian cities remain the domestic hot spots for solo travellers, the capital city of London with its blend of Roman history and modern culture emerges as the favourite International destination amongst India’s solo travellers, followed by Toronto, Bangkok, New York and Dubai.\n 08, 2015 5:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:41:59.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
