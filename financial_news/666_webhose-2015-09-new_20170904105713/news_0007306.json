Alex Ellinghausen by Rowan Dean A media furore erupted this week when the Prime Minister, Mr AbbottLovesAlan, appeared on a top-rating breakfast radio show and provoked an immediate uproar by claiming that the CFMEU was \"even worse\" than the AWU.\n\"I mean, the AWU have done some truly dreadful things in the past but at least they had a sufficient sense of shame to try and hide their rorts and rip-offs behind dodgy invoices and training programs and in brown paper bags at the bottom of the garden,\" said the Prime Minister, \"but with the CFMEU, this mob, they actually boast about how despicable they are. They act in a way that even medieval barbarians would have flinched at, such as by running adverts on the telly trashing the China Free Trade deal.\"\nThe comments sparked an immediate media meltdown, with thousands of people taking to the airwaves and to social media to argue which union was in fact \"more evil\" than the other. One outraged leader of the Trades Union Community, Mr Dave 'Please-sir-can-I-have-some-more' Oliver went so far as to describe the Prime Minister's comments as \"unfortunate\".\nOthers were equally unforgiving. \"I don't think I would compare the CFMEU to the AWU,\" said the leader of the opposition, Mr Shortoncredibility, \"the CFMEU rely on classic bully boy techniques to get new members, where of course I, er I mean the AWU, just take hardworking people's money and sign them up even if they don't know anything about it.\"\nWhen asked later if he regretted his choice of words, the Prime Minister defiantly stood by his comments: \"I'm not in the business of ranking evil,\" he told a frenzied crowd of reporters. \"But let's be clear about this â€“ we've never before seen trade unionists try to decapitate a sitting royal commissioner and stick his reputation up on a stick for all the world to see; I mean, this level of barbarity can't go unpunished. Which is why my good friend Barack Obama has responded to my request for him to ask me to bomb them into oblivion.\"\nThe comments fuelled further leadership speculation, with leadership aspirant Malcolm Turncoat immediately leaving his harbourside mansion by limo and private jet and hopping onto a tram from St Kilda to Geelong so he could warn the public against overstating the threat from the union movement. \"The CFMEU is hardly Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Stalin's Russia\" he tweeted. \"And like me they don't use helicopters.\"\nWoolly thinking In other news this week, a creature was discovered wandering on the outskirts of Canberra, struggling to survive due to an enormous burden of woolly thinking. Originally assumed to be a goat because of its nickname (Billy), the sheep was clearly on its last legs when it was discovered staggering all around the China Free Trade agreement in a complete daze.\n Said one world-renowned shearer: \"In all my years of shearing wool, I've never seen such a profusion of woolly thinking. I normally shear a sheep in a few minutes but this one took me hours just to try and cut through all the layers and layers of humbug and hypocrisy.\"\nExperts agree that the sheep must have been spooked by an aggressive group of union bosses and become separated from the rest of his flock. \"Clearly, Billy has been wandering around in the wilderness all on his own for weeks on end now. Every other serious Labor thinker, including Bob Hawke and Bob Carr, has come out in favour of the free trade agreement. It's a miracle that Billy has managed to survive so long.\"\nMeanwhile, a defiant Treasurer Joe Hockey this week announced the release of the latest republican figures, with interest in the republic falling to a dismal 0.2 per cent. Admitting that interest in his republican movement was trending well below average, and significantly below what he and the Governor of the Republic Peter FitzSimons had anticipated in their mid-week press release, Mr Hockey denied Australia was sliding towards a permanent constitutional monarchy.\n\"This steady decline in the growth of interest in our republic is totally in line with all our previous bandana, er, I mean budgetary expectations,\" a muted Treasurer explained to an empty press conference.\nCommentators, however, were quick to point out that other Commonwealth-based constitutions, such as Canada and New Zealand, were faring far worse than Australia. Said one expert: \"Will you look at those new designs for the kiwi flag? What a shocker!\"\nMeanwhile, in the Canning byelection, opinion polls show an unprecedented surge of support for the Liberal's surprise candidate. Said one excited punter: \"What a sensational candidate! He's a straight-shooter and he has a fantastic service of record for this country. Yes, I'll definitely be voting for John Howard.\"\nTwitter @rowandean", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:04:37.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
