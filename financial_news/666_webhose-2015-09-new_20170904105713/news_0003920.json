AP The storms brewing abroad in recent months have caused equity prices on Wall Street to fall, the US dollar to appreciate and credit spreads to rise, contributing to a tightening in financial conditions.\n\"These developments may restrain US economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\" Dr Yellen added.\nStubbornly weak inflation The sharp fall in oil and gas prices and rising US dollar, both symptoms of troubles in overseas economies, are making it harder for the Fed to revive stubbornly weak inflation and hit its 2 per cent target.\n The disinflation being imported from overseas means the US is likely to face low inflation for at least several more months, even though the Fed views the deflation effects of low energy prices and strong greenback as \"transitory\", or in other words temporary.\nTo give the FOMC confidence that inflation and wages will pick up, Dr Yellen said the Fed is looking for some further improvement in the labour market in coming months.\nThirteen of the 17 FOMC participants believe rates will still rise before the end of the year, down slightly from the 15 who held that view in June. Confidence that the US economy will pull through the international headlines underlies this majority view.\n\"The US economy is performing well and impressing us by the pace of creating new jobs and the strength of domestic demand,\" Dr Yellen said.\nVolatility likely to linger There are FOMC meetings scheduled in October and December, with most outside Fed watchers tipping a rise in the final month of the calendar year.\nUntil then, markets are likely to remain volatile as traders try to pick the exact timing of lift off and monitor economic events around the world that the Fed has become more concerned about.\nIn the wake of China's currency devaluation last month, swooning stocking market and cooling economy, the world's second largest economy will be closely watched.\n\"The question is whether or not there might be a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect,\" Dr Yellen said.\n\"I think developments that we saw in financial markets in August in part reflected concerns that there was downside risks to Chinese economic performance and perhaps concerns the deftness with which policymakers were addressing those concerns.\"\nThe key for the Fed will be whether ructions overseas \"spill over\" materially into the US economy, and if further tightening in the labour market can stir some healthy inflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:11:45.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
