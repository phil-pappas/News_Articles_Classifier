The stock plunged 33 percent, and investors “have shown a virtual universal disgust” for the deal, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Robert Salmon said in a report.\n“It’s very unusual to find a company where there’s $200 million of low-hanging fruit of profit-improvement opportunities,” Jacobs said. “I’m very confident that despite the short-term market reaction, we will create a tremendous amount of shareholder value over time.”\nJacobs’s history includes founding, building and selling United Rentals Inc. and United Waste Systems Inc. Where he sees cost-savings in the Con-way deal, investors see more risk. XPO, after all, just paid $2.2 billion in April for a European trucker. Jacobs, who became XPO’s CEO in 2011, says shippers like the addition of Con-way’s trucks, while shareholders say they were attracted to XPO as a cargo broker, not a fleet operator.\nStrategy Shift With Con-way and the acquisition of France’s Norbert Dentressangle SA, Jacobs has changed XPO’s strategy to include owning trucks as well as just arranging freight shipments. About a third of XPO’s revenue will come from the truck assets, putting it between a traditional trucking company and so-called asset-light brokers such as C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.\nOwning trucks gives XPO more control over capacity as the industry faces a driver shortage that will only get worse, said Jacobs, who pulled together 200 garbage haulers to form United Waste Systems and consolidated 250 equipment rental firms to create United Rentals.\nMore Efficiently XPO’s broker expertise will help the acquired trucks run more efficiently, Jacobs said.\nThe change in strategy may have chased out some investors, said Colin Delaney, a fund manager with Eventide Asset Management, which owned 848,200 XPO shares as of the end of June. Jacobs is a “very proven executive” who will make the transaction work in the long term, Delaney said.\n“The severity of the reaction has a lot to do with the investors that had been in it for one story and they don’t stick around as that story changes,” Delaney said. “It’s not quite as easy to model anymore.”\nInvestors are also spooked by XPO’s increased debt following the two large acquisitions just as high-yield debt markets have weakened, Delaney said. XPO’s 6.5 percent bonds due in June 2022 have fallen every day since the Con-way deal was announced, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nBond Yields Junk-bond yields rose to 8.12 percent Monday from 7.49 percent on Sept. 8, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Slowing economic growth in China and deteriorating commodity prices have put pressure on the high-yield market in recent weeks.\nXPO shares rose 5.2 percent to $22.74 at Tuesday’s close in New York, the first gain in two weeks.\nAnalysts are standing by XPO partly on Jacobs’ reputation as an acquirer and because the hybrid model of broker-truck operator makes sense, said William Blair & Co.’s Nathan Brochmann. Of 16 analyst ratings on XPO, 15 are for buy. The selloff is overdone, he said.\n“You get better control of service and you get better control of pricing on the asset side,” Brochmann said in an interview. “For the shipper base, you have flexible solutions.”\nJacobs, who pulled together 200 garbage haulers to form United Waste Systems and consolidated 250 equipment rental firms to build United Rentals, said he’s not paying a “huge amount” of attention to the stock decline.\n“I’ve never seen a transaction before where the opportunity to increase the profits is so large and clearly defined,” he said. “Every rock that we turn over at Con-way we find synergies with XPO.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:07:13.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
