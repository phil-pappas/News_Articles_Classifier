If we confirm these are the people behind the fraud and the so-called ghost workers, we shall institute disciplinary and legal action immediately,\" Kobia said. \nFurther, the report says 10,280 employee records require follow-up and investigation to unearth individuals using duplicate documentation to infiltrate government salary accounts. \nThe payroll fraudsters, for instance, used one payroll number (identity withheld by the Star) to pay a salary six times for years. \nAnother 112 Identity Cards, which were virtually identical, were used to milk taxpayers of money in the well- coordinated \nscheme involving senior government officials with access to the payroll. \nSuspicious characters also used 367 replicated PIN numbers to access money paid to nonexistent workers. \nAn earlier assessment had revealed that the government was losing Sh70 million in eight state departments through salaries to nonexistent workers. \nThe biometric audit of the civil service staff launched in July last year indicated 485duplicate records were used to access government salaries after the state payroll was violated by internal fraudsters. \nThe Secretary General of the Union of Kenya Civil Servants Tom Odege challenged the government to thoroughly clean up its payroll and rid it of waste. \n\"If ghosts can earn Sh1.8 billion from government annually and the government is not aware, then no Kenyan is safe. They must clean up the payroll and use the money to enhance working environment for our members,\"Odege said. \nThe report said that out of the 8,979 employees in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Database who were not biometrically registered, 4,541 are unaccounted for. \n\"For those unaccounted for, there is need for further investigation to determine whether loss of funds has already occurred in terms of erroneous/fraudulent payments,\" the report says. Of the 199,921 public servants, only 163,543 were found to be duly registered in the integrated payroll system, while 36,378 newly employed staff are yet to be integrated into the system. \nBoth the national government and the county governments employ ghost workers. The committee recommends drastic action, including linking the payroll system, and hence data, with the National Registry to create one database of employee records and therefore minimise incidences of fraudulent activity/ghost workers,\" the report says. It calls for ending government payments through vouchers that can be manipulated. \n\"Employment of casuals presents the inherent risk of violating employment laws if not controlled and monitored,\" the committee noted Kenya \nThe government on Tuesday is set to open bids for the supply of school laptops after previous attempts were rocked by … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star.
