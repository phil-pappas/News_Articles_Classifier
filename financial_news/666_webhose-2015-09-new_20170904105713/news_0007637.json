Give up your life for reality TV? Sell half your belongings? Become a human guinea pig?\nIf you answered “yes” to any of these, then you’re part of a surprisingly big cohort of GenY-ers desperate to get rid of their loans. Stat.\nUS finance website MyBankTracker quizzed 200 of its users — with a median age of 32 — to find out to what extremes they would go to have a clean slate.\nThe survey allowed for ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers only, and assumed the measure at hand would completely eliminate your student debt, Forbes reports.\nAs it turned out, many would sign up to have cameras follow their every move, with 55 per cent saying they’d be willing to turn their life into a reality show.\nTrade-in ... It’s unlikely Kim Kardashian has any debt after turning her life into a reality show.

But is the freedom from debt worth an organ? Source: istock\nRather, site co-founder Alex Matjanec saidthe results suggested a new mindset among millennials of trying to erase their debt as fast as possible rather than allowing it to simply become part of their long-term budget.\n“They’d rather get rid of their debt quicker than adapting to it over time and making it part of your day to day reality,” Mr Matjanec said.\nHe added that he believed this was linked to the common finding that young people are increasingly putting off embarking on major life steps such as getting married or buying a house.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6&h=Would+you+sell+an+organ+to+be+debt-free%3F", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6&title=Would+you+sell+an+organ+to+be+debt-free%3F", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2015/09/09/desperate-and-in-debt-30-of-millennials-would-sell-an-organ-to-get-rid-of-student-loans/", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6&title=Would+you+sell+an+organ+to+be+debt-free%3F", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Would+you+sell+an+organ+to+be+debt-free%3F&c=NOBODY+likes+seeing+that+five-figure+number+on+their+uni+debt.+But+a+survey+has+found+millennials+would+go+to+surprising+lengths+to+wipe+their+student+loans.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/generations/mybanktracker-survey-finds-gen-y-adults-would-sell-an-organ-or-turn-their-life-into-reality-tv-to-be-rid-of-university-debt/story-fn7ki9pl-1227521515218?sv=fd1c1df1dbfcba28e6cfc8a16261cab6", "http://www.mybanktracker.com/news/how-far-would-you-go-get-rid-your-student-debt-infographic"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:08:13.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
