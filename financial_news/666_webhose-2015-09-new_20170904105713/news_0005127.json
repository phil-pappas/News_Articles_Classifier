Photo: Alex Ellinghausen / Fairfax\nBig business is understood to have been called on to speak out against the effects test and firm opposition to the proposed changes to the competition law.\nThe Business Council of Australia, which represents the top end of business, claims an effects test will hurt shoppers, leading to higher prices. But it has denied talk of a public campaign.\nEmotions run high on both sides of the debate, which was reignited this week after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull made the effects test a central plank of his newly-minted agreement with Coalition partner the National Party.\nCanberra insiders report ministers have been told prices will increase and voters will turn against them if the effects test gets up, and claim that the BCA has called on its members to speak out against the change.\nAdvertisement Council of Small Business Australia chief executive Peter Strong said he was aware the BCA had approached its members to speak out against the effects test.\n\"It's my understanding that the BCA has been contacting the heads of all their members to support opposition to the effects test,\" he said.\n\"The people who don't want the effects test are half a dozen retailers from the top end of town, the big end of town have the money for a major advertising campaign.\"\nHe said the arguments put up by the BCA were \"rubbish\", particularly when the effects test was backed by independent heavyweights like former national competition boss Allan Fels.\nThe proposed changes to the competition law came out of the Harper Review and target any activity with the \"purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition.\"\n Neither Coles nor Woolworths would comment on the fresh push for an effects test.\nThe BCA will not say anything before the legislation has gone back to cabinet but it's been vocal in its criticism of the change, which it claims will undermine rather than improve the competitive process.\nAnd in a tweet on Wednesday it said: \"Don't back the Harper Review's anti-competition effects test - prices will rise and consumers will suffer.\"\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry boss Kate Carnell said she was surprised by the ferocity of the BCA's attack.\nIt was a \"moderate effects test\" that would not stop large companies from being aggressively competitive.\n\"It doesn't stop a company with significant market power from pushing down prices with a particular supplier,\" Ms Carnell said.\n\"It would only be if the effect of that activity impacted on the competitiveness of the whole market.\"\nShe said every country in the world had an effects test, except Australia and New Zealand.\nMaster Grocers Australia chief executive Jos de Bruin said the effects test would give the ACCC the clout to \"crack down\" on anti-competitive practices.\n\"This is about the national interest, it's not about the interests of a few big businesses,\" Mr de Bruin said.\n\"This will not stop Coles or Woolies or Murdoch or Telstra from doing what they do today unless they are breaking the law.\"\nCanberra insiders suggest Tony Abbott backed away from the effects test in recent weeks, wary of picking a fight with the country's biggest retailers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T11:40:34.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
