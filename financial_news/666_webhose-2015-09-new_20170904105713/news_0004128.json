Find out here By Ashley Armstrong | Telegraph – 2 minutes 4 seconds ago Print \nBritain's beleaguered supermarket chain puts a further 900 jobs at risk as it battles to revive its fortunes \nMorrisons has revealed the location of the 11 loss-making supermarkets it intends to close as part of its efforts to revive the supermarket chain. \nDavid Potts, who took the reins of Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket in March, last week outlined plans to shut the stores just one day after agreeing a deal to offload 140 of Morrisons' convenience stores. \nThe grocer has said that the 11 store closures will put around 900 jobs at risk but has not outlined a timeline for when the shops will shut. *West Bromwich (Hawthorns), West Midlands *Salford, Greater Manchester *Burnham on Sea, Somerset *Castletown, Sunderland *Clevedon, Somerset *Little Hulton, Greater Manchester *Northallerton, North Yorkshire *Oldbury, West Midlands *Shildon, County Durham *Streatham, London *Tyldesley, Wigan Morrisons has already shut 10 supermarkets this year, at the expense of 430 jobs, and Mr Potts culled 720 head office jobs just days after arriving at the retailer while swinging the axe on 45 members of the supermarket’s leadership team. \nMr Potts said the decision to close a further 11 shops was made with “great regret” but said there was no way to make the loss-making stores viable. He stressed that the company was on a “long journey” to recovery after posting a halving in pre-tax profits. \nLast night credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded the supermarket to Baa3 from Baa2 driven by the slump in pre-tax profits and the continued decline in like-for-like sales. \nThe rating action “primarily reflects the impact of structural changes in the UK grocery sector, particularly the ongoing shift of consumers to discounters, convenience stores and online retailers, which has caused Morrisons' earnings to contract beyond our previous expectations,\" said Sven Reinke, a vice president senior credit officer at Moody's and lead analyst for Morrisons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:04:21.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
