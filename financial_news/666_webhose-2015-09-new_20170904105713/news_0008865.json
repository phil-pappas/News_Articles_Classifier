Nic Walker Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Prospective investors have raised concerns about a $20 million-plus poison pill in the coming float of Brett Blundy's homemaker centre landlord Aventus Property.\nAccording to marketing documents, any change of management control of the $906 million vehicle will cost investors more than $20 million.\nA formula whereby the management fee of 0.7 per cent of total assets is multiplied by a three-year period will dictate the majority of the payment to the manager who is removed.\nSome institutional investors, who have declined to be named, told The Australian Financial Review that it could hurt the planned float of the company, which is being handled by Macquarie Capital and Morgans.\nMr Blundy, who has done a lot of the hard work bringing the 14 homemaker centres and five property funds together, was unavailable for comment, so too was his chief executive Darren Holland.\nChange-of-control provision Together they are expected to own about 30 per cent of the fund on listing, having committed to reinvesting all of their equity in the private retail portfolio. They will also own the manager and therefore an expensive change-of-control provision is likely to ensure they do not lose the management rights to a takeover rival.\nThe change-of-control provision has been a controversial issue in years past .\n In recent floats almost all the new listings except Industria REIT were without such a change of control payment.\nIndustria had a formula whereby 12 months-worth of management fees would be paid to the manager who is removed.\nThe float is targeting a $310 million equity raising and is likely to be priced at about $2 per security .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-09-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:05:14.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
