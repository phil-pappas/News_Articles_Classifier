Financial spreadbetters expected Germany's DAX to open down by 13-15 points, or 0.1-0.2 percent lower. France's CAC 40 was seen down by 9-12 points, or 0.2-0.3 percent lower, while Britain's FTSE 100 was expected to open flat. The U.S Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday in a bow to worries about the global economy, financial market volatility and sluggish inflation at home, but left open the possibility of modest rate rises later this year. \"Yes, we've got a reprieve on an immediate interest rate hike, but the reason for the stay of execution is rather bearish itself,\" said London Capital Group dealer Jonathan Sudaria. Asian shares rose modestly on Friday on relief that the Fed had held off on raising interest rates but gains were capped by renewed concerns about the health of the global economy, in particular China. The Fed's decision also pushed up the euro against the dollar, and gains in the euro can often weigh on European carmakers and luxury good stocks as their exports typically benefit when the euro is weaker on currency markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:31:04.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
