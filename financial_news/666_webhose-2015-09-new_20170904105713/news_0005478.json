Both had neither studied nor worked in foreign policy before taking on the prime ministership. Turnbull's experience comes primarily from his business engagement, while Hawke's was from his union work. Both have a deep intellectual interest in the area.\nBoth formed and cultivated broad networks of contacts and genuine friendship among the elites in Australia's most important relationships. For both, foreign policy is not a whimsy but one of deep, longstanding engagement and interest.\nIn Australia, as in many other countries, the key relationships are managed by the Prime Minister. This is expected by these countries and reflects the depth and breadth of engagement and the need for strong, whole-of-government co-ordination. Traditionally in Australia, the Prime Minister has taken the lead in managing relations with the United States, China, Indonesia, Japan and, perhaps anachronistically, New Zealand.\nIndia, Britain and South Korea fade in and out of prime ministerial attention, but these are more about ceremonial visits than the pursuit of substantial long-term interests that require the close attention of the Prime Minister. Interesting, the European Union hardly makes the Prime Minister's in-tray. John Howard made several trips to London over a number of years before making his first visit, reluctantly, to Brussels. Tony Abbott threatened to \"shirt front\" Vladimir Putin.\nPrime Minister Turnbull is likely to continue the tradition of taking charge of foreign policy for the key relationships and leaving others to his competent Foreign Minister.\nThe big challenge for any Australian Prime Minister today is how to balance our security interests in the US alliance and accommodation of the rise of China, our most important economic relationship and the most disruptive event in global affairs over the past 20 years.\nAt ease with the challenges Encouragingly, Turnbull seems to be at ease with the challenges of managing these relations. He has perhaps the most contemporary view of modern China since Hawke/Keating. He understands that China is not a one-dimensional cut-out of a post-Stalinist state. He knows that China is an economically, socially and politically diverse entity. Just as he is prepared to embrace the challenges of new technology, so he is prepared to embrace the realities of contemporary China, with all the opportunities it creates for Australia.\nHe seems to bring no ideological baggage to managing the relationship. His speeches indicate a practical understanding that the world has changed profoundly with China's rise, but that in dealing with China it is important to stick firmly to our values and beliefs about social and political organisation. This is not to proselytise but be clear about who we as Australians are and for what we stand. The Chinese will recognise and welcome this pragmatism.\n In many ways, the US relationship will be more challenging for Turnbull. To the extent he will want to nuance the management of it, he runs the risk of creating suspicions of his motives and whether he is \"soft\" on China. His potential first mistake would be to act in ways that required him to demonstrate later that he is \"tough\" on China. This was always a problem for Kevin Rudd, who feared being tainted as the Manchurian Candidate.\nSince Paul Keating, the US has been encouraged to take Australia for granted. Keating had some famous arguments with the US over dairy and wheat subsidies. Since then, successive prime ministers have gone out of their way to minimise differences and foster a belief in US policymakers' minds that Australia will always be there to assist. Our votes in the UN Security Council on Middle East issues, notably Israel, highlight this, as did the muddle of our response to China's proposal for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nIronically, those keen to ensure that there is no light between Australia and the US potentially do a disservice to the relationship, when at times an Australian government seeks to pursue a more independent foreign policy.\nRequired reading The excellent, recently published book on the extreme tension in the relationship that occurred after Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister should be required reading for the new Prime Minister. Unholy Fury, by James Curran, highlights the dangers to Australia and the US of our pursuing a supine foreign policy towards the US.\nIn 2005, then Foreign Minister Alexander Downer tried to alert the US to the limits of Australia's support for the alliance when he said Australia would not necessarily invoke the ANZUS Treaty in all situations of conflict between the US and China over Taiwan. Uncharacteristically, he was responding to a hypothetical question, and foolishly he said this in Beijing, but he spoke the truth and in friendship towards the US. The next day he was slapped down by Howard and the conservative press in Australia went into overdrive condemning Downer.\nHow then should the new Prime Minister open his foreign policy book? He will have a lot of non-discretionary things he must do, such as G2O, APEC, ASEM and various other summits and meetings already programmed into his diary.\nIdeally, however, he should make his first bilateral visits to south-east Asia, beginning with Indonesia. No relationship is more challenging, more important or more underdone than this. In the past, working closely with Indonesia we were able to solve the Cambodian peace process and institute the Bali Process on People Smuggling.\nFor his second visit, he should go to Washington and set out clearly that while the US will continue to be the cornerstone of Australia's security and we share deep and longstanding affinities, some recalibration of the relationship will inevitably occur as we respond in our own way to China's rise. While continuing to encourage US ongoing engagement in Asia, it is important for the US to understand that we also seek to shape China's engagement with and behaviour towards the region. To do this we need in part to be seen as having a clear, independent voice and positions that can be understood to be based on Australia's interests.\nVisit Japan first His third visit will need to be to north-east Asia. He must avoid the huge mistake Rudd made by visiting China on his first trip to the region, instead of Tokyo. Japan is in an existential state of anxiety over its decline relative to China. Japan lobbied furiously against Rudd behind the scenes and Rudd was forced on the defensive for the rest of his term â€“ over compensating and distorting Australia's foreign policy priorities. China is confident enough not to be troubled by the Prime Minister visiting Tokyo before Beijing.\nFinally, the Prime Minister should visit New Zealand, to learn from Prime Minister John Key how to manage adroitly the challenges of deep economic dependence on China and security interests with the United States.\nGeoff Raby is a former ambassador to China and is chief executive of the Beijing-based Geoff Raby and Associates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:04:22.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
