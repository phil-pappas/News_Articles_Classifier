Photo: Eddie Jim\nA massive plunge in Myer's share price to a record low is threatening to derail its $117 retail raising amid concern the department store's strategy will not deliver sales growth.\nIts share price closed at its low of 90¢ on Thursday, a level under the 94¢ price for the rights issue announced on Tuesday\nIt was also a whopping 26 per cent lower than its $1.21 closing price from Monday.\nThe stock has been battered by the double whammy of market volatility along with fears chief executive Richard Umbers and his team will not be able to execute their $600 million turnaround strategy for the retail business.\nAdvertisement Myer had expected to return to the bourse at about $1 as a result of the dilatory effect of the rights issue, according to CBA analyst Andrew McLennan.\n\"The retail investors won't want a bar of it [Myer] but that's assuming the share price stays where it is and ... the market is just so ridiculously volatile at the moment,\" he said.\nHe also noted that all the discretionary retailer stocks were down about 4 per cent on a day when the ASX200 closed down 1.4 per cent at 5028, and this had added to the already anticipated fall for Myer.\n\"It's only natural to expect to see the share price move the way it has and it's been exaggerated by the weak market,\" Mr McLennan said.\nThe good news for Myer is that the issue was fully underwritten by Goldman Sachs, which means the department store still gets its funding even if the stock doesn't trade above 94¢ in the next few weeks.\nBut the first day of trade since the stock was put in a trading halt won't provide any comfort for Myer's management.\nMr McLennan said there was a lot in Myer's full-year results and outlook that \"Might have disappointed the market.\"\n\"It's confirmation of just how difficult a bind the company is in but not withstanding that, this underwritten raising will dramatically improve their position.\"\nThe department store revealed a 21 per cent slide in its 2015 full-year net profit on Tuesday and forecast a 15 per cent decline in profits for fiscal 2016.\nThe turnaround strategy is targeting sales growth of more than 3 per cent a year out to 2020 when, according to the plan, Myer will hit a record of $3.7 billion in sales.\nMyer's institutional investors have already demonstrated support for the turnaround plan through the take-up of shares in a $221 million equity raising\nCitigroup analyst Craig Woolford said the fall in the share price was not unexpected.\n\"Fundamentally, we are seeing the share price fall because the company's earnings outlook has been reduced,\" Mr Woolford said.\nAnalysts have been broadly positive about the strategic plan but there are concerns over management's ability to execute, particularly in the face of an ascendent David Jones.\nDavid Jones owner South African Woolworths turned around a four-year earnings slide to post a 28.8 per cent jump in operating profit to $161 million for the 11 months to June 30.\nOne market watcher said Myer's share slump pointed to the \"doubt and uncertainty about its long-term strategy.\nIn a bid to turn around sales growth, Myer outlined plans on Tuesday to shut down underperforming stores, use brands to drive traffic to its stores and online, and invest in visual merchandising, fitting rooms and service.\nIt also unveiled a plans to roll out Topshop concessions in 20 of its stores after taking a 25 per cent stake in Topshop Australia.\n\"I don't think the market only looks at this from a long-term perspective, and the next 12 months don't look great,\" one analyst said.\n\"And if the shares are trading below the rights then there's no sensible reason to buy them.\n\"Then the underwriters, Goldman Sachs, has the stock and the headache to think about.\"\nA Myer spokeswoman said the company did not comment on share price movements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:52:51.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
