Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Global events are directing Australian share prices more than individual company merits, making it harder for stock pickers to outperform, but that could also play into their hands.\nIn an investor note, Goldman Sachs US equity strategist David Kostin said return dispersions, the difference between the best and worst performing stocks, had fallen during the recent sell-off on the S&P 500.\nThat the two phenomena happened simultaneously was rare, indicating that macro events were driving the market rather than company fundamentals.\nThe same dynamics are playing out on the Australian sharemarket, as company performance is swept aside in broad-based daily fluctuations that leave no sector unscathed.\n\"The macro backdrop for Australian equities is not particularly hot right now,\" State Street Global Advisors Asia Pacific head of quantitative equities Olivia Engel said.\nA slowing Australian economy, recording just 0.2 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the past quarter, fears over China's slowing economy, falling commodity prices and a looming interest rate rise in the US were contributing to the sharemarket.\n\"It is definitely more challenging here than in the US or Europe,\" Ms Engel said.\nBut it is the lacklustre growth in the heavyweight banks and the miners have done the bulk of the dragging on earnings-per-share growth, UBS equity strategist David Cassidy said.\n Those sectors have been specifically under pressure from capital requirements and an unwinding resources boom respectively.\n'Try to look through the business cycle' \"There is much better earnings growth coming through in the ex-resources, ex-banks segment of the market,\" he said.\n\"Growth in this part of the market has been assisted by a weaker Australian dollar, continuing focus on corporate cost-out/efficiency and pockets of organic top-line strength.\"\n\"We believe this presents a strong argument for not indexing the market, ie active management of Australian equity portfolios.\"\nMacquarie Securities quantitative analyst Jon Conomos said present volatility, measured on a time and cross sectional volatility basis was much lower in historical terms.\n\"An ideal environment for stock pickers has been low time series volatility and high cross sectional volatility,\" he said, but warned volatility on both measures was increasing.\nHigher correlations might suit short-term strategies, but through managing risk and being benchmark unaware, outperformance is possible, Ms Engel said.\n\"Try to look through the business cycle, take a stock selection that looks around 12 months or longer, ascertain the likely risk associated with those companies over a six-to-12 month period and not be thrown around by short-term movements in the market.\"\nOn a valuation basis, the market ex-bank and resources was moderately expensive, but not so relative to the broader market and interest rates, Mr Cassidy said.\n\"The prospect of quite a number of companies in this segment of the market delivering 10 per cent plus growth over coming few years at price-earnings ratios of 15 to 20 times against a 2.5 per cent government bond yield would appear to be attractive,\" he said.\nUnder their metric the UBS strategy team said Qantas Airways, Sims Metal Management, Incitec Pivot, CSL and Resmed all looked attractive.\nPeak Asset Management executive director Niv Dagan said in the volatile environment, there were four company metrics on which stock pickers should base their analysis.\n\"Cash flows, dividend yield, management and strong balance sheets are what investors should look at to really assess the health of a company,\" he said.\n\"But it is really difficult right now, especially when you see so much volatility on the market.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-25T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:06:29.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
