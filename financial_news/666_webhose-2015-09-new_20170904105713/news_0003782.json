He remained in custody on Friday but has the option of petitioning the court for release pending trial. \nThe charges are tied to allegations that Mr Karpeles falsified data, while another relates to claims he pocketed millions of dollars of Bitcoin deposits. \nHe has been held without formal charge for six weeks, as allowed under Japanese law. \nMr Karpeles was first taken into custody over claims he fraudulently tinkered with data and transferred funds to other firms controlled by him dozens of times between 2011 and 2013. \nHe was later rearrested for allegedly pocketing about 321m yen (£1.7m) worth of Bitcoin deposits, extending an initial three-week incarceration, during which time police likely grilled him over the incident. \nBitcoins are generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world, and are not backed by any government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies. \nTokyo-based MtGox shut down last year after admitting 850,000 coins - worth around $480m (£311m) at the time, or $387m at current exchange rates - had disappeared from its digital vaults . \nThe exchange, which once said it handled around 80pc of global Bitcoin transactions, filed for bankruptcy protection soon after the cyber-money went missing, leaving a trail of angry investors calling for answers. \nThe company initially said there was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoins that allowed hackers to steal them. \nMr Karpeles later claimed he had found some 200,000 of the lost coins in a \"cold wallet\" - a storage device, such as a memory stick, that is not connected to other computers. \nBut the whereabouts of the money and Mr Karpeles' involvement appear far from solved. \n\"I'm happy the police have made breakthroughs on investigating the missing fiat money, but it would be unsatisfying if after all this time all we get is a conviction for manipulated records and embezzlement only amounting to a fraction of all the money people lost,\" Bitcoin investor Kim Nilsson told AFP. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may be better than nothing for the people who want to see someone held responsible, but I think we should be expecting more.\" \nYoshimitsu Homma, head of Japan Digital Money Association, called Mr Karpeles' arrest \"good news\". \nBut \"the issue is in the past for the virtual currency world itself, and more people are getting interested\" in digital money, he added. \nThe case presented a complex challenge to Japanese police, as financial watchdogs around the world struggle to work out how to regulate digital money, which started to appear around 2009. \nInvestors have called on the firm's court-appointed administrators to publicise its data so that experts around the world can help analyse what happened at MtGox. \nIn a recent interview with Japan's top-selling Yomiuri newspaper, Mr Karpeles' mother said her \"genius\" son learned computer languages at age three and started making simple programmes of his own two years later. \nIn 2006, Mr Karpeles - who reportedly lived in an $11,000-a-month Tokyo penthouse - wrote on his blog that computer crime was \"totally contrary to my ethical principles\". \nBut four years later, a Paris court sentenced him in absentia to a year in prison for hacking. He had travelled to Japan to work for a web development company in 2009 and later got involved with the Bitcoin exchange. \nBackers say virtual currencies provide an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online. But critics argue the lack of legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility make it dangerous. \nBitcoin's reputation was also damaged when US authorities seized funds as part of an investigation into the online black market Silk Road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:54:46.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
