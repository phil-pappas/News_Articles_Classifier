All of those stocks, though, failed to make significant gains Tuesday, when major U.S. averages closed mixed in up-and-down trading. \nFor trader Dan Nathan, high-growth technology names could see another leg down, as many sit at \"very speculative valuations.\" \n\"It's all in the stock price here,\" he said. Adam Berry | Getty Images \nHe pointed specifically to weakness for Facebook, which he contended could fall to $80 per share. It closed Tuesday at $86.67 after falling nearly 3 percent. \nTrader David Seaburg disagreed with Nathan's outlook, contending Facebook was a \"gift\" below $90 per share. \n\"I'm really surprised that it's been punished so much,\" he said. \nRead More Facebook is going to $100: Trader \nSeaburg also took a particularly bearish outlook on Apple, saying it does not have another new product to send its stock higher. Apple announced this week that it broke a first-weekend sales record with the launch of its iPhone 6s line, but its shares shed 3 percent Tuesday. \nStill, trader Pete Najarian, an Apple shareholder, contended that the iPhone upgrade cycle could sustain Apple into next year, when it may get another catalyst to kickstart stock growth. \nSeaburg also touted shares of Google and Amazon. Google, in particular, has a reasonable valuation despite a 13 percent gain this year, he said. \nGoogle shares ended barely positive Tuesday after the company unveiled new phones and streaming devices. \nDisclosures: \nPete Najarian \nLong AAPL, AMAT, BAC, BMY, BP, CSX, DIS, DISCA, DKS, FOXA, GE, KKR, KO, MRK, PEP, PFE, PHM he is long calls AA, ABX, BMY, DAL, EEM, FL, MPEL, PFE, SWFT, UAL, XLF, XOM, ZIOP, he is long puts DISH, FCX, X \nDan Nathan \nDan is long PYPL Oct call calendar, BA Oct put spread, INTC Oct put spread, QQQ Oct put spread, UAL Oct/Nov put spread, XLU call spread, TWTR, PG \nDavid Seaburg \nOpinions expressed by David Seaburg are solely his own and do not reflect the views and opinions of Cowen Group, Inc \nGuy Adami", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:36:12.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
