Le Mobile has introduced the world's first ecosystem mobile phone brand - Le Superphone, including three flagship products: Le 1 Pro, Le Max, and Le 1. The Le Max is a high end device with a 6.33-inch Quad HD display, Snapdragon 810 chip (2GHz, octa-core, 64-bit), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, up to 128GB of internal storage, and a 21-megapixel f/2.0 camera with optical stabilisation and true-tone flash. The Le Max also boasts an ESS Hi-Fi chip, a one-touch fingerprint reader, infrared remote, a 3,500 mAh battery, dual LTE SIM support and Wireless HD display link. The Le 1 Pro is smaller and has a reduced feature set compared to the Le Max. \nWith LeTV's recent entry into the smartphone sector, Dialog's adapter solution enables the Le Max and Le 1 Plus to charge exceptionally fast for a top user experience, which is especially important for streaming video and other battery-intensive applications. Dialog's SmartDefender(TM) technology helps to facilitate safer, more reliable rapid charging adapters, extending Le Mobile's array of ground-breaking phone features. \n\"Dialog quickly took the lead in fast charging technologies in the smartphone market with an estimated 70% market share today,\" said Davin Lee, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Power Conversion Business Group at Dialog. \"We are pleased to be included in LeTV's successful smartphone debut, helping the company add yet another innovative feature to its high-performance smartphones.\" \nTechnical Details \nThe iW626 Rapid Charge interface IC resides on the secondary side of the AC/DC charger power supply and works with Dialog's iW1780 PrimAccurate(TM) primary-side digital pulse width modulation (PWM) controller. The iW1780 uses a unique secondary-to-primary digital communicaton link signal to receive all Rapid Charge commands from the iW626 through a single optocoupler. The iW626+iW1780 chipset supports Quick Charge 2.0 High Voltage Dedicated Charging Port (HVDCP) Class A (5V, 9V, 12V output) applications, providing fast voltage transition and low no-load power consumption under 100mW. \nDialog's SmartDefender advanced hiccup technology in the iW1780 provides an adapter safety feature that protects mobile devices from heat damage caused by short circuits in dirty or damaged charging ports, or by worn USB cables and connectors. The iW1780 PWM controller's SmartDefender protection reduces the average power delivered to a short circuit by up to 75% without latching off. This helps prevent excessive heat build-up and damage for safer, more reliable rapid charging - all with no added components. \nDialog SmartDefender(TM) video:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:37:18.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
