It has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley to work on the offering.\n\"The best thing Atlassian could have done for the local sector would have been to list in Australia,\" said Matt Barrie, chief executive of jobs website Freelancer, which listed on the ASX in 2013, citing the need for major players to build a local market.\nAtlassian co-directors Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, who founded the company in 2002 using credit card debt, declined to comment on Monday. Both have previously cited the maturity of the U.S. markets as a reason to list offshore.\nTurnbull's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe Australian tech startup sector has the potential to contribute A$109 billion ($78 billion), or 4 percent of GDP - up from just 0.1 percent currently - and 540,000 jobs by 2033, according to a PriceWaterhouseCoopers report.\nBut fewer than 5 percent of Australian startups currently grow into sustainable, global businesses, according to Deloitte research, largely due to funding issues.\n\"One thing we don't do a good enough job at, and I think the ASX can do better here, is promoting the stock exchange as a means of financing startups, or second-, third-round money for startups,\" Turnbull told business leaders last week.\nMomentum has been gradually building on the ASX with a stream of backdoor listings by startups using the shells of failed mining minnows, including security specialists Covata and YPB.\nBut the Atlassian IPO will set a new record for an Australian technology business, overshadowing accounting software group MYOB's A$2 billion float on the ASX in May.\nSome in the industry believe an Atlassian listing, regardless of location, will spark interest in Australian startups.\nThey also see improvements under Turnbull, despite the current lack of local funding.\n\"There's a real gap in funding, in the so-called Valley of Death, between early-stage money and the larger Series A funding and government support,\" said Sebastien Eckersley-Maslin, the founder of startup accelerator programme Blue Chilli. \"Turnbull understands innovation and he understands investment.\" (Editing by Stephen Coates and G Crosse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T01:26:42.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
