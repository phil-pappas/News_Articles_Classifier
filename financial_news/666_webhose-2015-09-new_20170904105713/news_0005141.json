Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Hollywood actor and Sydney resident Cate Blanchett and her husband, Andrew Upton, have sold their mansion home, the historic \"Bulwarra\" in Hunter's Hill, for $20 million.\nThe sandstone mansion on sprawling 3642 square metres of grounds at 4 North Parade epitomises luxury.\nBuilt in 1877, Bulwarra is both modern and classical, housing a pool pavilion, championship tennis court, trampoline platform, guesthouse and direct river access.\nThe pool is heated and features a covered spa and dining pergola with a unique studio retreat hidden below. Back in the main building, there is a chef's-grade island kitchen and a guest powder and cloakroom finished off with a cellar and parking for four cars.\nAlwill Design's Nadine Alwill and Lesiuk Architects' Dr Stephen Lesiuk designed the rebuild of the riverside five-bedroom home. Three of the bedrooms open out to a veranda overlooking the water views.\nWhile the sale price is the highest in the area so far, sources said it is \"right on the money\". The most expensive sale for the area to date was the $12.85 million sale of 1 Chevalier Crescent.\nListing agent for the home Ken Jacobs of Christies International, who recently sold James Packer's Vaucluse home for more than $60 million, declined to comment.\nSavills' Adam Ross, who was also involved in the transaction, also declined to talk about the sale but said its price would be \"the catalyst that unlocks value for the top-end properties in Hunter's Hill\". He has had offers between $20 million and $30 million for homes of the same quality in the area.\n Ms Blanchett and her family, who are moving to the US, bought the property in 2005 for $10 million from merchant banker Jim Dominguez and his wife Suzanne, and spent three years renovating the home.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-09-03T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:04:41.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
