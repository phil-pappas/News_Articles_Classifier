Other banks are expected to follow suit, with Andhra Bank trimming its base rate by 25 basis points to 9.7%.\nBoth consumers and corporates will benefit from the cut with equated monthly instalments becoming smaller. However, savers will lose out since the country’s biggest lender has said it proposes to trim deposit rates, across several maturities, by a fairly large 25 basis points.\nSBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya conceded the cut might impact the bank’s net interest margins by about 10 basis points but expected consumer demand to pick up as a result of the lower loan rates. Bhattacharya observed that this time around the transmission had been quicker and bigger. “We have transmitted 40 bps and as the book reprices and we begin to see credit growth come in, we will definitely look to bring down rates further,” she said.\nICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar asserted rates would come down and a large part of the cut would get transmitted. “When I say a large part will be transmitted it means more than half, but beyond that I can’t take my asset liability committee’s (ALCO) decision,” she explained.\nKochhar added home loan rates had anyway been moving down since the market was competitive. “Home loan rates are very competitive and as the rate regime becomes softer, home loans too will become softer,” she said.\nKeki Mistry, vice-chairman and CEO, HDFC, said there was room to cut lending rate cuts depending on the fall in its cost of funds and on the definition of affordable housing for which the Reserve Bank of India was looking at lower risk weights for home loans of lower value.\nBase rates now range anywhere between 9.3% and 10% — HDFC Bank charges 9.35%, ICICI Bank 9.7% and Andhra Bank 9.75%. While the RBI has lowered the repo rate by 125 bps since January, banks have passed on a maximum of 70 bps.\nWhile the cut in base rates is unlikely to boost demand for credit, which has been growing at a very sluggish 10% or thereabouts, it will help ease cash flows for companies. The move will especially benefit small and medium-scale enterprises reeling under the slowdown in the economy. RBI data showed non-food credit grew 9.88% year-on-year in the fortnight to September 4 to Rs 65.99 lakh crore, while deposits grew 11.59% year -on-year to Rs 90.3 lakh crore.\nDemand for project finance, however, is not expected to pick up for another year or so given there is sufficient capacity is the system across sectors and most companies remain very highly leveraged. Moreover, the crash is the prices of commodities such as steel has resulted in large imports leaving capacity unutilised.\n 30, 2015 1:25 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:23:45.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
