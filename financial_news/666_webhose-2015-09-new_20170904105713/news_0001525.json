Ian Waldie by Vanessa Desloires Glencore's true value has analysts guessing Glencore shares routed amid debt concerns Markets Live: $35b wiped off ASX Shares in Australia's biggest mining company, BHP Billiton, have fallen to a seven-year low after being caught up in a rout of rival Glencore, which lost 30 per cent of its share price overnight.\nBHP extended losses incurred by its UK-listed body overnight, plunging more than 5.8 per cent in early local trade to $21.79. Overnight its shares fell 6 per cent on the London Stock Exchange on the back of Glencore's savage sell-off.\nRival miner Rio Tinto also plunged early, falling 5 per cent to $46.33, its lowest in six years.\nThe miners' falls pushed the ASX back down below 5000 on Tuesday morning, reversing a strong 1.4 per cent rally on Monday.\nLondon-based Glencore's shares came under fresh pressure on Monday after British-based investment bank Investec warned if commodity prices remained at their present levels, with benchmark iron ore prices sitting at $US56.60 a tonne, the shares of Glencore and Anglo American could become almost worthless.\nThat assessment drove investors to extend Glencore's share price fall, which has now wiped three-quarters, or $US14 billion, from the company's value.\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned with the ability of the company, led by chief executive Ivan Glasenberg, to execute its $US10 billion debt-reduction plan amid weak demand for commodities from China. The company is struggling under the weight of $US30 billion of debt.\n IG market strategist Evan Lucas said asset sale deals of the magnitude planned by Glencore usually moved \"at a snail's pace\".\n\"In the meantime, the market is moving so rapidly, wiping off huge swaths of asset value. By the time these deals are done, Glencore's credit rating could be junk status,\" he said.\n\"Glencore also has a trading desk business and it must be receiving the most ginormous margin calls now, that's got to be putting more pressure on its balance sheet.\"\nHe described the takeover bid of larger rival Rio Tinto as \"extremely risky in hindsight\".\n\"The Glencore story is quite unbelievable\".\nInvestec said the challenging environment for mining companies lead it to question how much value would be left for equity holders if commodity prices did not improve.\n\"At current spot prices, all else being the same, Glencore's equity value is zero,\" it said.\nDemand for commodities had been weaker than was expected at the start of the year, and most commodity markets were sitting in surplus, UBS commodities analyst Daniel Morgan said.\n\"The mining industry as a whole is in a pretty dark place.\"\nBHP and Rio were better placed than others, Mr Morgan said.\n\"Their strategies have always been focus on the tier one assets, which means they're at the low end of cost curves in the industries they operate.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/glencore-shares-routed-amid-debt-concerns-20150928-gjwuno.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/1443486807067", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/glencores-true-value-after-stock-hammering-has-analysts-guessing-20150928-gjwypn.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-its-the-pits-for-miners-20150928-gjwxhr.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T08:09:04.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
