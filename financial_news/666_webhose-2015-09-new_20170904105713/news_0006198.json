Automakers consider these “end of summer” deals and, with a few weeks left to go in Post-Labor Day summer, there are still a lot of deals to be had. \nWhat's always most helpful to automobile bargain hunters is the fact that automakers always redesign or refresh a few models as the model year changes. As the folks at automotive pricing site Edmunds.com note, that provides dealers added urgency to those newly obsolete vehicles before the all-new models fill their lots.
