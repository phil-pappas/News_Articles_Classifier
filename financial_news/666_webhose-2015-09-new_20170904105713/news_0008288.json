Fairfax Art and Design by Claude Walker With increasing computing power and connectivity, much of our most valuable property is now stored on computers or computer servers, hypothetically accessible by just about anyone with an internet connection. Everything from banking passwords to private photos are potentially at risk.\nThat creates significant demand for the services of cyber security firm FireEye. And, as a result, the $US5.6 billion company is fast gaining traction as an important cyber security partner for corporations all around the world.\nFireEye has what's known as 'proprietary virtual machine technology' that it uses to protect customers' networks against external threats. The technology is more sophisticated than traditional security systems because it attempts to simulate an operating system such as Windows or OS X to get malicious code to activate within the virtual machine, rather than within the customer's actual network.\nThis is particularly useful because it can identify previously unknown threats. In contrast, traditional security systems only scan for known threats, and are only fully effective when constantly updated. More than a few privacy breaches have occurred simply because a cyber security system was not updated quickly enough.\nA virtuous cycle FireEye's devices are made more effective when combined with FireEye's Dynamic Threat Intelligence cloud. This is a required subscription for customers. It uses data gathered around the world from FireEye machines to keep systems up to date and provide alerts of ongoing threats in real time.\nThis creates a network effect, which is an important source of competitive advantage. That's because each additional FireEye customer adds more data points, which in turn makes the cloud more valuable, which makes FireEye's system even more appealing for new customers, and so on.\nFinally, FireEye also offers additional service and protection to customers by providing subscription monitoring of the customer's systems 24/7. Should FireEye detect suspicious activity or an intrusion into the network, its experts will immediately assemble a report on who, what, when, and how. FireEye can then contain the compromised system and send a cyber-forensic team to investigate the incident and determine what steps need to be taken to resolve the issue.\n The most obvious risk to FireEye is that things can change quickly in IT. Should hackers begin to routinely find ways to thwart FireEye's technology and evade detection, the company could face serious reputational risk, which would come at the cost of new and existing customers. There's also no shortage of deep-pocketed competition, so any shortcomings could cost the company customers.\nAnd recent news isn't all positive. In late July, the company's CFO announced his departure, and FireEye vulnerabilities have been disclosed publicly by researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen, who claimed he had known about the problems for more than 18 months. Furthermore, FireEye has also copped criticism for using an injunction to stop another research organisation, ERNW, from exposing other vulnerabilities.\nCyber security is certainly in focus for investors at the moment. Recent reports may not justify recent falls in FireEye's share price, which is down 25 per cent since the beginning of August. It is certainly aiming to reach the top, and if it does, the upside for investors is significant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:48:25.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
