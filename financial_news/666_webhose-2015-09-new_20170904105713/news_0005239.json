Wilson, said that business leaders who \"are always expanding their perspective and what they know — and have that natural curiosity — are the people that are going to be successful.\"\nWelcome to the era of the curious leader, where success may be less about having all the answers and more about questioning. As Dell noted, curiosity inspires leaders to seek out the fresh ideas and approaches needed to stay ahead of competitors.\nInspiring creativity A curious, inquisitive leader also can set an example that inspires creative thinking throughout the company, according to Hollywood producer Brian Grazer. \"If you're the boss, and you manage by asking questions, you're laying the foundation for the culture of your company or your group,\" Grazer writes in his book, \"A Curious Mind.\" Grazer and others maintain that leading-by-curiosity can help generate more ideas from all areas of an organisation, while also helping to raise employee engagement levels.\nThe notion that curiosity can be good for business is hardly new. Decades ago, Walt Disney declared that his company managed to keep innovating \"because we're curious, and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.\" That desire to keep exploring \"new paths\" is even more important in today's innovation-driven marketplace.\nIn researching my book, I found many entrepreneurs and innovators — including Netflix's Reed Hastings, Square's Jack Dorsey and the team behind Airbnb — who relied on curiosity as a starting point to reinventing entire industries. Dorsey, for example, was puzzled when an artist friend lost a big sale to a potential customer simply because the artist couldn't accept a credit card. Dorsey wondered why only established businesses, and not smaller entrepreneurs, were able to conduct credit card transactions; his search for an answer resulted in Square, a more accessible credit card reader.\nSelf-disruption Curiosity also plays an important role at more established companies, where leaders are contending with disruptive change in the marketplace. \"These days, a leader's primary occupation must be to discover the future,\" Panera Bread chief executive Ron Shaich told me. It's \"a continual search,\" Shaich says, requiring that today's leader keep exploring new ideas — including ideas from other industries or even from outside the business world.\nAn emphasis on curiosity may require a change in leadership style. In many cases, managers and top executives have risen through the ranks by providing fixes and solutions, not by asking questions. And once they've attained a position of leadership, they may feel the need to project expertise.\nTo acknowledge uncertainty carries a risk: The leader may be perceived as lacking knowledge. In their book \"The Innovator's DNA,\" authors Clayton Christensen, Hal Gregersen and Jeff Dyer observed that curious, questioning leaders seemed to overcome this risk because they were humble enough to admit that they didn't have all the answers, and confident enough to say so in front of their employees.\nWhile we may think of curiosity as a hardwired personality trait, it's actually \"more of a state than a trait,\" according to Ian Leslie, author of the book \"Curious.\" We all have the potential to be curious, given the right conditions.\nFresh ideas Leslie notes that curiosity seems to bubble up when we are exposed to new information and want to know more. Hence, a leader should seek out new influences, ideas and experiences that may stoke the desire to dig deeper.\nEven when operating within familiar confines, curious leaders tend to try to see things from a fresh perspective. Such leaders have a penchant for bringing a \"beginner's mind\" approach to old problems and stubborn challenges. They continually examine and reexamine their own assumptions and practices, asking deep, penetrating \"Why\" questions, as well as speculative \"What if\" and \"How\" questions.\nSuch leaders sometimes urge employees to \"question everything.\" This can serve to model the behaviour for others, though leaders may have to go much further — providing sufficient freedom and incentives — in order to actually create the conditions for curiosity to flourish company-wide.\n\"With curiosity comes learning and new ideas,\" says Dell. \"If you're not doing that, you're going to have a real problem.\"\nWarren Berger is author of the new book \"A More Beautiful Question: The Power of Inquiry to Spark Breakthrough Ideas.\"\n© 2015 The New York Times News Service", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:08:58.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
