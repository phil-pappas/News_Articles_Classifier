He is a federal employee. I’m self-employed in real estate and other consulting gigs. Hubby has $283,000 in the Thrift Savings Plan. He has the money in the C fund right now but can easily move it around online when the markets get shaky. The C fund is the one that invests in the S&P 500, all stocks. He stays on top of it and follows the financial news.\nWe also have around $164,000 with a large brokerage firm — $50,000 in my husband’s Roth, $67,000 in my Roth and $47,000 in a traditional IRA.\nWe are putting the max in the Thrift Savings Plan — 15 percent — which comes out to around $13,700 a year. We occasionally put money into our brokerage Roth accounts. For 2014, I think we contributed $2,400 each. Not much. The traditional IRA gets no contributions. I have been self-employed for a decade, so that IRA is just rollovers from earlier jobs, including some when I was in my 20s.\nWe are considering moving all of our brokerage accounts over to the Thrift Savings Plan. Putting all of our eggs in one basket makes me very nervous, so we want your input.\nOur brokerage people are lovely, but they aren’t on top of our account at all. My parents have a huge amount of money with them, so their adult children are given some sort of “family plan” discount. I think our account is free, but it also means they don’t monitor it or service us very well.\nC.O., Austin\nMajor brokerage firms encourage their brokers to focus on large accounts, generally at least $250,000 and usually $500,000 and up, so your brokers are playing “the main event,” which is your parents’ account. In any case, there is no reason not to move all of your eligible accounts to the Thrift Savings Plan. By doing so, you’ll reduce costs to the lowest possible level — 2.9 basis points or 2.9 hundredths of 1 percent.\nBut you can’t move your accounts there, only your husband’s. The alternative is to move your accounts to low-cost accounts at discount brokerage firms.\nWithout knowing what your brokerage accounts are invested in, I can’t tell you how much you’ll save every year, but it will most likely be 1 to 1.5 percent a year, perhaps more.\nThere is no reason to be concerned about consolidating accounts for your husband. Nor should you have any concern about moving your accounts to one of the major low-cost platforms such as Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab. At each of those firms, you can find a way to virtually duplicate asset class offerings of the Thrift Savings Plan but at a slightly higher expense, about 7 to 10 basis points.\nBut don’t worry about the higher costs. As I see it, the big journey is the one from losing 2 percent a year (200 basis points) in fees to about 20 basis points. Paying attention to cutting the big cost will change your retirement for the better. Obsessing over getting from 20 basis points to the 3 basis points of the Thrift Savings Plan won’t be very productive.\nI’m retired and will be 70 in September 2016. How do I avoid taking two required minimum distributions in one year?\nThe IRS required minimum distribution worksheet says the first RMD is the year I turn 701/2. That will be March 2017, with the RMD to be done by April 1 of the following year, which will be 2018, based on the IRA balance at the end of the previous year. Since I’ll be 71 in September 2017, this appears to require two RMDs in one year. Am I reading this correctly?\nIf I take my first required minimum distribution the year I turn 70 (2016), would I just take one the year I turn 71 (2017)?\nH.M., Chicago\nYes, you are reading the (contorted) regulations correctly. That’s why you should take your first distribution next year, 2016, when you are 70 and another the following year, 2017, when you turn 71. If your other sources of income in both years will be the same, it’s good to spread the distributions over two different years.\nIf you have good estimates of your sources of other income in both years, it may be worthwhile to ask a tax preparer to figure out the best choice. Most financial service firms also offer help with required minimum distribution decisions.\nFollow Scott Burns on Twitter at @assetbuilder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T14:20:01.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
