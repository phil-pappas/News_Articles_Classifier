The company’s decision to stick with its own operating system hasn’t really paid off, with competitors like Samsung, Apple, Motorola taking away most of its tiny market share. The OS doesn’t come with the kind of customizations that Android offers, nor it has millions of apps like other rival platforms. And it looks like Blackberry has finally accepted defeat, well to a certain extent as numerous leaks are cropping up online about a new Blackberry Venice handset that reportedly runs on Android platform. \nThis would make the Venice, the first Android smartphone from Blackberry. Up till now, the company focused on its own software, mainly due to its special concern for privacy and security. But now, the company seems to be ready to release its first Android powered device in the market. Sponsored Links \nThe Blackberry Venice will be an interesting device, which will combine the power of a touchscreen with a physical keyboard. The company has always insisted on using a physical keyboard for the best typing experience. In fact, the company’s smartphones were known for their QWERTY keyboards. Venice aims to combine the best of both the worlds with a hybrid touchscreen plus physical keyboard combination. This is not the first time the company is trying the combination, but it might just work considering that it runs on the world’s most popular mobile operating system, Android. \nAnother interesting aspect of the Venice, revealed by leaked images is its dual edged display. Like the Galaxy S6 edge, the phone will reportedly feature a 5.4-inch dual edged screen. Below the phone will be a slider keyboard for those who like to write the traditional way. A previous leaked had confirmed that there will be an on-screen keyboard as well, ideal for taking quick notes. But for something heavier, like typing a mail, the slider keyboard underneath might come in handy. \nAs for the specs, the Blackberry Venice is expected to feature a 5.4-inch QHD display, with Snapdragon 808 hexa-core chip under the hood clocked at 1.8GHz. The company is apparently trying to target the high-end market by equipping the phone with 3GB RAM, 18MP rear camera, and a 5MP front facing camera. \nAccording to leaks, the Blackberry Venice will hit the US shores via all four major US carriers. The phone will particularly focus on security and stability, something that hasn’t been the strong point of Android. So, Blackberry could offer its users something high-end at a decent price with a fully secured Android operating system with the Venice.
