The government forecasts the economy to grow 3.3 percent this year -- more than twice the average growth rate forecast for eurozone countries (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:35:49.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
