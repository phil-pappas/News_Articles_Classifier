At Chatswood Interchange, there is a queue of people wanting to join the buzz of noisy diners in the Michelin-starred Tim Ho Wan dim sum restaurant.\nTim Ho Wan is in The District dining precinct that forms part of the Chatswood Interchange shopping centre.\nThe District features culinary firsts for Australia and is becoming a food destination for Sydney's north shore.\nThe food offer on the podium level is one element in the successful leasing of 9943 square metres across four floors and the selling of the 553 apartments in three residential towers above.\nAdvertisement A clear, strategic vision to leverage the significant transport hub has been vital.\nEvery major mixed-use project is different: location, site dynamics, access, demographics of the trade area, competing offers and people movements all have to be thoroughly understood.\nWhile food is the lead offer at Chatswood Interchange, at Double Bay's mixed-use Kiaora Place, medical services – including a day hospital – have taken 1900 square metres of space, creating a new medical hub for the eastern suburbs.\nThe mix changes to suit the community's needs.\nThe challenge for planners and developers is the sheer volume of mixed-use developments coming online in Sydney in the next five years.\nUrbanGrowth NSW is asking for mixed-use urban centres to be created around the eight new stations on the Sydney Metro Northwest.\nMajor mixed-use developments are planned in the Parramatta CBD, St Leonards, Homebush Bay, Mascot and Zetland.\nWe, as a city, and the developers taking the risk on these mixed-use projects, cannot fall into the trap of poor planning and mediocrity, where ground-floor retail is led by a convenience store and the community amenities are limited to a dry cleaner and massage shop.\nDevelopers need to put as much energy into planning the tenancy mix as they do any other aspect of a development.\nDetailed retail planning needs to happen in close consultation with the project architect well before a development application is lodged, so the needs of future tenants are built into the project.\nIf a restaurant needs exhaust, waste, high power requirements, access to cool storage and plans to open for a late night crowd, this can't be retrofitted into a space pencilled in for retail under a 10-storey building.\nWe need to start with the end user in mind. That means the people who will shop, dine and use the services for the next 30 years.\nThis approach will create long-term value for all stakeholders.\nAdam Sheumack​ is the managing director of Rook Salinger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:19:11.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
