Additionally, it also has a very attractive tax rate,\" Mr Beaven said. The Singapore operatons were 64 per cent-owned by the Australian unit, and were, therefore, also subject to Australian taxes, he said. \nBHP pays tax at an average rate of 32.5 per cent in Australia, but pays zero tax on its marketing operations in Singapore. \nLast week, the federal government introduced draft laws to target tax avoidance by big international companies. However, the move comes just a month ahead of the findings from a broader action plan under the OECD/G20 base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. \nBHP supports reform on BEPS, but believes this should only come through a multilateral effort, Mr Beaven said. \n\"If there is clumsy, unilateral action, it could end up in a very chaotic and competitive situation. You could have a situation where we have to pay tax twice,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook BHP says it's paying a fair share of taxes AAP \nBHP Billiton has defended the use of a Singapore marketing hub to minimise its tax payments, saying most of its â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T07:03:16.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
