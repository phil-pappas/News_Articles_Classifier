Focusing on what hedge funds are, how they affect modern society and where they are expected to move in the future, the segment will explore the ins and outs of one of the world’s largest industries. With more than $2.7 trillion in assets under management, the global hedge fund industry is one of the most influential in the world. Hedge fund managers directly support economic growth with their investment choices and provide reliable income for many of the world’s wealthiest individuals.\nBut today’s hedge fund industry is one in flux. Stock market volatility is at an all-time high, potentially dragging down yields and manager flexibility. At the same time, new strategies are emerging that give mom-and-pop investors the opportunity to access the previously-exclusive hedge fund space.\nThe program will examine how the industry got to this point and the ways it can be expected to evolve going forward.\n\"Voices In America\" is an independent production that is distributed to Public Television Stations across the nation for airing at their discretion. It is not a production of APT or PBS, and is not affiliated with those organizations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:06:15.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
