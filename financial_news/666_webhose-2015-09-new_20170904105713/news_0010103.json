(For more data on Iceland's capacity, see )\nFIVE QUINTILLION BYTES\nThese days, anything anyone does on a computer generates reams of data, or to be precise 5 quintillion - add 18 zeros - bytes globally per day with little stored on a PC or laptop.\nBut the storage of someone's emails from 2003 requires a very different service than retrieving NASA's processing of New Horizons's data from near Pluto some 4.7 billion miles away.\nProcessing on this scale is called high performance computing, the most power-hungry kind. It is this kind of data storage that Iceland is best suited for, analysts said.\n\"It's a big problem for a lot of commercial customers and some universities who run high performance computer environments in Europe because the advanced computers are becoming so big and so energy hungry,\" said Giorgio Nebuloni, associate research director at U.S. advisory firm International Data Corporation.\nBMW requires huge amount of power for processing data: the smallest change to a wing mirror will change the aerodynamics of an entire car so \"they don't care if it takes the data hours to come back to Germany\", Nebuloni told Reuters.\nBut that is one of Iceland's drawbacks -- its remoteness means some types of data operations are ill-suited for the island such as high frequency trading, famous for such speed that data centres need to be located within a block of operations.\nAnd Iceland has yet to attract Apple, which has centres in Denmark and Ireland, Google, which opted for Finland, or Facebook, whose centres are in Sweden.\nNone wished to comment on the location of future data centres, citing privacy and security reasons, while data centre operators are equally secretive about their clients. Microsoft says its deliberations on centre locations include 35 weighted criteria.\nINCENTIVES\nWhile analysts suggest remoteness as well as a small workforce could be behind Iceland's failure to attract big names for now, Invest in Iceland's Tomasson has a different theory.\n\"I think this is a game of incentives. Many countries are giving incentives to companies who decide to locate in the area,\" he said.\nDanish finance paper Borsen, for example, reported earlier this year how the Danish tax authorities and foreign ministry highlighted tax incentives and how to use them to Apple before its decision to place a centre in Viborg in Denmark.\nMicrosoft meanwhile said it would build a $250 million data centre in Finland, a promise which the government said would reflect good corporate responsibility after the tech giant cut thousands of jobs from Nokia's former mobile phone business.\nIn June the Icelandic parliament agreed to offer investors in the country incentives that include a profit tax cut to 15 percent from 20 percent, a 50 percent real estate tax relief and to let companies depreciate assets completely.\n\"I think these new incentives are going to absolutely help us,\" Tomasson said.\nFor its part, Denmark plans to lower its corporate tax rate to 22 percent by 2016, and offer expat workers a reduced income tax of 26 percent for up to five years.\nData privacy is also becoming increasingly important to businesses, as underscored by the theft and release of details, including sexual fantasies, of people signed up to the Ashley Madison website which facilitates marital affairs.\nIn Iceland, privacy protection and transparency about how data is used has become a big issue since the grass-roots Pirate Party, with links to Wikileaks, became a top political force.\n\"Countries with restrictive data privacy regimes, such as Iceland, may be initially challenging to operate in from a regulatory point of view, but the data protection measures offered are highly attractive to customers who wish to maintain control over who has access to their data,\" Christopher Sherman, analyst with research firm Forrester, told Reuters.\nAnalysts say building data centres is a big decision and it is commonplace for options to be deliberated for 5 years, so Iceland has a good chance of becoming the go-to place.\n\"I think there is certainly an opportunity (for Iceland) - especially for workloads such as technical computing, high performance computing and lightweight consumer Web applications,\" International Data Corporation's Nebuloni said.
