Photo: GAZi Photography\nSimone Campbell, the wife of embattled former Fiat Chrysler Australia boss Clyde Campbell, has been accused of receiving more than $620,000 of secret \"kickbacks\" from contracts and deals signed by her husband and his successor at the car company, former managing director Veronica Johns.\nIn a hearing before the Federal Court on Friday, it was also revealed that Fiat Chrysler has gained access to Mr Campbell's emails. Those emails are believed to include exchanges between Mr Campbell and soccer star Harry Kewell, detailing secret negotiations over Kewell's $1 million-a-year contract with the car company.\nIn May, Fairfax Media revealed that Mr Campbell had been accused of misappropriating and misusing more than $30 million of company money, and had funded an extravagant lifestyle for his family and business associates. It is alleged that cars, boats, planes and luxury holidays had all been purchased with company funds.\nSimone Campbell, the wife of former Fiat Chrysler Australia boss Clyde Campbell, has been accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks.\nOn Friday, Justice Jonathan Beach was told that Mrs Campbell had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from contracts signed by the car company with suppliers.\nAdvertisement A shelf company called \"ACN 124\" – of which Mrs Campbell is the sole shareholder – received $622,170 in such kickbacks. Mrs Campbell, until recently a lawyer with the global firm Baker & McKenzie, allegedly invoiced companies called Dealer Drive and Superstring for \"royalties and consulting advice\" and \"marketing services\" supplied by ACN 124.\nFiat Chrysler now claims its contracts with Dealer Drive, Superstring and third company called Motortrak were \"uncommercial\" and designed to benefit Mrs Campbell and her husband.\nClyde Campbell. Photo: Jesse Marlow\n\"Mrs Campbell, we say, received kickbacks,\" said Phillip Crutchfield, QC, representing Fiat Chrysler. \"She had an interest in dealings and contracts between Fiat Chrysler and [suppliers]\".\nJames Peters, QC, representing Mr Campbell, claimed the deals were legitimate, had been approved by Fiat Chrysler management and the company was \"trying to drag Mr Campbell in after the event\" because it now wanted to get out of those deals.\nJustice Beach ordered that Veronica Johns, who succeeded Clyde Campbell as managing director, be joined as second respondent to the proceedings. He also ordered that Mr and Mrs Campbell hand over details of transactions from two Commonwealth Bank accounts.\nThe matter is due to be heard next on November 19. The trial is expected to take place next year and last more than three weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:09:03.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
