With the Renault Kwid the carmaker has been able to feel the pulse of buyers and deliver what they want and that too at a compelling price. The arrival of Renault Kwid is threatening to upstage the norms and trends of the small car segment and raise expectations of consumers. The million dollar, in fact much, much, more, question is whether Renault Kwid will allow the French carmaker into the common Indian homes and hearts, the way the Duster gave it an entry into the upper middle class ones. If that happens, Renault will ride easy in India for a long time. Renault Kwid launch date is expected to be around 15th of October which means there are only 3 weeks to go before the highly anticipated small car is out there for the world to see. Further, Renault Kwid bookings are already open via a new mobile app .\nWe take look here at the top 5 standout points about the car:\n1. Price: The extremely affordable price tag of Renault Kwid is what is going to give the French automaker an edge over the others with its starting variant being available at around Rs.3 lacs. This an extremely competitive price tag which will certainly outdo the likes of Hyundai Eon, Maruti Alto 800 and Datsun Go which are some of the most formidable names in the small car segment at the moment.\n2. Looks: Renault Kwid is a stunner, especially considering the price range in which it falls and therefore, looks head and shoulders better than any of its competitors.\n3. Engine: Under the hood too Renault Kwid has a very powerful set of specs with an 800cc engine that churns out 54bhp power along with 74Nm torque which is always going to be more than reasonable figures for the class.\n4. Interior: There are a lot of features inside the cabin that would appeal to customers including a touchscreen infotainment system which would make Renault Kwid the first in its class to offer this package. There would also be air conditioning controls and a digital instrument cluster that looks quite sporty and spunky. There are plenty of accessories as well for the users to choose from that would add to the external and internal aesthetics of the car.\nOnly the coming months will tell how much of an impact Renault Kwid can make but on paper, the vehicle surely seems like it is going to turn things upside down and consumers will certainly rejoice in that chaos.\n 29, 2015 6:00 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.cardekho.com/carmodels/Renault/Renault_KWID"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:08:08.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
