More Boardroom trades, September 12 \nShares in the German company dropped 20 per cent on Monday and the same again on Tuesday as a scandal emerged over revelations that it used software to deceive regulators about emissions from its diesel vehicles. \nOnly two equity funds show exposure to VW above one per cent — Smith & Williamson’s European Equity fund, which holds four per cent in the stock, and Man GLG’s European Alpha Alternative, which holds 2.1 per cent, according to figures from FE Analytics. \nEuropean growth funds show lower than index-level exposure to carmakers on average, while European large-cap funds show index-level exposure, said Muna Abu-Habsa, senior manager researcher at Morningstar. \n“The average [exposure to automakers] used to be much higher but for growth funds it has been falling since 2011. Some value managers dipped into the sector over the past year, but they have been taking profits in recent months,” said Ms Abu-Habsa. \n“It has been out of favour because of an expected fall in Chinese demand.” \nEconomic growth in China , where automakers can sell at high margins, has been slowing while stocks there have been volatile since July, worrying international investors and spreading gloom to other emerging markets.
