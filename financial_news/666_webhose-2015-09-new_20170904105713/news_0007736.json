The Company retains the flexibility to adjust the relative proportions of the Notes and Shares offered in the Combined Offering. \nThe Shares and the Notes will be offered pursuant to an effective registration statement (the \"Registration Statement\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). \nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Combined Offering to pre-fund potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Pending such use, the Company expects that the borrowings under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will be temporarily reduced with the proceeds of the Combined Offering. \nThe Notes will have a maturity of three years, will be issued at 100% of the principal amount and will be mandatorily exchanged for ordinary shares of the Company (the \"Exchange Shares\") at the maturity of the Notes unless earlier converted at the option of the holders or Weatherford Bermuda or upon certain specified events in accordance with the terms of the Notes. The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company on an unsecured, subordinated basis. The interest rate, exchange rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the Notes offering. \nUnder the terms of the Combined Offering, there will be a 60-day lock-up period for the Company on issuances or sales of ordinary shares of the Company and securities that give the holder the right to acquire ordinary shares of the Company. Weatherford Bermuda will apply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"). \nCitigroup and Wells Fargo Securities will serve as joint book runners of the Combined Offering. \nThe offering of each of the Shares and the Notes are being made by means of a separate prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus as filed with the SEC. When available, copies of the preliminary prospectus supplements and accompanying base prospectus relating to each offering may be obtained free of charge on the Sc's website at www.sec.gov under the Company's name or from the underwriters of the offering as follows: \nCitigroup \nc/o Broad ridge Financial Solutions \n1155 Long Island Avenue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:44:52.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
