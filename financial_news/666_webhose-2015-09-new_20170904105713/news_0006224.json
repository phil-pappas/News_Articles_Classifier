The data showed the surplus stood nearly quadrupled to 4.25 billion euros versus 1.27 billion euros in July 2014. Tourism revenues rose slightly to 2.87 billion euros from 2.77 billion euros in the same month last year. Last year Greece posted a current account surplus of 1.66 billion euros, up from 1.09 billion euros in 2013, helped by higher tourism revenues - its biggest foreign currency earner.
