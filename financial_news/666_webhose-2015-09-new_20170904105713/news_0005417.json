At 0915 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.1%, France's CAC 40 was 0.2% higher and Germany's DAX was up 0.5%. \nGerman business confidence unexpectedly improved in September, hitting its highest level in four months, according to a report released by the German research institute Ifo. \nThe business climate index rose to a seasonally-adjusted 108.5 from 108.4 in August, ahead of expectations for a reading of 108. \nThe business expectations index increased to 103.3 from 102.2 and better than estimates of 101.5. \nThe current assessment index, however, fell to 114 in September from 114.8 in August, missing expectations for a reading of 114.7. \nOn the corporate front, shares in Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) were up for a second day in a row, gaining nearly 5% after the company's chief executive Michael Winterkorn announced his resignation on Wednesday. A successor is expected to be chosen at a meeting on Friday. \nHennes & Mauritz slipped into the red after the Swedish clothing retailer said its third-quarter profit was hit by dollar strength. \nMonte dei Paschi (Milan: BMPS.MI - news ) di Siena was firmly on the front foot after it settled with Nomura over a derivative trade called \"Alexandria\" that hit the bank's profits. \nIn London, shares in tour operator Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) rose sharply after saying 2015 summer holidays were 91% sold, in line with expectations and at the same level as 2014. \nClothing retailer Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) was a top performer after Nomura upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral'. \nStill to come on the macro calendar, US durable goods orders and initial jobless claims are at 1330 BST, while new home sales are at 1500 BST. Investors will also eye a speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen at 2200 BST. \n\"With it still being very much unclear if and when the Fed will finally pull the trigger and hike rates any major economic data releases are likely to be closely watched for the time being,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \n\"Concerning Yellen's speech tonight it is expected that she will pretty much talk along the same lines as during the FOMC press conference showing no immediate urge to raise rates but ready to do so when needed. Of particular interest will be the Q&A following afterwards which might shed a bit more light on if a rate hike for October is really an option or if December or even 2016 are much more likely.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:04:01.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
