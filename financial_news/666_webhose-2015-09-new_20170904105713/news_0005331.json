Share on twitter by Robert Harley Large format retailers are on the expansion trail as the housing boom flows on to homewares.\nCBRE's Australian head of large format retail, Chris Parry, said retailers who had a strong network in one or more states were actively seeking to expand their national footprint, with a particular focus on the eastern seaboard.\n\"Stronger trading conditions are supporting this push, with national household goods sales having performed exceptionally well, increasing by 8.6 per cent over the 12 months to May 2015,\" he said.\nMr Parry said the demand had improved occupancy in large format outlets, particularly in Sydney, where CBRE says the vacancy rate has fallen from 17 per cent two years ago to less than 4 per cent in June.\nDarren Holland, the chief executive of Aventus Property, the nation's largest portfolio of large format retail outlets, has also noticed the expansion activity.\nAventus, which controls 14 centres, has recently done a three-location deal with Nick Scali to help itexpand into Western Australia.\nQueensland-based Pillow Talk, which has five outlets in Aventus properties in Queensland and NSW, has recently opened in the group's Cranbourne asset.\nPillow Talk has also secured Victorian sites at Shepparton, Mentone and Bendigo.\n The moves come at a good time for Aventus, which will undertake the book build for its IPO on Wednesday and expects to raise about $300 million for what will be a $900 million real estate investment trust.\nMr Parry said CBRE had facilitated a range of recent interstate moves, with Victorian large format retailer Provincial Home Living taking its first South Australian store at Mile End and a NSW store at Albury before more moving into Sydney at the Homebush DFO.\nAnother expanding retailer, Focus on Furniture, which last year opened in South Australia, is now seeking further opportunities in metropolitan NSW.\nKitchen Warehouse, with seven stores on the west coast, has just committed to its first Queensland store and is looking for further east coast opportunities.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:11:59.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
