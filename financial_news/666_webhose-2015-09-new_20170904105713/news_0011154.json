And, the initial estimate of vehicles thought to be affected proved inflated because of the way certain cars are equipped. \nTakata, a Japanese auto supplier, had said it installed almost 34 million inflaters that can potentially rupture and cause injury especially when exposed to heat and humidity for a prolonged period. Because four million affected vehicles have defective inflaters on both the passenger and driver sides, it was inaccurate to attach such a high estimate to the number of vehicles needing to be recalled and fixed, the official said on a conference call. \nNHTSA now estimates the number of defective inflaters installed in U.S. vehicles totals 23.4 million. The estimate will continue to fluctuate throughout the recall process, said the official, who asked not to be identified by name. The Takata recall is expected to take a significant amount of time to complete because new inflaters need to be made and consumers often ignore recall notices.

GM -2.72 % recall of faulty ignition switches and heightened concerns about vehicle safety and NHTSA’s ability to regulate auto makers. \nNearly every major auto maker had installed Takata air bags with the flawed inflaters. Honda Motor Co. HMC -4.00 % has been disproportionately affected because of its long and deep relationship with the supplier. \nInjuries and fatalities attributed to the air bag inflaters have been high profile, attracting the attention of U.S. lawmakers, drivers and regulators. Takata, much like GM, has been called to testify to congressional committees. \nThe inflaters have been linked to eight deaths world-wide and more than 100 injuries. \nNHTSA said roughly 4.4 million inflaters have been replaced to date, but some of those have been fixed with interim solutions and may need to be replaced again. \nNHTSA officials are conducting extensive public outreach to inform drivers of the safety issue with the inflaters, and plans to hold an event early this fall to further explain its process for ensuring affected consumers have their vehicles fixed. \nThe official said the rate of failure of the air bag inflaters varied significantly depending on the type of vehicle and the market where it was sold. Vehicles sold in Florida, for example, appear to be particularly susceptible to the defect, which typically shows itself between 7.5 and 12 years after a vehicle is first sold. \nSeparately, the official said NHTSA has received responses from Volkswagen AG VLKAY -2.93 % and Takata regarding a separate issue regarding the failure of a side-air bag inflater in June on a Tiguan sport-utility vehicle. But he said the agency it had nothing to immediately report from its review. \nThe NHTSA official said GM also had identified a side-air-bag defect involving a part similar to the one that failed in the Volkswagen as a part of its quality testing, and had recalled affected GM vehicles in Asia and the Middle East. None of the affected GM vehicles were sold in the U.S., the NHTSA official said. \nWrite to Gautham Nagesh at gautham.nagesh@wsj.com Save Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:10:16.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
