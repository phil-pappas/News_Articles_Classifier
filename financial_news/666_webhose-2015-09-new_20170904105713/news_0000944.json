This set ticks all the right boxes when you want to consider a pair of good headphones.\nLet’s start with the design. The Move looks fantastic and feels fantastic. The black-and-gold colour with that slightly steampunk style is gorgeous. Wear it and you know you are not looking out of place, geeky, or like a kid. It’s just classy. The Move’s lightweight is perfectly complemented by soft, faux-leather memory foam as padding. Combine these two factors and it is comfortable to wear for as long as you want. The foam actually forms a decent seal around the ears to provide a bit of noise isolation – but these aren’t noise cancelling headphones and you shouldn’t expect that outdoors.\nThen there’s the simple connectivity and the buttons. On the right, you have the on/off switch and the micro USB charging port. Pair it up, it works like magic. You can even connect two devices at the same time, so you can be listening to stuff from your laptop and when a call comes in on your phone, that gets routed to your ears. Neat!\nThe left ear has the main buttons: the universal button, volume buttons, and media playback. But all of these functions are combined into just three buttons. The universal button will take calls or call your last dialed number with a double-tap. A single tap will play or pause your music. And a long press will activate Google Now or Siri.\nSimilarly, the volume up/down buttons will change the volume when you tap them. But long-press the plus button and the track skips forward; long-press the minus button and the track skips back. It takes no time to get used to this, and once you are used to it, it’s a great setup.\nAs for the sound quality itself, the Jabra Move is surprising. Even compared to more expensive headphones, the Move held its own remarkably well. The audio is balanced, whether you are listening to Western classical, hard rock, or modern Bollywood . Even with the volume cranked up to high (and it goes pretty high at that), there was no noticeable crackling. The bass isn’t as thumping as I would like, but really, no wireless headphones manage that.\nWhen taking calls, the Move’s microphone is among the better ones I have used. Not having to speak louder than normal to be heard is a boon in itself, but the audio quality while outdoors was really impressive too. Not many headphones can do this.\nYou would think that great design and good sound would mean a compromise on the battery front. You couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, this has the best battery among all the BT headphones I have tried. On continuous music playback, it lasted over 14 hours – and that’s while being connected to two devices all the time.\nAnd here’s the kicker: if you run out of battery, you can still continue listening to your music. Jabra has thrown in an optional standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Plug one end into the headphones and one into the port on your phone, and the Move becomes a standard wired headset. No battery needed. It’s just so useful.\nAdd it all together and the Jabra Move is the complete package. It’s completely worth it at its usual price of around Rs 5,000 but we have seen it drop to R3,300 a couple of times on Amazon , so you might want to wait it out and try to grab it when it’s ridiculously low.\n** Estimated street price: Rs 4,999\nFirst Published on September 24, 2015 12:04 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:16:37.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
