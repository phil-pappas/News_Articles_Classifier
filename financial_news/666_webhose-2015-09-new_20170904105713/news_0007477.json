Photo: James Brickwood\nTransfield Services will ask investors to approve a name change to Broadspectrum Limited at its annual meeting in October, after its founding family withdrew its rights to use the Transfield name earlier in 2015.\nThe name change comes as Transfield Holdings, a privately held company owned by the sons of Transfield's founder Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, seeks to distance itself from Transfield Services because of the controversy over the company's detention centre contracts on Nauru and Manus Island.\nTransfield Holdings owners Luca Belgiorno-Nettis and his brother Guido sold their 11.3 per cent stake in Transfield Services in 2014 for more than $90 million, after Luca was forced to step down as chairman of Sydney's Biennale arts festival.\nArtists opposed to Transfield Services' work at detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru had lobbied the Biennale board, making it difficult for Mr Belgiorno-Nettis to remain as chairman.\nAdvertisement Some of Transfield Services' investors have sold their shares in the company in 2015 because of concerns over alleged human rights abuse at the detention centres.\nTransfield Services chief executive Graeme Hunt said on Friday the name change had nothing to with the controversy over detention centres and instead was an \"unfortunate coincidence of events\".\nTransfield Services says the new name is \"a better representation\" of the company's business, which delivers a broad range of services across different sectors.\n'Rigorous reporting mechanisms' Mr Hunt said Transfield Services had \"rigorous reporting mechanisms\" to make sure alleged incidents of abuse at the detention centres were recorded and investigated.\nHe said reports of abuse had been \"manipulated\" to try to indicate that numbers were \"far worse than reality\".\n\"I'm proud of the work our people do,\" he said. \"It's very unfortunate they have been characterised by people who have nothing else in their mind than to try to unwind the policy and are not focused on any practical solutions or approach.\"\nThe company said on Friday claims of abuse made by the activist group GetUp and the No Business in Abuse group were \"a political attack directed at an Australian company undertaking work to fulfil a government policy that has bipartisan political support\".\nIt also released a letter to shareholders saying it was making \"a positive contribution to the lives of asylum seekers\" and that no charges had been laid against its employees in relation to any \"inappropriate incidents\".\nTransfield's existing contract with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection Services to run the centres on Nauru and Manus finishes at the end of October but it is the preferred bidder for a new five-year contract.\nMr Hunt declined to comment on whether the government's detention centre policies would be changed after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott as Prime Minister.\n\"The policy position of government is something that is not a matter for us,\" he said. \"Our job is to provide services to support the operations.\"\nTransfield Services, which will ask the Australian Securities Exchange to change its listing code to BRS from TSE, will hold its annual meeting on October 28.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150925/pdf/431kwydtlzgz8g.pdf", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150925/pdf/431kx0424rjmfn.pdf", "http://www.transfield.com.au/news/189-transfield-holdings-ends-trade-mark-agreement-with-transfield-services"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:29:55.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
