Titled ‘The Indian Traveller Manifesto’, the survey saw more than 20,000 participants from over 30 Indian cities and towns.\nSome of the top demands put forth by travellers are:\n– Wi-Fi hubs – 74 per cent\n– Better access to remote destinations – 55 per cent\n– Safe solo travel – 56 per cent\n– Right to clean trains – 83 per cent\n– Standard cab fares – 62 per cent\nHari Nair , founder and CEO, HolidayIQ said, “India has the most attractive tourism potential and some of the best places to visit. I firmly believe that any trip planning process is incomplete until the traveller is provided with the best experience. With the above key elements addressed, we can become one step closer to creating the perfect holiday experience for every Indian traveller.”\nKey highlights of the Indian Traveller Manifesto:\nWi-Fi hubs\nA relatively new entrant in the wishlist, 74 per cent travellers demand for Wi-Fi hubs. The smartphone revolution and popularity of travel apps has created a new era in travel. Today travellers expect to be able to use their mobile devices to access travel-related information, to simplify their journey and enhance their experience while on the move. Top three uses for wi-fi is travel research, maps / navigation and access to social media.\nBetter access to remote destinations\nAround 55 per cent travellers require better access to remote destinations. Travelling is about seeking the rare experiences on the planet. It is about finding those hidden nuggets, pristine paradises that may be known to the local residents. Travellers choose their own adventure/remote destination among the boundary-pushing getaways that don’t skimp on creature comforts. With the business of tourism helping conserve endangered flora, fauna, and in some cases, local culture; and new standards of luxury, travellers feel the necessity for better accessibility to remote destinations.\nDemand for safe solo travel\nA rising middle class with higher disposable incomes and a deep-rooted quest for something bigger, better, more interesting look forward to solo travel. While solo travel can be the ultimate in self-indulgence, the foremost concern of the solo or single traveller is safety. Without a companion, travellers are more vulnerable to criminals and scam artists with the result more travellers demand for safe travel.\nTravellers demand for clean trains\nWhere more is the need of the hour, it was noted that travellers are increasingly turning away from train journeys as compared to last year due to the hygiene aspects.\nTravellers demand for standard cab fares\nThe world shrinks into a ‘global village’ thanks to a surge in technology and travel options. As easy-to-use on-demand and sharing economy apps like Uber, Ola, Taxi for Sure and Meru make getting around and staying in new cities convenient, a new survey suggests that only the cream of travellers use and trust them.\n 25, 2015 3:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T08:22:55.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
