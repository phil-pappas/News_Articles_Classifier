About 71 percent of Metro Transit’s electrical usage in 2016 will go toward light rail operations. \nUnder a plan approved by the Metropolitan Council last week, Metro Transit will purchase energy produced by the new solar arrays from Solar City, a California-based solar provider with clients across the country. \nSolar City will pay for the equipment and its installation. Under the agreement, Metro Transit will purchase the electricity at a locked rate for 25 years. \nSolar arrays are on the rise in Minnesota. \nBy its latest count, the Minnesota Department of Commerce estimates the state has about 25 megawatts of solar capacity overall, said Ross Corson, communications director for the department. \nCorson said capacity stood at about 20 megawatts last fall. \nMetro Transit currently has 40-kilowatt solar arrays on a new park-and-ride facility at the northwest corner of Highway 610 and Noble Parkway in Brooklyn Park, and on a light rail support facility at Hiawatha Avenue and East 24th Street in Minneapolis. \nSeveral bus shelters also tap into solar power. \nMetro Transit estimates it saved about $22.5 million between 2009 and 2014 as a result of its overall conservation efforts, which include LED lighting and efficient HVAC systems in its buildings, and the use of hybrid buses. \nHybrids represent about 15 percent of the total bus fleet. \nThe new solar installations are planned for these buildings: Fred T. Heywood office building and garage, 560 Sixth Ave. N., Minneapolis; East Metro Transit facility, 800 Mississippi St., St. Paul; Nicollet Garage, 10 W. 32nd St., Minneapolis; South Garage, 2100 MTC Road, Bloomington; Overhaul Base, 515 N. Cleveland Ave., St. Paul, and Minneapolis Light Rail Operations and Maintenance facility, 1810 E.
