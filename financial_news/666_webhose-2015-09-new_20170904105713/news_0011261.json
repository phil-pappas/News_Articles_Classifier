But it was down from 47.8 in July. \nAugust thus marked the sixth, successive month in which the index came in below the 50-point mark, the dividing point between business growth and contraction among the companies surveyed. \nAccording to sub-indexes based on survey results, manufacturing output contracted at the sharpest rate in 45 months. Employment remained on a downward trend, too, as manufacturers continued to shed workers. \nThe Caixin China Services PMI also published Tuesday showed that Chinese service industry activities expanded in August but less quickly than in July. The index posted at 51.5, down from 53.8 in July. \nThe Caixin China Composite PMI, which covers both manufacturing and services, fell to 48.8 from July's 50.2, marking the first contraction in the rate which reflects overall business conditions since April 2014. \nThe latest data indicates that \"the expansion of services activities was not strong enough to offset the contraction in manufacturing,\" said Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group. \nHe also said the relative weakness of services sector growth was \"driven in part by a softer expansion in the financial services sector, caused to some extent by stock market fluctuations.\" China Factory PMI Falls to 47.3, Services to 51.5 August marked the sixth straight month of contraction for manufacturing, according to the Caixin index By staff reporter Wang Yuqian SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T11:45:24.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
