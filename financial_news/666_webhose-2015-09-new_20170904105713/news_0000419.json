The Plantation Labour Committee (PLC) meeting held last Saturday failed to to arrive at a consensus regarding wage hike. The plantations affected by the strike include Kannan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) in Munnar, estates of Harrisons Malayalam and state-run Aralam Farm in Kannur.\n“We are not in a position to afford any wage hike at the moment and demand for R500 per day is preposterous.The average increase in wages in the last 30 years during the tripartite agreement with three-year validity is in the range of 10-13%,” N Dharmaraj, President of UPASI said.\nDharmaraj, however, said that it was for the Association of Planters of Kerala, state government and the trade unions to take a final decision in this regard. He said basic minimum wage in plantations in the state is R232 per day. The total earning per day for worker is R382 per day when benefits such as PF, DA, social and medical costs are added, he told reporters.\nThe wage agreement in plantation sector in the state had expired in December 2014 and negotiations for a fresh wage pact have been going for the past few months, he said.\nHe added that the daily wage rate prevailing in Kerala cannot be compared with the wages in the plantation sector.\n“A daily wage earner in the state may earn more than R600 per day, but they don’t have permanent jobs. In plantation every worker is entitled for wages every day including holidays,” he explained.\n 30, 2015 12:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:31:11.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
