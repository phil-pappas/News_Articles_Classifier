They've responded to growing consumer expectation and confidence to transact online and on mobile, but also the important role branches and call centres play in account set-up and resolving issues. They’ve been much better at creating joined-up, multi-channel service propositions.” \nIncreased competition in banking , from challenger banks and the seven-day switching scheme , which lets customers change their lender in just one week, is pushing banks to improve their customer service. Likewise, price-comparison websites are encouraging switching in the utilities sector. \n“The regulators’ efforts to make switching quicker and the price-comparison sites making deals more transparent have certainly influenced the result but these make it harder for providers to build long-term customer relationships,” said Mr King. \n“Utility firms need to do more themselves, such as addressing complicated tariffs, being seen to pass on wholesale price drops to customers more quickly, and taking a more proactive stance on resolving customer issues.” \nAt the other end of the spectrum, leisure firms such as gym chains and cinemas are increasingly bad at keeping customers happy the sector’s score rose by seven percentage points. \nComplaints about the hotel and hospitality sector rose by five percentage points. \nHowever, just because their ratings have improved does not mean customers are cheering for banks and utilities just yet. \nOnly 12pc of customers said utilities firms offer the best experience of any sector, up from 11pc in 2014. And 23pc said banks were among the best sectors, down from 24pc a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:53:38.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
