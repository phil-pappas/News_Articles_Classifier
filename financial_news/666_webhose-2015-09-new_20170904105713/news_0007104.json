Starting on October 1, retailers are supposed to start accepting new chip-enabled credit cards. These \"EMV\" cards are less vulnerable to fraud than ones with a magnetic strip because each time you step up to the register, they churn out a one-time code that can't be used again if your credit card information falls into the wrong hands.To use these new cards, stores have to swap out their old machines where you swipe your card for new ones where you dip your card.The act of dipping your card is entirely different than swiping. The first (and only) time I was confronted with a newfangled machine at a store, I looked helplessly at the clerk for guidance on which way to insert my card. After a little more confusion and time than is typically involved at checkout, I was on my way.The problem is that a lot of stores aren't ready -- and neither are consumers. Only 27% of U.S. retailers will be ready to process the cards in time for the October 1 deadline, according to a recent survey by the Strawhecker Group. Meanwhile, fewer than 40% of credit cardholders have a chip-enabled credit card, according to a survey out Wednesday from CreditCards.com.It's up to credit card providers to send you a new card. Since this is something the banks have been working on since the October deadline was set nearly two years ago, you should have received one already. But if, like the majority of consumers, you haven't gotten one, keep your eyes out for one in the mail.It appears the banks may have prioritized new cards for some cardholders over others. According to the CreditCards.com survey, cardholders with an annual income over $75,000 are more than twice as likely to have one of the new credit cards than someone who makes less. Someone with a college degree is also twice as likely to have a new card, and people dwelling in cities or suburbs are more likely to have a new card than those in rural areas.So what do you do if you don't have one yet?\"Relax: No need to worry,\" says Matt Schulz, a senior analyst at CreditCards.com. \"All the new EMV terminals will still work with your old magnetic stripe card, so just be patient. Your new card should come by yearâ€™s end.\"However, even when all consumers have chip-enabled credit cards, it's unlikely every retailer will have the machinery needed to use them correctly.The rub for retailers is that it's not cheap to replace credit card machines. Some of the nation's biggest retailers, like [entity display=\"Target\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"target\" ticker=\"TGT\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4220\"]Target[/entity] and Wal-Mart, have invested in the upgrades. Meanwhile, small businesses have been the least likely to upgrade, according to the Strawhecker Group. The credit card police aren't going to bust down doors to make sure retailers have upgraded. However, after the deadline, retailers that haven't upgraded are liable for losses caused by credit card fraud. Previously the bank would have been liable.While this is an incentive for retailers to upgrade, it's not going to happen overnight. In the meantime, if you walk into a store with the old machines, know that you could be at more risk for credit card fraud.\"If you think about fraudsters, after October, they're going to have fewer and fewer stores they can bug and fewer and fewer cards they can steal,\" says NerdWallet credit card analyst Sean McQuay. \"That means those stores and those cards are going to become increasingly attractive to fraudsters.\" [tweet_Quote: display=\"After October 1, you'll be more at risk for credit card fraud at gas stations\"]Among the increasingly attractive destinations for fraud are gas stations[/tweet_Quote: ] , which don't have to upgrade their credit card machines until 2017.The takeaway: \"Consumers really should avoid swiping their card anywhere they can after October, because there's a much higher risk,\" says McQuay. \"If you think about a lake and it evaporated down, it's toxic and salty. That's what's going to be leftover.\"Credit card fraud might also bubble up in other places. \"Chip cards should reduce fraud in stores that are able to process them, but an unintended consequence could be more fraud in other areas,\" says Schulz. He points to online shopping as one example. EMV technology is only helpful when you're physically standing in a store holding a credit card. Therefore, it will offer no extra protection for purchases you make online, nor help prevent the type of fraud that occurs there.\"This is not a magic bullet for fraud,\" says McQuay.
