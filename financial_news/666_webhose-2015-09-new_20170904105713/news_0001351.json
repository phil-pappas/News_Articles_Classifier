This fear factor has been growing steadily since 2006 when 23 per cent cited working longer as their biggest fear for retirement and then 28 per cent in 2010 in earlier Edward Jones' studies.\nA recent study on the psychology of investing my BMO InvestorLine found that 97 per cent of Canadians feel anxiety when thinking about their investments and another report by the BMO Wealth Institute found that half of Canadians are concerned about what would happen to their family's finance if they were to die, yet only 43 per cent own life insurance or plan to purchase some in the next 12 months.\nWhen it comes to investments, 47 per cent of Canadians (43 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women) fear financial loss, while 40 per cent fear they will not get a good return on their investments, 33 per cent are concerned about how market volatility will affect their portfolios and 32 per cent are concerned about selecting the right investments.\n\"Investing is personal so it's not surprising that a majority of Canadians are not only financially but emotionally involved in their investments,\" says Julie Barker-Merz, president of BMO InvestorLine. \"Given recent market volatility, fear of financial loss is an understandable concern.\"\nThe study further revealed that Canadians are confused about investing in general but more particularly they are confused about finding an investment that will yield the best return with minimal risk, which investment options will best suit their risk tolerance and stage of life, knowing when to change their investment mix and deciding with whom to entrust their money.\n\"The confusion that exists among 90 per cent of Canadian investors likely contributes to their investment anxiety,\" Barker-Merz says.\nDespite their anxiety about the financial future of their families, Canadians continue to be under-insured. Fewer than half of Canadians own or will purchase life insurance in the next 12 months, one third do not have life, travel, accident, disability, critical illness or long-term care policies and only one third are confident that their financial plan has addressed their insurance needs to mitigate risks.\n\"Life is unpredictable and Canadians are clearly anxious about what would happen to their family in the event of death or an unexpected illness, so it's concerning that so few feel that their insurance needs are being met,\" says Chris Buttigieg, senior manager of wealth planning strategy with BMO Financial Group.\nThe report looked at the types of insurance that Canadians in different age groups currently own or plan to purchase in the next year. BMO recommends that millennials (age 18-34) start with life insurance as the foundation for protection of the future of their loved ones as well as critical illness, accident and travel insurance.\nFor gen-Xers (35-54) who are settled into a career, critical illness and disability insurance are important for individuals but even more so for their families who are dependent on their ability to earn an income.\nFor boomers (54-65) long-term care insurance is particularly beneficial for those who have left the workforce and cannot benefit from disability insurance if they are no longer earning. For estate planning purposes Boomers also should consider taking out permanent life insurance.\n\"As life changes insurance needs change as well,\" says Rocco Casullo, head of direct to consumer insurance with BMO Insurance. \"It's important to educate yourself about the products that will provide the most benefits for you at your particular stage in life. There are plenty of online resources available and a financial professional can clarify and further expand on the information you find online to help you determine which type of coverage is best for you.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:34:27.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
