Unprocessed food, on the other hand, was the biggest upward driver for the overall index, with a 2.7 percent rise.\nWithout these two volatile components -- or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation -- prices increased by 0.9 percent year-on-year in September, the same as in August.\nThe ECB wants to keep the headline inflation at below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term and started buying assets including government bonds in March to inject more cash into the economy and in this way accelerate price growth.\nBut the 1 trillion euro plus programme, called quantitative easing (QE), has so far had limited success because of the sharp declines in the prices of commodities, exacerbated by expectations of slower economic growth in the world's second biggest economy China.
