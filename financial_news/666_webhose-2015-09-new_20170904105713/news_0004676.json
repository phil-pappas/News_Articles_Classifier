After just eight days in release, the movie also delivered an impressive cumulative total in China with $82.8 million. \nIn North American action, Universal's \"Straight Outta Compton\" makes it three in a row at the top of the box office chart, with $13.1 million and $134.0 million to date. In second place, Sony's PG-rated faith-based drama, \"War Room,\" is a resounding success, earning a whopping $11.35 million in just 1,135 theaters, proving that in a sea of R-rated fare, the movie benefitted from filling a void in the marketplace for a largely underserved audience. \nOn this week's Movies on Demand chart, we see a three-peat at the top of the chart. Buddy comedy \"Hot Pursuit,\" starring Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, is once again followed by Lionsgate's Young Adult action-adventure \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent\" and Fox's Dreamworks Animation release \"Home\" for the second straight week. \nOn our digital purchases and rentals chart, Warner Bros.' \"Mad Max 4: Fury Road\" debuted strong in its first week of release, easily grabbing the number one spot. Lionsgate's, YA action-adventure \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent,\" - now in its fourth week of release continues - to make its mark on the charts, landing in the number two position. Sony's new release, \"Aloha,\" directed by Cameron Crowe and starring Bradley Cooper and Rachel McAdams, entered the charts in fourth place. \nOur DVD and Blu-ray Disc sales chart this week sees a flip-flop of last week's top two movies with Lionsgate's YA action-adventure \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent\" moving to second place in its third week and Fox's Dreamworks Animation family-favorite \"Home\" moving back to the top spot in its fourth week on the chart. \nThis week on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc rentals side of the ledger, we notice a repeat of last week's one-two punch with Lionsgate's \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent\" remaining in the top spot as Warner Bros.' ever-popular buddy-comedy \"Get Hard\" holds strong in the second position. \nOn our top viewer engagement for broadcast telecasts chart, Telemundo's \"El Señor de los Cielos\" remains on top once again this week and proves its never-ending popularity. Meanwhile, Univision's \"Yo no creo en los hombres\" takes the second spot with Telemundo's \"Caso cerrado – Edicion especial\" in third and Univison's \"Lo imperdonable\" landing in fourth place. \nOur top viewer engagement for cable telecasts chart puts TNT's \"Major Crimes\" back on top, followed by ABC Family's \"Pretty Little Liars,\" TNT's \"Rizzoli & Isles\" and VH1's always-popular \"Love & Hip Hop Atlanta\" in fourth place. \nFinally, on our combined social media and digital engagement chart for viewers of broadcast and cable telecasts, ABC Family's \"Pretty Little Liars\" uploaded a photo to Instagram of Lucy Hale to promote the night's episode and the photo had 259k+ interactions. In the second spot, Comedy Central's \"Key & Peele\" uploaded a video clip to Facebook with a link to last week's episode and the post gained 16k+ interactions.
