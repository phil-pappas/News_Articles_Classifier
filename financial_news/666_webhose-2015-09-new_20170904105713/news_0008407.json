Stacks of five dollar notes pass through a carousel machine at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on \nThe fall in the value of the US dollar following the Federal Reserve's decision to leave near-zero interest rates unchanged may prove short-lived given the central bank made explicit reference to concerns about the international picture, as opposed to that of the United States, in coming to its decision. \n\"The outlook abroad appears to have become more uncertain of late and heightened concerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies have led to notable volatility in financial markets,\" said Fed chairman Janet Yellen, in the post-announcement press conference, but should that really translate into a weaker dollar? \nIf the Fed, with the US economy \"performing well\" as Yellen described it, has such concerns about \"the outlook abroad\" that they impinge on US monetary policymaking decisions, that is hardly a vote of confidence for other currencies in preference to the dollar. \nJapan is a case in point. \nStandard & Poor's last week downgraded Japan's credit rating a notch to A-plus, saying \"we believe the likelihood of an economic recovery in Japan strong enough to restore economic support for sovereign creditworthiness commensurate with our previous assessment has diminished\". \nLacklustre export growth, despite the tailwind of the weak yen, uninspiring wage growth and an unimpressive rate of household spending, has already increased pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy even further in an attempt to reflate a Japanese economy which contracted in the second quarter. \nThe failure of the Fed to tighten policy last week might paradoxically increase the pressure on the BOJ to ease next month, especially if the Fed's concerns about emerging market economies trigger \"safe haven\" demand for the yen in the interim. \nEven in South Korea, whose sovereign rating S&P raised to AA-minus, the central bank is not ruling out the possibility of a further cut in the key rate from the record low of 1.5 per cent adopted in June. \nSpeaking before the Fed decision to stand pat, Bank of Korea governor Lee Ju-yeol said the central bank \"cannot completely rule out the possibility of conditions when we might need an additional monetary policy\". \nTaiwan, whose central bank meets on Thursday, arguably now also has room to cut rates if it wishes or to at least allude to the possibility. \nOf course, the state visit of President Xi Jinping to the US, beginning tomorrow, might provide the conditions for a degree of stability in Chinese markets but, looking beyond that, Beijing's attempts to recalibrate China's economy to \"the new normal\" will continue along a road which, understandably, has had some bumps in it. \nChina will continue to set policy to suit China, and investors might decide that, in the current environment, that does not easily support arguments for holding the yuan in preference to the dollar. \nAs for the euro, investors who might see that currency as a viable alternative to the dollar, following the Fed's decision, have to factor in the fact that the ECB's monetary policy remains resolutely accommodative. \nThere is also the uncomfortable fact that, on top of all its other economic challenges, Europe now also has to cope with a refugee crisis that is already straining relations between member states of the European Union. \nIn the meantime, for the Fed, \"every meeting is a live meeting where the committee can make a decision to move to change our target for the federal funds rate\", Yellen said in a direct reference to the remaining Federal Open Market Committee meetings this year, next month and in December. \n\"While the FOMC decided not to raise policy interest rate [last week], it is worth noting 13 out of 17 members of FOMC expected a lift-off within this year,\" noted HKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam on Friday. \n\"The interest rate rise cycle will definitely happen. Investors and property buyers need to prepare for the interest rate to go up,\" said Chan, alluding to the specific situation in Hong Kong. \nBut Chan's sentiment is equally applicable more widely in relation to US monetary policy and the dollar. \nBuoyant US jobs data on October 2 would undoubtedly reignite expectations of tighter Fed policy, triggering renewed demand for the dollar. \nWith the outlook for many economies beyond US shores cloudy enough to affect the Fed's own monetary policy deliberations, the odds must be that demand for the greenback will be back.
