More Streaming revenues climb US music charts \n“Clients are becoming wary and suspicious,” he said. \nBoth Google and Facebook “are going to have to raise their game” when it comes to providing advertisers with strong evidence that their ads are being seen by real people, he added. \nFake views of ads by “bots” — computer programs that mimic the behaviour of internet users — have become a big problem for marketers as they shift an increasing portion of their advertising budgets online. \nWPP, the world’s largest marketing services group, has been on a “crusade” to eliminate fraud in online advertising, Sir Martin said. It has also been trying to prevent advertisers wasting money on ads that are displayed in parts of a web page that cannot be seen. \n“Online measurement is weak,” he said. New media companies have been “held to lower standards” than traditional ones “because they’re sexier”, he added. “Traditional media are being penalised.” \nGoogle has been investing significantly in technology and staff to keep bots out of its systems. \nBut as the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, a study by researchers at four institutions — UC3M, Imdea, NEC Labs Europe and Polito — has raised questions about whether Google is doing enough to protect advertisers from deception. \nWhen the researchers sent bots to visit two YouTube videos 150 times, the video site’s public view counter identified only 25 of the views as genuine. AdWords, Google’s service for advertisers, charged the researchers for 91 of the fake views, however. \nIn other words, the study found that Google’s core advertising engine charged the researchers for the bot visits even though YouTube was clearly able to identify them as fake. \nAlthough YouTube was vulnerable to some fake views, the study also found that the platform’s fraud-detection mechanism was superior to those of four of its rivals, such as Vivendi’s Dailymotion. \nThe US Association of National Advertisers, whose members spend more than $250bn on marketing each year, and White Ops, a fraud detection company, found in a study last year that a quarter of online video ads were “viewed” by bots. \nThe ANA estimated that advertisers would lose more than $6bn globally to bots in 2015, across both display and video advertising.
