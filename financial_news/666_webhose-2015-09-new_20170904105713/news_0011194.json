However, oil prices pulled back on Tuesday on concerns over weakening demand in China, the world's second-largest economy. \n\"Crude oil prices came under renewed pressure through the third quarter as the global supply overhang showed little improvement while faith in a demand-led rally was shaken by China's currency revaluation,\" analysts at BMO Capital Markets (a unit of Bank of Montreal ) wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. More Headlines Jim Cramer Points Out 11 Quality Stocks Down 50% or More \nAccording to BMO Capital markets, Brent crude oil prices averaged roughly $50/bbl in the third quarter, down from $63 in the second quarter and from $103 in the same period last year. As well, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) averaged approximately $45/bbl compared to $58 in Q2/15 and $97 in Q3/14, the note said. \n\"We expect crude oil prices to remain under pressure over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 as the global supply overhang takes longer to work off; however, supply and demand are dynamic and we anticipate oil prices' firming somewhat in late-2016 in anticipation of a tighter supply-demand balance in 2017,\" the note said. \"We are lowering our 2015 assumption for Brent to $54.50/bbl from $62 and our 2016 assumption to $57.50 from $65.\" \nSo what does that mean for oil stocks ? The analysts say investors should \"remain cautious as the near-term outlook for crude oil remains uncertain and volatile,\" according to the note. \"We would continue to focus on companies with strong balance sheets that are able to generate growth without the help of rising commodity prices.\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , said oil prices may be bottoming and oil stocks may be interesting. \nBMO Capital Markets named six energy companies as top recommendations. Here is the list, paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. And when you're done be sure to check out Oppenheimer's stocks to \" buy on weakness .\" \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nSector: Energy/Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Market Cap: $36 billion \nBMO Capital Markets Rating/Price Target: Outperform/$100 TheStreet Rating: Sell, D+ TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP as a Sell with a ratings score of D+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP (APC) a SELL. This is driven by multiple weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its unimpressive growth in net income, weak operating cash flow, generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself and feeble growth in its earnings per share. \" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed against the S&P 500 and did not exceed that of the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 73.1% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $227.00 million to $61.00 million. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $1,243.00 million or 49.51% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the industry average, the firm's growth is significantly lower. Despite any intermediate fluctuations, we have only bad news to report on this stock's performance over the last year: it has tumbled by 37.55%, worse than the S&P 500's performance. Consistent with the plunge in the stock price, the company's earnings per share are down 73.33% compared to the year-earlier quarter. Naturally, the overall market trend is bound to be a significant factor. However, in one sense, the stock's sharp decline last year is a positive for future investors, making it cheaper (in proportion to its earnings over the past year) than most other stocks in its industry. But due to other concerns, we feel the stock is still not a good buy right now. ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. The company has reported a trend of declining earnings per share over the past two years. However, the consensus estimate suggests that this trend should reverse in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP swung to a loss, reporting -$3.51 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings (-$1.80 versus -$3.51). The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry and the overall market, ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORP's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.
