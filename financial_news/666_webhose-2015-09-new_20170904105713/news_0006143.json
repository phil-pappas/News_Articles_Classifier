Turnover was $143 million. Despite gains on the ASX, Australian banking stocks did not fare so well and dual-listed Westpac led the New Zealand benchmark index lower, down 3.5 per cent to $32.57 and ANZ fell 2.5 per cent to $29.50. \"It's a combination of things. There's China, although a fair bit of that's played out really in terms of their own market, but the fear is more their own economy,\" said Matthew Goodson, managing director at Salt Funds Management. \"At the same time we're seeing the US market start to focus on the possibility of a September rate hike, which appears to be a 50-50 call at the moment.\" \"We've seen a decent step up in volatility. That alone appears to have triggered a degree of selling.\" Other leading stocks to fall included Sky TV down 3.2 per cent to $4.58, Heartland New Zealand 1.7 per cent to $1.13, Metlifecare 1.7 per cent to $4.18 and Spark New Zealand 1.3 per cent to $3.17.
