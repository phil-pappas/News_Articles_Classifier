Since then, Matterport has provided Apartments.com with over 1,000 3D floor plans and apartment tours per week, a pace that both companies plan to sustain.\n\"Property tours are one of the most time-consuming, yet critical, elements of the apartment-hunting process,\" said Andrew Florance, Founder and CEO of CoStar Group. \"By providing renters with thousands of virtual property tours right at their fingertips, Apartments.com is once again providing an easier, more convenient and more transparent apartment search experience.\"\nTo create the floor plans and virtual tours, Apartments.com utilizes Matterport's end-to-end 3D imaging platform, consisting of the Matterport Pro Camera, 3D Showcase and cloud services. This provides prospective renters with a quick and easy immersive walk-through of Apartments.com properties on a PC, mobile or virtual reality device. The prospective renter gets a sense of what it feels like to be in a particular space by walking through an apartment unit virtually, as well as experiencing the building's amenities and facilities, such as the lobby, fitness facility and other areas of interest.\n\"The world is moving from 2D image galleries to immersive media that enables consumers to experience any place at any time from anywhere -- Apartments.com and Matterport are leading the charge,\" said Bill Brown, CEO of Matterport. \"Apartments.com is the clear thought leader in the apartment rental market, and we're excited to work with them on a large scale to leverage the simplicity, cost efficiency and outstanding visual experience of Matterport's fully-immersive 3D content to make the rental experience even better.\"\nThe innovative site feature has significant implications for property managers as well. Properties within Apartments.com's top three advertising tiers have the option to add 3D floor plans and apartment models to their listings. By providing an in-depth layer of insight to an apartment, the virtual tours are expected to dramatically increase the volume of qualified leads that reach site advertisers.\nCWS Apartment Homes, a property management firm with apartment buildings throughout the U.S., added the 3D tour feature to its Apartments.com listings in early 2015. According to the firm's Director of Marketing, Matt Baker, the feature has become an invaluable tool for attracting new renters.\n\"In the past, the consumer experience was limited to a few community specifics, high resolution images and an occasional video,\" said Baker. \"With the 3D tour feature, our residents now have the ability to tour any CWS community from anywhere in the world. Being able to provide this type of convenience to prospective renters is priceless.\"\nIn the few months since CWS Apartment Homes began offering 3D tours of its properties, Baker said he's seen a significant uptick in the volume of leads sourced from Apartments.com.\n\"In the Atlanta region alone, we've experienced an increase of double and in some cases triple the number of overall impressions and qualified leads generated by Apartments.com,\" said Baker. \"Based on these results and the positive feedback from our associates, I'd say we made the right decision to leverage this feature.\"\nTo date, the virtual tours on Apartments.com have collectively garnered over 4.8 million views. In addition, on average, site users spend three-times more time engaging with property listings that offer the 3D tour feature, than those without virtual tours. According to Matterport, Apartments.com's investment in 3D content is having a transformative impact on the apartment industry.\nAbout Matterport \nHeadquartered in Mountain View, CA, Matterport develops technology to create, modify, navigate and share 3D spaces.
