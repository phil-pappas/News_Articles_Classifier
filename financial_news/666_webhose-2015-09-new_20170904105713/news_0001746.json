It is great to see that talent coming through and see what they are capable of dreaming up,\" McKenzie told the Financial Review .\n\"Our graduate program is so competitive, so running competitions like this gives us insight beyond a traditional recruitment process around who has got what type of skills and abilities.\"\nKeeping things interesting Telstra also runs a separate competition to identify the best cyber security minds in the country and McKenzie said more than 50 per cent of last year's participants went offshore to work for multi-national technology companies.\n\"We hope to create an environment where we can give them an interesting enough career to stay here. We would like that type of environment in Australiaâ€¦ so we can keep the bright young things here,\" she says.\nMcKenzie, one of the country's most senior executives focused on technology and innovation, says Australia did not yet have the close alignment between universities and industry in the way that Silicon Valley and Stanford University work together.\n\"It would be fantastic if we could get closer alignment between universities and industry to create that kind of dynamic here,\" she says.\nThe winner of the Telstra University Challenge will receive a $10,000 grant for their university as well as coaching and mentoring from Telstra executives.\nThe idea is to get the teams from 11 different universities to develop an application or software solution that is commercially viable. Wearable devices that tell you when to apply sunscreen or to help pregnant women track their babies heartbeat are examples of entries this year.\nRight ideas and talent While healthcare features heavily, the competition covers five industries: wearable devices, smart cities, transport and logistics, industrial and retail.\nTelstra is looking for ideas to sell that use mobile communications, connectivity and data to improve the lives of customers.\nMcKenzie says no industry sector was immune to digital disruption, which is highlighted by the number of large companies setting up innovation laboratories, accelerators and other initiatives to capitalise on the tech boom.\nTelstra opened an innovation lab in Melbourne in August and chief executive Andy Penn has identified innovations in mobile technology and cloud computing as a key growth area for the company.\nMcKenzie concedes that turning a good idea into commercial reality is not easy, but the money is there if you have the right ideas and talent.\n\"There is plenty of money floating around looking for places to invest you just have to have the credibility to attract the investors.\"\nNew Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's emphasis on digital disruption and the surprise appointment of Christopher Pyne as Industry, Innovation and Science Minister means the technology sector has high expectations around potential opportunities under the new ministry.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-22T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:40:26.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
