The agencies said the Tennessee-based equipment and tool retailer sold the Chinese-made all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles and engines between 2006 and 2009.\nThe Clean Air Act requires vehicles and engines sold in the United States to have a valid EPA-issued certificate certifying they meet federal emissions standards for harmful pollutants. Officials determined at least 10 of the models sold at Tractor Supply were imported using certificates for less-powerful, less-polluting models.\nAs part of the settlement the company will pay a $775,000 fine and implement new compliance standards.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:34:32.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
