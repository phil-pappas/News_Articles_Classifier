Plenty of back to school sales going on, and plenty of pressure to buy your kids all the things they “need” to go to school. The problem is that the definition of “need” by some stores is a little out of wack. Students don’t need a home computer, laptop , tablet and also an iPhone, however that does seem to be implied by many of the tech stores out there. Isn’t a Hilroy Exercise book, a pencil and a pen enough? It seems that lifestyle creep has worked its way into back to school. Is This the Only Bank You Can Trust ? \nMy yearly pilgrimage to the bank to extract money from my RESP continues to create more and more content for this site, so I really must send a Thank You note to TD for all the great stories that have come from their product. As I mentioned in my article this week I did manage to not run into the TD E-series Beartrap , where I cannot do anything in my local branch with the E-series funds, so I must first transfer the funds into a TD Money Market account, so that then my local branch can release the funds in that savings vehicle. \nI thought my issues with TD and RESPs were bad, however, Mrs. C8j pointed me to an article in the Ottawa Citizen about a woman (who she knows) and her issues with Scotiabank and their RESP (another classic example of “ Banks Behaving Badly “). It seems they would not release the funds in the account until Ms. Adeney answered some Marketing questions about her net value and income. Read that previous sentence again, they would not give her HER money, until she answered the questions? What the flip? I am glad to hear that Scotiabank admitted their mistake, but holy cow, at least TD never did that to me. \nMy Writings for Week Ending September 4th \nThe summer is slowly coming to a close and an entertaining fall lies ahead (with plenty of election shenanigans and tom-foolery) : I started the week with yet another fun list of great financial tweets, with More Great Personal Finance Tweets for the Week , I went “off script” a little with a peek at the new economy with In App Purchases and the New Economy , which does have a very naughty video included with it as well. Yes, I do rant about my exploits at my local bank, but this one did miff me more than previous visits with, No I can’t Do Anything about That , which just goes to show that “Brick and Mortar” storefronts (ort banks for that matter) are less and less useful to most folks. Tweet of the week \nEllen Roseman (if you aren’t following her on Twitter and on Facebook, you are missing some good stuff) gives another example of “ Banks Behaving Badly “. I note I am only 8 new twitter followers until I reach 2500 followers (hint, hint). I hear from Star readers about banks not delivering great service unless they're trying to sell you something. https://t.co/1WsjekWP0F \n— ellen roseman (@ellenroseman) September 2, 2015 No Marketing Questions Just Good Stories \nBarry from Money we Have brings us a very good article about Money Myths Busted , and yes interest rates really will go up some time (soon).

Speaking of income, did you realize that Everyone Who started watching Mad Money in 2005 are now Billionaires ? Not really, but it is a fun story from the Onion.
