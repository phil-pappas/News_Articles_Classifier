Yields on U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar moved higher against a broad basket of currencies.\nProspects of rising U.S. interest rates usually reduce the appeal of higher-risk investments such as Latin American assets. Commodities, the main export of most Latin American countries and also sensitive to U.S. rates and dollar trends, fell 0.7 percent as oil prices slipped 1.0 percent.\nBrazil's real faced additional pressure on fears Finance Minister Joaquim Levy could leave office because of disagreements over his austerity plan, which opponents blame for deepening the country's recession. The government on Thursday dismissed the market rumors.\nThe Brazilian real is the global emerging currency most prone to sell off, according to a Reuters poll on Thursday. Although its fair value is calculated at about 3.5 per dollar, JPMorgan analysts revised their forecasts to predict an exchange rate of 4.1 per dollar at year-end and 4.35 at mid-2016.\n\"Recent deterioration in economic and political outlook in Brazil has increased the volatility in asset prices,\" wrote the economists led by Cassiana Fernandez in a note. \"Without the fiscal anchor, we believe the real will need to adjust beyond fundamental drivers.\"\nThe benchmark Bovespa stock index fell nearly 2 percent as shares of state-run oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, and miner Vale SA dropped between 2 and 3 percent. Benchmark stock indexes in Mexico and Chile also dropped more than 1 percent.
