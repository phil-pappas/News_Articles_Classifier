Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Hardware expert Geoff Dart, the man who first predicted massive losses at Masters, says the chain needs to dump timber and tools in favour of paint, carpets and tiles to prevent losses reaching $1.3 billion by 2020.\nMr Dart said Masters, a joint venture between Woolworths and United States retailer Lowe's , could not survive or be sold in its current form because its stores were too large and did not generate sufficient foot traffic, sales or margins to cover high operating costs.\nBut by moving out of the trade and garden categories and targeting the $38 billion home decoration and lifestyle market, which included \"finishing\" products such as paint, flooring, window coverings and kitchens, Masters could be profitable in a year or two, Mr Dart said.\n\"I'm not anti-Masters but the model just won't work,\" said Mr Dart, who was accused by Woolworths of mounting a \"dirty tricks\" campaign when he forecast in 2012 that the home improvement business could lose $151 million in 2013.\n\"I've never said there is no opportunity for another player in the home improvement market, I've said there is no opportunity for Masters in its current shape and form,\" he said.\nThe home improvement business lost $139 million in 2013 – with Masters losing $157 million – and has racked up losses of $604 million over the last four years.\nWoolworths believes Masters will eventually make a profit and has pointed to a 30 per cent improvement in sales at new-format stores, which will be rolled out over the next 12 months .\n\"It's early days, but I'm optimistic about the progress that's been made and I'm optimistic we can make a real difference in 2016,\" Woolworths home improvement managing director Matt Tyson said last month.\n However, analysts and investors have called on Woolworths to close or sell the business, saying it is a major management distraction at a time when Woolworths' core food and grocery business is under pressure from Coles and Aldi and BIG W is losing ground to Kmart and Target.\nIn DGC Advisory's 2015 Market Report , which was released this week, Mr Dart analyses three options for Masters –fold, hold or change.\nThe report said Woolworths could lose $600 million to $700 million – excluding the cost of paying out Lowe's – and would \"gift\" $800 million to $900 million of sales to arch rival Bunnings if it closed Masters.\nThese exit costs are consistent with previous estimates by brokers Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.\nDGC Advisory said if Masters continued on its current path the venture would lose another $600 million to $900 million over the next four years, taking accumulated losses to $1.3 billion.\nMasters is generating sales of less than $20 million a store, compared with estimated operating costs of $26 million a store. Losses have increased as more stores have opened.\n\"The current model is doomed,\" the report said. \"For the venture to succeed a move to a 'finishing' model is fundamental to success. This could see the new venture move into profitability in its own right after year one and over the ensuing three years reduce overall losses for Masters.\"\nMr Dart said the \"finishing\" market was worth $38 billion a year, including design and installation services. Unlike the $46 billion home improvement market, there were no major retail chains.\nBunnings' share of the home improvement market is estimated to be about 20 per cent, but its share of the finishing market is only 2 to 3 per cent, leaving plenty of room for a new national player.\n\"It's a very fragmented market, there is no national retail chain that is a finishing store, where you can go to buy everything for the house whether it's window coverings, flooring, paint, wallpaper and home automation,\" Mr Dart said.\nThe home automation or \"connected home\" market alone is estimated to be worth $3.2 billion and is set to boom as homeowners install internet connected appliances, security systems, air conditioning and heating systems.\nMasters would need to shrink its current stores from 13,500 square metres to between 8000 and 6000 square metres, exit the trade and garden categories, which take up 40 per cent of floor space, and sell or lease the surplus space to complementary tenants such as Super Cheap Auto, Repco, Bob Jane and Beaurepaires.\nDGC Advisory estimates sales per square metre under a finishing store format would more than double over time, gross margins would rise from about 25 per cent to 45 per cent, and operating margins to about 16 per cent, in line with those at leading specialty retailers.\n\"They could reach $1.5 billion to $2 billion in revenues and have a very profitable business,\" said Mr Dart, who also said Woolworths should dump the Masters brand for the family-friendly HOME brand held by its wholesale hardware business.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/woolworths-injects-more-money-into-masters-to-fund-growth-20150311-141aa9.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/bunnings-stars-for-wesfarmers-while-coles-matches-and-target-disappoints-20150426-1mtzkk.html", "https://twitter.com/@suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:14:23.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
