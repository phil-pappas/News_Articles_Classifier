The change comes into effect on September 25. \nThis is intended to ensure the developers do not have a chance to receive, transfer and change the information sent by investors to the securities firm, in keeping with a requirements put forward by the Securities Association of China (SAC), Huatai said. \nThe SAC is a self-disciplinary organization overseen by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). \nOne of the apps, developed by Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network, which is based in the eastern province of Zhenjiang, told users later its services could still be used for nearly 100 other securities firms. \nIt is unclear whether other brokerage firms will follow Huatai's lead, but many have become much more cautious about cooperating with outside software developers, in light of recent regulatory actions against those that facilitated unsupervised margin trading, several people working in the industry said. \nThe SAC has fallen behind in its schedule for drafting rules and standards for how securities firms can plug their system into those of outside software developers, or vice versa, one person said. \nHuatai has paid a price for problems with third-party trading systems. In a separate announcement, the firm said it had received a notice from the CSRC on September 10 that it had to pay nearly 73 million yuan in fines and lost earnings for \"failing to know the real identity\" of customers who traded through third-party computer software systems. \nThree other securities firms and one futures company have also been punished for the same reason, the CSRC announced on September 11. \nThe regulator named three companies whose trading software had been used by the securities firms, including a subsidiary of Hundsun Technology Inc., which is partly held by Jack Ma's Ant Financial Services Group. \nAll three software developers were punished by the CSRC this month for violating the Securities Law in \"selling systems and providing related services to clients who do not have the qualification to run securities businesses.\" \nThe CSRC said the developers' software let investors trade stocks under false names, a loophole that was exploited by many companies lacking a license for margin trading, or buying shares with borrowed money. \nLeveraged trading with funds borrowed through these unmonitored channels is believed to have fueled the A-share market's rallies in November and exacerbated its drastic falls since mid-June . \nHundsun was required to return some profits and pay a fine, which wiped out its total profit of 530 million yuan from January 2014 to June. The other two had to pay about 73 million yuan combined. \nHowever, apart from third-party software related to margin trading, the regulator has not ordered securities firms to cut their ties with other outside information systems, a source from a securities firm said. \nA CSRC spokesperson said in March that the regulator supported cooperation between securities firms and Internet companies or information technologies providers. \nBut many brokers said they would wait for the SAC to clarify all technical details for how securities firms ought to connect their systems with those of outsiders. \"The SAC had planned to roll out a set of clear standards and rules for third-party software in late July or early August,\" but it failed to meet the deadline, the vice president of a securities firm in Shanghai said. \n(Rewritten by Wang Yuqian) Brokerages Said to Rethink Ties with Firms Making Trading Software Move comes as securities regulator cracks down on programs that let investors engage in unsupervised margin trading By staff reporter Zhang Yu SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:26:00.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
