The blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index climbed 3.07 percent. The FTSEurofirst was still down more than 1 percent so far this week. \nEuropean shares have been hit this week by concern over the broader risks of the emissions rigging, but the mood turned after Janet Yellen said overnight the Federal Reserve was on track to lift rates this year. \nSome investors said they were positive on the longer-term outlook for European shares given signs of economic improvement and stimulus measures from the European Central Bank. \n\"We are positioned for improvements in domestic consumption in Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain and Italy, which already show considerable signs of improvement, and also in France where valuations are low and there are early signs of a belated recognition of the need for reform,\" said Ali Miremadi, fund manager at Taube Hodson Stonex Partners. \nThe auto sector rose 2.15 percent, but Volkswagen (LSE: 0P6N.L - news ) fell as much as 6.37 percent. In spite of the rebound, the index was set to close its worst week in four years. \nVolkswagen shares rose in morning trade, amid signs Volkswagen would name Matthias Mueller, head of its Porsche sports car brand, as CEO. That was taken as evidence of its determination to tackle the crisis. \nRival carmaker BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) rose 3.79 percent. The German car magazine Auto Bild clarified an earlier report to say it had no evidence the company manipulated. Daimler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) rose 3.09 percent after denying allegations by a lobby group it had rigged emissions data for its vehicles. \nZodiac Aerospace slid 8.5. The French aerospace supplier confirmed it faced court action and the possible loss of some business from American Airlines (Xetra: A1G.DE - news ) over delays in aircraft seat production. \nPersonal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) and household goods stocks were up 3.5 percent to be the top sectoral gainer on Friday. Adidas was among the leaders after its U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . rival Nike reported results that were better than expected. \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:38:54.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
