This means people who do not require all of their withdrawals for living expenses can decrease these withdrawals, and therefore, defer tax to later years.\nRecall that if you are age 71 or over, any money you had in an RRSP (registered retirement savings plan) had to be converted into an RRIF. In the case of former pension money, the conversion is from a LIRA (locked-in retirement account, which is known as a locked-in RRSP for monies that have transferred from a federally regulated pension, as opposed to provincially regulated) to a LIF.\nWhen this change takes place, a minimum annual withdrawal is required. This is, of course, taxable. Prior to the recent budget, the minimum for a person age 71 was 7.38 per cent of the value in the plan on Dec. 31 of the previous year.\nAs an example, the required withdrawal from a $100,000 RRIF was $7,380. However, after the change in the 2015 budget, this has been decreased to 5.28 per cent, or $5,280 per $100,000 of RRIF.\nThe same percentages apply to an LIF, but the LIF also has a maximum allowable withdrawal amount. Those maximums have not changed.\nIf a person has been taking the minimum withdrawals monthly based on the old percentages, they will reach the new minimums with part of their September payment. Our firm is allowing clients to then suspend the payments for the balance of the year. I believe other investment firms are allowing the same change.\nSome people have already withdrawn their required minimum for 2015 or may keep making withdrawals to year-end. In this case, CRA is allowing a re-deposit or \"re-contribution\" to RRIFs or LIFs within 60 days of year-end, or March 1, 2016. The amount allowed is the difference between the old minimums and the new.\nTax slips will be provided by the financial institution to total the correct resulting amount of net withdrawal.\nThere is a small bonus to this approach, as the 2016 minimum required withdrawal is based on the Dec. 31, 2015 value. The re-contribution amount will not be included in this balance, thus slightly reducing the minimum for 2016.\nRemember, all of this is predicated on you having other income and assets to live on, other than your RRIF and LIF withdrawals. If you depend on this income, then the change is moot.\nThe other major change in 2015 for people who have unregistered investments is the increase in the tax-free savings account contribution limit to $10,000, from the previous $5,500. This $10,000 amount will be fixed going forward and no longer indexed to inflation.\nI should mention two of the three major political parties in the current election campaign have vowed to cancel this increase. However, since millions of Canadians have taken advantage of the higher limit for 2015 at the instruction of the Canada Revenue Agency, one would hope any rollback would not happen until 2016.\n \nDavid Christianson, BA, CFP, R.F.P., TEP, CIM is a financial planner and adviser with Christianson Wealth Advisors, a vice-president with National Bank Financial Wealth Management and author of the book Managing the Bull, A No-Nonsense Guide to Personal Finance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:16:15.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
