Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of only 102,000 barrels.\nFront-month US crude had dropped 47 cents, or more than 1 percent, to $44.76 a barrel by 0142 GMT. The contract settled Tuesday’s trade at $45.23 a barrel, up 80 cents, or 1.8 percent, on the day.\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 35 cents to $47.88 a barrel. On Tuesday, the contract rose 89 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $48.23.\nThe US government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue official weekly inventory data on Wednesday.\nWednesday’s session may have added volatility due to the close of September and third-quarter trading, according to some analysts.\nUS crude is heading for a 9-percent decline this month as the slump in commodities continues amid deepening concerns over China’s slowing economic growth.\nBrent crude is on track to round out September with a near 12-percent drop.\nPrices are unlikely to move substantially higher in the near term because demand growth is easing and likely to continue slowing into 2016, Rhidoy Rashid, oil analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n“We see demand growth easing from 1.5 million bpd (barrels per day) to 1 million bpd next year,” Rashid said.\nHe expects supplies to swing into a year-on-year decline, but prices “need to be low for at least the next six months – so in the $45-$55 range – to ensure a proper rebalancing.”\n 30, 2015 8:25 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:40:12.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
