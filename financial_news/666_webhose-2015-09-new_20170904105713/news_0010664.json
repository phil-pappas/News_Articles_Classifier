It is essentially barred from lending, and its deposits are capped at about $80,000 per account.\nIt will remain tightly regulated, though Japan Post CEO Taizo Nishimuro has said that once 50 percent of the bank is sold, which is a priority, it could enter new businesses without needing regulatory approval. He did not mention a timeframe.\nSole shareholder, the Finance Ministry, will list all three entities simultaneously, allowing investors to value each against its peers in the distribution, banking and insurance industries, government officials say.\nGovernment hopes this will breed a more competitive spirit among regional banks as JPB becomes more market-oriented, using its balance sheet heft - similar to Japan's three \"megabanks\" - and network of 24,000 post offices, nearly twice the nationwide total of bank branches, to set the weather.\n\"The plan is to have a player to promote (smaller-bank) consolidation in the future,\" said the former Japan head of investment banking for a U.S. bank, describing how the Finance Ministry explained its thinking to foreign banks.\nFIGHTBACK\nA banker at a domestic firm briefed on the discussions said, \"Even if the regional banks don't like it, they'll have to compare themselves to the rest of the industry. As a result, the government will get the policy result it wants.\"\nWhile one government official denied any intent to stir up the financial industry, a senior FSA official said the IPO could have that effect.\n\"If a privatised Japan Post Bank makes efforts to become more active, this could make things rough for the management of regional financial institutions, which could have a sense of crisis and join forces to fight back,\" he said.\nJapan Post and the FSA declined to comment, and the Finance Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\"Japan Post Bank is the only bank with both economies of scale and a presence in local markets nationwide,\" said bank analyst Ryoji Yoshizawa at Standard & Poor's Ratings in Tokyo.\nJapan aims to raise up to 1.7 trillion yen ($14 billion) in the Nov. 4 sale, sources told Thomson Reuters DealWatch , rising to a total of 4 trillion yen in three instalments over the next six years or so. The final extent of the selloff hasn't been decided, though the ministry must maintain at least one third of the parent.\nUnder the Japan Post privatisation law, the parent must dispose of all shares in the bank and the insurer \"as promptly as possible\", but it gives no timeframe.\nJapan Post Holdings employs more than 430,000 people full- or part-time, similar to Toyota Motor Corp. Though there have been calls for it to slim down, it can't shrink its footprint in a hurry as it is legally mandated to provide universal mail, banking and insurance services.\nJPB has 177.7 trillion yen in deposits - more than Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group - and assets of 208 trillion, about three-quarters of MUFG's.\nJapan Post Holdings makes money - 483 billion yen net profits for the year to March, 80 percent from JPB - largely off the bank's investment portfolio of over 200 trillion yen. That is half again as big as the assets of Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund.\nS&P's Yoshizawa said JPB would be a threat to regional banks when it begins fee businesses like selling mutual funds in a planned tie-up with a major bank and brokerage in February.\nThe FSA has been prodding regional banks to tie up to survive as populations shrink outside the biggest cities, but to little avail.
