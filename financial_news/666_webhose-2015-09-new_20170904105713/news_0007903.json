Kenneth Cheung Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Victorians will have forked out $2.24 billion by the year's end on new electricity smart meters, which were supposed to provide future cost savings, but a new report has found the costs will likely outweigh the benefits.\nThe Victorian Auditor-General's Office (VAGO) issued a scathing report of Victoria's smart meters on Wednesday, which the Victorian Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources has labelled as 'systematically pessimistic'.\n\"Worryingly the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources does not have a good understanding of the costs of the program, which it does not track,\" Victorian Auditor-General John Doyle said in the report.\nWhen the cost of the smart meter program was reviewed by the department in 2011, it was found that there would be no overall benefit to consumers. Instead of the outlay being recouped in benefits, there would be an outstanding cost to Victorians of $319 million and now Mr Doyle expects this cost to rise.\nThe roll out of the smart meters began in 2009. The meters were designed to cut costs for Victorians by letting them monitor their electricity usage, reduce costs associated with meter reading and increase competition in the sector.\nBut Mr Doyle said these benefits relied on consumers changing their behaviour, something which largely has not happened.\n\"I found a real risk that the expected benefits will not be achieved,\" he said.\n\"Current forecasts predict consumers will only receive approximately 80 per cent of the benefits identified in the most recent 2011 cost-benefit analysis... and as costs are likely to increase over the life of the program, the final net cost to consumers is also likely to rise above $319 million.\"\n Not used properly The Auditor General said that despite improvements to consumer education since an earlier 2009 audit, market research conducted in early 2014 found that two-thirds of Victorians do not understand what the benefits provided through smart meters are.\nMany were also still unaware of the ability for smart meters to help minimise energy bills.\n\"Consumers who do take action will not only benefit directly, but changes in behaviour will also achieve cost savings for electricity distributors and retailers... However this relies on factors such as retail competition and the regulator passing these savings on,\" the report said.\nThe Auditor-General found that approximately 80 per cent of the expected benefits of the smart meters could be achieved, but there was significant uncertainty around this.\nA 2009 VAGO report into the rollout of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) program was critical of the original business case for smart meters.\nIt also made recommendations to improve the governance and stakeholder engagement, reassess the economic viability of the smart meter program and to assess the impact of changes to scope and underlying assumptions.\nThe new report said that efforts had been made to address these recommendations, but the changes had not been sufficient to overcome the \"manifest problems with the estimation and control of cost benefits\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:04:58.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
