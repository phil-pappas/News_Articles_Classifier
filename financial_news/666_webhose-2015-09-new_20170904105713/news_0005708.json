Ad-RTS-IL-12 is a novel gene therapy candidate for the controlled expression of IL-12, a critical protein for stimulating an anti-cancer T cell immune response.\nThe first poster presentation, titled, \"Demonstration of Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Intratumoral Regulated Expression of IL-12 in Advanced Breast Cancer and Melanoma Patients,\" highlights additional evidence of systemic immune activation with AD-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex in advanced melanoma and breast cancer patients. The data were drawn from two previously completed open-label Phase II clinical studies: one which enrolled 12 patients with metastatic advanced stage breast cancer, and one which enrolled 26 patients with metastatic melanoma, both exploring the immune-mediated local and systemic anti-tumor effects of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex. Among other findings, treatment with Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex in patients with melanoma was found to increase in the immune cytokine IL-12 and downstream cytokines, IFNg, IP-10 and IL-10, resulting in a significant increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes both locally, in injected lesions, and systemically, in non-injected lesions. The second poster presentation, titled \"Demonstration of Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Intratumoral Regulated Expression of IL-12 as a Gene Therapy Approach to Treatment of Cancer,\" demonstrates the anti-tumor effects and tolerability of Ad-RTS-mIL-12 in murine models of glioblastoma (brain cancer), colon cancer and melanoma. The data demonstrated dose-related increases in veledimex in both plasma and brain tissue, leading to an increase in expression of IL-12 mRNA and in-tumor IL-12p70 expression with minimal increase in serum IL-12. Ad-RTS-mIL-12 + veledimex also demonstrated systemic memory upon rechallenge in multiple syngeneic mouse models, providing further evidence of systemic anti-tumor immunity elicited by Ad-RTS-mIL-12. 4:37 pm Banro announces the intersection of significant mineralization from on-going near mine exploration activities at its wholly-owned Namoya project ( BAA ) : \n4:33 pm Nathan's Famous commences its previously announced Dutch Auction Tender Offer to repurchase up to 500k shares ( NATH ) : \n4:32 pm Freeseas receives a non-compliance notice from Nasdaq relating to the minimum bid price requirement, has until March 14 to regain compliance ( FREE ) : \n4:31 pm Dakota Plains announces notice of noncompliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards due to stockholders' deficit of approximately $3.1 million ( DAKP ) : The Company Guide requires that a listed company maintain stockholders' equity of $2.0 million or more if such listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years, and stockholders' equity of $4.0 million or more if such listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years. In order to maintain its listing of securities on the Exchange, the Company intends to submit a plan to the Exchange by October 14, 2015, detailing actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide by April 14, 2017.\n4:31 pm Biomarin Pharm enters into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories ( RDY ) that resolves patent litigation in the US related to BioMarin's Kuvan 100mg oral tablets ( BMRN ) : Under the terms of the settlement , BioMarin will grant Dr. Reddy's ( RDY ) a non-exclusive license to its patents related to Kuvan to allow Dr. Reddy to market a generic version of sapropterin dihydrochloride 100mg tablets in the U.S. for the indications approved for Kuvan beginning at a confidential date in the future, but which is more than five years from today, or earlier under certain circumstances.

Operators shut down the plant late Sunday following the failure of a turbine cooling water system. The plant remained in a safe condition following the shutdown. The refueling and maintenance outage originally was scheduled to begin Sept. 28.\n4:13 pm Closing Market Summary: Stocks Slide Amid Persistent Uncertainty (:WRAPX) : \nThe stock market ended the week on a broadly lower note. The S&P 500 lost 1.6%, surrendering 0.2% for the week, while the Nasdaq (-1.4%) outperformed, finishing the week higher by 0.1%. \nEquity indices spent the entire Friday session in the red after heavy selling in the futures market ensured a lower start. The overnight weakness in futures was accompanied by a retreat in Europe as investors shied away from risk assets amid the persistent uncertainty. On one hand, Greece will vote for a new parliament on Sunday and it is unclear whether the potential transition of power will upset the bailout agreement with eurozone creditors. On the other hand, yesterday's FOMC decision to hold the policy line has re-invited the rate-hike uncertainty that had pressured equity markets going into the September meeting. The uncertainty remains in place because Fed Chair Yellen, in her press conference, maintained that FOMC members are still looking to raise rates before the year ends. \nToday's retreat in stocks was accompanied by a rally in the Treasury market. The 10-yr note climbed throughout the day, pressuring its yield nine basis points to a two-week low of 2.13%. \nAll ten sectors ended in the red with cyclical groups leading the decline. The energy sector (-2.7%) spent the day well behind its peers as crude oil surrendered its weekly gain, ending today's pit session lower by 4.7% at $44.68/bbl. \nElsewhere, heavily-weighted financials (-1.9%) and industrials (-2.2%) also underperformed throughout the day, limiting the market's brief rebound attempt in the late morning. The likes of Citigroup (C 50.29, -1.36) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 60.94, -1.71) both lost near 2.7%, responding to the prospect of lower rates for longer. \nAll things considered, the S&P 500 could have suffered a larger decline, but the top-weighted technology sector (-1.3%) showed some slight relative strength, thanks to Apple (AAPL 113.45, -0.47), which shed 0.4%. Another tech sector member, Adobe Systems (ADBE 81.25, +0.94), also fared better than the broader market, climbing 1.2% after reporting a bottom line beat and issuing cautious guidance. \nWith overall uncertainty running high, volatility protection was in demand, evidenced by a two-point spike in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 22.84, +1.70). Today's participation was well above average, largely thanks to quadruple witching. As a result, more than 2.1 billion shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.\nEconomic data was limited to the Leading Indicators report, which increased 0.1% in August after an upward revision made the growth rate flat (from -0.2%) in July. The Briefing.com Consensus expected the index to increase 0.2%. \nOn Monday, the Existing Home Sales report for August will be released at 10:00 ET (Briefing.com consensus 5.50 million). \nNasdaq Composite +1.9% YTD Russell 2000 -3.3% YTD S&P 500 -4.9% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average -8.1% YTD Week in Review: Fed Holds Pat \nThe stock market began the week on a lower note with the S&P 500 surrendering 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) outperformed slightly. Overall, the Monday affair was very quiet with many investors sticking to the sidelines ahead of Thursday's FOMC policy announcement. To that point, fewer than 800 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor versus a 20-day average of 984 million. A cautious tone was set during overnight action after China and Japan both released disappointing industrial production reports. Equity bulls attempted to turn the tide during European action, but their efforts were not successful with the selling spilling into the U.S. session. The key indices hit their lows shortly after 13:00 ET and remained near those levels until the close. Nine sectors registered losses while the utilities space (+0.3%) eked out a slim gain, which was aided by strength in Treasuries that sent the 10-yr yield lower by two basis points to 2.17%. \nThe market raced higher on Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.4%) pacing the advance while the S&P 500 (+1.3%) followed not far behind. Thanks to the broad-based rally, the S&P 500 erased all of its decline from Monday and then some, settling at its best level since August 28. Although the Tuesday tone differed greatly from Monday, it is worth noting that trading volume remained relatively light with 760 million shares changing hands at the NYSE floor. That total represented a notable decline from the 20-day average of more than a billion shares as some investors continued sticking to the sidelines ahead of Thursday's policy statement from the Fed and a potential fed funds rate hike. The rally began in the futures market shortly after the release of the Retail Sales report for August, which came in just below expectations (+0.2%; Briefing.com consensus +0.3%); however, core sales increased 0.5%, suggesting the presence of some underlying consumption strength. Stocks followed the report's release with a rally while Treasuries began a daylong retreat. The 10-yr note settled on its low with its yield higher by nine basis points at 2.28%. \nThe major averages strung together their second consecutive advance on Wednesday with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9%. The benchmark index extended its weekly gain to 1.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%) underperformed, but still brought its week-to-date advance up to 1.4%. Equities spent the first hour of the day near their flat lines before racing higher alongside the energy sector (+2.8%), which had shown relative strength from the start. That strength was closely linked to the buying surge in crude oil futures that sent the energy component higher by 5.8% to $47.15/bbl. A significant portion of the rally developed after the release of the weekly EIA inventory report, which showed a draw of 2.104 million barrels. \nThursday ended on a lower note after the Federal Reserve made no changes to its policy stance. The S&P 500 shed 0.3% while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.1%) outperformed throughout the day. FOMC days are known for afternoon volatility and the Thursday affair lived up to that billing even though the policy statement from the Federal Reserve was virtually a carbon copy of the previous directive. The FOMC acknowledged positive labor market conditions in the U.S., but indicated that concerns related to an economic slowdown in China have outweighed the domestic positives. Ms. Yellen stressed that these developments have weighed on the inflation outlook, contributing to the decision to maintain status quo. \n4:06 pm Norfolk Southern completes its acquisition of 282 miles of the Delaware & Hudson Railway's line between Sunbury Pa. and Schenectady N.Y. from Canadian Pacific ( CP ) ( NSC ) : \n4:06 pm TICC Capital: NexPoint Advisors issues a statement saying it has identified numerous weaknesses in TPG Specialty Lending's ( TSLX ) offer to acquire TICC ( TICC ) : \nHighlights of their statements include: \nTSLX has presented no path to how it would implement its non-binding acquisition proposal, which has already been rejected by the board of directors of the Company. The deadline has now passed for additional board nominees for election at the Company's October 27 special meeting and TSLX lacks the votes required to present a stockholder proposal. TSLX's negative view of external management is a red herring. What really matters is cost and quality of management. Under both the Benefit Street Partners and the TSLX proposals, stockholders would bear approximately $45-50 million of aggregate additional management fees over the next ten years beyond those under the NexPoint proposal (based on the Company's AUM as of June 30, 2015). Contrary to TSLX's assertion, this $45-50 million of savings does directly benefit stockholders. TSLX is offering an all-stock deal. As a result, the discount reflected in the Company's share price would likely carry over to trading in TSLX shares (in absolute dollar terms) should such a transaction be consummated. NexPoint calls the offer inadequate, saying it only presents an approximately 13% discount to the book value of TIVV 4:03 pm Star Bulk Carriers announces the sale of M/V Maiden Voyage to an unaffiliated third party, has agreed to time charter-in the vessel for a period of two years ( SBLK ) : \n4:01 pm Amgen reports the FDA has accepted for review, its SNDA for Kyprolisor for injection for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma; PDFUA target action date is Jan. 22, 2016 ( AMGN ) : \n3:36 pm Natural Alternatives files a complaint against Creative Compounds, for 'intentionally and improperly trying to mislead NAI's actual and potential customers with regard to beta-alanine' ( NAII ) : \nCo has filed a Complaint against Creative Compounds Inc to stop Creative from intentionally and improperly trying to mislead NAI's actual and potential customers and wrongfully interfering with NAI's CarnoSyn beta-alanine business. \nThe Complaint alleges that, on or about September 5, 2015, Creative, which sells generic beta-alanine, sent an internet communication to customers and potential customers of beta-alanine making numerous false and misleading statements regarding Creative's own generic beta-alanine, NAI, CarnoSyn beta-alanine, and NAI's intellectual property rights 3:33 pm Earnings Preview for the week of September 21 - 25 (:SUMRX) : \nOf the companies reporting earnings for the week of September 21 - 25 some of the bigger names include:\nMonday: Pre Market - LEN, NEOG After Hours - THO, RHT Tuesday: Pre Market - CCL, GIS, KMX, CAG, AZO, DRI, FDS After Hours - CPRT Wednesday: After Hours - JBL, WOR, SCS\nThursday: Pre Market - ACN, KBH, OMN, SCHL After Hours - NKE, BBBY, CTAS, PIR Friday: Pre Market - BBRY, FINL 3:30 pm Treasury Market Summary ( BONDX ) : \nGovernment Yields Plunge \nThe U.S. Treasury complex followed through on its post-FOMC gains from Thursday during today's session, but the primary beneficiary of that rally was the long end of the curve instead of the 2 and 5-year notes which led the way higher yesterday. Steep declines in global equity markets and oil prices encouraged the buying of U.S. government debt and European sovereign debt rallied in sympathy, with the 10-year German Bund yield declining 12 basis points to 0.66%. Greece is holding its general election on Sunday and the race is a toss-up between the left-wing Syriza party and New Democracy on the right.

The data from this analysis has guided the design of the Company's ongoing clinical studies of its Phase 3 compound, Carbavance. \nThe study titled \"Designing Clinical Trials for New Agents in CRE Infection: What is \"Best Available Therapy\" in CRE and How Well Does it Work?\" showed that there was a high morbidity and mortality rate among the population, with a 28-day mortality of 28% that was highest in patients with hospital-acquired (35%) and ventilator-associated (33%) bacterial pneumonia, and lowest among in patients with cUTI/AP (18%). Only 57% of patients achieved a clinical cure and just over half (52%) achieved microbiological eradication. 3:03 pm Merck announces that a Phase 2 study of relebactam in combination with imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, met its primary endpoint ( MRK ) : \nIn the Phase 2 study, relebactam in combination with imipenem/cilastatin demonstrated noninferiority in the percentage of microbiologically evaluable patients with favorable clinical response at the end of intravenous therapy compared to imipenem/cilastatin alone. The addition of relebactam is designed to restore activity of imipenem against certain imipenem-resistant strains of Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. \nBased in part on the results of this Phase 2 study, Merck is planning to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies of relebactam with imipenem/cilastatin given as a fixed-dose combination. A study comparing imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam to colistimethate sodium in combination with imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of imipenem-resistant bacterial infections, including those caused by P. aeruginosa and KPC-producing organisms, is currently recruiting patients 3:03 pm Ampliphi Biosciences reports data demonstrating the efficacy of a novel bacteriophage cocktail, as comparable to Vancomycin, at the ICAAC ( APHB ) : \nCo announced experimental results highlighting that its prototype bacteriophage cocktail demonstrated comparable efficacy to vancomycin in reduction of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in a murine lung infection model. Data from this study were presented at the joint Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and International Congress of Chemotherapy and Infection 2015 meeting. \nTo assess the in vivo efficacy of bacteriophages to treat lung infections, neutropenic immunocompromised (:ICR) mice were inoculated intranasally with S. aureus. At two hours post infection, scaled dosing of the bacteriophage cocktail was administered intranasally to three dosage groups, with a second identical dose administered at six hours post infection.Vancomycin was administered subcutaneously at two and six hours post infection to a fourth, positive control group. Two control groups were infected, but untreated. The groups treated with the bacteriophage cocktail at the two highest doses (1 x 109 and 1 x 108 PFU per phage per dose) showed a 3-log reduction in bacterial cell counts relative to untreated controls at the same time point, which was comparable to the efficacy seen in the positive control group treated with vancomycin. 2:00 pm Major averages extend slow slide off mid-morning bounce highs under opening lows -- Dow -294, S&P -30, Nasdaq Comp -66 (:TECHX) : Relative sector weakness in recent trade has been noted in: Semi SMH, Technology XLK, Software IGV, Crude Oil USO, Steel SLX.\n1:25 pm Notable movers of interest ( SCANX ) : \nThe following are some of today's most notable movers of interest, categorized by market capitalization (large cap over $10 billion and mid cap between $2-10 billion) and ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume). \n\nLarge Cap Gainers \nHCN (68.13 +2.95%): REITs, rate sensitive names outperforming as treasury yields decline ( O , VTR , HCP , AVB also higher).
