The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hit 96.700 after the GDP data, its highest since August 19. The index, which was up 0.26 per cent at 96.230 late Friday afternoon in New York, was on track for a weekly gain of about 1.4 per cent, its strongest since mid-July.\nThe greenback has hit its highest in over two weeks against the Japanese yen of 121.240 yen. The euro was last down 0.35 per cent against the US dollar at $US1.11910.\nLingering scepticism surrounding the view that the Fed would hike rates this year capped the dollar's gains, analysts said. \"The theme is indecision,\" said David Rodriguez, senior strategist at FXCM in New York.\nCommodities\nCopper saw its biggest weekly drop since mid-January on Friday. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed down 0.6 per cent at $US5023 a tonne, bringing losses for the week to 4.3 per cent. Turnover was light due to holidays in Singapore, and ahead of China holidays next week. \"We see copper at around $5,500 (by year-end) but that should be as good as it gets,\" said Carsten Menke, analyst at Julius Baer. \"There will be no drop in supply - there might be mine closures here or there but we expect mine production to grow and at the same time we don't see any region in the world that will ramp up demand growth.\"\nMacquarie has slashed its copper price forecasts. The bank sees average prices at $US5663 for 2015 and $US5713 for 2016. It cut its fourth-quarter price forecast expectation by 6.8 per cent to $US5500.\nNickel bucked Friday's down trend, closing up 0.8 per cent at $US9975. Data showed a 4350 tonne decline in available or 'on-warrant' LME stocks to 243,510 tonnes, the lowest since September 2014.\nUnited States\nThe S&P 500 erased an early Fed-driven rally to close down slightly on Friday, as a selloff in biotechs offset gains in banking shares. For the week, the Dow was down 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent and the Nasdaq was down 2.9 per cent.\nShares of Nike hit a record high after its profit topped expectations on strong China growth. The stock, up 8.9 per cent at $US125, gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500.\nThe Commerce Department said on Friday gross domestic product rose at a 3.9 per cent annual pace in the April-June quarter, up from the 3.7 per cent pace reported last month. The data supports the case that the US economy may be gaining enough strength to withstand an increase in benchmark interest rates.\nThis week's economic data culminates with the September Labor Department payrolls and unemployment report. Forecasts call for job growth of 203,000 versus the prior 173,000, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 5.1 per cent.\nEurope\nEuropean stocks jumped from an eight-month low after Fed chair Janet Yellen said she's ready to raise rates this year, indicating recent market turmoil won't derail the US recovery. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed 2.8 per cent higher on Friday. All 19 industry groups rose at least 1 per cent.\nEurope's benchmark gauge dropped 18 per cent from a peak in April through last Thursday, taking its valuation to 14.6 times estimated earnings, down from a multiple of 17.1 in July. Friday's biggest advance in a month helped the Stoxx 600 trim a second weekly decline. It's down 1.6 per cent for the period as carmakers tumbled after Volkswagen said it cheated on US diesel-emission tests.\nVolkswagen fell 3.8 per cent, reversing an intraday advance of as much as 4.3 per cent, after people familiar with the matter said executives in Germany controlled key aspects of the faked tests. Other auto makers clawed back losses today, with BMW, Daimler and Renaul rising 2.2 per cent or more.\nWhat happened on Friday\nVolatility remains a key characteristic on the local sharemarket, as Friday's session capped another week of wild swings in which the benchmark index briefly slipped below the key 5000-point mark. On Friday, the S&P/ASX200 seesawed 0.6 per cent lower to 5042.1 points, to be down 2.5 per cent for the week, while the All Ordinaries finished at 5076.6, down 2.3 per cent.\nPengana fund manager Tim Schroeders said concerns about China's slowing growth had increased prevailing nervousness, causing the sell-offs and an increasing unwillingness to buy during dips. \"I expect the 5000 level will be tested again, and anything that provides a sniff of negative news will set off disproportionate sell-offs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:32:12.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
