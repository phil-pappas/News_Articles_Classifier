The EU recently eliminated border controls between the 26 Schengen-area countries, requiring asylum seekers to apply for asylum in the first EU country they reach. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her fear that the migrants crisis the EU was facing could destroy the Scghengen open borders treaty if other EU countries did not take in a larger number of refugees. \n\"If we don't succeed in fairly distributing refugees then of course the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,\" she told a news conference in Berlin. \n\"We stand before a huge national challenge. That will be a central challenge not only for days or months but for a long period of time.\" Germany expects 800,000 asylum requests this year, doubling a forecast made at the beginning of the year. The figure amounts to 1% of Germany's entire population. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will be the largest influx in the country's postwar history,\" Thomas de Maiziere, the German interior minister, commented recently. \n\"We can master this challenge. I don't think this will overwhelm Germany; we can handle this.\" Meanwhile, Bulgaria continues building walls to keep migrants out, the same as Hungary, which has erected a 13-foot-tall fence along the Serbian border EU President Donald Tusk emphasised on Monday, during a visit to Slovenia, the relevance of the migration crisis, but stressed that the union \"cannot and should not be blamed for the migration crisis.\" \"This is a very complex problem and requires a complex set of actions. There are no quick fixes. Had there been, they would have been used (a) long time ago.\" Migration summit in Brussels EU ministers were expected to meet in Brussels on 14 September to tackle the increasingly critical situation. \nA joint-statement issued by the home affairs ministers of Germany, France and Britain said they had \"asked the Luxembourg presidency to organise a special meeting of justice and interior ministers within the next two weeks, so as to find concrete steps\" to deal with the situation. \nThe statement also called for reception centres to be set up urgently in Italy and Greece to register new arrivals, and for a common EU list of \"safe countries of origin\". \nMost of the migrants reaching the EU are believed to come from Syria. \nAlso read: Austrian police arrest three suspects after 71 bodies found in lorry UK and France urge EU to act against migrant Calais crisis EC to allow UK to escape asylum quota system Juncker dismisses calls for a new EU summit on immigration", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:34:10.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
