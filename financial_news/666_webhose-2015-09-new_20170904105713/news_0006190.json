Moller-Maersk AMKBY -1.33 % A/S, said Tuesday it would buy a majority stake in Spain’s biggest container-terminal operator, Grup Maritim TCB. The deal adds 11 terminals to the 63 that APMT already operates around the world.\nThe value of the deal wasn’t disclosed, but people with knowledge of the matter said it was “in the hundreds of millions of dollars” and one of the biggest acquisitions in APMT’s history.\nGrup Maritim manages container terminals in Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Turkey and Spain. APMT is the world’s second-biggest port operator, handling around 72 million containers a year, behind Hong Kong’s Hutchison Port Holdings, which handles more than 80 million containers.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

The acquisition comes as the world’s biggest port terminal operators are buying up more container-handling facilities, consolidating the business among fewer big players.\nDrewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. said in a report last month that the activity is being driven by the introduction “ever-larger container ships, combined with the creation of larger shipping line alliances.” That is “placing significantly greater demands on ports and terminals and having far reaching consequences, driving up operating costs and capital expenditure requirements,” Drewry senior analyst Neil Davidson said in the report.\nDrewry forecasts that global container-port demand will grow at an average annual rate of 4.5% over the next five years.\nIn the biggest deal so far this year, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners BIP 0.97 % LP said last month it would buy Australian port and rail operator Asciano for $8.8 billion , and signaled more acquisitions are coming. Dubai-based DP World in April said it would acquire the Fairview Container Terminal in Prince Rupert, Canada.\nGrup Maritim will add more than four million containers to APMT’s capacity. APMT said it expects to complete the deal by the end of the year.\nThe deal marks APMT’s second investment in as many months in South America, following an agreement in August with Colombia’s Compania de Puertos Asociados SA to jointly operate and invest $200 million in the Cartegena port.\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:09:54.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
