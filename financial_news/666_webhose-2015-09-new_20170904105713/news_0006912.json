So I think the next few months or years are going to be very active in this industry.\" Claure said. \"I think it’s going to be exciting times ahead in terms of consolidation but we don’t have any conversations with anybody.” \nSprint burned $2.2 billion (1.44 billion pounds) in cash in the second quarter ended June 30. It is locked in an aggressive price war with its rivals Verizon Communications Inc , AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc which are going after each others' subscribers with promotions that have weighed on growth. \nIn August, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, the majority owner of Sprint, raised its stake in the wireless company to 82 percent from about 80 percent through a share purchase, boosting the market value of the struggling U.S. wireless carrier. It is also setting up two financing vehicles to help Sprint reverse its fortunes. \nThe company has been under pressure to cut costs because of investor concerns it was spending too much to acquire and retain customers and build out its wireless network. \nShares in Sprint were little changed at $4.39 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. \n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:23:53.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
