Mr. Miller succeeded Theodore M. Wright, who will remain on Conn's board as executive chairman.\nThe company also unveiled plans to securitize $1.4 billion of retail installment contract receivables, with closing expected on Sept. 10. The coupon rate to investors is 6.03%.\nConn's will receive upfront proceeds of approximately $1.08 billion, net of transaction costs and reserves.\nSince last year, Conn's has said it was exploring unloading its subprime lending unit in the wake of mounting delinquencies and deteriorating credit scores.\nThe company's board established a credit risk and compliance committee and said Wednesday that an independent evaluation of these areas didn't result in changes to standing practices or procedures. In the past year, however, the company added the positions of chief credit officer and credit compliance officer and named a new chief financial officer.\nIn December, the retailer, which operates primarily in the South and Southwest, said its previous chief financial officer, Brian Taylor, was stepping down amid an increase in delinquencies and deteriorating credit scores in the company's credit-financing business. Conn's provides in-house financing for customers in urban markets with below-average credit scores and household income of between $25,000 and $60,000.\nIn the latest quarter ended July 31, Conn's reported earnings of $16.5 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a profit of $17.7 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.\nRevenue increased 12% to $396 million, mostly reflecting the addition of a net nine new stores over the last 12 months and an increase in same-store sales of 3.1%. Excluding the impact of the company's decision to stop selling videogame products, digital cameras and certain tablets, same-store sales climbed 6.7%.\nAnalysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a per-share profit of 47 cents and revenue of $396 million for the quarter.\nFurniture unit volume increased 28.3%, offset by a 3.1% decrease in the average selling price. The home appliance unit volume rose 21.2%, offset by a 4.6% decrease in the average selling price.\nThe credit segment operating loss was $9 million, down from a loss of $212,000 during the same period last year, mostly due to increased provisions for bad debts. The percentage of customers more than 60 days delinquent was 9.2% as of July 31, compared with 8.7% during the same time last year.\nThe company said Wednesday that it would repurchase up to a total $75 million of common stock or its 7.250% senior notes due 2022.\nThis authorization is the maximum amount permitted under the company's credit facility and senior note indenture. Conn's added that it was terminating its stockholders' rights plan that was enacted in October last year to allow management to launch its strategic review while reducing the likelihood of a hostile takeover.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:42:20.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
