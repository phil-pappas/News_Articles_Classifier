This reflects challenges with marketing efficiencies, media availability and the continued transition towards online advertising, each of which we are working to address,” said Dr. Dolev Rafaeli, PhotoMedex CEO. “Importantly, there have been several encouraging developments for PhotoMedex in recent weeks. We are delighted to be preparing to bring the no!no!™ line of hair removal products back to the Japanese market, following the signing of an agreement with Synergy Trading Corporation last month. Synergy has placed its initial order, and we will be shipping product to them in the coming weeks. We are working closely with Synergy to ensure a successful launch in what historically has been an important market for the brand. In addition, our XTRAC recurring physician business continues to grow, posting a 22% year-over-year increase in revenue during the quarter. We added a net 20 XTRAC systems to our installed base, which now stands at 640 units.” \nHe added, “Our first quarter financial results are within the requirements of our revised forbearance agreement, and we continue to work with our lenders to pursue a satisfactory resolution.” \nReported Financial Results \nRevenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $28.1 million, a decrease of 44% compared with revenues for the first quarter of 2014 of $50.1 million. \nGross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $20.2 million, or 72% of total revenues, compared with gross profit of $39.7 million, or 79% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2015. \nNet loss for the first quarter of 2015 was $10.0 million or ($0.51) per share, which included a $1.7 million loss on discontinued operations, $1.0 million in stock-based compensation expense and $1.9 million in depreciation and amortization expenses. This compares with net loss for the first quarter of 2014 of $0.3 million or ($0.02) per diluted share, which included $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and $1.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses. \nAs of March 31, 2015 the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.2 million, compared with $10.6 million as of December 31, 2014. \nNon-GAAP Measures \nTo supplement PhotoMedex’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, PhotoMedex provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per share. \nPhotoMedex’s reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, nor superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of PhotoMedex’s current financial performance and to provide further information for comparative purposes. \nSpecifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook. In addition, PhotoMedex believes non-GAAP measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release is as follows: \n(Unaudited) \nThree Months Ended Mar 31, (ooo's) except per share amounts 2015 2014 Net income as reported ($ 10,013 ) ($ 345 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization expense 1,865 1,636 Interest expense, net 2,423 47 Income tax (benefit) expense 365 (79 ) EBITDA (5,360 ) 1,259 Stock-based compensation expense, including accelerated vesting \n3,337 1,262 Acquisition costs - 979 Major litigation expenses 223 775 Extraordinary non-recurring debt costs 762 - Non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income ($ 1,038 ) $ 4,275 Fully diluted shares outstanding at March 31 19,794 18,719 Non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income per share ($0.05 ) $ 0.23 About PhotoMedex \nPhotoMedex is a global skin health company providing integrated disease management and aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians and consumers.
