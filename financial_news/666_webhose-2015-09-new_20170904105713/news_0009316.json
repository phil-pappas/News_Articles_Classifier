Photo: G. Bentley\nEmbattled mining equipment rental business Emeco Holdings has sought to reassure investors after suffering a trio of credit rating downgrades.\nFitch Ratings Services cut its credit rating for Emeco on Monday, to B- from B+, just weeks after downgrades from rival ratings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's.\nStandard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating for Emeco to B-, down from B, less than a fortnight ago. Moody's dropped its rating to Caa1 from B3 in late July and named Emeco as the most at risk of default out of its mining services peers.\n\"The consensus view was that the low commodity price environment would continue to impact Emeco despite our recent improvement in performance,\" Emeco said in a market announcement on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement \"The ratings downgrades do not impact Emeco's debt structure or finance costs.\"\nEmeco said it had increased equipment utilisation, cut costs and improved efficiencies over the past 12 months and a continued focus on these areas was \"expected to improve profitability in FY16 and beyond\".\nThe ratings agencies are less confident.\nFitch said on Monday the downgrade reflected a \"deterioration in Emeco's profitability and cash flow generation\" due to challenging market conditions.\n\"The prolonged weakness in global commodity markets has led to a rapid decline in revenue and shrunk Emeco's operating scale,\" the agency said.\n\"The agency expects the current environment to persist over the medium term as mining companies are likely to remain focused on cutting costs, which will negatively impact service providers such as Emeco.\n\"The negative outlook reflects the potential for Emeco's credit profile to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken further or remain weak for longer over the next 24 months.\"\nFitch said Emeco's ability to sustain cost reductions was largely dependent on global commodity prices.\nSimilar concerns were voiced by Standard & Poor's, which said weak commodity prices would continue to apply pressure on Emeco's markets.\n\"In our view, the company remains vulnerable to any further unfavorable business developments as this could lead to a gradual deterioration in its liquidity position,\" Standard & Poor's said.\nMoody's said in August Emeco's \"high leverage, low financial flexibility and weak levels of liquidity\" meant it and peer Bis Industries faced the highest risk of default out of the five Australian mining services companies the agency rated.\nThe majority of Emeco's revenue is derived from the Canadian oil sands sector and the Australian coal sector, which have both been significantly impacted by sharp declines in commodity prices.\nFor the 2015 full-year, Emeco reported a statutory net loss of $123 million, compared to a loss of $224 million in fiscal 2014.\nIn January, Emeco refinanced a $50 million syndicated debt facility with a $75 million asset backed loan to improve its liquidity.\nThe group said on Tuesday it had $36 million cash as at August 31 and the loan remained undrawn, except for $9.6 million of bank guarantees.\nEmeco's $US335 million bonds mature in March 2019.\nFitch also downgraded its ratings on the bonds to B- from BB-, noting the asset-backed loan ranked ahead of the bonds during a default.\n\"The lower bond rating also reflects the sharp decline in the AUD/USD exchange rate since the bond was sold in March 2014, which places a heavier burden on Emeco in Australian dollar terms,\" Fitch said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:59:38.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
