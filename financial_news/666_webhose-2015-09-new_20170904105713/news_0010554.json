A request, he said, had been lodged for the loan of the work to an upcoming \"important Sydney exhibition\".\nSydney art dealer Denis Savill, who bought the 1984 painting for $793,000, well above a high estimate of $600,000, said the exhibition request was not a big deal but the mention may have encouraged people to think of the work as \"a bit blessed\". All sale results include a buyer's premium of 22 per cent while estimates do not.\nSavill bought up big on that first night, declaring he may even have bought about half of it by value. He also picked up Charles Blackman's Girl with Flowers above its estimate for $67,100, and a minor study by Jeffrey Smart, which went for $122,000 on an estimate of $120,000 to $180,000.\nA large Longquan mallet vase, Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) with fish form handles and covered in a broadly crackled pale green glaze, sold for $73,200 on a high estimate of $5000. Fred Williams' Lysterfield Landscape was passed in, but later that night Savill snaffled that too for $294,996 when it had been hoped to go for $350,000 to $450,000. The late sale gave the auction's first day an almost unheard of 100 per cent clearance rate by volume.\nThe result was all the more surprising because three quarters of lots on offer that night were low value artworks, primarily by Australian artists that Elliott had collected in the 1980s and 1990s. But whether it was the modest estimates – some as low as $300 – or Elliott's name that drew out the buyers, these lots did remarkably well. There were several works by Frank Hodgkinson that attracted a flurry of in-room bidding, including his 1985 painting Before the Burn, Arnhem Land , which made $14,640 on an estimate of $3000 to $5000. John R Walker and Henry Mulholland were others who had a few fans in the room.\nOceanic and Asian art also sell strongly As a sign of just how many works exceeded their estimates, the fine art part of the sale made $4.4 million against a low estimate of $2.4 million. But Elliott, a respected Sydney doctor and medical researcher who had long been a patron of the arts, was an unusual collector whose tastes also ranged across Oceanic and Chinese art, which were handled on the next two nights of the sale. All up, across three days and 1015 lots, the Elliott collection brought in $7.03 million with all but 22 lots finding a buyer.\n It helped that Mossgreen marketed the sale heavily, including with a viewing in London. Sumner reports buyers from Germany, France and Britain pursued the Oceanic art, particularly the Papua New Guinea artefacts and bulul figures from the Philippines. Results for these figures varied, but leapt as high as $41,480 against an estimate of $3000 to $5000 for one pair.\nSumner says virtually all the Chinese art went to buyers in China and Singapore, something that \"has been a pattern for a while\". The sale was particularly enticing to these buyers, he says, because Elliott bought many of the pieces in the 1970s before reproductions became as prevalent. The top lot, a Longquan mallet vase from the 13th or 14th century, made $73,200 on a high estimate of $5000, and a tripod censer from the same period made $53,680 on an estimate of $2000 to $3000. The Asian art section made $1,347,880 against a low estimate of $282,330. All up, Paul Sumner and co had plenty to smile about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:12:32.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
