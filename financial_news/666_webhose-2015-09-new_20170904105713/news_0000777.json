More than half-a-billion shares changed hands, or more than one for every IPO share sold, showing that professional investors thought the offering was overpriced. \nWithin a week, the stock had lost 18% and it kept falling until September, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg — whom the IPO had made into one of the world’s richest billionaires — promised not to sell any more shares. While the pledge from Facebook’s largest shareholder stopped the bleeding, allowing the shares to find a floor around $18, it wasn’t enough to save the stock that first year. \nOne year after the offering, the shares closed at $26.25, or 31% lower than their first day’s closing price. During that same 365 days, the Nasdaq composite gained a whopping 26%. \n​When it comes to Internet IPOs that badly lag the returns of the broader market for tech stocks during their first year of trading​, Facebook has plenty of company.​ Alibaba, Twitter, Groupon and Zynga all shared that distinction, as we reported here Monday . \nYet Facebook is alone among that group in one ​crucial​ aspect: Its shares have not only rebounded ​from their post-IPO doldrums, ​but have since soared. The shares this week have been trading between $87 and $90 a share, or more than 135% above their IPO price. \nThose who bought after the IPO froth came off the company’s valuation​, then,​ have been rewarded wi​th ​returns that have trounced the broader market. \nThe Facebook IPO is a reminder of two thing. One is that, in stock buying and selling, timing is everything. It also showed that the IPO process itself sets up a zero-sum game between the listing company and its public investors. \nEvery dollar more that a company raises in the offering is one dollar less left on the table for investors to profit from a subsequent rise in its share price. As with the stock option grants that give to executives and early investors millions of discounted shares, it’s a process that favors insiders over ordinary shareholders. \nInvestors could have done worse than the Facebook IPO, of course. \nThey could have bought IPO shares of Twitter, Zynga or Groupon, the three large Internet offerings of this investment boom that have been least kind to public shareholders. \n(We’ll look at Twitter’s IPO on Wednesday, Zynga’s on Thursday and Groupon’s on Friday.) \nFollow USA TODAY columnist John Shinal on Twitter: @johnshinal. 1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1FBwdpu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:36:26.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
