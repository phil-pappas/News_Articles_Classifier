If it was bad, people wouldn’t be buying them, people wouldn’t be living in them, and we wouldn’t have wonderful city precincts like Southbank.”\nMr Abdelrazaq said the hope was to move towards “smart cities” which operated efficiently using all the technological advances available.\n“Sustainability and environment are very important. Transportation is extremely important, whether people live and walk to their office or whether they drive. Energy is very important,” he said.\n“When we can no longer expand horizontally, we have to go vertically, and the question\nis infrastructure. Singapore and Hong Kong are very dense but they operate very efficiently using the least amount of energy possible. That’s where we need to go.”\nOriginally published as Thumbs up for Brisbane’s rise ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730&h=Thumbs+up+for+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+rise", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fnihpu6h-1227508200891", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730&title=Thumbs+up+for+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+rise", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730&title=Thumbs+up+for+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+rise", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Thumbs+up+for+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+rise&c=THE+man+behind+the+tallest+building+in+the+world+has+given+Brisbane%26%238217%3Bs+steady+rise+to+world+city+the+thumbs+up+-+predicting+it+could+be+%26%238220%3Bthe+centre+of+something+big%26%238221%3B.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-project-director-gives-brisbanes-steady-rise-the-thumbs-up/story-fndbalka-1227508200891?sv=8ef173e7198c51448aa6a18fd32a2730"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:13:27.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
