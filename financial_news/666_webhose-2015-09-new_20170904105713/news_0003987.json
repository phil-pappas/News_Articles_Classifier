It’s that simple. No more pins, no more dial in numbers and no more putting people on hold. Making a group call has never been this easy,” hike messenger founder and CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal said.\nConsumers can get this feature by upgrading to the latest version of hike, which is available on the Google Play Store starting today.\nThe company said group calling has been launched keeping in mind the needs of students and families who love to chat in groups as well as small executive teams whose job demands being in sync with their large teams while on the move.\nLaunched in December 2012, hike has over 35 million users and has raised USD 86 million from Tiger Global and BSB till date.\n 11, 2015 2:32 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T14:04:03.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
