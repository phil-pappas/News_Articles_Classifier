Its dramatic fall weighed heavily on Germany's main stock index, the DAX, which underperformed its peers in Europe.\nIndustry analysts said the VW chairman faces difficult questions in the coming days, particularly when the company's board meets Friday.\n\"At the moment, I'd be surprised if Winterkorn can ride this out, but in Germany there's often a slightly slower process in these matters,\" said Christian Stadler, a professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School who researches the car industry.\nStadler said that if VW were a U.S. company, the CEO would have gone immediately.\nVolkswagen stands accused of skirting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's clean air rules.\nThe EPA said VW used a device programmed to detect when the cars are undergoing official emissions testing. The software device then turns off the emissions controls during normal driving situations, allowing the cars to emit more than the legal limit of pollutants.\nGuido Reinking, a German auto expert, said that for a company to engage in such blatant trickery the company's top executives would have to be informed.\nWinterkorn, an engineer by training, led research and development across the VW group from 2007. He became chairman of the management board in 2009.\n\"It's almost impossible to imagine that he didn't know about this special way of programming the engine,\" Reinking told German television station n-tv.\nVolkswagen marketed the diesel-powered cars, which account for about 25 percent of sales, as being better for the environment. The cars, built in the past seven years, include the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models.\n\"The company will have to recall nearly 500,000 affected cars, which will cost it millions of dollars, and that's even before the damage to its brand and potential fines,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\nThe EPA has ordered VW to fix the cars at its own expense but said car owners do not need to take any immediate action. The EPA insisted that the violations do not pose any safety hazard and said the cars remain legal to drive and sell while Volkswagen comes up with a plan to recall and repair them. However, it said the cars pose a threat to public health.\nThe EPA also indicated the scale of the fines that could be imposed on VW. It said the carmaker could be hit with up to $37,500 per vehicle for the violations - a total of more than $18 billion. The California Air Resources Board is also investigating.\nVolkswagen has had a difficult year, its share price having fallen from over 250 euros amid signs of faltering sales in the U.S. and China.\nVW edged out Toyota to become the world's top-selling automaker in the first half of 2015.\nThe Japanese automaker recalled 9 million cars between 2009 and 2011 after some of its vehicles experienced unintended acceleration, way more than the half-million or so that VW is having to take back. The cost to Toyota, including fines, was a little more $5 billion, Stadler noted.\n\"To some extent the cheating by Volkswagen seems more blatant, but the numbers are lower and there are no fatalities involved,\" Stadler said. \"This suggests that in the 'heat of the moment' the long-term effect on Volkswagen may be overstated. Sure it will hurt, but maybe not quite as bad as we expect right now.\"\nBut a hit to its reputation from the emissions revelations could hamper VW's efforts at a sales rebound in the U.S.\nIf other regulatory authorities decide VW has a case to answer, then the carmaker faces the potential for even bigger fines.\n\"The news so far revolves around the U.S. impact, but if European investigators become interested the potential penalties could multiply very quickly,\" said Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG.\nA spokesman for Germany's environment ministry said that, for now, authorities there were waiting to see how the U.S. investigation develops.\n\"The auto manufacturers have to work closely with U.S. authorities to comprehensively clarify the matter,\" Michael Schroeren told reporters in Berlin. \"We expect reliable information from the car manufacturers so that (German authorities) can check whether comparable manipulation has happened in Germany or Europe.\"\nGovernment spokesman Steffen Seibert declined to comment directly on the case, but said Germany's standing as a leader in environmental protection hadn't been harmed.\n\"Our climate policy stands for itself and I think it's internationally recognized that Germany is one of the drivers on the way to (the international climate summit in) Paris,\" he said.\n___\nPylas reported from London.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
