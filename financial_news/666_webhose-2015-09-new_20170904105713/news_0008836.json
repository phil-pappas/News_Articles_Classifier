Don’t let your guard down simply because you are not in the office. Burglars and cybercriminals are both taking advantage of the situation. \nProtect your home easily by making sure your home looks occupied by having your residence lit well. Installing a smart outlet timer will allow you to control when the lights come on and can deter criminals, said Herman Tau, CEO of Tend, a Fremont, Calif. manufacturer of home video monitoring options.

You can always post a #latergram when you get back.” \nDuring your Labor Day holiday trip, many retailers will be advertising tempting sales. Don’t be foolhardy and check online before you buy that must-have item. \n“Look for what other retailers are charging for the same item without special sale discounts,” said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization. “You may find that what you thought was an amazing sale was no better that normal pricing elsewhere.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:57:13.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
