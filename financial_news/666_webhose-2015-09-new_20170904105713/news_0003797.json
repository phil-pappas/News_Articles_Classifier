Along with Peru, the two Latin American countries are the world’s biggest suppliers of the industrial metal, used in everything from construction to electrical industries. \nThree-month copper futures traded in London hit their highest level since July following news of the quake, which was followed by a tsunami warning. The bounce to $5,440 per tonne was a 10pc increase from the six-year low from last month. \nAlthough the earthquake was a random incident, it does provide some evidence that the true state of the copper market, which has been weighed down by concerns over China’s economy this year, may be healthier than was previously expected. Known as “Doctor Copper” the metal has long been seen as a key barometer for the economic wellbeing of the world as a whole. \nCopper, like all base metals , has been suffering from the perception of a vast oversupply, which was caused by miners rushing to add new capacity over the past decade. That glut in the market has come just as demand for the commodity primarily from China has stalled for the first time in a decade. \nChina may account for nearly half of the world’s copper demand, but the problem is that the appetite of the world’s second-largest economy for the metal is slowing. Demand has fallen by 3pc this year, while production has increased by the same figure, which has left warehouses full to the brim with copper ingots and coil. \nDeutsche Bank said: “The structural slowdown in Chinese metals demand has been exacerbated by the cyclical weakness in property construction in our view. Copper is by no means immune to this slowdown.” \nThe market reacted positively to the quake because it hoped that a natural disaster would do what most mining companies have been so reluctant to do: cut production. Glencore is the only major mining group to have acted on the oversupply in the copper market so far. The company said it will cut 400,000 tonnes per year of output from its African copper mines as part of its scheme to slash its debt by about $10bn. However, on the whole mining companies have been reluctant to cut back on supply after investing billions to develop new mines. Copper, which is difficult to mine, is often given a scarcity premium by mining companies and the market, which makes producers more reluctant to cut back on supply during slumps. \nCopper mines are also expensive to maintain, with the quality of ore deteriorating at a much faster rate than other resources, especially iron ore. Some mine operations were disrupted in Chile but the country’s major mining group, Antofagasta , said that output from its major pits would be largely unaffected. Since then, operations have gradually been restarted. \nAlthough prices quickly resumed their downward trend and again took a tumble following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates unchanged amid concerns over the global economy, the short-term bounce does suggest that prices may be hovering around their lows because the pace of investment into new mines has started to slow. Prices fell to around $5,361 per tonne last week following Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen’s speech. \nMining companies have been reluctant to shut operational mines but billions of dollars have been slashed from capital expenditure across the industry, which means no new resources are being developed. According to analysis from Deutsche Bank, the world’s top 20 copper mines will produce 7pc more ore this year than they did in 2000, but their share of the market has slipped to 32pc from 52pc over the same period. \nAt the same time, the quality of ore that is being mined is dropping at a rapid rate. The German investment bank estimates that copper grade quality in these leading mines has fallen by 3pc annually over the same period and that increases in output have been achieved only by investment into more efficient milling processes. \nDeutsche Bank said: “Lower Chinese demand growth will be offset by lower supply growth, but we still forecast a surplus market for the next three years. After the final flourish of new mines, there is a dearth of new supply, which we think will move the market back into a deficit.” \nThe next big question is whether Chinese demand for copper will bounce back more quickly than the market believes. Clearly, China won’t achieve its desired 7pc growth this year, even if the figures that we’re presented with by Beijing try to paint a better picture. Most of China’s copper usage is weighted towards its construction sectors and power generation industries, which are both highly sensitive. \nHowever, it is unlikely that China’s government will allow the recent stock market turmoil , which wiped billions of dollars off the value of stock, to cause structural damage without further stimulus measures, which should support copper prices. \nDeutsche Bank said: “Chinese demand is now structurally lower and is unlikely to recover back to the pre- 2012 growth rates. \n“However, there is a growing expectation that given the various monetary easing measures, fiscal support measures from the central government to the local governments, and improving government coffers, there will be a recovery in the latter half of the year.” \nCopper, like all major commodities, is going through a period of transition. The concern is that in cutting back on investment, mining companies are creating an environment in which within a few short years demand once again begins to outstrip supply sending copper prices skyrocketing again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T01:12:55.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
