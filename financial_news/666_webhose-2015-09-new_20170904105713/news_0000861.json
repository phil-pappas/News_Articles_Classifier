However, in the midst of all this 'free game viewing', there has come a report from the Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) that about 360 wild animals in the park die each year due to recklessness on the part of some drivers along the 50-kilometre road stretch across the park. \nThis means that one animal is being killed every day by vehicles passing through the park, which is cause for much concern as we can't go on with this trend indefinitely given the economic and environmental importance attached to our rich wildlife heritage. \nIt is gratifying to note, according to the park's officials, that the government has hinted at plans to divert the highway's direction to avoid vehicle passage across the park. Concern has been raised, however, that the plan is taking too long to materialise since it was initiated almost 10 years ago. \nAs if the wildlife carnage is not enough cause for worry, passengers and other road users wantonly litter the road stretch by throwing plastic containers and food leftovers, some of which are eaten by animals, disturbing their ecological balance and behavioural patterns in the process. \nWild animals are supposed to remain wild, eat wild and act wild! But already, some of them are reported to have changed their behavioural pattern by actually spending time along the roadsides, waiting for the various food items discarded by passengers, including bread and biscuit! \nThe wanton littering is also a headache for park workers who have to clear the about a ton of litter discarded along the park stretch every month. All these point to the need for bus managements to educate their passengers against throwing litter along the road stretch. \nThe fact that they are passing through a location of national economic and heritage importance should be imparted.
