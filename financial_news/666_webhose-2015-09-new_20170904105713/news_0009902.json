A steadily weakening yen also helped boost Japanese shares.\n\"Abe's speech sparked speculation that he won't be sitting idly to let the economy flop. Investors thought there will be a rebooting of Abenomics,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nThe prime minister's fiscal policy has yet to translate into gains in real wages for Japanese workers, and market participants said easing the corporate tax burden is a step toward giving companies more profits to put into employees' pockets.\n\"The bottom line is Japan needs Abe's third arrow to fly,\" said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading in Hong Kong.\n\"Japan Inc has been making tremendous profits thanks to the weak yen, but they have yet to put those profits towards increasing capital expenditures or real wages for workers. Corporate tax breaks are one way of encouraging companies to do those things now that it's clear Abe's corporate governance reforms failed to shame them into action.\"\nLong-term investors also saw the Nikkei's dip to a seven-month low on Tuesday as a good opportunity for bargain-hunting as the Nikkei was trading around 14 times forecast earnings.\nThe country's public pension funds, which have been stepping up stock investment under Abe, are likely to be among them.\n\"Long-term investors such as public pension funds seem to be buying stocks today,\" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.\nAll of the Topix's 33 sub-sectors were in positive territory. Its pharmaceutical sub-index, which shed 5.2 percent on Tuesday, bounced back to gain 8.8 percent as bargain hunters scooped up oversold shares in industry giants such as Takeda, which climbed 7.7 percent.\nBrokerage stocks jumped, with Nomura Holdings up 8.7 percent and Daiwa Securities Group rising 6.9 percent.\nExporters also gained. Toyota Motor Corp jumped 6.3 percent and Honda Motor Co leapt 6.6 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 6.4 percent to 1,507,37, with turnover hitting 3.14 trillion yen, more than 15 percent above the average in the past 100 days.
