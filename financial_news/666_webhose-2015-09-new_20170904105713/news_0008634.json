Patients on Opdivo also reported better quality of life, according to the results.\nBristol-Myers said it plans to apply for approval for the new use of Opdivo, which already is prescribed for lung cancer and melanoma and costs about $150,000 a year. Using the drug for kidney cancer patients could eventually add more than $1.3 billion of sales for New York-based Bristol-Myers, according to a Sept. 22 report from David Risinger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:01:44.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
