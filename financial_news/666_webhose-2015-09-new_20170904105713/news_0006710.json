View photo\nUBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti, pictured June 11, 2013, says he is \"pleased\" with the banking giant's latest quarter (AFP Photo/Fabrice Coffrini) >\nSergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, has said what many in financial services have long thought needs to be said. Risk-taking and mistake-making are acceptable. Try to eliminate all risk-taking, and threaten to punish all mistakes and the ensuing culture of fear - I find the German translation, Angstkultur, even more evocative - will limit the pursuit of legitimate business.\nHe is right. But there are some important caveats, some of which Mr Ermotti added to his address to the bank's senior executives. One is that the mistakes should be \"honest\". Another is that the organisation's culture should be strong enough to prevent any doubt in the minds of employees about what constitutes an honest mistake.\nUnfortunately, \"mistake\" remains a popular euphemism among bank bosses for some very grave errors of judgment and failures of risk management, implying that even some intentional unethical acts are accidental. Another problem is that the extent and durability of improvements in corporate culture are extremely hard to assess and measure.\nWhen Antony Jenkins took over as Barclays' chief executive in 2012, he admitted the bank had made \"serious mistakes\" - which was one way of describing the hundreds of millions of pounds levied by regulators on Barclays and others for manipulating interest rates. He vowed those mistakes would not be repeated.\nMore from the Financial Times \nUBS chief says it is OK to make mistakes UBS to offer social investment fund UBS shares slip despite surge in profits UBS: costs and benefits Earlier this year, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, issued a more nuanced description of his bank's policy, to be read in the wake of such errors as the bank's \"London Whale\" derivatives losses.\nIn a lengthy declaration about how to create the right culture, he wrote that \"we need to develop a safe environment where people can raise issues and admit and analyse mistakes without fear of retribution\". Referring, like Mr Ermotti, to the downside of adding more layers of compliance and regulation, he also said \"we cannot allow this to devolve into crippling bureaucratic activity or create a culture of back-stabbing and blame\".\nBefore he was removed as chief executive, Mr Jenkins had set in motion the \"Transform\" programme of culture change at Barclays. It was based on a range of different methods - including employee and customer surveys - for monitoring whether behaviour and attitudes had indeed been transformed. But when I talked to him about this in 2013, he told me it would still be a \"five- to 10-year journey\".\nA report last year by Cass Business School and the New City Agenda think-tank went further, pointing out that banks' culture change initiatives \"remain relatively fragile\" and saying it would take a generation to change the aggressive sales mentality in British retail banking.\nEven then, it would not be the end of the road. Misbehaviour, fostered by amnesia, complacency and greed, seeps quickly back into companies whose way of working is not actively cultivated and policed. The British regulator, for instance, has said that multiple banks' rigging of currency markets dated from 2008 to October 2013, after it had started investigating the problem, and long after the crisis had focused public and regulatory attention on banks' cultures. The tendency to make dishonest mistakes appears to have a very long half-life.\nClearly, if bank staff were cowed by Angstkultur for a generation, risking little and fearing much, their clients would suffer. Individuals and businesses would find it harder to raise finance for new projects; economic growth would suffer. Risk is not just a threat, but also an opportunity. Mr Ermotti is sending a strong message from the top to that effect. I just hope he is as certain that UBS's culture has changed as he is that now is the time to loosen the leash a little.\nandrew.hill@ft.com\nCopyright Â© 2015 The Financial Times Limited.
