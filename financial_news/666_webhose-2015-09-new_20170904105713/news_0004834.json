Around 75 per cent of the world’s unpaid work is undertaken by women, including the vital tasks that keep households functioning such as child care, caring for the elderly, cooking and cleaning.\n“Using conservative assumptions, MGI estimates that this unpaid work could be valued at USD 10 trillion per year, an amount roughly equivalent to 13 per cent of global GDP,” the report said.\nFirst Published on September 24, 2015 7:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:26:11.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
