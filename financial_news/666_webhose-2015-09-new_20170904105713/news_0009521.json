A spokeswoman said the company does not comment on personnel matters.\nAmerican Apparel Piñata\nThis article originally appeared on the New York Post .\n Workers bash CEO look-alike piñata", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/protesters-bash-american-apparel-ceo-look-alike-piata/story-fnkgbb6w-1227517320061", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/armed-guards-stationed-at-american-apparel-hq-amid-rising-tensions/story-fnkgbb6w-1227505799583", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOWn5UIezMY", "http://nypost.com/2015/09/05/protesters-bash-american-apparel-ceo-look-alike-pinata/"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:00:28.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
