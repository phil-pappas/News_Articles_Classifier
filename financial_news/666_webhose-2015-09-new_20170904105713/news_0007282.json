(9/22/15)--The kids are just back to school, but some people already are doing their holiday shopping. About one in seven American adults--32 million--already are crossing items off of their gift lists, according to a survey by CreditCards.com conducted over Labor Day weekend ( USAToday Sept. 15). \nParents are twice as likely as those without kids to have already started shopping. With the flexibility of online shopping and special retail promotions, it's no surprise that people have started early. \nAbout one in four holiday shoppers hope to have their shopping complete by the end of November. \nIf you're heading to the mall or another retailer: Hold off on TV and computer purchases. Sometimes deep discounts show up closer to the holidays. Check out \"doorbusters\" before you head to the store. Store employees may tell you whether the item is expected to sell out within a few hours after the store opens. Call and ask how many units of the item you wish to purchase are available for sale; and Hold on to expired coupons. Some retailers may honor them anyway, particularly if they're worried about lower-than-normal sales at year-end. It doesn't hurt to ask. \nIf you're shopping online: Know the seller. Make sure you can find the physical address and phone number in case you have problems or questions. Remember, legitimate sellers don't ask for personal or financial information in email or pop-up messages; Know the bottom line. What's the total cost, including shipping, and can you find the product description? Read the fine print. If you see words such as \"refurbished\" or \"close-out,\" you may be in for a let-down. Many online retailers offer \"free shipping\" days throughout the holiday shopping season. If you can wait, it's smart to hold off on your purchases until then; Know the return and refund policies. Each seller can set its own policies, and they may not be in your best interest; Keep a record of online transactions. Print the product description, price, receipt, and any correspondence; Use a credit card for online purchases. You have federal protections with credit cards that you don't have with other forms of payment. Always read your statement carefully to check for unauthorized charges; and Read the privacy policy. It tells you how your personal information will be collected and used. If you can't find it, shop elsewhere. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:13:58.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
