Nigerian exports are set for further growth in October. \nOutput in Iran, eager to reclaim its spot as OPEC's second-largest producer if and when sanctions are lifted, is edging up, the survey found, and Qatar posted a small supply rise after an accident involving an offshore rig in July that an industry source said slowed output. \nKuwait's output was stable although the United Arab Emirates is pumping more crude due to increasing supplies from its Upper Zakum field, sources in the survey said. \nTop exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady in September as reduced use of crude in domestic power plants was offset by a gentle uptick in exports towards the latter part of the month. \nSaudi output remains close to the record high of 10.56 million bpd it pumped in June, as it focuses on market share. Riyadh has regained some market share in 2015, according to a Reuters analysis published on Wednesday. \nLibyan supply edged lower in September. Output remains disrupted by unrest, and negotiations to reopen closed oil facilities have yet to succeed. \n(Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:55:16.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
