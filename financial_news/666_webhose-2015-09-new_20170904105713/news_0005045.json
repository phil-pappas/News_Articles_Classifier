Photo: Vince Caligiuri\nNearly seven years of zero interest rates in the United States , and unprecedented levels of quantitative easing over that period, means the conventional wisdom that sees most financial planners recommend clients \"dial down the risk\" of their savings portfolio upon retirement no longer holds true.\nInstead of dumping shares and property to shift the bulk of their capital into cash and bonds, retirees need to stick with high-yielding growth assets, argues Martin Currie chief investment officer Reece Birtles.\n\"Today's retirees are not only living longer, but they need to make their savings last in a low-growth, low interest rate, post-GFC world where asset prices have been inflated by central banks. Defensive asset classes, such as term deposits and bonds, just aren't going to deliver enough income for people to live on in retirement,\" he said.\n\"The traditional approach whereby investors switch their asset allocation, from a 70:30 growth to defensive assets split during their working years, into reverse when they retire, is not going to work anymore\".\nAdvertisement Mr Birtles is urging retirees and their advisers to worry less about how share prices might fluctuate, and give more consideration to the relative value of the dividends stocks offer.\n\"Most people don't have a high enough balance when they retire to start drawing down on their capital, so they need to ensure their portfolio is going to earn enough income\".\nAverage needs According to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia's retirement standard calculator the average retired couple needs $58,784 a year in retirement income to fund a \"comfortable\" lifestyle. The age pension can provide couples nearly $34,000 a year.\n\"That leaves most people looking to make up a shortfall of between $20,000 to $30,000 from their retirement savings, which would require a combined savings balance of around $600,000,\" Mr Birtles said.\n\"Australia's age pension is designed on the assumption people can earn a yield of between 4 to 5 per cent on superannuation invested in a traditionally \"defensive\" portfolio dominated by cash and bonds, but that just isn't possible anymore and isn't likely to be for some years to come\".\nAt the time of writing market watchers around the world were eagerly awaiting the US Federal Reserve's September rates decision , due early Friday morning Australian time. Economists and futures traders were pricing the chances of a rate hike at around 30 per cent, the most hawkish predictions since the US cash rate was slashed to near zero in December 2008.\n\"Even if US interest rates rise back to 5 per cent over the coming years, it could take a lot longer for bond yields to catch up,\" Mr Birtles said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/economy/monetary-policy/meet-the-10-people-with-the-fate-of-the-world-in-their-hands-20150916-gjoilv", "http://www.afr.com/markets/whatever-the-fed-does-its-for-aussie-investors-to-rethink-their-strategies-20150916-gjok5v"], "published": "2015-09-17T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:00:46.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
