Paul Harris by Ben Smythe The saying goes: with change comes opportunity. In the new world of refunding excess superannuation contributions, should you now be exploring the option of exceeding your contribution cap?\nLook first at the changes. Prior to 2013-14 any breach of the concessional or non-concessional contribution cap, inadvertent or otherwise, was punished severely. After years of intense lobbying, we now have a more equitable system with far less drastic tax consequences.\nWith respect to excess concessional (ECC) and excess non-concessional contributions (ENCC), you can now elect to release the ECC from your SMSF. In total, a maximum of 85 per cent of any ECC can be released. Where you make an ENCC, you can elect to release up to 100 per cent of the ENCC plus up to 85 per cent of the \"associated earnings\" – a figure that is calculated by the ATO.\nWith respect to the tax treatment, ECCs – whether they are released or not, will automatically be included in your assessable income and taxed at your marginal tax rate with a 15 per cent tax offset. You will also need to pay what is called the excess concessional contributions charge, and a shortfall interest charge. Importantly these charges, together with the ATO's associated earnings calculation for ENCC, are applied from the start of the year in which the excess contribution is made, and not simply from the date of the excess contribution.\nWhere you elect to release ENCC, there is no additional tax on the actual released amount. However the associated earnings will be included in your assessable income and taxed at your marginal tax rate, again with a 15 per cent tax offset. Where you elect to not release the ENCC, it will simply be taxed in your fund at the top marginal tax rate, and associated earnings are ignored.\nSo are there any circumstances where you would consider leaving excess contributions in your SMSF? First, the timing of the additional charges for ECC makes it quite punitive if you actually make the excess contribution towards the end of the financial year (which is often the case). For this reason, there is very little scope for exceeding the concessional cap and for most people, the tax treatment of receiving the excess in salary versus contributing it to your SMSF will be the same.\nUnpalatable to exceed cap When looking at ENCC, requiring an associated earnings figure to also be withdrawn (currently calculated at 9.61 per cent) does make it unpalatable in almost all cases to exceed the cap. As noted, this calculation is also from July 1 in the year of excess, which may force you to withdraw more than was actually earned in the fund with respect to the excess contribution.\n If you decide to leave the ENCC in your SMSF, then it will be taxed at 49 per cent. This makes it very unattractive, and it would make sense to withdraw the excess in most cases.\nHowever, the way the excess contribution is released may present some opportunities. The amount released is actually treated as a benefit payment (but is not taxed as a benefit payment). If, for example, you are in the pension phase, then you can also use the released amount to count towards your minimum pension payment requirement, including the 10 per cent for transition to retirement pensions.\nYou can also choose the account in your SMSF from which to draw the released amount. So, for example, if you have multiple transition to retirement pensions, you could consider drawing from the pension that is fully preserved.\nThe released payment is also not subject to the proportioning rules, allowing you to reduce your taxable component if you are in accumulation phase.\nWhile the rules around the treatment of excess contributions have now changed, there is still very little scope to exceed your contributions caps. However, there are some tactical options to consider if you do have an excess contribution, as the actual refunding mechanics present some opportunities for consideration.\nBen Smythe is the principal of Smythe Financial Management and a founder of Eviser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T16:51:02.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
