The country is Africa’s largest producer of crude, which accounts for about 90 percent of total exports and two-thirds of government revenue. JPMorgan placed Nigeria on index watch in January, saying the foreign-exchange measures made it more difficult for foreign investors to replicate the gauges.\n“Investors who track the GBI-EM series continue to face challenges and uncertainty while transacting in the naira due to the lack of a fully functional two-way FX market and limited transparency,” JPMorgan said in the statement. “As a result, Nigeria will be removed.”\nNigeria will not be eligible for re-entry for at least 12 months from the date of exclusion, JPMorgan said. The country has a 1.5 percent weighting in the biggest GBI-EM index, which is tracked by $183.8 billion of funds, according to the bank.\nEmefiele has repeatedly said that Nigeria wants to remain in the indexes and that there’s enough liquidity in the currency market for foreigners to buy and sell naira bonds. Average yields on those securities rose 11 basis points to 16.04 percent on Sept. 7, the highest among 18 countries included in the GBI-EM indexes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nIbrahim Mu’azu, a spokesman for the Abuja-based central bank, didn’t answer calls to his mobile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:06:52.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
