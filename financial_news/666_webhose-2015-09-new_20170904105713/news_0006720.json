People can use online services to barter goods, arrange for lodging in a private home rather than using a (possibly bed-bug-infested) hotel, share a bicycle, have a package delivered, lend or borrow money, find someone to work for you, earn employment, share an office or make a payment, typically using a smartphone.\nThe sharing economy is becoming more popular among younger people. One obvious reason is Uber’s success. There was a time when I never tried to hail a cab in midtown Manhattan. It was just too annoying. But more recently, I walked out the door, approached 6th Avenue and instantly had three yellow-cab hacks vying for my business. Uber has really opened up this business, enabling a much larger supply and turning what was a seller’s market into a buyer’s market.\nOther reasons include efficiency, cost control and even concern for the environment.\n“Despite the attention paid to some of the individual ‘sharing’ companies, we believe that significant uncertainty or skepticism remains with investors on whether sharing businesses more broadly have longevity and which of them will ultimately prove to be truly disruptive,” Credit Suisse analyst Eugene Klerk said in a report Friday.\nKlerk and his research team cited an estimate from PWC that sharing revenue may reach $335 billion by 2025, which would imply a compounded annual growth rate of more than 25%.\n“This may appear large; however, it only represents 0.4% of 2014 global GDP. Supply constraints to sharing appear limited given the growing share of freelancers and part-timers,” Klerk said.\nThe Credit Suisse researchers looked at nine economic subsectors and considered which publicly traded companies might benefit from the sharing trend.\nFirst, here’s a list of companies that Credit Suisse expects to see a “positive” effect from increasing collaborative activity, sorted by the business subsector affecting the company:\nCompany Ticker Business subsector Credit Suisse stock rating Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, -3.15% Autos Outperform Axa SA Sponsored ADR AXAHY, -3.37% Autos Outperform Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, -3.90% Autos Outperform JCDecaux SA JCDXF, -2.35% Bicycles Neutral Shimano Inc. Unsponsored ADR SHMDF, +3.34% Bicycles Neutral HomeAway Inc. AWAY, -2.00% Hotels Neutral TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -1.48% Hotels Outperform Amazon.com Inc.

Class A YELP, -2.16% Social media Outperform Source: Credit Suisse For companies based outside the U.S., with main classes of shares traded on non-U.S. exchanges, we have used tickers for American Depositary Receipts where possible.\nAvis Budget Group Inc. CAR, -3.15% and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, -3.90% can obviously benefit from a long-term move away from car ownership, provided Uber-type ride sharing leads to it. According to Klerk, Axa SA AXAHY, -3.37% can also make gains, as global property and casualty insurers “should benefit as companies such as Uber are likely to want a global insurance policy for their vehicles.”\nHere are some comments about the other companies listed above:\nKlerk said the expansion of bicycle sharing should benefit JCDecaux SA JCDXF, -2.35% since it is “one of the largest operators ... globally.” He added that there could be an indirect benefit to bicycle manufactures. Shimano Inc. SHMDF, +3.34% makes bicycle components, as well as fishing equipment. HomeAway Inc. AWAY, -2.00% connects travelers with owners and managers of vacation rental properties globally. TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -1.48% operates several websites, in many languages, featuring user-generated reviews of hotels, vacation rental properties, restaurants and other businesses. Klerk said TripAdvisor could “expand its offering to sharing accommodation.” Amazon.com AMZN, -2.03% is an obvious play on the sharing economy, because of its leading position in the sale of used merchandise. Regus PLC RGU, -1.53% provides office space and related services worldwide. Lending Club Corp. LC, -1.08% connects borrowers and lenders “to engage in transactions relating to standard or custom program loans,” including personal, education and business loans, in the company’s words. Investors can buy notes secured by the loans. Visa Inc. V, -1.34% of course, is one of the leading credit-card payment processors. Klerk says the stock should be considered by investors “expecting structural growth” of peer-to-peer lending. EBay Inc. EBAY, -0.89% and MercadoLibre Inc. MELI, -1.70% each provide online marketplaces for the sale of products and services. MercadoLibre operates in Latin America. Klerk said both companies could benefit from growth in the “sharing (and selling) of pre-owned goods.” LinkedIn Corp. LNKD, -0.23% is the best-known online recruitment tool, while Facebook Inc. FB, -2.30% and Yelp Inc. YELP, -2.16% facilitate contact between businesses and consumers.
