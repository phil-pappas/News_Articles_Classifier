By comparison, Vocus focuses on the corporate broadband market.\nThe merger will create the nation's fourth-largest telecommunications company and the third-largest in New Zealand with $1.8 billion in annual revenues and a market capitalisation of over $3 billion.\n\"A Scheme Booklet is expected to be dispatched to M2 shareholders in late 2015,\" both parties said in a statement. \"M2 shareholders will vote at a Scheme meeting expected to be held in early 2016.\n\"Subject to the conditions of the Scheme being satisfied, the Scheme Implementation Date will be early 2016.\"\nVocus chief executive James Spenceley will become executive director alongside M2 founder Vaughan Bowen while M2 chief executive Geoff Horth will become CEO of the combined business.\nBut questions are likely to arise from M2 shareholders about whether the deal fairly values their holdings. M2 had a market capitalisation of almost $2 billion in mid-August and has experienced sharp declines over the past month that saw its share price fall by 20 per cent.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also made it clear earlier this year that it was unlikely to approve any further consolidation of the broadband market. M2 and Vocus will hope that the different market segments that both companies target will allow its deal to be approved by the regulator.\n The deal will need ACCC approval to go ahead.\nThe move comes after M2's failed bid to buy out iiNet, which was eventually purchased by TPG Telecom for $1.56 billion.\nTPG had also unsuccessfully opposed Vocus' acquisition of corporate telecoms rival Amcom.\nâ€‹More to come", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-09-28T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:08:25.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
