Dominic Lorrimer by Trevor Sykes This may be only my hip pocket speaking, but the big four bank shares are looking oversold.\nANZ will serve as an example. On August 6 ANZ announced it had made a placement for $2.5 billion at $30.95 a share. That was below the prevailing share price, which had been generally ranging between $32 and $33.\nANZ simultaneously announced it would raise a further $500 million or more through a shareholder purchase plan, in which existing holders would be limited to purchases of $15,000. The price would be the lower of $30.95 or the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the previous five days' trading, less 2 per cent.\nThe bank didn't give dates saying when the VWAP would be determined. That meant any sane existing shareholder would refrain from buying shares until the VWAP dates were announced, because it was in the interest of the existing investors for the price to be as low as possible.\nPredictably, the price of ANZ shares began sliding immediately and they have ever since been trading between $26 and $28. Learned analysts have blamed the weakness on the dilutionary effect of the placement, on perceived weaknesses in ANZ's business, and on the higher capital being required.\nNot many commentators blamed the bank itself, even though it wasn't in many investors' interest to support the stock while a shareholder purchase plan was overhanging the market. ANZ's last annual report showed it had 22,503 shareholders, but only 85 of them held more than 10,000 shares. Hardly any of the other 22,418 would have had a good reason to buy shares ahead of the shareholder purchase plan.\nIt was not until August 17 that ANZ announced the closing date for the VWAP would be September 8. In the event, ANZ raised $720 million at $26.50 a share. ANZ is presumably happy now that it has ample capital, and investors (including me) should be happy to have expanded their ANZ holdings at a price not seen on the market since the start of 2013. Everyone who wanted an ANZ share has now got one at what appears a good price.\nCBA is another example. Its shares were touching $88 before it announced a $5.1 billion raising in early August. That busted the share price as low as $71.26, which was just below the $71.50 paid by small shareholders in an entitlement offer.\n Together with an institutional offer, CBA has raised $3.6 billion with the final $1.5 billion to come from a bookbuild in which the bank will sell the shortfall from the retail offer. Before holding the bookbuild, CBA took the unusual step of asking the bidders to declare whether they have been shorting the stock.\nPerhaps that question should be asked more often by companies. The short position in CBA has risen 25 per cent – from 23 million shares to 30 million – since mid-August. Pretty obviously, some big short-sellers were intending to make a quick, large profit by bidding low in the bookbuild to cover their positions.\nCBA wants to find out who they are, but whether it will succeed is an open question. Meanwhile the bank appears to have a enjoyed a minor success because the share price, which had been heading down, stabilised above $75 while the shorters thought about their positions.\nFinally Westpac, which touched $40 back in April, has been belted as low as $29.20 and is trading between $30 and $31 as this column is written. Unlike its three big rivals, Westpac has not made a large rights issue and has not yet said it will. However, the investment world (doubtless including a few shorters) are keeping its price down in case it does.\nSo while nothing has changed at Westpac up until now, its share price is close to its lowest levels for the past year.\nAll this suggests that when (and if) logic ever returns to this sharemarket, the bank prices should start heading upwards again. But don't hold your breath.\nTrevor Sykes has interests in ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:25:56.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
