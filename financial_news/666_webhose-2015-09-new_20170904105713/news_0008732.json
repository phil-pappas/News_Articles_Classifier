Although that date is just around the corner, many small businesses are unaware of the shift. 1 \nThe liability shift is directly tied to the rollout of EMV chip technology in the United States. Currently, credit cards have a magnetic strip encoded with basic information that the terminal captures when the card is swiped. The information is passed on for authentication and authorization. 2 \nEMV changes the process. EMV relies on a secure chip memory and an intelligent processor to enable different card authentication and cardholder verification methods. 3 As Visa explains, its EMV chip cards \"protect in-store payments by generating a unique, one-time code needed for the transaction to be approved.\" 4 \nOn October 1, 2015, as between the issuing financial institution and the merchant, in-store counterfeit fraud liability will shift to the party that has not adopted EMV technology . 5 Three scenarios help explain the shift: Magnetic-stripe card at magnetic stripe terminal . If a traditional magnetic stripe card is swiped by a customer at a magnetic stripe terminal, liability for the counterfeit transaction will remain, like today, with the issuing financial institution. That is because neither party has adopted the EMV technology. 6 Chip card at magnetic stripe terminal . If a chip card is used at a traditional magnetic stripe terminal, the merchant will generally be liable for a fraudulent transaction because the issuing bank has provided EMV technology, but the merchant has not. 7 Chip card at chip-enabled terminal . If a chip card is used at a chip-enabled terminal that has been activated by the merchant, the merchant will not be liable and liability will remain with the issuing bank. 8 \nThere are notable exceptions to the new liability shifting rule. Liability for automated fuel dispensers and ATM transactions shifts at a later date, and the liability shift does not apply to card-not-present transactions. 9 \nIf your business accepts credit card payments through card present transactions—meaning your customer is physically present and swipes a credit card to make payment—act now to implement EMV technology in advance of the liability shift. \n2 Phillip Miller, Guy Berg, Jeff Stroud & Steven Paese, EMV for U.S. Acquirers: Seven Guiding Principles for EMV Readiness , MASTERCARD ADVISORS (July 2012). \n3 Id. at 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T00:55:23.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
