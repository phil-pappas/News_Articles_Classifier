Bradley Kanaris Share on twitter by Michael Smith Have early cracks emerged in the uneasy truce between supermarkets and their suppliers or has the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) jumped the gun over what looks like an administrative issue which has been blown out of proportion?\nThe ACCC on Thursday took Woolworths and Aldi to task over the way they are implementing a code of conduct designed to end years of conflict between the two sides.\nThe code, launched in July, was supposed to end the adversarial and conflict-driven relationship between the supermarkets and thousands of suppliers who had long complained they were being unfairly pressured.\nJust three months in and ACCC chairman Rod Sims is suggesting its not working. Sims says he has been receiving complaints from suppliers that things have not got off to a good start and the supermarkets have given the impression supply agreements are non-negotiable.\n\"We were hoping the code would being about a change of approach. We are still hopeful it will. Our concern is at least Woolworths and Aldi haven't got off to a great start,\" says Sims, who says the supermarkets have given suppliers the impression they cannot negotiate the terms of the agreements.\nBut Woolworths and some suppliers are disappointed with the way the ACCC is handling the issue. The code was supposed act as a circuit breaker when there was a problem, removing the need to get lawyers involved. The supermarkets also hoped this also meant the media would not be alerted when there was a problem.\nWoolworths will argue the complaints that Sims is referring to stem from a misunderstanding around an administrative process relating to supplier agreements which it was working to resolve.\nIt is understood the ACCC wrote to Woolworths several weeks ago after the supermarket group told suppliers not to make changes to supply agreements. It is common practice in the industry to amend agreements by writing over the top of them, crossing out words or attaching changes with post-it notes. Woolworths asked suppliers to instead put the proposed changes in a letter and properly register it.\n After the ACCC complaint, Woolworths wrote to around 1000 suppliers who had not yet signed the code to try and clear up the confusion by stating that the request was referring to the administrative process and did not mean the agreements were non-negotiable.\nThis was not enough to alleviate the ACCC's concerns. Sims believes it gave suppliers the impression they could not negotiate the terms of the agreements.\nHe also says there is also concern about the low level of detail provided in some agreements around how payments for things like wastage occur. He says the ACCC only went public because some suppliers urged him to do so. He points out that it is easy for a supermarket to say after the event what they meant to communicate to suppliers.\nWhether this is a communications mix-up between the supermarkets and suppliers which is easily addressed in the early phases of the code of conduct's short life remains to be seen.\nThe supermarkets have accused Sims of grand-standing on the issue and have long argued they have been unfairly targeted. Woolworths believes it was rail-roaded by the regulator, which contacted it about the issue at 6pm on Wednesday before going public Thursday morning.\n\"We want to make sure there is an evening up of the bargaining power. If we engage on the quiet with the supermarkets that wont give the suppliers enough understanding,\" he says.\nSims's comments are a signal to the retailers he will be vigilant around implementation of the new code. It comes a week after the change of Coalition leadership and the potential for a Turnbull cabinet to reconsider a competition effects test which Sims supports. Sims says the timing is a coincidence and the ACCC was looking at the issue weeks before the surprise leadership change.\nIt is still unclear which minister will be responsible for the code of conduct and competition policy. The industry is upset about the departure of Small Business Minister Bruce Billson who helped get the code of conduct implemented.\nWhile the ACCC did not have to name Woolworths and Aldi, it also did not want to give the impression that Coles was involved in the latest complaints. Coles appears to have cleaned up its act after being taken to court over claims of unconscionable conduct.\nIt is still early days for the code which has a 12-month implementation period. Supermarkets are still on notice. There have been suggestions a grocery industry ombudsman would be installed to overview complaints if the code fails.\nBut hiccups are inevitable in this early phase. While the Australian Food & Grocery Council says it welcomes the ACCC's oversight, it is not complaining that supermarkets are not acting in good faith.\n\"The engagement with the retailers has been positive and they are actively seeking to address issues as they arise. The Code strengthens the negotiating ability of suppliers and creates a framework for more transparent and certain trading relationships, to help both suppliers and retailers move on from the adversarial conflicts of the past,\" AFGC chief executive Gary Dawson says.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-09-24T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:03:41.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
