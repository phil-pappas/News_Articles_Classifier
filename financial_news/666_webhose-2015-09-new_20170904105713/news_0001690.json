But those people said it was too early to confirm that a decision had been made.\nThe board that oversees the management of Volkswagen is expected to announce further management changes as the company tries to quell the growing outcry over the deception.

Photo: Getty-Images\nStill, pressure continued to mount on the company. On Thursday, Germany's transportation minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said that software might have been used to fool official emissions tests on millions of cars in Europe, not just in the United States.\nMr Dobrindt, the transportation minister, indicated that 10 million cars in Europe with the diesel engines could be affected by the manipulation. If true, the Volkswagen software used to deceive emissions tests would have been more widely used than the company has disclosed.\nVolkswagen said on Tuesday that 11 million cars worldwide were equipped with the same software that the Environmental Protection Agency said was used to evade emissions tests in the United States. About half a million of those cars are in the US, and analysts say about 10 million are in Europe.\nBut it had been unclear whether the software was dormant in cars sold in Europe or actively used to evade pollution standards, as Volkswagen admitted was the case in the US.\nAs an indication that other European officials are growing wary, the European Commission on Thursday urged the 28 member nations of the European Union to test vehicles on their roads and report the findings.\nIf the chief's job falls to Mr Mueller, Volkswagen would acquire a leader widely regarded as more approachable than Mr Winterkorn, who was known for his autocratic style. However, Mr Mueller might be seen as a transitional leader because of his age. And many commentators have said Volkswagen should bring in an outsider better able to fix flaws in the company that allowed the scandal to arise.\nMr Mueller has been president and chief executive of Volkswagen's Porsche unit for nearly five years. According to the Porsche website, he began his career at Volkswagen's Audi unit in 1977, before eventually rising to head of product management there in 1995.\nAfter eventually overseeing all Audi and Lamborghini product lines, Mr Mueller was put in charge of all vehicle projects and brands for the parent company, Volkswagen Group, before taking the top job at Porsche in October 2010.\nNew York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:25:26.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
