Profits have swelled from £29m in 2012 to £87m in 2015, while revenues have jumped from £278m to £395m over the same period. \nSince 2013 UK house builders have had to source more expensive bricks from the Continent as demand at home has risen, while supplies have fallen. \nThe company recently won planning permission for a new factory in Leicester which will boost production by 100 million bricks a year. \nIbstock Brick, named after the Leicestershire town where the company was founded115-years-ago, started life as a coal mining company, using quarrying clay to make bricks. \nOver the following 30 years, it exited coal mining to focus exclusively and brick manufacturing. \nSeparately, Equiniti, the financial outsourcing group which handled the controversial privatisation of the Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) , is also planning a £1bn stock listing this week. \nPrivate equity firm Advent has hired Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) and Liberum for the flotation, said Sky News which first reported the plans (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:18:04.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
