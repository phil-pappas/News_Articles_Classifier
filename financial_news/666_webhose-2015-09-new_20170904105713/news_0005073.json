By the close, the second-line index was down 0.25% to 16,925.69 points. \nPlatinum miner Lonmin , one of the index's most volatile stocks, was down by more than 6% as trades were altered on the back of a decline in the rate of global car sales being down 1% in August, worse than the month before, which hit platinum sales as the metal is used in catalytic converters. \nAlso linked to car sales, the sector team at Exane said they believed the market is \"not far from the top of one of the strongest production and margin recovery cycles we have ever seen\". Counseling caution, the broker on Monday decided to remove Inchcape (Other OTC: IHCPY - news ) from its 'Deep Value/Recovery' list, yet the automotive distributor and retailer was 1.5% higher. Auto Trader Group was a faller, however. \nCopper miner KAZ Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) was down on renewed concerns about the massive market of China, which saw three-month copper prices down 0.8% on the day. KAZ and more diversified Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) were both downgraded by RBC Capital Markets to 'underperform'. \nHome Retail (Other OTC: HMRLF - news ) was down along with several other FTSE 350 retailers slipped on industry data BRC-Springboard survey highlighted the low footfall hitting the retail industry in August. The overall rate of footfall fell below the twelve-month moving average of minus 1.4%, coming in at minus 1.6%. \nAmong the risers was Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) , after Exane published an 'outperform' rating on the hedge fund giant as analysts think a number of upside risks have been overlooked. The company's trend-following quant fund, AHL, is not far from its high water mark and upside risks are increased, added to by the high probability of further acquisitions, with upside from the GLG and Numeric units two of the overlooked factors. \nFTSE 250 - Risers Evraz (EVR) 71.10p +3.34% Betfair Group (LSE: BET.L - news ) (BET) 3,112.00p +2.91% Investec (INVP) 530.50p +2.71% Euromoney Institutional Investor (ERM) 1,025.00p +2.30% Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) (ACA) 241.40p +2.12% Man Group (EMG) 164.70p +2.04% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 264.50p +2.01% Vedanta Resources (VED) 521.00p +1.96% Polymetal International (Other OTC: AUCOY - news ) (POLY) 529.50p +1.73% Inchcape (INCH) 713.00p +1.49% FTSE 250 - Fallers Lonmin (LMI) 20.93p -6.31% Kaz Minerals (KAZ) 154.30p -4.64% Vectura Group (LSE: VEC.L - news ) (VEC) 176.00p -3.03% Home Retail Group (HOME) 133.10p -2.92% Vesuvius (VSVS) 382.80p -2.87% Keller Group (LSE: KLR.L - news ) (KLR) 949.00p -2.47% Auto Trader Group (AUTO) 324.00p -2.47% Bank of Georgia Holdings (BGEO) 1,791.00p -2.45% Bodycote (BOY) 615.00p -2.38% Hunting (Frankfurt: 0YT.F - news ) (HTG) 406.00p -2.17%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T08:17:18.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
