Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The Business Council of Australia will launch a \"substantial\" advertising campaign in coming weeks to help the government convince the community of the need for tax reform.\nSpeaking before Thursday's reform summit convened by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the campaign in its initial phase would studiously avoid specifying which taxes the BCA wanted changed.\n\"We have to, I think, convince the community of the need for change before we start talking about which taxes go where,\" she said.\n\"We have to do a much better job of explaining to people why the current system is not going to help with that growth story.\n\"We have to stand beside government in winning the hearts and minds, if you will, on tax reforms because there are trade-offs.\"\nMs Westacott said once the case for change was better established, the BCA would launch a second phase, advocating more specific changes but hoped to do this in concert with groups such as the Australian Council of Social Service.\nListening to leaders Mr Turnbull called the snap gathering to meet and listen to the key players from the business, industry, union, welfare and community sectors who attended the August National Reform Summit which was co-sponsored by The Australian Financial Review , The Australian and KPMG.\n The BCA has previously advocated increasing the GST to fund a company tax cut but Ms Westacott said all she was expecting from the meeting on tax was a comprehensive review of the entire retirement income system, including superannuation tax concessions.\n\"I'd like to walk away with a commitment that we won't cherry pick that agenda,\" she said.\n\"The more narrow that agenda is, the more controversial it will be, the more difficult it will be.\"\nSince becoming Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison have put all tax options back on the reform table, including super taxes which Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey sough to quarantine .\nACTU national secretary Dave Oliver will also attend the summit and will call for the inclusion of super taxes as part of a broad reform blueprint he will present.\nPenalty rate resistance Mr Oliver will resist any push on penalty rates, which is expected to come from such groups as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\"We want to engage on the high road to reform, not the low road of reducing wages, stripping conditions or cost-shifting on to working families,\" he said.\nMs Westacott dismissed a recent call by former Treasury secretary Ken Henry for the government to delay reform until after the next election , given the short time left.\nShe said the government needed to seek a mandate for change at the next election and then get on with it, because reforms, including changes to retirement incomes, will take five to10 years to effect.\n\"The trouble with putting everything off is we need urgent change,\" she said.\n\"If we think 2 per cent GDP is fine, we can put everything off. I don't think a 2 per cent GDP number is good enough.\"\nMr Morrison said last week his priority was to sell the need for tax reform, saying Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey had failed to make the case with ordinary voters.\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen welcomed the government's re-embrace of the need to consider superannuation taxes as part of the mix but said Labor would never agree to a GST increase, especially to fund the return of bracket creep.\nHe said a GST increase was permanent whereas income tax cuts were eaten away by bracket creep.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:11:57.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
