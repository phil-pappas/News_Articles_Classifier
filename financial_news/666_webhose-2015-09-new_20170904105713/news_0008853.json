However, following China’s unexpected Yuan devaluation in early August there has been some turbulence in financial markets that has some investors hoping interest rates will stay lower for longer.The Federal Reserve (Fed) continues to maintain that the increases will occur before the end of the year, and while not widely understood by those with student loans, changes in the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve can have a significant impact on student loan interest rates and repayment plans. How The Stock Market and Federal Reserve Can Influence Student Loans It is important for borrowers to understand how the stock market and decisions regarding rates by the Fed can impact those with student loans that carry variable interest rates.The interest rate charged on variable-rate student loans is typically tied to the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR). LIBOR indirectly tracks the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve, and has historically been highly correlated with the Feds actions.Interest rates on federal student loans are determined once a year, when they’re benchmarked against yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds auctioned in the month of May. Currently, Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and Direct PLUS federal student loans issued before July 1, 2016 carry fixed rates between 4.29% and 6.84%.Monetary policy makers typically use interest rates as a mechanism to adjust the opportunity cost of capital. In environments of weaker economic growth, they typically use lower interest rates to incentivize individuals and businesses to borrow and consume – promoting stronger economic growth. Conversely, in environments of strong economic growth, they will raise interest rates to curb investment and consumption.Consequently, if the global economy sails through the current volatility and continues to gather momentum, it is more likely interest rates will increase. Impact on College Students and Graduates Students and graduates with variable-rate student loans should be keeping an eye on the economy and the direction that interest rates are heading, as these developments could influence the repayments they are required to make on their student loans and may influence the way they plan for their financial futures.For students still in school, with a longer term of student loan repayments ahead of them, even a small change in interest rates could have a significant long-term impact on the total student loan repayments that they are required to make.Interestingly, those who have already graduated may be in an ideal position. There are many lenders in the student loan market that offer both fixed and variable interest rate refinancing products. If graduates are able to refinance before interest rates start to rise, they may be able to secure fixed-interest rate repayments at the lowest student loan interest rates that the market have ever seen.With the significant influence interest rates can have on student loan borrowers, it makes sense for students or graduates with student loans to keep their eyes on the market. Although recent financial market volatility could see a delay in the timing of rate increases, an eventual rise is considered very likely.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-appears-to-hold-line-on-rate-plan-1440959106", "http://www.ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/051515DLInterestRates1516.html"], "published": "2015-09-03T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:04:43.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
