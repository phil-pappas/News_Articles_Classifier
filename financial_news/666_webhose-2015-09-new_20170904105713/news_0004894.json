The change would change the way retirement plan advisors are paid, with the goal of eliminating conflicts of interest, and require them to always act in their clients’ best interests. \nThe White House , which is behind the proposal, says the conflicts of interest it is intended to address are costing investors $17 billion a year. That is based on an estimate that $1.7 trillion of IRA assets are invested in products that generate conflicts of interest resulting in 1 percentage point in extra costs per year. \nBackers of the rule say brokers not held to the fiduciary standard encourage savers to move nest eggs from low-cost employer-sponsored plans to IRA accounts, which typically charge higher fees. They also, according to the White House critique, steer savers into higher-cost IRA products.
