Dudley said the central bank will \"probably\" raise interest rates later this year despite uncertainties over global growth.\n\"I think that the economy is doing pretty well,\" Dudley said at an event Monday in New York. He said he expected growth in the second half will be \"a little bit weaker\" than in the first half.\nDudley said his expectation on timing was \"not calendar guidance. It depends on the data. That’s based on my view of how the economy is likely to evolve.”\nFed Chair Janet Yellen said Sept. 24 she also felt it likely the Fed would increase rates this year for the first time in almost a decade. The Federal Open Market Committee decided Sept. 17 not to hike rates, citing worries over the slowdown in China and other international concerns.\nDudley said the drop in commodity prices, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, had contributed downward pressure to inflation in the U.S.\n\"My expectation is that we probably will raise interest rates later this year,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:23:09.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
