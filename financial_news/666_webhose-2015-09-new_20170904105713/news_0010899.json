Shenzhen's growth board ChiNext dived 6 percent and the CSI500 index of small companies tumbled 6.3 percent.\nActivity in China's manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace in three years in August, an official survey showed on Tuesday, reinforcing fears of a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. A separate private survey on manufacturing was equally downbeat.\nInvestors largely ignored fresh stimulus measures unveiled by the government, including further relaxation in property investment rules, and policies to support mergers and acquisitions and share buy-backs by listed companies.\n\"These measures are inadequate. It's like just trying to put out a big fire with a glass of water,\" said Yang Hai, strategist at Kaiyuan Securities.\nBlue-chips, including banking heavyweights and energy giants PetroChina and Sinopec rose sharply, helping limit losses.
