This past summer, it announced a 2.8 billion euro ($3.14 billion) deal to buy Germany's Kaufhof chain.\nThe job cuts will affect just over 0.5 percent of the company's nearly 45,000 employees, primarily U.S. positions, a spokeswoman said, adding that Hudson's Bay was ahead of schedule in its integration plans.\nEarlier this month, the company told investors it was on track to meet its C$100 million cost savings target as part of its Saks acquisition and had indicated there could be more savings to come.\nThe retailer has also been investing heavily in its back-end technology so its various department store banners and online operations all function off a common platform, a move executives say will help drive long-term growth and savings.\nThe company said it was also on schedule to open several Saks Fifth Avenue locations and OFF 5th locations, beginning next year, as part of is expansion plans in Canada.
