Details on program trading strategies and the location of trading servers would also have to be provided to the exchanges. Failure to do this could lead to yet-to-be-defined disciplinary action.\nTraders who submit but then withdraw within a second before execution more than 60 percent of the more than 4,000 placed orders on the exchange's order-entry platforms will also trigger increased regulatory oversight.\nAnd traders would be restricted to placing no more than 4,000 trades if they execute orders for more than two futures products, or buy and sell orders of the same product in different futures contract months within one second.\n\"This is at a preliminary stage and the exchanges are still working on details,\" said one individual with direct knowledge of the matter. The DCE, SHFE and ZCE were not immediately available for comment.\nLIMITING ARB-ING\nLocally-registered traders and brokers active in China's commodities markets say the new rules would likely \"force out\" some firms that specialise in arbitrage trading strategies aimed at exploiting short-term price differences for the same commodity in different months, or different commodities within the same contract month.\nOne broker said \"more than half\" of his firm's positions on the SHFE involved buying and selling in different months, and so would be impacted if these new proposals came into effect.\nOther sources downplayed the likely impact of the proposals, noting that program trading makes up only a small portion of China's commodity markets.\n\"Computer-driven program trading is not widely used in commodity trading, and I think the exchange (will adopt these rules) just in case and is being over-cautious,\" said a fund manager who trades commodities and other assets.\nA fund trader in Shanghai said the measures could slow down funds that exited from stock futures and plan to enter commodities.\n(Reporting by Ruby Lian and Polly Yam; Editing by Gavin Maguire and Ian Geoghegan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T09:05:27.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
