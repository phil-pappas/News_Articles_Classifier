Refinery utilization rates fell by 1.9 percentage points to 90.9 percent of capacity.\n\"Refinery utilization is now below 91 percent, with more reductions on tap,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\n\"That will cause a reduction in crude oil demand in the weeks ahead,\" Kilduff noted.\nGasoline stocks rose by 384,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a drop of 567,000 barrels.\nDistillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1 million barrels, versus expectations for an increase of 858,000 barrels, the EIA data showed.
