Rogers takes up his new job at LVMH in October. \nWhile luxury goods sales globally have slowed down in recent years to around 5 percent annually, luxury online sales have been rising by more than 20-30 percent, albeit from a very low base. \n(Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt, editing by William Hardy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:46:10.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
