Bowman will on Friday hand over the reins to Andrew Reynolds Smith, who is leaving his role as chief executive of GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) 's division GKN Automotive. \n\"On that basis there will be no major strategy-related commentary given the new CEO does not yet have his feet under the table,\" said UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) analyst Mark Fielding. \n\"However, we do see downside risk to 2016 earnings forecasts given the John Crane Oil & Gas exposure. On a company reported basis UBS estimates 2016 earnings per share is close to 10% below consensus and we retain a 'sell' rating.\" The group's mechanical seals division John Crane has come under pressure from the slump in oil prices. John Crane accounts for 40% of group profit and a third of sales. \nOn the economic data front, purchasing managers' index reports on manufacturing will be released.
