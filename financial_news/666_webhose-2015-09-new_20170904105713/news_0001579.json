He said companies tend to charge their foreign subsidiaries low licensing fees as a way to shift reportable income away from the US, where corporate tax rates are higher. \nTypically, Mr Willens said, the cases are settled for a fraction of the amount of the assessment. \n“They hardly ever get to court, because neither party wants to experience the hazards of litigation,” he added. \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coca-Cola said it has been following the same methodology for determining its taxable US income for nearly 30 years. \n“The IRS now seeks to depart from this long-standing practice in order to increase substantially the amount of tax,” the company said. “We are among hundreds of other companies currently facing these types of adjustments involving payments.” \nCoca-Cola said it was notified that a recommendation was made to the IRS’s chief counsel that the matter be designated for litigation. The company said it plans to start disputing the matter by filing a petition in US Tax Court. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the IRS made the determination on owed taxes after a five-year audit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T01:35:36.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
