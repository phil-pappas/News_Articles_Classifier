Expats in India also learn new skills and 82 per cent believe that the country is as good as or better for learning new skills than their home country.\nOne of the biggest challenges for expats in India is integrating into the Indian culture, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) in the country finding it difficult to do so, compared with the global average of 18 per cent.\nExpats also felt that organising finances is harder than elsewhere as only 21 per cent found this easy to do as compared to 39 per cent of expats globally, the report added.\n 28, 2015 6:54 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:43:25.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
