View Enlarged Image \n\n\"The market was overhyped, with the technology still immature, resulting in roller-coaster rides for the stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems,\" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research report. \"However, we think the market is real and could be about $20 billion in 2020.\" \nSales in the 3D printer market this year are estimated to come in at about $5 billion. \nStratasys and 3D Systems are the two largest providers of 3D printers. The stock of both companies soared from early 2012 through early 2014. Then the stocks fell, on the reality that the industry had many mountains yet to climb . \n\"We think 3D printing is a significant long-term opportunity, but the technology is immature in terms of speed, quality and reliability, which has caused problems for Stratasys and 3D Systems,\" Milunovich wrote. \nHe says that HP has solved bottlenecks holding back 3D printing, such as speed. \nIt is \"entirely believable that HP could become the leading 3D printing company,\" due to its current strength as a printing vendor, he wrote. \n\"Our view is that 3D printing is in the early innings of commercial implementation, with the industrial greater than the consumer opportunity,\" Milunovich wrote. \"3D printing lacks economies of scale today for most applications. Over time, however, we believe 3D printing is on a path to overcoming its shortcomings in throughput, process stability, equipment life, post-processing elimination, materials know-how, production qualification and ease of use.\" \nFollow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:44:05.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
