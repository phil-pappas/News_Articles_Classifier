There are some natural barriers that we face but our (tourism) industry is growing particularly into South East Asia.\" \nWA's tourist expenditure grew by 1.2 per cent last financial year compared to the national average of 11.5 per cent, according to International Visitor Survey data. \nThe Australian Hotels Association has blamed the lacklustre growth on inadequate state government funding and too much focus by Tourism Australia on attracting visitors to the east coast. \nAHA chief executive Bradley Woods said the WA government needed to increase its destination advertising budget by tens of millions of dollars. \n\"WA tourism is being held back,\" Mr Woods said. \nMr Barnett conceded Perth's tourism infrastructure was lacking compared to the rest of the nation, but said projects including Elizabeth Quay and Perth Stadium could change that. \nVisitor numbers to WA lifted by four per cent last financial year compared to an eight per cent rise in Queensland, a six per cent increase in NSW and a 22 per cent surge in Tasmania. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:15:29.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
