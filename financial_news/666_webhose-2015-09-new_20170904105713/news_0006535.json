If no party manages to break away, Canada looks set for a period of unstable minority government.\nThe ethnic vote is enormously important in Canada, which is home to significant Chinese, Indian, Italian, Filipino and Ukrainian communities.\nThe Liberals have traditionally favored immigration and under Trudeau's father, former Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau, Canada accepted well over a million people.\nFor decades it was assumed that newcomers to Canada would vote Liberal but since taking power in 2006, the Conservatives have made enormous efforts to build ties to ethnic communities.\nAs a result they picked up dozens of seats, especially in the region around Toronto, which was one of the reasons Prime Minister Stephen Harper won a majority in the 2011 election.\nPollsters say the Liberals are much more competitive in the area surrounding Toronto, Canada's largest city.\nUnder the Conservatives, who took power in 2006, Canada changed the immigration system to focus more on attracting skilled workers from abroad while slashing back programs that allowed family reunification.\nCritics of the previous system said allowing in elderly relatives put an unfair burden on the healthcare and social security systems.\nTrudeau said the Liberals would make the system more compassionate by doubling the number of applications allowed for parents and grandparents to 10,000 each year.\nCanada, which has a population of about 36 million, aims to attract 285,000 immigrants in 2015.
