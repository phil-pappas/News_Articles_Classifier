Though EC spurned congress’ appeal, the party still continues to begrudge that PM is addressing the nation at a time when the model code of conduct is enforced in Bihar. Here are the top 10 power points covered by PM Modi in today’s ‘Mann Ki Baat:\n1. PM Narendra Modi: I had addressed you in October last year. One year, a lot of conversation. I learnt a lot from you. Jan Shakti is very important in a democracy. I sought inputs from you, I would take up a few of them. The lakhs of letters taught me invaluable lessons. I got to know about the issues in the Government.\n2. PM Narendra Modi:Mann Ki Baat showcased Samajh Ki Shakti (strength of the people in a society).\n3. PM Narendra Modi: Around 30 lakh families have given up their LPG subsidy . These are not rich people. This is also a silent revolution.\n4. PM Narendra Modi: I had urged you all to buy some Khadi and I am happy the sales have increased so much. This is realisation of Jan Shakti. I am again making an appeal for 2nd October, please buy some Khadi and handloom to give them some space in your life.\n5. PM Narendra Modi: We must ensure Gandhiji’s dream of ensuring cleanliness.\n6. PM Narendra Modi: More governments stay connected with people of country, more they can act as a tool for bringing about change in society.\n7. PM Narendra Modi: I spent a lot of time with Armed personnel at Shauryanjali. I was supposed to be there for 30 minutes but spent much more than that. History was recreated at Shauryanjali. We have always heard about the valour of our forces.\n8. PM Narendra Modi: In May, I went to Kolkata where I met family of Subhas Babu. I invited the entire family of Subhas Bose to my residence and in October over 50 family members will come to 7RCR. It is a matter of joy for me that I can host this family (Bose family) at my residence.\n9. PM Narendra Modi: I want to congratulate the election commission. Earlier it was a regulator now it is facilitator and has become very voter friendly.\n10. PM Narendra Modi: I urge the youth to register as voters and go out and vote when the time comes.\n 20, 2015 12:36 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:31:39.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
