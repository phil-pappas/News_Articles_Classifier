Are you choosing a college or graduate school with the richest, best connected alumni? We've found the top schools for the global ultra-high net worth (UHNW) population, those that have $30 million or more in net assets. \nAccording to the most recent Wealth-X and UBS World Ultra Wealth Report , the United States is the country with the largest amount of wealth in the world and holds almost a third of the world's ultra-high net worth population. In 2014, there were 211,275 ultra-high net worth individuals in the world. At the same time, the UHNW population in the U.S. managed to increase by over 4,000 new individuals, which was more than the entire UHNW population of Australia. \nSo, how did this increase happen? In addition to the strong performance of the country's equity markets and a decrease in unemployment, more than three quarters of the UHNW individuals in the U.S. are self-made entrepreneurs, whose new ideas have been made into profitable business ventures.
