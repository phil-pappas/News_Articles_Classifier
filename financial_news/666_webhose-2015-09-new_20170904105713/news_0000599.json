Qilai Shen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Corporate debt in emerging market economies led by China has more than quadrupled to $US18 trillion in the past decade, leaving the firms \"vulnerable\" to a pending rise in US interest rates, the International Monetary Fund has warned.\n\"Emerging markets should be prepared for corporate distress and sporadic failures in the wake of rising interest rates in advanced economies, and where needed, should reform insolvency regimes,\" the IMF's analytical chapters of the Global Financial Stability Report said.\nThe US Federal Reserve this month backed away from raising interest rates, due to concerns about the economic slowdown and financial market volatility in China and stubbornly weak domestic inflation .\nFed chair Janet Yellen said last week she expects US rates to rise from near zero before the end of the year.\nThe United Kingdom is tipped to begin raising interest rates next year.\nConstruction and energy businesses in Asia, Latin America and other developing economies hoovered up cheap loans from bond investors in the United States, Europe and Japan in recent years. Near zero interest rates in advanced economies starved investors of decent returns, forcing them to lend to foreign businesses in riskier markets at cut price rates.\nThe debt binge at lower yields and longer maturities occurred despite emerging market firms exhibiting weaker balance sheets.\n\"These developments make emerging market economies more vulnerable to a rise in interest rates, dollar appreciation, and an increase in global risk aversion,\" said Gaston Gelos, division chief of the IMF's global financial stability division.\n China's ramp up in borrowing since the 2008 global financial crisis has underpinned the explosion in emerging market corporate debt, which has grown by 26 percentage points as a share of GDP in the 10 years to 2014. State-owned enterprises, real estate and construction companies, miners and utilities in and around Beijing have led the debt binge.\n\"The high level of credit could weigh on China's growth and financial stability,\" the IMF said.\nTurkey, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and Colombia have also experienced appreciable increases in corporate indebtedness.\nOverall, emerging market corporate debt has jumped from about $US4 trillion in 2003 to well over $US18 trillion in 2014. The figures exclude financial institutions like banks.\nThe Washington-based fund points out that higher borrowing can be beneficial, by facilitating investment and faster economic growth, as it has in China for many years before the recent economic moderation.\nHowever, the fund is concerned that the increase in firms' debt-to-asset ratio has come about through more foreign-currency liabilities, making it challenging to repay unhedged debts in the event of local currency depreciations.\n\"Furthermore, local currency depreciations associated with rising policy rates in the advanced economies would make it increasingly difficult for emerging market firms to service their foreign currency denominated debts if they are not hedged adequately,\" the IMF said.\nA possible saving grace for China is that firms have issued debt mostly in local currency, leaving them less exposed to exchange rate gyrations, such as the recent devaluation of the yuan .\nThere has been a sharp selloff in emerging market currencies in recent months, including the Brazilian real, Russian rouble, South African rand, Mexican peso, Turkish lira, South Korean won and Vietnamese dong.\nCurrency traders have yanked out funds due to economic slowdowns and in anticipation of rising US interest rates.\nThe IMF has repeatedly urged the Fed to delay lifting interest rates until next year , partly to give emerging economies more time to prepare for the rising rate environment.\nDr Yellen has emphasised the path for rate hikes is likely to be gentle and dependent on the good run of US economic data continuing.\nTo prepare for rising rates, the IMF suggests policymakers monitor vulnerable and systemically important firms and banks, as well as considering tools such as higher capital requirements for foreign exchange exposures and caps on the share of such exposures on banks' balance sheets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:05:52.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
