However, as investors piled into the stock, amid chatter that a deal that would create a beer behemoth is imminent, a further two brokers revised their target prices. \nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets reckon AB InBev could stretch their offer to £42 per share, warning anything above this level would lead to “value destruction”. \nJames Edwardes Jones, of RBC Capital Markets, said: “We have great respect for ABI’s management and if the price demanded by SAB is too rich would like to think they will have the financial discipline to walk away.” \nThe broker also believes the only disposals made will be those required by anti-trust authorities, highlighting the takeover will be about “a global domination strategy on the part of ABI”. \n* Anheuser-Busch InBev explores $280bn mega deal for SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) * Another takeover challenge for SABMiller’s chairman Separately, Société Générale upgraded the stock to “buy”, lifting its target price by £8 to £43. Analysts said they do not expect it to be a lengthy bid process. However, to succeed in its bid, AB InBev must persuade several crucial stakeholders, including Altria and the Santo Domingo family. \nThe bank reckons AB InBev have taken the last three years to discuss its plans with stakeholders “to get them on board” and any reservations about “strategic intend” have now been removed. The stock closed the trading session at £36.35, up 46.5p, or 1.3pc. \nOn the broader market, the FTSE 100 plunged into the red, wiping out Friday’s gains, falling 150.15 points, or 2.47pc, to 5,958.86, as further weak data from China and a bearish broker note dragged mining stocks lower. Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at its sharpest rate in four years last month, official data showed. \nMike McCudden, of Interactive Investor, said: “Investors returning to the market with a renewed sense of confidence have had their bubble burst once again as Chinese economic data continues to disappoint.” \nMr McCudden also warned the FTSE could come under further pressure, as the International Monetary Fund prepares to cut its global growth forecast. \nMeanwhile, Jameel Ahmad, of FXTM, warned \"crucial data\" due to be released by both China and the US later in the week could \"expose markets to further losses\". \nInternational miner Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) became the biggest casualty of the day after Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) warned its equity value could “evaporate” , if commodity prices remain at current levels. Panic stricken investors offloaded the stock, as it hit another fresh low, plunging 28.6p, or 29.4pc, to 68.6p. \nHunter Hillcoat, of Investec, expects commodity markets to remain “subdued” for several years to come, given the coincidence of excess supply and a slowdown in demand, particularly from China. If commodity prices do not recover, Mr Hillcoat reckons the value for Glencore and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) equity holders is “virtually eliminated” given sustained depressed earnings. \nAnglo American slid 10.1pc to 552.7p, while BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) was off by 6pc to 964.1p, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) fell 4.8pc to £21.11 and Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) was 4.9pc lower at 481p. \n* Oil exporters face years of pain from tumbling prices, says IMF * Questor share tip: Is now the time to buy Glencore? \nConfirmation Vodafone and Liberty Global (NasdaqGS: LBTYA - news ) had ended early-stage discussions regarding asset swaps sent the mobile operator into the red. Robert Grindle, of Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , said he was pleased Vodafone had “not rushed” into another fixed deal, adding there may be an opportunity to exploit overlap with Liberty assets at a later date. Shares fell 4.8pc to 207.2p. \nElsewhere, shares in ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) rallied 0.9pc to 250.5p amid talk that Liberty Global will now increase its 9.9pc stake in the broadcaster following the termination of talks with Vodafone. \nBAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) was among the best performers after Bernstein upgraded the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The broker said the motivation for the move was based on improved expectations in international defence growth and an increased margin of safety in the current share price. The stock climbed 4.5p to 444.5p. \nMid-cap stock Ultra Electronics (Other OTC: UEHPY - news ) was among the favourites after JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) Cazenove lifted its rating to “overweight” from “neutral” thanks to “green shoots of recovery” in western defence spending. David Perry, of JPMorgan Cazenove, said: “Western defence stocks are more attractive on a relative basis in a period of heightened economic uncertainty.” Shares leapt 25p to £16.84. \nShares in Irish oil and gas exploration company Petroceltic inched 3.3pc higher to 61p after it was granted an injunction by the High Court of Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) preventing an extraordinary general meeting called by its largest shareholder Worldview Capital from going ahead. Worldview, which has a 29pc stake in the company, was due to put the resolution to the meeting, on Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 5, about Petroceltic’s announcement earlier this year that it will issue senior secured bonds. * Petroceltic's biggest shareholder calls for meeting to oust chief executive Finally, Aim-listed Flowgroup ticked 2.4pc higher to 10.5p after a stellar half-year sales growth of 28pc. However, the innovative energy company recorded an operating loss of £8.4m which analysts say was largely driven by investment in headcount in its energy division, in preparation for growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:16:36.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
