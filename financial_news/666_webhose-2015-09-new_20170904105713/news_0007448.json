Is it different from what you’ll get from a financial planner?\nWhen it comes to financial advice, labels can be deceiving. Some advisers might offer as much guidance as some planners—and in some cases both might provide less help than those titles imply. The important thing for investors is to look beyond the labels to see exactly what they are being offered.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Wealth Management Money and College: The Crucial Questions for Parents and Children More U.S. Students Look to College Abroad Why Peer Pressure May Not Help You Save More for Retirement When Millennials Move Back Home Mistakes Charitable Startups Make “These titles that people throw around are becoming less and less descriptive as time goes by,” says Bob Stammers, director of investor education at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals.\nLet’s start with the title of financial adviser. “Financial advisers can really be anyone,” Mr. Stammers says—a stockbroker, a loan officer at a bank, a mutual-fund salesperson, for instance. One issue for investors to be aware of is that advisers often are paid on commission, which means that in some cases they may be offering more of a sales pitch than objective advice, Mr. Stammers says. For instance, the stockbroker will make more money when you buy more stocks. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has proposed that the brokers it oversees be held to the standard of only acting in the best interest of their clients. But currently the standard is only that any investments those brokers recommend are suitable for the investor. So checking to see what rules an adviser is bound by is a good place to start, Mr. Stammers says.\nIf you’re looking for more than advice on particular investments, you may want a financial planner. The title suggests you can expect more-comprehensive guidance toward achieving your financial goals, and that’s often what you’ll get—but not always. “Frequently what [financial planners] are attempting to suggest is that they are giving more than money-management services, but that can be just a marketing gimmick,” says Gary Schatsky, president of Objectiveadvice.com, a fee-only financial advisory firm based in New York. Fee-only advisers don’t earn commissions on whatever investments you make.\nMr. Schatsky says investors looking for big-picture help should be sure the financial professional they work with, whatever title that person carries, can offer advice not only on their investment portfolio and retirement plan, but also on their budget, real estate, taxes, estate planning and every other aspect of their finances.\nMr. Constable is a writer in New York.
