While that's up from 1.2% in July, it's still a far cry from the central bank's 2% annual inflation target.

Expectations have slumped as volatility across stocks heats up and China's economic woes fan fears of a global recession. \n\"The Fed is not going to be able to wait with unemployment rates coming down,\" Chan said. \"In fact, it's moving towards that 4% handle in the not too distant future,\" he added \nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 5.1%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the September labor report on Friday . Chan expects nonfarm payrolls to rise some 225,000, eclipsing the 173,000 jobs created in August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:34:28.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
