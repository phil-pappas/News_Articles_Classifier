Scott Eells by Stephen Foley and Alistair Gray Investors who followed the famed bond specialist Bill Gross and put money into his new mutual fund at Janus Capital are sitting on a 2.5 per cent loss at the first anniversary of his dramatic career move. Those who stayed put in the Pimco Total Return fund, which Mr Gross had managed to great acclaim for decades, are up 1.7 per cent.\nThese contrasting figures put to shame many easy assumptions that were made in the days that followed his resignation on September 26 last year, when regulators feared that massive outflows would destabilise the Pimco fund and Mr Gross said he expected to do much better running a smaller, nimbler portfolio.\nAnother surprise is in part explained by the diverging performances: while the outflows from Total Return were indeed huge - $US120 billion and counting - barely $US1 billion flowed to the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund.\nBy underperforming, Mr Gross may be inadvertently helping Pimco make its own case: that the investment process, trading infrastructure and intellectual firepower across a large asset management group count for as much as, if not more than, any individual's investing talent.\nThat is the argument Pimco has made since Mr Gross walked out without informing colleagues. His departure from the company he co-founded 43 years earlier was an earthquake in fixed income asset management, the denouement to months of management turmoil at Pimco, concern about Mr Gross's behaviour and a move by other executives to oust him.\nWhile analysts say outflows from the core bond portfolios Mr Gross once managed are likely to continue, Pimco and its parent company, Allianz, are focusing on alternative products, where they continue to attract investors and which they say represent the future of the business.\n\"What is very good, and what I look at, at the moment, is the net inflows that we have in what we call the future platforms,\" says Oliver Bäte, Allianz chief executive.\n\"We are shifting from institutional more into retail; from traditional traded fixed income to credit and to alternatives; from a US focus a lot more to Europe and Asia.\"\n Pimco put Total Return under collegiate management last September - namely Scott Mather, Mark Kiesel and Mihir Worah - and the trio have emphasised continuity.\nWhile Mr Gross was famous for big calls on the direction of interest rates, a good part of the fund's market-beating returns came from trading strategies such as selling insurance against market volatility. The trio also bet on a rising US dollar, which propelled the fund back near to the top ranking in its category, at least until the date of the first US interest rate rise was pushed out. According to the Morningstar research group, the fund's returns have beaten the average core bond fund by 62 basis points over the year.\nCustomer outflows have more than halved the size of the fund to $US98 billion, and related funds and accounts once managed by Mr Gross have borne the brunt of the rest of the redemptions. Pimco's group-wide assets under management have dropped by a fifth since September last year, to a little over $US1.1 trillion at the most recent update at the end of June, excluding funds managed for Allianz. The latest quarter will also be negative, analysts suspect.\n\"Pension fund consultants, advisers and boards all make decisions on a lagged-behind basis,\" says Dan Fannon, asset management industry analyst at Jefferies. \"It is a slow process, and while the outflows have subsided somewhat, they are ongoing.\"\nMr Bäte says the core bond portfolios are suffering for reasons that go beyond Mr Gross's departure and that these broad, conservative fixed income funds have fallen out of favour with investors who fear rising interest rates.\n\"We are at the end of a 30-year bull market where Pimco benefited the most because they had the largest fund with the highest efficiency in the most exposed product to the interest rate cycle,\" he says. \"If you want to get the double-whammy on the way up, you're also going to get the double-whammy on the way down.\"\nUnderstanding that market shift, Mr Gross decided at Janus to launch not a core bond fund but an \"unconstrained\" fund, which could make both positive and negative bets on fixed income, make use of derivatives and invest in riskier bonds than he could at Pimco. The result has been a higher-risk portfolio, which slumped during the turmoil of August and has returned 500bp less than the bond market as a whole over the past year.\nThe shift in strategy meant institutional investors were less likely to give him credit for his long record in core bonds, and even retail investors have been put off by the weak start. His fund has grown to only $US1.4 billion, and about half of that is Mr Gross's own money.\n\"It is a numbers game from now,\" says Mr Fannon. \"The initial hype has subsided. The only way flows will improve is if his performance numbers improve.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:08:28.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
