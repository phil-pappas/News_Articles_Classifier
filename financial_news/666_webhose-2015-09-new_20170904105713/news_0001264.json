Hawaiki aims to capitalise on the boom in broadband demand by connecting the West Coast of the US to the Asia Pacific region using 14,000 kilometres of fibre optic cabling strung along the ocean's floor at a cost of $US300 million.\nBut submarine cables connecting Australia to the world have struggled to get the funding required to start construction. This is because the existing cables have slashed prices and boosted capacity in recent years.\nSimilar projects attempting to link Australia and New Zealand to the US have failed. Photo: Nic Walker\nHawaiki was initially launched in 2013 with the support of iiNet, TPG Telecom and several other telcos in the region with a launch date of late 2015. However, a lack of funding and sales has led to consistent delays and its most recent start date is late 2017.\nAdvertisement In June it appointed French bank Natixis to help raise money from institutional and equity advisers without stating how much was required to fully fund the project.\n\"The completion of the financing will allow project implementation to begin in the fourth quarter of 2015,\" Hawaiki said at the time.\nBut according to documents obtained by Fairfax Media, the project's ready for service date has been delayed until 2018 and Natixis has been tasked with raising up to $US150 million in equity, which represents half of the project's total cost.\nThe bank will run market soundings during September before opening its data room and running a roadshow. Non-binding offers and a shortlist will be completed by October before exclusive negotiations for funding begin in November.\nThis is despite the company announcing in July it had partnered with Sinclair Investments, the investment vehicle of New Zealand business identity Sir Eion Edgar, as an equity partner to help fund the project.\nHawaiki Cable chief operating officer Ludovic Hutier said the cable system was scheduled for completion by the end of 2017 and that it had reached its \"tipping point in terms of customers capacity contracts.\"\n\"We do not have any further comment to make on this matter [and] Hawaiki is progressing according to plan.\"\nSimilar projects attempting to link Australia and New Zealand to the US have failed. Pacific Fibre was a $US400 million project that collapsed in 2012 because it failed to find the funding required .\nThis is partly because the dominant existing fibre optic link, Southern Cross Cable, has been able to consistently drop prices and boost capacity when its sales are threatened.\nBut Australia and New Zealand will both need to rapidly increase the capacity of its submarine cables because their national broadband networks will boost demand for high-speed internet services.", "external_links": ["http://origin-www.afr.com/p/technology/pacific_fibre_cancels_million_project_8X2NZ4bBYDjbWRk5qtzoMI"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T19:58:16.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
