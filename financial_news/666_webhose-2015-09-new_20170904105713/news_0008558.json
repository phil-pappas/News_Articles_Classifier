Manuel Balce Ceneta Share on twitter by Karen Maley Much to Janet Yellen's disappointment, investors are having a hard time deciding whether to cheer or bemoan the US central bank's decision to keep its short-term rate close to zero .\nThe US Federal Reserve was no doubt hoping the decision would provide a short-term boost to US shares, as well as other higher-yielding risk assets such as junk bonds, because it shows that economic growth remains a key priority.\nShe would have also been hoping that the decision would reduce some of the upward pressure on the US dollar. This benefits the US economy, because a strong US dollar makes it more difficult for US exporters to compete in global markets, and cuts the price of imported goods.\nAnd, initially at least, that's how the investors reacted, with the US share market rising while the US dollar and US bond yields both fell (bond yields fall as bond prices rise).\nBut then a mood of pessimism swept through the US sharemarket, as investors began focusing more closely on why the Fed opted to not raise rates.\nIn its policy statement, the Fed highlighted its concern that recent turbulence in financial markets, combined with slowing growth in China and the emerging markets, could hurt the US economy and spread deflationary pressures through the developed world.\n\"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near-term,\" the Fed statement said.\nAt her news conference, Yellen was at pains to stress the Fed's decision to keep rates on hold was a precautionary one. Fed officials formed the view that, with offshore risks rising, it was prudent to wait a little longer to make sure that the US economy would not be harmed.\n And although Yellen was keen to emphasise a \"great majority\" of Fed officials still expect a rate rise this year, investors were rattled that the US central bank was taking the China threat so seriously.\nAfter all, many analysts have touted that, unlike commodity exporters and other Asian countries, the US has little to fear from slowing Chinese growth. That's because US exports to China account for a mere 0.6 per cent of GDP, well below countries such as Australia whose exports to China – 30 per cent of total exports – represent almost 4 per cent of GDP.\nBut what these analysts are ignoring is that US sharemarkets are becoming increasingly influenced by what happens in the world's second-largest economy.\nThis partly reflects the fact a number of major US technology companies – such as Apple – generate about one-fifth of their revenue in China. In addition, China is an important market for US manufacturers of sophisticated capital goods who are seeing their profits, under pressure from falling Chinese demand. Beijing's crackdown on corruption has also made Chinese consumers wary about splurging on high-price US and European luxury brands.\nEven more worrying for the Fed, China is changing the dynamics in the global economy. Instead of driving growth (China used to account for about one-third of global growth), it appears to be lurching towards a hard landing. At the same time, weak Chinese growth is fuelling global deflationary pressures, causing commodity prices to tumble while the price of Chinese-made goods continues to fall.\nAs Yellen knows all too well, the risk of Chinese-fuelled deflation poses a major threat to the US economy, with its high debt levels. Falling inflation levels increase the strains on borrowers by pushing up real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates.\nAn increase in real interest rates would deal yet another blow to the US economy, which already is battling the challenge of a stronger US dollar.", "external_links": ["http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150917a.htm", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-18T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:11:00.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
