He(PM Modi) also said to farmers not to worry as ‘Acche Din’ will come. And now, in every state, farmers are committing suicide. I want to tell you that when I am visiting the farmers, they are not criticising, but abusing Narendra Modi,” Gandhi said while addressing a ‘Chintan Shivir’ here.\n“He promised to the youth that ‘achche din’ will come and that they will get employment. Not even a single youth got job. He even promised ex-servicemen that he would implement OROP(One Rank One Pension). Even today, ex-servicemen are asking for written orders from the government. This only shows the damage Narendra Modi is doing to himself, perhaps, we all together cannot do it,” Gandhi added.\nA chintan shivir (brain storming session) of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Congress Party is being held in Mathura, which is being chaired by Gandhi and attended by around 700 party leaders.\n 21, 2015 5:31 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:35:33.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
