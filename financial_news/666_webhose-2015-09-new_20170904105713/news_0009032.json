Photo: Graham Tidy\n'China will walk away': warning on the China-Australia free trade agreement Comment: China-Australia free trade arguments fail to bridge divide Seafood producers clamour for China trade deal Canberra's peak business body has publicly backed Australia's free trade agreement with China, labelling it an \"important step in levelling the playing field\".\nThe Canberra Business Chamber has come out in favour of the preferential agreement with Australia's largest trading partner, which covers two-way trade worth $152 billion a year.\n\"What we [the chamber] care about is diversifying our economy and growing our trade footprint and it is absolutely clear to our exporters that a free trade agreement will assist that,\" business chamber chief executive Robyn Hendry said.\nAdvertisement Ms Henry said the agreement has \"enormous potential\" for exporting produce from the Canberra region but also has benefits for service providers.\nIncreased freight between Canberra and China could even help underpin demand for a direct flight to Asia, she said.\n\"The China palate is changing. The demand for premium wines, of which Canberra is particularly pronounced in producing, is growing in China and as the palate matures there, so do the opportunities,\" she said.\n\"Just as their palate for wine is changing, their palate for tourism is changing. Tourism has been increasing quarter after quarter. As the mining boom comes off its peak, tourism is proving to be our strongest replacement in the services sector.\"\nShaw Vineyard Estate owner Graeme Shaw has recently set up distribution for his cool-climate wines in Shanghai.\nHe said his numbers of enquiries from China have \"at least doubled\" in the past 12 months.\n\"Every week we're getting more enquiries now and we're following it up with a visit to China in November, it's looking very, very promising,\" Mr Shaw said.\nMr Shaw recently returned from Korea, where he also locked in a distributor on the back of another free-trade agreement.\nHe said the agreement with China would be key to the expansion of his business.\nMeanwhile Canberra-based production company Wildbear Entertainment will be creating a documentary series on World War II for China's CCTV10.\nWildbear chief executive Michael Tear said they have had a large volume of work coming in from the Chinese market, with their most recent project, Forever Young, reaching more than 100 million people last week on CCTV2.\nHe'd like to see the process around working visas streamlined.\n\"Anything that simplifies the process of doing business is welcome,\" Mr Tear said.\n\"Most of our work is focused on the international market, the television market in Australia is important but relatively small so we look to overseas to grow our business and there's an enormous market to our north.\n\"Australia has a lot of talent but we need processes that make working together as simple as possible.\"\nThe ACT government is also backing the agreement, despite the federal opposition and unions voicing concerns about labour market testing provisions which, they say, could pave the way for foreign workers to take Australian jobs.\nHowever premium wine exporter Greg Corra, of Inland Trading Co, said while there was some benefit to free trade agreements, the levels of compliance required have increased his costs of doing business.\n\"We've found working with free trade agreements in other countries compliance was never looked at by the government when the decision was made so it's horrendously time-consuming to comply,\" he said.\nThe agreement, while signed in June this year, will only become binding once both countries have ratified the treaty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T10:52:55.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
