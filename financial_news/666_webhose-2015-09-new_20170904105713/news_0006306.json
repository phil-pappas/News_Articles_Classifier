An overwhelming majority of economists expected policymakers to keep interest rates unchanged after seven consecutive hikes.\nWhile most other major emerging-market economies are gearing up to raise borrowing costs to head off rising prices, Brazil is ending monetary tightening as its economic downturn proves more severe than even the most pessimistic economists had envisioned.\nThe bank made no changes to its decision statement, signaling again that it will hold borrowing costs where they are for some time to bring inflation back to the 4.5 percent center of the official target.\nThe recession and a decline in inflation expectations prompted the central bank to end the tightening cycle even though inflation remains near double digits, climbing to 9.57 percent in mid-August.\nAlthough recession is helping slow inflation as consumption drops, renewed political turmoil has weakened the real and is keeping the central bank under pressure.\n\"The exchange rate has been weakening significantly, dragged down by domestic and external uncertainties ... that could warrant an additional rate hike,\" said Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist with Itau Unibanco.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff's inability to halt the deterioration of the government's finances is threatening Brazil's investment-grade rating and rattling local markets.\nThe leftist leader, whose approval rating is at an all-time low, is facing growing resistance to her fiscal austerity drive and the threat of impeachment by her opponents in Congress.\nThe fiscal crunch and growing fears of a sustained Chinese economic slowdown have weighed on the real, which has slid nearly 30 percent so far this year to its weakest in nearly 13 years. A weaker real fuels inflation by making imports more expensive.\nThe central bank has warned that it will act decisively to prevent consumer price growth from deviating significantly from the government's target.\nHowever, a deepening recession could force policymakers to start cutting rates next year, some economists say.\nThe economy contracted a worse-than-expected 1.9 percent in the second quarter, sinking into what is predicted to be its deepest recession in 25 years.
