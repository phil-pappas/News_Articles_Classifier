The U.S. Markit flash manufacturing PMI was also forecast to stay unchanged at 53.0 this month. \nMSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell as much as 2.5 percent at one point on Wednesday in its biggest daily fall since Aug. 24., as investors sought refuge in U.S. Treasuries. \nSTRONG HEADWINDS \nGlobal investors and policymakers have been on edge over the health of China's economy this year, as it looked set to log its weakest performance in at least a quarter of a century. \nA plunge in China's stock market over the summer and a surprise devaluation in the yuan have roiled global markets, and raised doubts inside and outside China over Beijing's ability to manage the world's second-largest economy. \nThere are signs that China's stumbling economy have unnerved companies, financial markets and consumers around the world. \nSentiment at Asia's top companies soured in the third quarter to a near four-year low as some executives ranked the Chinese market as their top risk, a Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) /INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index (.TRIABS RACSI) showed on Wednesday. \nIn the United States, a study showed well-heeled shoppers spooked by a whipsawing stock markets and shoppers waiting for the best deals could result in the weakest U.S. holiday sales season for retailers this year since a recession in 2010. \nAnd despite China having slashed interest rates five times since November, small- and mid-sized Chinese firms are still starved for funds due to banks' preferences to lend to big, state-owned companies. \nAccounting for up to 80 percent of urban employment and 60 percent of China's GDP, the woes of small Chinese companies could be harbinger of the hard times ahead. \nEuler Hermes (Paris: FR0004254035 - news ) , a seller of trade insurance, predicted this week that corporate bankruptcy in China could surge 50 percent in the next two years to nearly 4,000 cases. \n\"The multi-year low in the PMI confirms the economy will face strong headwinds before finding a new steady state,\" economists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a note on Wednesday. \n\"We continue to look for more fiscal and monetary easing in Q4 to support growth, but do not expect that to change the economy's structural softening trend.\" (Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T10:18:02.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
