To me it was necessary to have a fourth mobile operator,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters on the sideline of a conference in Florence. \n\"That was discussed with the parties. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) seems as if the remedies were not sufficient. \nThe two telecoms operators said on Friday they had dropped plans to merge their Danish units as they could not agree terms with Europe's competition regulator. \nAsked if she was preparing to block the deal, Vestager said: \"We were on the road.\" \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) also said there should be no conclusions drawn from this case on Hutchison Whampoa's merger bids in Italy and Britain, both of which she will examine in the coming months.
