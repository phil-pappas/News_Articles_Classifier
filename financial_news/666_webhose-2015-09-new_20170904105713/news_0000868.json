It is expected to draw more than 50 attendees from firms representing a combined $17 trillion in assets under management.\nSponsors say the success of companies such as burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and specialty grocer Whole Foods Market Inc demonstrates the financial and social benefits of adopting humane sourcing policies.\nThe track records of those companies have investors weighing the risk of not getting on the humane-sourcing bandwagon against a tradition of avoiding social issues perceived to have little impact on share prices.\nThe issues also are grabbing attention in executive suites and boardrooms.\n\"Ten years ago, we were mostly engaging with quality assurance staff. Now we regularly engage at the CEO level, said Matthew Prescott, senior food policy director for HSUS, who is leading a discussion on industrial food production at the event.\nHSUS has worked with dozens of food companies on humane sourcing practices, including McDonald's, which recently announced a North American switch to cage-free eggs by 2025.\n\"There is a lot more debate around these issues and it's across so many segments of society,\" said Michelle Edkins, a BlackRock managing director and global head of the firm's 22-member corporate governance and responsible investment team.\nWith consumer tastes changing quickly, companies may be best served by preempting or anticipating changing sentiment rather that waiting to be hurt by the shifting tide, said Edkins, who added that policy issues around antibiotic resistance and obesity also weigh on investors minds but are not the subject of the meeting.\nCarol Geremia, co-head of global distribution at MFS, said environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics have gained traction with the Boston firm's mainstream clients in recent years.\n\"They want to know we're out there collecting information,\" said Geremia, who added that MFS tries to integrate ESG into many investment decisions.
