AP Share on twitter by Philip Baker One of the major reasons why so much angst has been felt throughout global financial markets worldwide over the past month comes from the sudden end of the unusual calm of recent years.\nVolatility across all asset classes remained at unusually low levels while it looked like central banks had it all under control.\nBut the most worrying aspect of the latest swings in asset prices and investors' increasingly frayed nerves is the fear that central banks don't have the answers any more if there is another disaster.\nThat's one reason why volatility in the local sharemarket is now at its highest level in four years.\nThe potential for markets to feed on themselves in a dangerous way is always a risk, and is one reason the US Federal Reserve may be forced to keep rates steady this month rather than raise them.\nMost economists think the Fed is going to hike rates by one quarter of a percentage point this month, but traders beg to differ.\nAccording to futures traders at the CME, it's just a 27 per cent chance of a move, with a hike in December seen as a 60 per cent chance.\nThe International Monetary Fund has waded into the debate about the Fed moving rates and has warned that the risks around the world have increased to such a level that global growth forecasts might have to downgraded again.\n Since the start of 2015 most major economies have slowed, with the United States being the major exception.\nOn Wednesday night there was confirmation of the strength in the US economy when the Fed's Beige Book was released.\nThe report is released eight times a year and provides a snapshot of economic conditions in the Fed's 12 districts, and it shows that the only sector not doing well is the energy sector, thanks to the falling oil price.\nBut the IMF report talks about a range of risks including a stronger US dollar, currencies collapsing in emerging markets as investors work overtime to get their money out, and falling commodity prices.\nJust two months ago the IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2015 to 3.3 per cent and forecast that growth in China would slow to 6.8 per cent.\nThe warning comes as central bankers and finance ministers make their way to Ankara this weekend for a Group of 20 meeting.\nThe IMF also said the European Central Bank should do another round of quantitative easing , while the Bank of Japan should also be ready to ease monetary policy further.\nThe ECB will meet on Thursday night and there have been calls for the bank to continue to do \"whatever it takes\" to get the eurozone economy growing substantially.\nOverall, has the eruption of risk come to an end? No. Historically, these adjustments have rumbled on for a couple of months and it might not be until November or December that a relief rally takes place.\nThere are another few reasons to be nervous about the outlook for the next few weeks.\nAccording to S&P Capital IQ, September is the only month in which the broader S&P 500 index falls more often than it rises.\nFurthermore, if shares tumble more than 5 per cent in August (and they fell than 6 per cent last month), then 80 per cent of the time shares fall on average 4 per cent in the month of September.\nAt the same time, the outlook for earnings in the US doesn't look encouraging.\nFollowing a poor second quarter where profits were flat, the third-quarter earnings season is tipped to show a fall of close to 4 per cent, according to S&P Capital IQ .\nAt the start of 2015 earnings in the third quarter were forecast to rise 6 per cent.\nAugust has been such a bad month for a number of big-time investors, including Bill Ackman and John Paulson, that a myriad of uncertainties and the lags in hedge fund performance disclosures mean further jolts – probably gentler than the past month's – are still likely.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-09-03T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:03:23.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
