The Australian dollar was little changed Tuesday at 71.09 U.S. cents as of 5 p.m. in Sydney.\n“The bottom line is that the RBA isn’t concerned about China,” said Joseph Capurso, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. “It doesn’t look like the RBA is going to be cutting rates this year. The risk for the Aussie is that it rises from here if the market’s rate-cut pricing is taken out.”\nChinese stocks fell Tuesday, extending the biggest two-month tumble since 2008, after an official factory gauge slumped to a three-year low and concern grew that government intervention to shore up equities will fail. China is Australia’s largest trading partner.\nThe turmoil in China comes at a time when Australia is already dealing with massive business investment cuts and falling prices for its main commodity shipments. Net exports subtracted 0.6 percentage point from gross domestic product in the second quarter, double what economists forecast, the South Pacific nation’s statistics bureau said Tuesday.\nSluggish Growth “Most of the available information suggests that moderate expansion in the economy continues,” Stevens said in his statement after keeping the cash rate at a record-low 2 percent following reductions in May and February. “Key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago, in part reflecting increased supply.”\nThe RBA usually emphasizes increased supply, not falling demand, when discussing commodity prices, said CBA’s Capurso. China’s falling equities won’t impact retail spending or businesses there, he said.\nThe Australian economy probably expanded 0.4 percent in the three months ended June 30 from the first quarter, a report Wednesday is forecast to show. While 26 of the 27 economists polled estimate a positive result, Morgan Stanley is predicting a 0.1 percent contraction.\nThere has been some discussion in the market about the possibility of a weaker-than-expected number, even a negative figure, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Ken Crompton wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nThe Australian economy last contracted in the first quarter of 2011 and the nation hasn’t experienced a recession in more than two decades.\nSwaps imply a 54 percent chance that Stevens and his board will lower the benchmark rate to 1.75 percent at their November meeting.\nA drop in the Australian dollar, which makes exports more competitive, has so far helped the central bank hold back from further easing. The Aussie has declined 13 percent this year and slid to 70.50 cents on Aug. 24, the weakest since April 2009.\n“They’re just waiting to see more information as to whether the market volatility leads to a sharper slowdown than what they were penciling in,” said Kieran Davies, the Sydney-based chief economist for Australia at Barclays Plc. “In the short-term though they’d be happy that at least the currency was heading lower, so it’s operating as something of a safety valve for them.”", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2015/mr-15-15.html\\"], "published": "2015-09-01T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:34:37.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
