The new system was in fact a tremendous stride to this East African nation, that has been in a continuous economic leap over the past two decades. \nFollowing the rapid growth and transformation in all aspects in the country in general and in the capital in particular, and considering the increasing figure of the population of the city as time goes by, the need for fast and modern transportation service has been what all sought after for economic and several other reasons. Until this problem gets washed away for good, observing long queues in nearly every station has been the reality in the capital to put the cards on the table. \nBy the same token, while Ethiopia continues to register an 11% economic growth per annum putting the country to be one of the world's ten fastest growing economies, easing the transportation problem is and will be a must do. \nTherefore, in a bid to arrest the problem in this regard and satisfy the thirst of its people, the government of Ethiopia is spending millions of dollars in building the modern transport systems that will also support the ongoing overall development in the nation. It can, for instance, be recalled that the cost of the Addis light rail system project is 475 million USD. \nThe newly effected line covers the 17-kilometers long portion of the railway, stretching from the North to the South of the capital offering service to tens of thousands of residents daily. In the meantime, it is also eagerly anticipated that the remaining 17-kilometer long route, stretching from East to West part of the capital will begin providing service next month. \nThe commencement of the light rail system, in point of fact, is a sign that the country is audacious and capable of joining ranks with countries of the world with the same rail system and status of development. In fact it is understood that the rail way system to this never-colonized nation is not a new phenomenon; Ethiopia has enjoyed modern train system a century before in its train transportation that stretched from the capital Addis to Djibouti. \nMeanwhile, the Addis light rail system shows multiple positive things about the Ethiopia and the strengthening ties it is having with nations across the globe and with China in particular in this case. The experience gained from the project is also something that can be taken as an asset for the upcoming similar projects. Obviously the job opportunities it has brought is a merit too. \nNot only that the project as well has become a mouth watering feat to the neighbouring countries as it was learnt from fellowships who attended the launching of the service. What a Kenyan said can do here; he said: \"I am happy to witness this project through. I feel envious actually because Kenya does not have such infrastructure. This is a big developmental leap to Ethiopia. I wish Kenya would follow suit.\" \nHowever here it has to be noted that, as the country has invested millions of dollars on it, as mentioned above, passengers should feel responsible to keep good care of the system and the properties in and outside the trains for it is a wealth of the nation and the people. \nThe system may not solve the deep rooted transportation problem that prevailed in the city for years. But it definitely plays a pivotal role in easing the burden on other transportation forms providing a modern travel service. \"Though the project doesn't give a lasting solution to the city's transportation problem, no doubt, it will tackle the problem,\" is what Transport Minister Workeneh Gebeyehu said. \nThe passengers therefore are expected to hold the travel ticket which is currently manual until the automation is in effect. Passengers should know that travelling without ticket is liable to punishment accordingly. Besides, those who travel or cross the rail should not jump over the yellow painted fences. A yellow line on the station is the boundary where people should remain while waiting for the train. Inflammatory objects, animals, some goods including anything that disturbs travellers in the train is strictly forbidden to take into the train. Thus, users should be regularly well informed about rules and regulations Because awareness creation is time taking as it is vital. \nTravellers should get sensitized as to which gate they are expected to use in order to get aboard and get off the train. Continuous education and awareness should be given to the people in order for them to use the elevators, gates and everything of the project carefully and righteously. \nAs the same time, it is Herald's belief that the corporation would pay a close attention to the daily activities of the service and solve on job challenges as quickly as possible. This is what Getachew Betru, CEO, Ethiopian Railway Corporation assured. Getachew said, \"If there are many loopholes, we are ready to identify and address them in due course. We will make strong supervision in areas where movement of people is high,\" he added.
