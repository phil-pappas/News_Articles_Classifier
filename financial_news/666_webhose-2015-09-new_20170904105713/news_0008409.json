I will continue to do my best in whatever capacity the leader sees fit,\" the current finance minister told Sky News on Sunday. \nSenator Cormann said the government should be explaining the economic challenges the nation was facing. \nAs an exporting nation, the government must focus on doing everything it can to ensure the economy is as competitive internationally as it can be, while improving productivity and reducing the cost of doing business. \nFormer Liberal leader John Hewson said it was about marketing the message that gives a better explanation in a very uncertain global economy. \nHe said the government must focus on an objective, like doubling the nation's productivity by 2025, and then go through each of the policy areas to explain what needs to be done, whether it is the reform of industrial relations or tax or energy and energy efficiency. \n\"You need to reset the agenda because we can't go on with this game where one side (of politics) proposes something and the other side immediately says no,\" Dr Hewson told Sky News.
