This new service is helpful mainly to those members who may not have easy access to computers or smartphones.\nEPFO already has in place a Short Code SMS service, which helps members get their details along with contribution and PF balance through an SMS to 7738299899.\nAs an extension to this service, a missed call at 011 22901406 - at no cost to the member - will fetch the user all the required details. As this facility is available only to UAN members, the activation is expected to pick up.\nDattatreya said these services will benefit nearly 3.54 crore contributing members, 49.22 lakh pensioners and 6.1 lakh employers.\nA total of nearly 1.80 crore UAN are activated, 58.72 lakh UAN seeded with Aadhaar and 1.82 crore UAN seeded with bank accounts, he added.\nIn the Hyderabad region, nearly 16.46 lakh contributing members, 1.26 lakh pensioners and 21,817 employers can avail of these facilities.\nThe government, Dattatreya said, is committed to creating an environment conducive to creation of jobs at every level. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:43:45.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
