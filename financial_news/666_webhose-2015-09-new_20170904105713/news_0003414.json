As much a political symbol as an effort to correct the excesses blamed for the worst financial turmoil in decades, the FTT has been debated ever since, delaying the original 2014 start date.\nThere has already been a push to limit the tax's impact on sovereign debt markets.\nCritics have said the levy could hamper a core policy of the EU to establish a \"capital markets union\" to encourage more funding for the economy to come from markets rather than banks.
