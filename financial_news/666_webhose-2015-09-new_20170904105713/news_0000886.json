U.S. Treasuries rose after the decision, with two-year note yields falling the most since March 2009, when the Fed announced its quantitative-easing program.\nIn Europe, policy debates still revolve around the need for additional easing, with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi saying this month that officials are ready to expand the asset-purchase program if needed. Yields on Spanish and Italian government securities dropped to record lows in March after the institution began a 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.3 trillion) bond-buying plan to help boost inflation and growth in the region.\n“What is interesting is the path of rate hikes in 2016 looks much flatter than what some of the investors had expected,”said Daniel Lenz, lead market strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “This is something which will give European bonds some support this morning. Also, given what U.S. Treasuries did yesterday evening, I expect yields across the board will drop this morning.”\nGermany’s 10-year bunds, the euro region’s benchmark sovereign securities, yielded 0.78 percent as of the 5 p.m. London close on Thursday. The price of the 1 percent bond due in August 2025 was 102.08 percent of face value. Yields on similar-maturity Italian bonds were at 1.90 percent, while those on Spain’s were 2.09 percent.\n“The implication for Europe is that the ECB may need to ease policy further,” said Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. “If it’s true there is a competitive devaluation going on, then what the Fed did tonight doesn’t help the ECB. This will take pressure off risky assets. I will be in favor of those. Peripherals are likely to do well.”\nTreasuries Climb Treasury 10-year notes surged after the Fed’s policy announcement, with the yield falling 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 2.19 percent on Thursday, having touched 2.30 percent on Sept. 16, the highest since July. The yield was little changed as of 6:23 a.m. London time Friday. The two-year note yield fell 13 basis points to 0.68 percent on Thursday.\nThe extra yield, or spread, that investors demand for holding Treasury 10-year securities instead of German bunds closed at 141 basis points on Thursday, having widened to 154 basis points on Sept. 15, the most in four weeks on a closing-price basis.\nMarkets had been paring expectations on the Fed lifting rates in September, since the shock currency devaluation by China in August triggered a stock market rout that wiped more than $8 trillion from the value of equities worldwide and drove commodity prices to their lowest in 13 years. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg were almost equally divided, leaning to the Fed maintaining rates at a record low.\nIn a separate summary Thursday, Fed officials cut their median estimate for the fed funds rate at the end of 2016 to 1.4 percent, from the June forecast of 1.6 percent. A year later the median of all the officials’ forecasts rises to 2.6 percent, down from the June projection of 2.9 percent.\nFutures prices compiled by Bloomberg show a 44 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate increase by the Fed in December. That’s down from an about 64 percent chance on Thursday before the policy announcement. The calculation is based on the assumption that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.375 percent after the first increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:55:09.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
