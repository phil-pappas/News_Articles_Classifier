In this context, the weakening of global activity since our last review suggests that commodity prices will remain contained for a while. Still-low industrial capacity utilisation indicates more domestic demand is needed to substitute for weakening global demand in order that the domestic investment cycle picks up,” the RBI has pointed out.\nRajan further said that, “The coming Pay Commission Report could add substantial fiscal stimulus to domestic demand, but the government has reaffirmed its desire to respect its fiscal targets and improve the quality of its spending. Under these circumstances, monetary policy has to be accommodative to the extent possible, given its inflation goals, while recognizing that continuing policy implementation, structural reforms and corporate actions leading to higher productivity will be the primary impetus for sustainable growth”.\nWhat the RBI governor has done, therefore, is facilitate investment to respond more strongly by front-loading the policy action.\nAtsi Sheth, Associate Managing Director, Moody’s Investors Service, says that RBI’s cutting of the repo rate by 0.5% suggests that it ‘sees underlying growth trends as subdued enough to require more aggressive stimulus, given the rising external headwinds to growth’.\nThough it will be simplistic to think that the RBI will still persist with this stance if the inflation scenario is not on expected lines, but it is also a fact that the RBI governor has taken a different turn and he would not like to change course unless there is a strong reason to do so. This is certainly good news for the NDA government.\n 29, 2015 6:53 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:03:07.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
