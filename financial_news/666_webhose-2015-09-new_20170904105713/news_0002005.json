Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Joanna Mather It would take an increase to both the rate and base of the GST to guarantee enough revenue to meet spiralling state health costs to 2050, new modelling shows.\nLifting the GST to 15 per cent and applying it to food, health and education would raise $113.5 billion a year by 2019-20, according to PwC.\nFully compensating every household with income of $100,000 or under would cost $76 billion, leaving $37.5 billion a year.\nThat's just over what NSW Premier Mike Baird says will be required every year by 2030 to fill the growing gap between what the GST delivers and what states need to spend on hospitals.\nPwC tax partner Paul Abbey said when the GST was introduced in 2000, federal budget surpluses allowed the then Howard government to overcompensate lower-income households.\n\"We're going to have to be really targeted and insightful in regard to our compensation structures,\" he said.\nGST models PwC is the second big four accounting firm to model changes to the GST to inform the national tax reform debate.\n A report by Deloitte found a 15 per cent GST would generate enough money for household compensation and a company tax cut to 25 per cent, while still leaving $21 billion a year.\nBut Mr Abbey said Deloitte underestimated the amount of compensation households would require to make the proposition palatable.\n\"The outcome is not politically feasible, bluntly,\" Mr Abbey said.\n\"They overcompensated the first quintile, under compensated the second quintile and massively under compensated the third quintile because they only gave them 50 per cent,\" he said.\nThe third quintile includes household incomes up to $100,000.\n\"That's middle Australia,\" Mr Abbey said. \"You can't give them 50 per cent compensation unless you're planning to lose the election.\"\nIn simple terms, PwC comes up with a figure of $24.5 billion a year left over after increasing the GST to 15 per cent and fully compensating all households with income up to $100,000. Deloitte's less-generous compensation model leaves nearly $29 billion.\nModel for 12.5 per cent The PwC modelling also considers the revenue outcomes of a GST increase to 12.5 per cent and removing exemptions for food, health and education. This gives $24 billion a year after compensation.\nGoing a step further to 15 per cent raises an extra $37.9 billion. This last scenario generates enough revenue to propel the states and territories into surplus, in aggregate terms, by 2020 and keep them in the black until 2050. This surplus peaks at about 2 per cent of GDP in 2020 before dropping steading over the next 30 years.\n\"That sustains the states in a surplus position for quite some time, albeit there is a decline in that performance over time and it is impossible for the model to account for a massive GFC-like external shock,\" Mr Abbey said.\nA situation where the base was broadened to fresh food, health and education and the rate increased to 12.5 per cent keeps the states and territories in surplus until about 2040.\nBecause Australians are saving more – and therefore consuming less – and spending more on the sorts of things that do not attract the GST – such as health and education – the GST is becoming less potent as a revenue generator.\nMay budget The Coalition's May budget locked in $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals over a decade, which was viewed as a ploy to get the states to push for a GST increase.\nMr Baird and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill catapulted the GST debate forward earlier this year when they said they were open to an increase if it helped fund hospitals. Mr Baird argues there should be compensation for all households earning under $100,000, which is what the PwC modelling does.\nFederal Labor does not support any changes to the GST. Labor state governments in Victoria and Queensland have pushed for a 2 percentage point increase in the Medicare levy to fund health.\nThe federal government has been arguing that Australia's GST rate is low and its base narrow, compared with OCED standards.\nUniversity of Sydney professor Rebecca Millar said that in itself was not a reason to make changes.\n\"I'm very suspicious of increasing the GST and expanding the base unless there is genuine reform to income tax and genuine improvement on the welfare side,\" she said.\n\"It's not just base erosion and profit shifting, it's all the concessions for the rich but also the gradual whittling away of the welfare state that concerns me.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-09-20T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:48:33.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
