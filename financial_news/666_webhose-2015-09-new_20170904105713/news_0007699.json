( bit.ly/1KeqBBy )\n\"Noble Group's profits could stay subdued over the next one to two years amid the poor fundamentals of its key traded products, while increased working capital may continue to strain credit metrics,\" the rating agency said.\nThe prices of both iron ore and coal have reached unprecedented lows in 2014 and according to RAM, the prices are envisaged to stay depressed in the near term, exerting pressure on Noble's trading margins and earnings.\nIn June, Standard & Poor's had cut its outlook on Noble Group to negative from stable, saying it expects higher earnings volatility and peer Moody's Investors Service changed the ratings outlook to negative in August.
