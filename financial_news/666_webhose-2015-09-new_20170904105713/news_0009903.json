They decide how much of your money should be devoted to stocks, bonds and other assets. And they shift the stock-bond proportion to a more conservative mix over time. These kinds of funds are now the default investment choice in many retirement plans. The biggest Freedom fund—2020—has $13 billion in assets. But are the Freedom funds, which hold $62.5 billion in total, worthy investments? Nine of Fidelity’s Freedom funds, from target date 2010 through 2050, rank among the top 101 401(k) funds. For now, they are far from Fidelity’s most impressive funds, but they are slowly improving. \nFidelity has been recasting the series for three years. The changes included the creation of a new brand of funds to be used exclusively for the Freedom line. Known as Series funds, they are run by some of the firm’s best investors, including Will Danoff, manager of Fidelity Contrafund, and Joel Tillinghast, who runs most of Fidelity Low-Priced Stock. The firm also revved up the funds’ glide paths—the change in the stock-bond mix over time—to be more aggressive. Now the amount of stocks in almost all of the Freedom funds matches or exceeds that of their typical peers. \nBut these funds aren’t ready for prime-time yet. While the funds performed considerably better in 2014 than they had in previous years relative to their respective peer group, we want to see more consistent numbers before we give them our stamp of approval. Another concern is over-diversification. The 2020 fund holds 26 funds. U.S. stock exposure—45% of the fund’s assets—is divvied up into 14 portfolios. On the bond side, there are eight funds, and some of the slices are razor thin. The 2020 fund has 0.5% of its assets, for example, in a bank-loan fund and another 0.5% in real-estate debt. \nBottom line: The Freedom funds have been disappointing. Of course, this may be the only target-date product offered in your 401(k) plan. In that case if you want a target fund, stick with Freedom. The funds could be better, but they’re not awful. \nFidelity Freedom 2010", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:41:30.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
