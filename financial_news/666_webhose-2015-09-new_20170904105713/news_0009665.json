HomeHero.org \nA senior home care operation that boasts 1,200 caregivers in Los Angeles County should have sprawling offices with a staff heavy in administration, right? Especially since they've provided a million hours of care in about eighteen months. \nThat's not the case with HomeHero.org. The newcomer to providing senior home care has headquarters in Santa Monica just above ground level making it easy to walk by on the street and just as easy to miss when walking up the stairwell. \nCo-founders Kyle Hill and Mike Townsend are an unusual pair to head the operation that's already captured about three percent of the total market in L.A. County. It wasn't too long ago that both graduated from college and were working to launch a point of purchase system that didn't make it beyond the incubation stage. \nThe company is also growing in San Diego, San Francisco, and Orange County. \nThe change in business pursuit came because Kyle's father, living in Ohio, had trouble finding credible caregivers for Kyle's grandmother living in Seattle. Kyle provided some technical help like making it possible for caregivers to clock in and out using a landline to provide one level of accountability. \nA business mentor helped Kyle and Mike see the need in the marketplace. L.A. County has about 20 seniors for every 100 people of working age, according to figures quoted in a March 2015 article in the Daily News. Expect that ratio to double by 2040. \nThe duo used their technical skills to integrate the principles of the shared economy with the personal trust and accountability needed for successful relationships between client families and caregivers. \nHomeHero.org is bringing innovation to the industry like making it possible for client families using GPS systems to track the caregiver when the person is on errands. Clients like the service because the company has a rigorous screening process and charges below market rates. \nCaregivers, who are all Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), like the flexibility. They can take time off when they want and if they need to be away for an extended period of time, they simply close down their profile. The company also lets caregivers keep 85 percent of the fee charged to families, a healthy percentage compared to business models like ride-sharing company Uber where drivers keep about 20 percent of passenger fees. \nThe hi tech platform has a strategic personal touch supported by marketing efforts that include bingo nights, in-person Meetup groups and announcements in church bulletins. \nRead a detailed account of the company's founding and growth on the website Where We Live Work Play.com. \nVisit HomeHero's website for current rates and caregiver information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T22:38:46.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
