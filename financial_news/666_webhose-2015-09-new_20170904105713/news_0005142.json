While the award is certainly special to me, being included in your lives and trusted as your advisor is what I value so much more,” says Matt Teeple of Teeple Wealth Management.\nThe Five Star Wealth Manager award program is the largest and most widely published award program in the financial services industry. The award is based on a rigorous, multifaceted research methodology, which incorporates input from peers and firm leaders along with client retention rates, industry experience and a thorough regulatory history review.\n“Teeple Wealth Management is a unique and completely independent, 100- percent fee-only boutique advisory firm. We are unique in that we are committed to remaining small by capping the number of clients any one advisor works with so that our service to them is top-notch.

We know that many advisors out there have a primary objective to earn a commission and quickly move on to the next sale. We want no part in that. We're in it with our clients for the long term, and everything we do is centered on transparency, building relationships and adding value in the lives of our clients,” says Matt Teeple of Teeple Wealth Management.\nMatt Teeple’s Five Star award profile can be viewed here .\nAbout the research process:\nNow entering its 13th year, Five Star Professional conducts in-depth, market-specific research in more than 45 markets across the United States to identify premium service professionals.\nWealth manager award candidates are identified through firm nominations, peer nominations and industry qualifications, and then evaluated on 10 objective eligibility and evaluation criteria, including client retention rates, client assets administered, firm review and a favorable regulatory and complaint history.\nSelf-nominations are not accepted, and wealth managers do not pay a fee to be considered or awarded.
