Nobody's putting up millions of dollars for me. I'm putting up my own money,\" he said to applause. \nSome commentators suggest securing Trump's loyalty may come at a heavy price for the Republicans if it antagonises those enraged by his more controversial opinions, particularly his insults towards illegal immigrants. \nTrump denies that he is anti-immigrant, only anti-illegal immigration. \nHe suggests he wants to do more to help talented foreigners, such as tech entrepreneurs, engineers, physicists and the best performing foreign students stay in the country and acquire citizenship. \nTrump on Thursday also repeated his love for boundary-pushing rapper Kanye West, who stole headlines at the MTV Video Music Awards by announcing he would run for president in 2020. \n\"I'll never say bad about him. You know why? He loves Trump,\" he said. \n\"I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I'll have to run against him. \n\"I only hit people when they hit me.\" \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:07:52.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
