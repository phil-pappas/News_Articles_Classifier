One of the most curable is Hodgkin's lymphoma, which strikes about 5,000 men in the U.S. each year. Treatment has improved substantially in the past 50 years, with almost 90 percent of patients surviving for at least five years. The most common form is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a more lethal type that affects 38,000 men annually.Mr. Blankfein, who has been CEO of the New York-based firm since 2006, said he underwent a series of tests late this summer after not feeling well. A biopsy last week confirmed lymphoma , he said, adding that he will reduce some previously planned travel during the treatment period.He received the final diagnosis midday Monday and notified the board at around 4 p.m., a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing the internal talks. Jamie Dimon \nMr. Blankfein was scheduled to speak on a panel discussion Monday night at an event sponsored by the Partnership for New York City. He had to pull out and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who arrived on a plane from Singapore earlier in the day, took his place. Mr. Cohn, 55, may be called upon to assume some of Blankfein's obligations during his treatment, the person said.JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Jamie Dimon , 59, the only other CEO of a major U.S. bank who has served since before the 2008 financial crisis, said in July 2014 that he would begin radiation and chemotherapy treatments for throat cancer. He remained active in his role, and told employees of the New York- based bank in December that he was free of the disease.\"I wish my friend Lloyd a fast and full recovery,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"He is blessed with a lot of love and support from family and friends, including me. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his loved ones.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T03:32:34.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
