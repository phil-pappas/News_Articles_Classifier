China's industrial profits fell 8.8% in August compared to a year ago, following a 2.9% drop in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The bureau said exports suffered exchange losses on the yuan's depreciation in August. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is yet another reminder of the creaky nature of China's economy, and, despite mild (and always suspicious) closing gains for the Shanghai Composite, was partly to blame for this Monday's morning losses,\" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. \nElsewhere in Asia, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said inflation would not reach 2% without further improvement in wages, employment and prices. \"The positive feedback loop between the increases in employment and wages and the rise in inflation needs to gain further momentum in order to achieve the price stability target of 2%,\" Kuroda said in a speech to business executives in the western city of Osaka. \nMeanwhile, the shock vote in favour of Catalonian independence shook European markets. Pro-independence parties in Spain's Catalonia region won an absolute majority in regional elections but they fell just short of getting 50% of the vote, winning 1.9m out of 4m ballots cast. Spain's central government in Madrid said it would challenge the move towards independence. \nMichael Van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said a pro-independence win for the Catalonia electorate \"adds to Eurozone political risk, showing desire for the key state to break away from Spain and means the likelihood of an official Scotland-like 'Yes or No' vote in the next 18-months\". \nAcross the Atlantic (Shanghai: 600558.SS - news ) , a report on personal consumption expenditure will be released at 1330 BST and pending home sales figures will be published at 1500 BST. Federal Reserve officials Charles Evans and John Williams will speak at separate events after the close of markets, potentially offering further hints on the timing of an interest rate hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen last week said she expected a rate increase later this year but left the door open on maintaining policy if the global economic outlook worsened. \nOn the corporate front, SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) jumped following a Sunday Times report that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA could bid about $106m for the company as early as Monday. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) slumped after agreeing to sell its Araguaia nickel project to Horizonte Minerals (LSE: HZM.L - news ) for a discount price of $8m. \nVodafone dropped after ending talks with Liberty Global (NasdaqGS: LBTYA - news ) about a merger of the European businesses. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,040.66 -0.65% FTSE 100 6,092.08 -0.28% FTSE 250 16,783.21 -0.10% FTSE 100 - Risers SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) (SAB) 3,735.00p +4.10% Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) (SKY (LSE: BSY.L - news ) ) 1,055.00p +2.03% ITV (ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) ) 252.80p +1.85% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 156.20p +1.23% Diageo (Amsterdam: DO8.AS - news ) (DGE) 1,761.00p +0.63% Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 228.00p +0.62% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,565.00p +0.51% United Utilities Group (UU.) 922.50p +0.44% Associated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) (ABF) 3,255.00p +0.43% Berkeley Group Holdings (The) (BKG) 3,475.00p +0.43% FTSE 100 - Fallers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 92.37p -4.99% Vodafone Group (NasdaqGS: VOD - news ) (VOD) 209.85p -3.58% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 4,623.00p -1.68% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 301.60p -1.53% Intertek Group (Other OTC: IKTSF - news ) (ITRK) 2,381.00p -1.53% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 967.50p -1.48% Experian (Amsterdam: EP8.AS - news ) (EXPN) 1,047.00p -1.32% Carnival (CCL) 3,438.00p -1.24% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 607.50p -1.17% Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) (STAN) 652.50p -1.17% FTSE 250 - Risers Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 83.25p +2.46% Ultra Electronics Holdings (ULE) 1,699.00p +2.41% Vesuvius (VSVS) 359.50p +2.28% Home Retail Group (HOME) 136.20p +2.02% Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) (MAB) 328.10p +1.80% Poundland Group (Other OTC: PDLDF - news ) (PLND) 279.90p +1.67% Renishaw (RSW) 2,001.00p +1.47% Wood Group (John) (WG.) 591.50p +1.20% Polymetal International (Other OTC: AUCOY - news ) (POLY) 555.00p +1.09% Melrose Industries (Other OTC: MLSPF - news ) (MRO) 263.80p +1.03% FTSE 250 - Fallers Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) (ALM) 359.70p -5.34% Just Retirement Group (JRG) 165.40p -4.94% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 97.15p -4.29% Worldwide Healthcare Trust (WWH) 1,752.00p -4.05% Enterprise Inns (LSE: ETI.L - news ) (ETI (Shenzhen: 002005.SZ - news ) ) 108.30p -2.52% Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) (ACA) 241.20p -1.95% NMC Health (LSE: NMC.L - news ) (NMC (Other OTC: NMCX - news ) ) 820.00p -1.86% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 66.00p -1.71% Crest Nicholson Holdings (CRST) 575.00p -1.71% Rotork (Frankfurt: RO41.F - news ) (ROR) 166.30p -1.54% FTSE TechMARK - Risers SDL (Shenzhen: 002658.SZ - news ) (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 335.00p +3.72% XP Power Ltd (LSE: XPP.L - news ) .
