It has been \"meticulously preserved\" by the owners, according to the listing , and even little details—like the bold bathroom wallpaper and the built-in food processor—are original to Sinatra.

That couple never moved in, and records indicate the property entered foreclosure before the current owners acquired it for $350,000 (£230k) in 1998. \nThough the listing doesn't name the current owners, previous news reports as well as property records show that a woman named Naomi Ritz bought it. She was a longtime friend of Sinatra, the Desert Sun said. \nRitz told the L.A. Times she didn't change the home much because she \"felt it was important to keep it pure Sinatra.\" \nFor a party pad, it’s pretty classy. The desert hideout property includes three buildings—the main house, a guesthouse and a pool house—at an elevation of 4,300 feet, overlooking the Coachella Valley. Together they comprise eight bedrooms, 12.5 bathrooms, nine stony fireplaces and about 6,428 square feet of living space. \nSinatra picked the spot not only for its privacy but because temperatures are about 20 degrees lower than they are on the desert floor, the listing says. When the heat grew too much in Palm Springs—where he kept a better-known residence —he could fly his guests up to this Mountain Center compound, which has a helipad. \nThe five-bedroom main house takes the form of a rustic lodge. It’s stuffed with fireplaces and includes multiple viewing decks, as well as two separate kitchens. \nThe guesthouse features three separate suites that each have their own mini-kitchens, baths, fireplaces and decks. A little secret: Two of the suites actually connect through a passageway in the closets, perfect for keeping romantic trysts behind closed doors. \nAmenities for entertaining include a lighted, rock-lined pool with sauna and pool house as well as a tennis court. \nMore blasts from the past on Yahoo Homes:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:49:30.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
