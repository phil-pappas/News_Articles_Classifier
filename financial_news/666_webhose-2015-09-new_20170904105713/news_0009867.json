Tairen China Fund gained 3.7 percent last month, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked to remain anonymous.\nSome Asia hedge funds were able to avert large declines as they reduced risky positions and got out of China-focused trades before a rout in the stock market intensified. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index plummeted 8.5 percent last month, including a 4.3 percent decline on Aug. 24, amid a global correction triggered by concerns that China’s growth is slowing.\n“The alarm bells were sounded early, in the end of June and the start of July, over China,” said Mohammad Hassan, an analyst with Eurekahedge Pte in Singapore. “Asian managers who had realized steep losses in July adopted a more cautious approach going into August.\"\nHedge funds around the world were hurt last month amid rising volatility across markets. In the U.S., Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital were among managers with August declines. Winton Capital Management and Cantab Capital Partners, two U.K. computer-driven hedge funds, also fell.\nFunds Slump Greater China-focused hedge funds lost 6.2 percent in August, capping three consecutive monthly losses unseen since July 2012, according to an index compiled by Eurekahedge , with more than 75 percent of funds yet to report August numbers to the data provider. Eurekahedge had earlier estimated that China hedge funds plunged as much as 10 percent in August.\nThe Pine River China Fund’s August return brought this year’s gain to 8.2 percent and ended a two-month losing streak, according to an investor update. The multistrategy fund that trades stocks, convertible bonds and credit is helmed by Hong Kong-based Dan Li and made 30 percent for investors in 2014.\nSegantii, Tairen The more than $1.2 billion Segantii Asia-Pacific Equity Multi-strategy Fund extended this year’s gain to just above 31 percent after rising in August, according to a performance estimate sent to investors on Sept. 4. The fund, led by Hong Kong-based Chief Investment Officer Simon Sadler, a former head of equity trading for HSBC Holdings Plc’s regional securities unit, trades Asian equities and equity-linked securities with a focus on North Asia.\nThe Tairen China Fund, which has about $400 million in assets, added to a 25 percent return in the first seven months of the year, according to the person with knowledge of the matter.\nSpokespeople for Pine River, Segantii and Tairen declined to comment.\nFunds from BosValen Asset Management and Zeal Asset Management had narrower losses versus benchmarks, even as they declined for the month, the firms said.\nThe $226 million Zeal China Fund lost 4.6 percent in August and was up 0.3 percent this year, said Franco Ngan, chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based Zeal, in an e-mail. That compared to a 12 percent loss in July.\nBosValen Asset Management’s Asia hedge fund, which oversees just under $400 million of assets, lost 3.5 percent in August, said Chief Investment Officer Ken Xu, a former managing director at SAC Capital Advisors and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC.\nCutting Exposure Since June, BosValen has gradually cut the fund’s gross exposure by as much as 40 percent from its normal level, mainly by scaling back on Greater China stocks, said Xu in a phone interview. Greater China companies, including those with American depository receipts and Hong Kong or China-listed shares, typically account for 40 percent to 70 percent of its gross exposure.\nThe cuts were made \"because of extreme volatility in Asian and global markets, also uncertainties in currencies and economic policies,” Xu said.\nSome industries and companies still have long-term structural growth opportunities even in an uncertain economic environment, he added.\n\"We’re prepared for opportunities to invest in these companies with more attractive valuations given market selloffs,” he said.\nSome funds suffered bigger setbacks in August. The $2 billion Greenwoods Golden China Fund, one of the largest hedge funds focused on the country, lost 8.9 percent in August, eroding this year’s gain to 6.6 percent, according to an investor update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:45:53.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
