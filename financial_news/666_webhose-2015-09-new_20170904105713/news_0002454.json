Sydney jumped 1.5 percent and Taipei surged three percent. \nShanghai and Hong Kong led a regional rally Tuesday despite data showing another slump in Chinese trade, with experts suggesting Beijing stepped in to support mainland shares. The figures also raised the prospect China would unveil further economy-boosting measures, following five interest rate cuts since November. \nThe baton was then taken up in Europe where London, Frankfurt and Paris all tacked on more than one percent, helped by data showing the eurozone grew more than expected in April-June. Then, in New York all three major indexes surged more than two percent. \n\"Expectations for more policy action from China and strength in the European economy saw the return of risk,\" Chihiro Ohta, general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Bloomberg News. \n\"At long last, we may be seeing a real rebound.\" \nCurrency markets also saw traders take a risk-on attitude, with the dollar at 120.29 yen from 119.82 Tuesday in New York, while the euro was at 134.64 yen from 134.22 yen. \nThe yen had been climbing in recent weeks as dealers moved into safer investments to protect them from the global market convulsions. \nAlso, the \"Aussie\" dollar was at 70.52 US cents against 69.75 cents late Tuesday in Tokyo and is well up from the six-year lows around 69.00 cents plumbed at the end of last week. \nEmerging currencies enjoyed a rare advance, with the South Korean won up 0.8 percent against the greenback, the Indian rupee 0.4 percent higher and Malaysia's ringgit 0.7 percent stronger. \nHowever, there remains uncertainty over the Fed's plans for raising interest rates, with the China crisis muddying the waters for bank policymakers as they prepare for a meeting next week. \nChris Weston, chief markets strategist in Melbourne at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , warned further market ructions if a hike is announced, which could drag on investment opportunities. \"We won't rule out more volatility ahead of the US meeting next week,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:20:33.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
