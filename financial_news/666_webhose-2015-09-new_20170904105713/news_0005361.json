The North West Shelf project partners, including Woodside, later went ahead with a $US15 billion expansion of the Pluto LNG plant at Karratha.\nIt is now Woodside's turn to convince O'Neill that its ownership of Oil Search will bring advantages to the country that would not otherwise occur under existing arrangements.\nThat will be a challenge for Woodside chairman Michael Chaney and chief executive Peter Coleman for two reasons.\nFirst, Oil Search is regarded by O'Neill as PNG's only successful national champion. He has invested a considerable amount of his own credibility in Oil Search being a long-term success.\n His decision last year to approve the purchase of a 10 per cent stake in the company funded by a $1.2 billion loan from UBS was highly controversial. It led to the sacking of the then treasurer, Don Poyle, who refused to sign the UBS loan arrangement.\nThe PNG government investment in Oil Search is a tribute to the negotiating skills of Oil Search chief executive Peter Botten and his advisers, UBS.\nIn one fell swoop, Botten bound up the company's commercial interests with O'Neill's ambitions for the long-term economic development of PNG.\nThe Prime Minister will be reluctant to approve a merger that involves him swapping a 10 per cent holding in a company based in PNG operating under PNG law for a 3 per cent stake in an Australian company based in Perth with a diverse array of other interests.\nChaney and Coleman will have to come up with compelling arguments as to why PNG will be better off aligning itself with Woodside.\nThe second reason why Woodside will find it challenging to convince O'Neill of Woodside's worth to PNG is that its potential contribution to economic development will be measured against two global oil and gas giants, Total and Exxon.\nThese two gorillas of the LNG industry are already well entrenched in PNG. Exxon partnered with Oil Search in the PNG LNG project and Total is partnering with Oil Search in the $US20 billion Elk-Antelope development.\nExxon and Total bring world class technical engineering skills and financial strength to the task of extending the expansion of PNG's natural resources.\nThe second criteria that must be considered by O'Neill is the commercial consideration involved in Woodside's offer.\nThis is a tricky topic thanks to the complex deal that stands behind last year's purchase of PNG's 10 per cent stake in Oil Search.\nWhen UBS lent PNG the $1.2 billion to buy the stock, it put in place a collar derivative arrangement to protect PNG against any downside in the share price as well as capping any upside.\nThe price paid for the stock was $8.20, which is well above the effective price of $7.64 a share inherent in the 1-for-4 scrip offer.\nUBS has never revealed the details of the various strike prices associated with the collar derivative transaction and it never will. Without that information, it is difficult to know whether the PNG government is sitting on a loss on its investment in Oil Search.\nUBS has maintained ownership of the stock as security for the loan to the PNG government.\nThe offer price is said by Woodside to be at a 23 per cent premium to the three-month-volume weighted average price before the deal was leaked in Street Talk .\nWhile that premium has a semblance of merit at a time of low oil prices, it does not appear to capture the strategic value of the Oil Search assets.\nSome of the peculiarities of the deal were highlighted by Credit Suisse analyst Mark Samter in a note to clients on Tuesday. He said the scrip offer was confusing given Woodside's low cost of debt and the valuation appeared to ignore the value of Elk Antelope development.\nSamter, who is famous for his correct call on Santos needing to fix its balance sheet, says a deal would need to be far closer to $10 to get over the line. Another analyst, Nik Burns at UBS, said the premium being offered was only 13.5 per cent when compared with the prior closing price of $6.73 a share.\nBurns said: \"We don't see Oil Search accepting an offer at this level, given the quality of its growth portfolio and value potential.\"\nWoodside is sitting on about $3.2billion in cash and can therefore afford to include a cash component with any offer. Both ratings agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, noted the improved cash flow benefits for Woodside from completing a merger. S&P was worried about the high level of country risk.\nThe deal sets up an interesting tussle between some leading investment banks.\nMerrill Lynch and Gresham are advising Woodside while Morgan Stanley is advising Oil Search. The National Petroleum Company PNG is being advised by UBS. That advice will surely find its way to O'Neill.\nNAB cops a battering Liberal Senator Ian Macdonald has given National Australia Bank a battering in a speech in the Senate for allegedly turning its back on the financing of coal investments.\nMacdonald, who is from Queensland, said he would be distressed if NAB had stopped funding fossil fuels. He said that would involve the bank succumbing to the propaganda of the Greens.\nA NAB spokesperson said Macdonald had got the wrong end of the stick. It was not true that NAB had stopped funding coal projects.\n\"NAB looks at all financing project proposals on a case-by-case basis and assesses a potential borrowers capacity to repay, management, reputation, industry fundamentals, legal, tax, insurance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\"We have a role to play in transitioning to a low carbon economy. We also believe we have the responsibility to fund projects that will secure Australia's energy needs now and into the future and coal has an important role to play in this.\"\nHedge funds How powerful are hedge funds? Read between the lines of everything that has been written and said about Swiss commodities trading house Glencore and it is clear the company's capital raising was in direct response to a perceived attack from hedge funds.\nGlencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg , only decided to raise $US2.5 billion and slash debt by $US10billion because about 6 per cent of the company had been sold short.\nHe could see no reason for the need to have a more conservative balance sheet but accepted the fact that the hedge fund short selling would not cease until he did.\nThe question now is whether or not he has raised enough capital.\nIt will be very costly to go back to the well for more.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-09-08T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:06:04.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
