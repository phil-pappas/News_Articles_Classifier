It was John Ford’s favorite film of all time, and no wonder, what with 3,000 pies thrown in a custardly climax of epic proportions. The long-lost treasure was presented by the man responsible for its re-emergence, a restoration expert and zestful showman named Serge Bromberg; he’s become a festival attraction in his own right. “There are a lot of funny films at Telluride this year,” Mr. Bromberg said with blithe irony that could have been mistaken for generosity. Funny films are in short supply these days, when pie throwers are less common than bomb throwers. Still, there was one masterly comedy at Telluride this year, plus lots of surprising, stirring films that provided a generous measure of serious fun.\nThe comic standout—tragicomic, really, in the fullest sense of the term—was “Marguerite,” a film from France with a wider emotional spectrum than anything else in the festival. Catherine Frot is at once hilarious and heartbreaking as the heroine of the title, a wealthy aristocrat who, in the 1920s, fancies herself an opera diva even though her voice is ghastly enough to shatter crystal. The director, Xavier Giannoli, and his co-writer, Marcia Romano, have loosely based their film on the life of Florence Foster Jenkins, an American socialite of similarly talent-free devotion whose concerts made her an object of affection as well as derision. (An American film, currently titled “Florence Foster Jenkins,” will star Meryl Streep in the title role.) The dangers in such a subject are many, but “Marguerite” gracefully sidesteps every mine in the field. Rather than view its heroine with indulgent condescension, it sees her as a lover of life, and the arts, in whom delusion is far exceeded by heedless passion.\nPowerful performances are an essential part of film-festival allure; at Telluride this year they were in copious supply—sometimes in films that deserved them, sometimes not, and more often than not in films about or dominated by women.\nENLARGE Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling in ‘45 Years’ Photo: Sundance Selects Charlotte Rampling, co-starring with Tom Courtenay in the excellent “45 Years,” has a scene that’s as affecting as anything I’ve seen in many years. After making a shocking discovery, her character, Kate, ages visibly while the camera studies her stunned features.\nCarey Mulligan turns a meat-and-potatoes script into substantial portions of caviar in “Suffragette,” a feature with a weakness for anachronism that dramatizes a laundry worker’s radicalization during the battle for the vote in early 20th century England. (Meryl Streep has slightly more than a cameo and much less than a role as Emmeline Pankhurst, a leader of the movement about whom the film provides no information.)\nWatch a film clip from \"Carol,\" starring Rooney Mara, Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson. Photo: Weinstein Co. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are superb as lesbian lovers in “Carol,” a Todd Haynes film, based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, that’s set in the early 1950s, when such relationships were beyond the pale. Here’s an instance in which performances plus a gorgeous evocation of the period—down to a sleek Packard sedan that evokes the contours of Ms. Blanchett’s face—almost compensate, though not quite, for a deficit of dramatic urgency.\nIngrid Bergman isn’t exactly a performer in “Ingrid Bergman—In Her Own Words”; she’s the subject of Stig Björkman’s fascinating documentary, which preserves Bergman’s glamour and charm while exploring her huge ambition, and the desperate folly of her romantic attraction to the Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini. But oh, how my heart went pitter-patter when, at the end of her screen test for “Intermezzo,” her first Hollywood film, she flashes that inimitable and perpetually dazzling Bergman smile.\nENLARGE Michael Fassbender in ‘Steve Jobs’ Photo: Universal Pictures Formidable actors come in both genders, and both are represented brilliantly in the hyperkinetic “ Steve Jobs ”—by Michael Fassbender in the title role, and by Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Apple’s marketing chief, who became famous for her fearlessness in standing up to her famously willful and often truculent boss. Danny Boyle directed from Aaron Sorkin’s daring, provocative and problematic script, which takes its structure from a decades-long succession of product launches that Jobs turned into performance art, and finds its emotional center—unconvincingly for me, on first view—in the fraught relationship between Jobs and his daughter Lisa.\nWatch the film trailer for \"Black Mass,\" starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch. Since “Black Mass” will be opening commercially next week, I’ll limit my comments on Scott Cooper’s remarkable—and flagrantly violent—biopic about James “Whitey” Bulger, the peerlessly murderous South Boston mob boss who was also an informant for the FBI. Suffice it to say for now that Johnny Depp is phenomenal in the central role, and that Joel Edgerton is equally so as John Connolly, the FBI agent who was no less corrupt than the criminal he handled. (I can’t resist adding that for at least a decade Bulger was my down-the-block neighbor in Santa Monica, a grey-haired guy who called himself Charlie and, just like me, walked his dog in nearby Palisades Park.)\nWatch the film trailer for \"Spotlight,\" starring Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo. Photo: Kerry Hayes “Spotlight,” a newspaper procedural directed by Tom McCarthy from a script he wrote with Josh Singer, is a showcase of ensemble distinction, thanks to flawless work by Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and, among many others, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Billy Crudup. More than that, “Spotlight” is a vividly clear and relentlessly dramatic account of how the Boston Globe exposed widespread sexual abuse in—and far beyond—the Boston archdiocese of the Catholic Church. In a brief, heartfelt speech before the screening, Mr. McCarthy spoke of the “shrinking world of cinema” in which filmmakers find it increasingly difficult to get serious films like this one financed and produced. “Spotlight” doesn’t feel shrunk, though. Big and bold, it’s a testament to the importance of independent film, and of investigative reporting.\nWatch the film trailer for \"Room,\" starring Brie Larson, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. Photo: A24 Films We bring our prejudices to screenings, like it or not. I’ve usually disliked movies with few characters set in claustrophobic spaces. (Last year I loved “Locke,” a monodrama set entirely inside a car, but what’s a prejudice for if you can’t violate it?) “Room,” directed by Lenny Abrahamson from Emma Donoghue’s adaptation of her popular novel, could hardly be more claustrophobic, and I dreaded the prospect of being stuck in a theater watching a film about a mother and her young son locked up in a single room. (The novel was inspired by the real-life cases of Elisabeth Fritzl and Jaycee Lee Dugard, young women who had been kidnapped, raped, held captive, and bore children sired by the rapists.) My dread was entirely misplaced. “Room” is an enthralling film with two exceptional performances: Brie Larson as Ma, and Jacob Tremblay as 5-year-old Jack.\nWatch the film trailer for \"He Named Me Malala,\" starring Malala Yousafzai, Ziauddin Yousafzai and Mobin Khan. Photo: Fox Searchlight I didn’t dread the prospect of seeing “He Named Me Malala.” I simply doubted that Davis Guggenheim’s documentary could add much new to the widely—indeed incessantly—celebrated story of Malala Yousafzai, the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize who, as a 15-year-old in Pakistan, was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen after speaking out in favor of education for girls. Here again I was dead wrong. “Malala” is thrilling, and not only because its young subject, now 18, is enchanting. Mr. Guggenheim has extended his film’s perspective to Malala’s father, Ziauddin, a force for enlightenment if ever there was one. Mr. Yousafzai was there in the flesh at the film’s screenings, gracious and articulate, while his daughter delighted the audience via Skype video from her home in England. Malala said it was all well and good that she’d won a Nobel prize, but what she was really proud of was getting all A’s in her recent exams.\nEvery festival has its clunkers; this one was no exception. “Taj Mahal” recounts the 2008 Islamic terrorist attack on Mumbai’s Taj Mahal hotel from the perspective of Louise (Stacy Martin), an 18-year-old French girl separated from her parents and forced to take refuge in the family’s spiffy suite. Unfortunately Louise is, from the outset, vapid bordering on dislikable. She’s a questionable heroine in a bare-bones narrative with an interminable anticlimax that serves only to boost the running time so the dinky film can pass for a theatrical feature.\nEvery festival should have its small-scale revelations, or curiosities, to complement the commercial attractions: this one did, memorably. The singular curiosity was “Anomalisa,” an animated tale of anomie by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. I can’t say I enjoyed it, even though this may well be the first stop-motion film in which nude puppets make love, but I’m glad it got made, and I can’t get the damned thing out of my head. (David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan did the voices.)\nThe revelations included Jayro Bustamante’s fine debut feature “Ixcanul,” from Guatemala, and Grimur Hákonarson’s “Rams,” from Iceland. In the former, a coming of age story with a sociopolitical thrust, a teenage girl with the face of a Mayan goddess brings opprobrium to her parents, poor tenant farmers living on a coffee plantation at the foot of an active volcano. In the latter, two sheep-farmer brothers who haven’t spoken to each other for 40 years face a personal and financial crisis when disease threatens their respective flocks. However dry or schematic that may sound, Mr. Hákonarson’s little saga is a marvel of deadpan comedy with an improbably beautiful climax. In other words, just the sort of film that dyed-in-the wool festival-goers hope to discover.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK749_FilmAr_P_20150910150032.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK749_FilmAr_M_20150910150032.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AK747_FilmAr_P_20150910150221.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-10T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:22:42.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
