In fact in just 12 to18 months from now, Zambia shall become a net exporter of energy,\" President Lungu said. \nHe also informed the House that a refined petroleum multi-product pipeline worth $2.5 billion would be built from Lobito bay in Angola to Lusaka under a private-sector initiative supported by his Government. \nThe pipeline, whose construction will commence in 2017, will be designed to deliver refined petroleum products as well as gas for power generation for the country estimated at 500 to 1,000MW.
