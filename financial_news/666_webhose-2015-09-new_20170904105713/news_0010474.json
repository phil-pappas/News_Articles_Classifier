The economy declined by 1.9 per cent in the second quarter, while fixed investment fell 8.1 per cent. \nThe political temperature surrounding the Petrobras probe has also risen after the filing 10 days ago of the first indictments of leading politicians, including speaker of the lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha. Unlike the business executives who are being tried by Mr Moro in Curitiba, the cases against elected politicians are taken out of his hands and transferred to the country’s supreme court in Brasília. \nWith the discovery of new oilfields and greater emphasis on state-led economic development, Petrobras has come in recent years to play a much larger role in the economy. However, the arrest of a series of executives from Petrobras and construction companies it works with have brought some of its projects to a halt. The company’s latest long-term plan for 2015-2019 included a 37 per cent cut in investment from its previous forecast. \nA recent study by GO Associados, a São Paulo consultancy, calculated that the economic impact from the Petrobras corruption scandal over the next few years — including reduced investment by the company, construction activity and jobs — will amount to R$142.6bn, which is equivalent to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The cost of systematic corruption is extraordinary \n- Sérgio Moro \nJosé Roberto Mendonça de Barros, a prominent Brazilian economist, said the impact from the corruption probe was hard to calculate because Petrobras would be suffering anyway as a result of oil prices falling to $40. “Petrobras is now effectively being run by its finance director,” he said, in reference to the huge constraints it is now operating under. “Any company being run by its finance director is facing a lot of problems.” \nIn his speech on Monday, which won a standing ovation, Mr Moro rejected the suggestion that the Petrobras corruption cases were the cause of the sharp economic downturn in Brazil. “The policeman who discovers a crime is not to blame for the corpse,” he said. \nThe elaborate system of bribes surrounding the company, which prosecutors estimate to be worth about $2bn, was one reason Petrobras had made a series of disastrous investment decisions in recent years. “If economic agents do not have confidence that they can compete on equal terms for public contracts, if there is a grey zone of bribe payments, then that impacts the functioning of the market,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:26:59.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
