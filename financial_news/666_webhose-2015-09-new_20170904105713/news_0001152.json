Donovan had a reputation in Vermont and around the country as a go-to person for inmates with legal research questions. \nThe Vermont Law School in South Royalton is stepping into the breach to offer some of the services the state law library in Montpelier offered before its budget was cut. \nBut Cynthia Lewis, director of the law school's library, says the school is waiting for a state grant to come through to fund a half-time person to provide research assistance to inmates. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T21:18:55.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
