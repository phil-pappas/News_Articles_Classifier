The S&P 500 index had its worst performance in four years as a result of August's market selloff, slumping 6.9% for the three-months ending Sept. 30, despite the market rally on Wednesday. The index is down 6.7% for the year. \nThat said, some stocks somehow managed to avoid the selloff and correlating volatility, most prominently several stocks in the tech, utilities and consumer sectors. Teco Energy earned the title of best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the third quarter. \nHere are the 10 best-performing stocks for the quarter, paired with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if they're still good stocks to buy. More Headlines A+ Rated Mid-Cap Stocks With Low Debt to Buy \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n10. Advance Auto Parts Inc. Industry: Consumer Goods & Services/Automotive Retail Market Cap: $12.6 billion Third-Quarter Return: 18.9% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC (AAP) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, growth in earnings per share, revenue growth, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Investors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company's shares by a sharp 33.82% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Turning to the future, naturally, any stock can fall in a major bear market. However, in almost any other environment, the stock should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed nice gains in the past year. ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC has improved earnings per share by 7.4% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC increased its bottom line by earning $6.71 versus $5.33 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($8.30 versus $6.71). Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 10.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 0.9%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. 48.52% is the gross profit margin for ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 6.32% trails the industry average. The debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.64, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Even though the company has a strong debt-to-equity ratio, the quick ratio of 0.20 is very weak and demonstrates a lack of ability to pay short-term obligations.
