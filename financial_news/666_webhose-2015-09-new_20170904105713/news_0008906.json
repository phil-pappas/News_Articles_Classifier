The numbers include equity raisings, initial public offerings and convertible issuance.\nLarge equity raisings by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank have buoyed this year's numbers, as banks have moved to bolster their capital buffers.\nFinance sector ECM volume has climbed to a record $US12.1 billion so far this year.\nSecondary issuance has been the standout this year, Dealogic data showed, as new issuance reflecting sharemarket floats dropped 53 per cent over the period to $US3.2 billion. The largest initial public offering in the September quarter was the float of fresh food business Costa Group.\nThe runway for IPOs is bumpy, however, following the postponement, cancellation and repricing of various offers this year. An institutional bookbuild for the Aventus Retail Property Fund listing was delayed last week and the float of insurance distributor Greenstone was also shelved earlier this year as fund managers questioned pricing around the transaction.\nSome companies are not deterred by the environment and are still lining up for a run at the local bourse despite shaky market conditions. Among those are private-equity-backed Link Group, healthcare company Integral Diagnostics and retailer Baby Bunting.\nBlock trades have also been a feature of activity this year as many stakes in companies that listed last year, or earlier, come out of escrow. Among recent sell-downs are stakes in hospital company Healthscope and hotel group Mantra.\n Morgan Stanley's local investment banking chief Richard Wagner expects a measured finish to 2015 for local ECM, barring any major ructions in markets offshore.\n\"From where we sit today we are going to see the ECM backlog clear out,\" he said.\nHerbert Smith Freehills' partner Philippa Stone also expects a steady finish to the year for ECM activity, including more block trades, against the backdrop of continued volatility in markets and concerns around domestic economic growth.\n\"We are aware of significant and continuing IPO interest,\" she said. \"Obviously one is cautious, particularly as markets are choppy ... but we are cautiously optimistic.\"\nMacquarie Group's co-head of ECM, Hugh Falcon, said: \"There are four or five quality IPOs for the remainder of the year and we expect they will be well received by the market, notwithstanding the recent spike in volatility.\n\"Block trades have been a significant feature this year,\" Mr Falcon added, noting that many of the transactions had been executed at \"tighter discounts\" in 2015 than in previous years.\nMr Falcon also said that while the anticipated increase in M&A financing had not materialised in a big way, activity via balance sheet repair had risen.\nIn the ECM league tables for Australia, UBS ranks in top spot with transactions amounting to $US6.4 billion. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie rank second and third.\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity has been strong so far this year, but has lagged frenzied global activity. Australia targeted M&A volume totals $US79.1 billion in 2015, up 31 per cent on the same period last year and the highest year-to-date total since 2011. Those figures do not include outbound transactions by Australian companies, which have almost doubled to $US19.3 billion.\nWoodside Petroleum's $11 billion-plus bid for Oil Search is the largest deal announced in 2015 so far, despite some doubts about whether a transaction will be consummated.\nDealogic noted that the transport sector was the busiest for M&A this year, helped by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners' tilt at Asciano. The mining and oil-and-gas sectors were the next-busiest industry groupings for deals.\nMr Wagner is of the view that with the lower Australian currency stabilising at current levels more inbound acquisitions may be on the horizon.\nIn the M&A tables, Macquarie leads the pack working on transactions amounting to $US34.4 billion. Gresham Partners and Goldman Sachs round out the top three.\nIn debt capital markets, Australian year-to-date bond issuance fell to $US109.4 billion, reflecting a four-year low for volumes as at September 16. NAB led the DCM tables.\nMacquarie was out in front on Dealogic's core investment banking fee measure, followed by UBS and JPMorgan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:08:27.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
