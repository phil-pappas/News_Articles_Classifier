Productivity contracted at a 1.1 percent rate in the first quarter.\nThe government last week revised second-quarter gross domestic product to show GDP expanding at a 3.7 percent annual pace instead of the 2.3 percent rate it had initially estimated.\nBut the trend in productivity remains weak. Productivity rose 0.7 percent from a year ago instead of the 0.3 percent increase reported last month.\nGrowth in productivity is an important determinant of the economy's non-inflationary speed limit.\nThough the second-quarter bounce back is dampening wage pressure for now, the weak trend in productivity suggests the economy's growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent pace that economists have been estimating.\nThat would imply the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflation pressures may take hold a little bit faster than had been anticipated.\nUnit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 1.4 percent rate in the second quarter, rather than increasing at a 0.5 percent rate as previously reported.\nUnit labor costs rose 1.7 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014. They increased at a 2.6 percent rate in the first quarter.\nCompensation per hour increased at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged from last month's estimate. It was up 2.5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014.
