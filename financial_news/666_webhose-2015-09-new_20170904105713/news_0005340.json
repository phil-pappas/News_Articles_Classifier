Then, so the theory goes, the stockmarket will proceed to climb its wall of worry. And the wall includes\n Some people are still wondering whether to sell, when investment theory says they now should be starting to ask when is it the time to buy?\nThat's why the first sell is the best one, but it can also be hard to pull the trigger. (Taking a smaller loss now rather than a bigger one later is the theory). Real capitulation involves an extremely busy day with huge amounts of shares trading hands and very sharp declines in prices. The volumes on Thursday weren't as large as they were last week when the major S&P ASX200 index was closer to 5000 .\nStill, the major index fell 2 per cent on Thursday after gaining more than 2 per cent in the previous session, a rare combination. Indeed 2 per cent days in whatever direction are rare but two consecutive sessions with a 2 handle, and in the opposite direction are unusual.\nAll up, the index has fallen about 15 per cent from its recent peak so it's not yet in bear-market territory, as defined by a 20 per cent fall.\nIf there is something that stands out during this week's wild ride in the sharemarket it is this: widespread nervousness and uncertainty means these dizzying swings in sentiment will continue to menace markets.\nAnd when equity markets take a tumble, even the good companies often get caught up in the melee. But that's a chance to add to the portfolio.\nSome analysts have compared the sell-off to the Asian and emerging markets crisis in 1997 and 1998. The local sharemarket fell 10-23 per cent in those years but managed to recover both times.\nThe thing about emerging markets is you can get them very right or very wrong.\nThe more bears that come out of hibernation and hog the headlines, the closer investors will get to capitulation.\nA few more dire warnings, like the one from Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter who reckons there is a 55 per cent chance of a global recession in the next two years, should do the trick.\nMr Buiter thinks a recession will force central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe to beef up their monetary stimulus.\nBut that's a problem in itself. One of the main reasons markets are so skittish now is the fear that what central banks have done since the crisis hasn't really worked. The Federal Reserve wants to hike rates but there is so much debate about how the world will cope. If the globe can't cope with a quarter of a percentage point rate rise from zero, where rates have been since 2008, then maybe investors have a right to be nervous.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-the-big-payback-20150909-gjj3r5.html"], "published": "2015-09-10T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:06:50.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
