As many as one in three of the jobs lost in the Great Recession and its aftermath could have been caused by such collective consumer frugality. That's up to 1.85 million more job losses than there would have been otherwise. The statistics are examined in a new working paper titled Trading Down and the Business Cycle , published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The paper states that between 22% and 36% of the jobs lost were because of consumers \"trading down,\" or buying lower quality products and services. \"When consumers suffer a reduction in their income, they trade down in the quality of the goods and services they consume,\" the report states. \"Lower quality products are generally less labor intensive, so trading down reduces the demand for labor.\" An example might be forgoing dinner at a Del Frisco's Restaurant Group steakhouse in favor of beans-on-toast at the local greasy spoon or curling up in front of the television with a container of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese from Kraft Heinz . There's nothing wrong with the beans or the pasta, but as the report says, those products are less labor-intensive. So when more people are choosing them, other companies lose business and some people lose their jobs. Employment at the less expensive end of the spectrum typically doesn't outweigh losses at the top end. To find out how much this self-imposed austerity cost the jobs market required some complicated calculations. Data gathered by the researchers included information scraped from Yelp as well as Census Bureau reports. For various categories of industry, such as the restaurant businesses highlighted above, researchers evaluated changes in market share and the resulting net impact on the labor force. The timespan examined by the study wasn't restricted to the 2007-2009 period that the economic research bureau classifies as a recession. Rather, it was extended through 2012 because \"average and median household income continued to fall until 2012.\" Even though the U.S. economy was technically growing, the effect of the crisis meant workers continued to get skinnier paychecks for years. It caused them to skimp on certain items. The team also calculated figures in multiple ways, which accounts for the wide range of its assessment: Between 22% and 36% of the jobs lost were because of consumer trade-down. \nData from the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows that the number of employed workers shrank by 5.1 million during the period the researchers analyzed. Combining the Fed data with the bureau's analysis implies that as many as 1.85 million jobs (36%) could have been retained if consumers hadn't altered their spending patterns.
