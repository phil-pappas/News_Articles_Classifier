Daniel Munoz by Sally Rose The government's plan to overhaul the rules that hand union representatives 50 per cent of board seats at most industry super funds is misguided and risks long-term member returns, warns IFM Investors chief executive Brett Himbury.\nDirect representation of members' interests at board level has driven the industry fund sector's superior approach to strategic asset allocation, which has in turn been responsible for the consistent outperformance of industry funds compared with their retail rivals over the past 15 years, he argued.\n\"The evidence is unequivocal that industry funds have historically and continue to deliver superior returns to members,\" Mr Himbury said.\n\"In part that is because the non-profit model has kept fees down, but another very large contributor to the outperformance of industry funds is their approach to asset allocation\".\nMr Himbury called on newly appointed Treasurer Scott Morrison and Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer to rethink slated changes mandating all super funds appoint a minimum of one-third independent directors, including an independent chair.\nCall to protect representation The legislation tabled in Parliament last week by former Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg follows a recommendation of last year's financial system inquiry, chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray.\nIt is now uncertain when the government's formal response to the inquiry will see the light of day after it was bumped by the Liberal leadership spill . Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has flagged that \"every policy\" could be up for review.\n \"It is my hope that the government will not be ideologically driven and that with more discussion the legislation to outlaw the equal representation model of industry fund boards can be scrapped or amended,\" Mr Himbury said.\nAt a minimum, he wants assurance that the remaining two-thirds of board positions not occupied by independents should be split between employer and employee representatives.\nDavid Hartley, the outgoing investment chief of Sunsuper, one of Australia's biggest union-aligned superannuation funds, broke ranks this week to back the controversial plan . Other high-profile identities from the non-profit super sector to publicly support the governance shake-up include former Australian Workers Union boss and AustralianSuper director turned KPMG consultant Paul Howes and Telstra Super chief executive Chris Davies .\nBy the numbers Analysis by superannuation sector research house Chant West shows that in the year ended June 30, 2015, industry funds outperformed retail funds with an average return of 10.2 per cent compared to 9.6 per cent. This is consistent with a trend that records industry funds consistently beating retail funds over the long term. Over the 15 years to June 2015 industry funds delivered on average an extra 1.1 per centa year.\nMr Himbury said a higher allocation to \"alternative assets\", such as the infrastructure funds, offered by his firm had been a major driver of the superior performance by industry funds.\n\"Alternatives\" is a catch-all term for non-traditional asset classes encapsulating infrastructure, property, private equity, and hedge funds. Compared to traditional assets – stocks, bonds and cash – alternative asset managers tend to charge higher fees.\n\"In a long-term investment like super it is absolutely vital portfolios have an adequate exposure to unlisted infrastructure and other alternatives,\" Mr Himbury said.\nChant West data shows that at December 31, 2014, the industry fund sub-sector had 21 per cent of funds allocated to alternatives, compared to 15 per cent across retail funds.\nHimbury's retail background IFM Investors is owned by 30 of the country's largest industry funds, but also attracts a significant chunk of its business from non-shareholder funds. The firm has nearly $60 billion in funds under management.\nMr Himbury has led IFM for the past five years, but he does not have a union background or come from the industry fund world. He was previously the managing director of Tyndall Investment Management and prior to that worked for Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Rothschild and Westpac Banking Corp.\nMr Himbury and his chairman, Gary Weaven, faced calls to stand down from the board of IFM earlier this year following their dramatic $685 million write-down of portfolio company Pacific Hydro . Mr Himbury and Mr Weaven subsequently resigned from the Pacific Hydro board and put the company up for sale. Both have since been re-elected to the board of IFM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:01:18.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
