Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan One of the biggest industry superannuation funds, Cbus, leaked confidential information to Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union to demonstrate its continued loyalty to the union, the trade union royal commission has been told.\nConstruction company Lis-Con said the Cbus claim that the leaking of personal information of Lis-Con employees was essentially the result of the actions of rogue employees was a \"three wise monkeys defence\" and \"offensively inadequate\".\nCbus has accepted that two former employees, Maria Butera and Lisa Zanatta, acted improperly by disclosing information to the militant construction union, but denied its chief executive, David Atkin, was involved in the leak.\nCounsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, has recommended the commission find \"on the balance of probabilities\" CFMEU NSW secretary Brian Parker told Mr Atkin in 2013 he wanted his assistance to obtain personal information about employees of Lis-Con, with whom the union was in conflict over unpaid superannuation.\nCbus chief executive David Atkin has denied being involved in leak to CFMEU Glenn Hunt In a submission to the commission, Lis-Con said Mr Atkin's denials of complicity in the disclosure by Ms Butera and Ms Zanatta to Mr Parker were not credible.\n\"No reason at all has been suggested why Ms Butera and Ms Zanatta would risk their careers, reputation and liberty by making the disclosure made to Mr Parker and then lying about it to the commission unless Mr Atkin was involved and their lies were to cover his complicity,\" the company says.\nThe commission has heard how the CFMEU reviewed its relationship with Cbus in 2012 and 2013 because the union was unhappy that the fund awarded a building contract to Grocon, which was brawling with the union.\nLis-Con says Cbus senior executives, including Mr Atkin, had a strong commercial motive in 2013 to keep the union happy.\n \"The purpose of the Cbus disclosure to Mr Parker and that of two other disclosures … was to demonstrate Cbus ' continued loyalty and 'responsiveness' to union concerns or, as in this case, the interests of senior union executives,\" it says.\nLis-Con says \"the best explanation available on all the evidence\" is that Mr Parker was informed that he would need the authority of Mr Atkin to pursue the personal contact information for Lis-Con employees.\nIt claims Mr Parker asked Mr Atkin for the information. \"Mr Atkin conveyed the substance of that request to Ms Butera and his authority to see that it was actioned and Ms Butera, to Mr Atkin's knowledge, tasked Ms Zanatta with carrying it out,\" the submission says.\nCbus claims a lack of evidence But Cbus urged the commission to reject the Lis-Con arguments, asserting they were not supported by the evidence.\n\"There are several attempts by the Lis-Con parties to attack Mr Atkin's credit, but, in each instance, either no basis is provided to justify the attack or the purported basis does not withstand scrutiny,\" Cbus says in its submission.\nIt says Mr Atkin took \"corporate responsibility\" once it became clear that the disclosure had been made by an employee of the fund.\nLis-Con told the commission that the overall response of Cbus could be compared with how Vodafone recently responded when it was revealed an employee accessed the phone records of a Fairfax journalist.\nIt Quote: d the NSW Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation, Victor – Dominello, saying Vodafone's response – that the incident was essentially the result of a rogue employee was the \"three wise monkeys defence\" and \"offensively inadequate\".\n\"The same may be said for Cbus ' response in this case,\" Lis-Con said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-28T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:57:07.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
