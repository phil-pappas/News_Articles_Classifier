Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Just before Christmas in 2006, this columnist was in David Jones buying a new toaster when Kim Beazley rang.\n\"Thanks mate,\" he said. \"I'm glad somebody noticed.\"\nHe was referring to the column published that day which noted that Kevin Rudd, who had recently toppled Beazley as Labor leader and ended any final chance he had of being prime minister, had actually not brought a single new idea to the opposition.\nYet his reception was messianic.\nAs Opposition Leader, it was the Bomber who had laid out the platform that was going to prove so lethal against an ageing Howard and his government.\nA price on carbon, a renewable energy target, a promise to sign the Kyoto Protocol, apologise to the stolen generations, rip up WorkChoices, an education revolution, a recognition of the burgeoning need for childcare and a promise of extra resources. All deemed forward thinking back then and made Howard look out of touch.\nYet, when Rudd took over and promoted the ideas as his own, it was like no one had even mentioned them before. Rudd and Julia Gillard moved on Beazley not because there was anything wrong with his ideas, but because they contended no one was listening to him, that he had become \"white noise\" and thus, could not beat Howard. This will never be known and remains contested to this day.\nWould have won Peter Costello said in 2009 that Beazley would have won the 2007 election because the issue was Howard's longevity, rather than any special attraction to Rudd.\nFast forward to today and all of a sudden Labor is feeling ripped off in much the same way as Beazley.\nThe enormous change in atmospherics associated with the demise of Tony Abbott and the ascension of Malcolm Turnbull has left Labor shouting in protest at the theft of ideas and themes.\nAs The Australian Financial Review's Laura Tingle noted last week, Turnbull's modus operandi is not so much a wholesale shift in policy direction but to steal the future from Labor.\nSince the last election, Labor leader Bill Shorten has accentuated the positive and the forward thinking, all as a stark contrast to the negativity and myopia of Abbott. Shorten has spoken of and flagged policies underscoring the importance of education, science and technology.\nIn his first big National Press Club address as leader he readily conceded Labor in government had been wrong to crack down on employee share schemes because of the detrimental impact it had had on innovation and start-ups. His budget-in-reply address in 2015 had at its centre a promise of 100,000 free university degrees for science, technology, engineering and maths students.\nAll this in contrast to a government that took the budget axe to science and education and, as the former prime minster admitted, would have cut off at the knees the renewable energy target and all the associated technological and job-creating benefits, if he had been able.\nUnderscored the change Enter Turnbull and his new team and it's all sunlit uplands. New Treasurer Scott Morrison, one of the fiercest attack men of the Abbott government, made two significant comments this week that underscored just how much things had changed.\nFirst, he accused Labor of being stuck in the past, which caused a collective spitting out of teeth nationwide, and second, in an interview with this newspaper, he admitted candidly that Abbott's pugilistic style had impeded good policy development.\n\"The key change in politics in the last two weeks is that we may well, and hopefully have, seen a shift from that combative phase into a more optimistic phase. The politics of optimism, I think, will more likely drive policy debate,\" he said.\n\"That is something Malcolm has sought to inject.\n\"To get a discussion around the types of things we've just been talking about, whether it's in tax or whether it's in productivity, competition, policy, trade or whatever, then you need to remove some of these shackles that the combative style of politics has placed on things.\"\nAttitude shaped how people participated in a debate and listened to the debate, he said.\nRipping off its theme Imitation might be a form of flattery but Labor released four pages of Quote: s made just in the past fortnight to buttress its claim Turnbull was ripping off its theme.\n\"Nothing matters more to Labor than securing the jobs of the future,\" Shorten said in his budget reply as he spruiked the importance of teaching science and technology.\nQuoth Turnbull a week ago: \"We need to make sure that we make the changes to promote innovation, promote science, promote technology to ensure that we deliver the jobs of the future.\"\nShorten gets the size of the challenge he faces now and he and Labor have held their nerve so far. He was smart on Monday night on the ABC's Q&A program to show good grace and embrace the change to Turnbull by cashing in on the majority sentiment that it was a good thing for the country that Abbott had gone.\nThe rebound in the polls thus far has been sharp but not spectacular. Polls have the two main parties either tied at 50 per cent each in the two-party preferred vote or the Coalition ahead by a smidgen, 51-49. We have a contest again, nothing more at this stage. The potential for trouble in the Coalition remains, with elements of the right still seething at the dumping of Abbott.\nLabor is steady but if it starts to fall behind and stay there, there will be \"trouble at mill\".\nNo longer does everything in politics have to be a zero-sum game.\nThe fact that, rhetorically at least, there is not a cigarette paper's difference between the Prime Minister and the alternative prime minister on where the world is heading is of enormous benefit to the rest of us â€“ insofar as we have two leaders who not only get it and where the challenges lie, but are eager to embrace it rather than fight it.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-25T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:15:04.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
