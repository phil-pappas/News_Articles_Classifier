( on.wsj.com/1NPb7Xr )\nFor Apple, a \"ship date\" doesn't necessarily mean the date that customers receive a new product; it can also mean the date that engineers sign off on the product's main features, the WSJ said.\nApple spent more than a year investigating the feasibility of an Apple-branded car, including meeting with two groups of government officials in California, according to the Journal.\nSources told Reuters in August that Apple was developing a car and studying self-driving technology, but it was unclear if the iPhone maker was designing a vehicle that could drive itself.\nApple was not immediately available for comment.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company doesn't currently plan to make its first electric vehicle fully autonomous, WSJ said on Monday.\nApple has been consistently hiring car experts as part of its effort to build a team in automated driving.\nApple has hired this year Megan McClain, a former Volkswagen AG engineer with expertise in automated driving, and Vinay Palakkode, a graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, a hub of automated driving research.\nApple also hired a senior engineer from electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc, according to a LinkedIn posting.\nApple's shares were up 1.3 percent at $114.98 on the Nasdaq.
