GOOGL, +0.65% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.08%\nThe executive saw her role expand at Yahoo following Mayer’s firing of Henrique de Castro in early 2014, at which point Savitt added oversight of the company’s media division, which included news and video.\n“We appreciate her contributions to Yahoo over the past three years and wish her well,” a Yahoo spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “We have strong leaders in both Yahoo’s media and marketing organization who will continue to drive the business forward.”\nMayer has reshuffled top executives frequently in her three years as CEO. In April, the former head of Yahoo’s home page, Mike Kerns, departed from the company and Simon Khalaf, an executive who joined when Yahoo acquired his startup, mobile-ad network Flurry, was promoted to senior vice president overseeing the home page and Tumblr. The company disclosed Friday that its chief accounting officer had departed , days before Yahoo revealed in a separate filing that it had dropped a request for a ruling on the tax-free status of its Alibaba spinoff after IRS pushback.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-marketing-chief-kathy-savitt-departs-for-studio-stx-entertainment-1441992087"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:51:38.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
