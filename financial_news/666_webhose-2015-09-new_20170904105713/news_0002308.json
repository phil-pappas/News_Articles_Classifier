The food business said that it had attracted 280,000 more customer transactions each week during the past six months compared to last year, which had helped its market share to grow to 5.1pc. \nThe food retailer, which launched a “pick your own offer promotion” in June, said that 700,000 customers had taken part in the scheme, which gives them 20pc discounts on 10 products of their choosing. \nWaitrose said that this approach had meant it had achieved sustainable sales growth rather than “joining the industry in across-the-board price cutting aimed at driving volume in the short term”. \nWaitrose also said that its click and collect orders had grown by 50pc. \nJohn Lewis said that it had outperformed the industry’s high street sales average with a 3pc like-for-like increase in sales and gross sales of £1.94bn. \nThe retailer said that its department store fashion sales were a “standout”, posting a 7.5pc increase while sales of its homewares were 4.9pc higher. The retailer, which has just modernised its home department in its Oxford Street flagship store at a cost of £14m, said that this was a “good performance against the impact of the general election and a late start to summer sales”. John Lewis’ home division was helped by a 33.5pc rise in sales of outdoor living goods, such as hammocks and barbecues. \nHowever, the retailer reported a 0.7pc slide in its electrical sales against the previous year after being hit by a lack of new product launches. John Lewis, which is facing stiff competition from beefed-up Dixons Carphone (Stuttgart: CWB.SG - news ) , said that it had secured the rights to sell Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) Watches in shops, which would give it “more momentum in technology sales for the second half”. \nThe group said that its online sales grew by 17.1pc to £647m, although this does not include returned items to shops. \n“This has been a solid first half for the Partnership in a difficult market. Both Waitrose and John Lewis are growing sales and increasing market share,” said Sir Charlie. \n“Conditions in the market will remain difficult, especially in grocery where there is little sign of any price inflation. However, I expect sales in both Waitrose and John Lewis to perform comparatively well against the market, helped by promising new ranges and online capability.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:11:04.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
