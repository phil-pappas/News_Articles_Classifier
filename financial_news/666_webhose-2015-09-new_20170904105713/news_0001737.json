Photo: Twitter @MartinShkreli\nCEO raises pill's price from $US18 to $US750 overnight Washington: It was a story about a crucial but normally dry issue that ignited outrage around the world.\nA former hedge fund manager, Martin Shkreli, founded a start-up company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, that bought the rights to a vital though decades-old drug, Daraprim, and jacked up the price by over 4000 per cent , risking lives of patients who could no longer afford the medication that kept them alive.\nBad move: Martin Shkreli will make Daraprim \"more affordable\" after raising the price. Photo: Bloomberg\nDespite Shkreli agreeing to lower the price of the drug after the backlash, the New York Times ' revelation of his behaviour this week focused attention on what is arguably a larger scandal – the success pharmaceutical companies have had in boosting the price of drugs in the United States.\nAdvertisement Big Pharma's most extraordinary win came in 2003, when Congress passed a law that at once expanded government health insurance for the elderly, known as Medicare, to include prescription drugs.\nThe law also – and this is not a joke – banned the government from negotiating the prices they would pay the drug companies.\nThat is, once a drug had been approved for coverage, the government was forced to pay whatever the companies demanded.\nThis bewildering concession – normally referred to as simply \"Medicare Part D\" – was made after a colossal lobbying effort under the Bush administration in 2003.\nThe pharmaceutical industry spent a staggering $US2.6 billion on lobbying activities between 1998 and 2012, according to OpenSecrets.org.\nThat is four times as much as the defence and aerospace industries spend and almost twice the lobbying outlay of oil and gas companies.\nAccording to the Centre for Public Integrity, the pharmaceutical industry employs two lobbyists for each member of Congress and spends $US100 million a year to keep many of those members of Congress on its side.\nMedicare Part D was eventually passed after an ugly late-night battle on Capitol Hill.\nThe vote was held at 3am, but after 15 minutes normally allowed for ballots to be cast, the legislation had failed, so Republican leadership kept the ballot open almost three hours while they twisted arms and offered inducements.\n\"The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill,\" one disgusted Republican congressman, Walter Jones, told CBS in 2007.\n\"The bill was over 1000 pages. And it got to the members of the House that morning, and we voted for it at about 3 in the morning.\"\nThe then House Majority Leader, Tom Delay, would later be reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee, which was dominated by his Republican colleagues.\nAs a result drug prices in the United States are the most expensive in the world.\nThe issue has now become a focus of the presidential campaign, at least on the Democratic side, and the industry is taking notice.\nHillary Clinton sent the stock price for drug companies plummeting on Monday when she reacted to news of Turing's hikes with a furious tweet, promising to introduce a plan to control drug prices.\nPrice gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2015 She announced details on Tuesday, vowing to stop \"excessive profiteering\" by imposing a $US250 monthly cap on prescription drugs. Biotech share prices sank as a result.\nBernie Sanders, who is challenging Mrs Clinton from the left for the nomination, had already announced a similar plan, but in the wake of the Turing news he has added to it.\n\"The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people,\" he thundered on Tuesday afternoon.\nHe would require generic drug companies to rebate money to the government if their prices go up higher than inflation.\nLike the Sanders legislation, Mrs Clinton's plan would allow the government to negotiate better prices for the drugs it buys and forbid brand-name companies from paying to keep low-cost competitors off the market.\nIn addition, Mrs Clinton would allow Americans to buy prescription drugs abroad, most often in Canada, where prices are far lower.\nThe case of Turing Pharmaceuticals and Daraprim​ is hardly unique. Congress is investigating Valeant Pharmaceuticals after the price for one of their drugs, Isuprel​, went from $US215 per vial to $US1346 per vial.\nHow energetically that investigation will be prosecuted is anyone's guess.\nSoon after buying the pain pill Vimovo​ from AstraZeneca​, Horizon Pharma​ bumped the price up by almost 600 per cent.\nFor the CEO of Turing, this is nothing new. When Martin Shkreli​ served as chief executive with another drug company, Retrophin​, he increased the price of Thiola, a drug used to treat a disease that causes kidney stones, from $US135 a month to $US2700 a month.\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h", "http://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/645974772275408896", "http://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:47:35.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
