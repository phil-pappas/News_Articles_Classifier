Advertising Print This Post \nFidessa group plc (LSE: FDSA) has released its Sentinel Trading Compliance (STC) system, a utility that helps asset managers better aggregate, monitor, and manage their trading operations and risk, according to a Fidessa statement. \nIn an attempt to help manage associated risk and compliance with trading operations, Fidessa’s STC system was designed to capture and monitor large swaths of transaction-related data in a streamlined workflow. Moreover, the STC system caters to asset managers who are aiming to consolidate a cascade of tasks such as risk monitoring, trading operations control, and systems integration. \nThe STC system is also compatible with Fidessa’s existing Sentinel Portfolio Compliance system – the fundamental difference with the STC system is the improved emphasis on risk management controls its current portfolio systems suite cannot singularly achieve. \nAccording to Richard Hooke, Buy-side Product Director at Fidessa, in a recent statement on the release, “Having been developed closely in partnership with a client, Sentinel Trading Compliance sets a new, high standard for compliance risk systems in the buy-side trading space. The scalable nature of our solutions also means that it is available to any asset manager, regardless of size. In the current complex and evolving regulatory environment, it is something that no asset manager can risk being without.” \n“Monitoring and controlling trading activity has traditionally been handled by the OMS, but for many large asset managers this approach has become fragmented, difficult to control and insufficient. Working closely alongside a global, tier-one asset management client, we are delivering a single system to centralize control that has robust capabilities to oversee, analyze and impose restrictions on trading practices – something that has not previously been feasible,” added Hooke. \nLast month, Fidessa appointed Andy Skelton as its newest Chief Financial Officer (CFO) , whose move will become effective only on October 26, 2015. Mr. Skelton will be replacing Andy Malpass, Fidessa’s acting CFO who previously announced that he will be relinquishing his post on the aforementioned date, paving the way for a succession.
