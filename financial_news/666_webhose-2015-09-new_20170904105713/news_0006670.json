Jesse Marlow by Rachel Nickless Kate Jenkins had an epiphany this year while running a review of sex discrimination, sexual harassment and predatory behaviour within Victoria Police.\nVictoria's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity commissioner says what's struck her so far is how many people were willing to talk in confidence to her and her team about bad experiences they'd had at work, which they'd never talked about before.\nThey had failed to speak up before because they saw complaining as a \"career killer\", or out of a sense of loyalty, she tells The Australian Financial Review .\n\"The focus on getting individuals to raise complaints is flawed,\" she says. \"In practice what most people learn over time is you do it [bring a complaint ] at great personal toll. Either you end up with quite traumatised people, or you end up with no complaints at all,\" she says.\nAhmed Fahour, chief executive of Australia Post, credits Kate Jenkins with helping to drive change in his workforce of 36,000 people to make it more female-friendly. Luis Enrique Ascui The law's a poor weapon Before she took the reigns at the Commission two years ago, Jenkins had been a partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. She'd spent some two decades preaching to employers about getting anti-discrimination policies, training their staff and weeding out any \"bad apples\" who broke the law.\n\"What I've learned is not that the advice I've been giving is wrong, but it's about legal protection rather than actually a pathway to equality,\" she says.\nJenkins, named one of The Australian Financial Review Westpac Women of Influence 2015 , now thinks that a broader approach, like that taken in public health campaigns against smoking, is more effective. That involves getting the wider community and the media talking about equality and understanding why it matters.\n She is realistic about what she and her Commission, charged with fighting various forms of discrimination including race, sex and disability discrimination, are up against. In the sex discrimination space alone, \"we still have a gender pay gap of 17.9 per cent, we've still got a real lack of women in leadership positions, we've still got women retiring with half the retirement savings of men and two women a week are dying at the hands of their intimate partners,\" she says.\nBut much has changed under her leadership. The Commission is busier than ever. In 2012/13, it dealt with 10,557 issues raised by Victorians. In the most recent financial year, it dealt with 13,877 issues, while visits to the Commission's website were 51 per cent up on the year before. And Jenkins aims to be hired to do more wide-ranging reviews of systemic problems, such as the one the Commission is currently being paid to do for Victoria Police.\nGetting the establishment to rattle the cage In April, Jenkins also announced she'd recruited a group of high-profile \"Male Champions of Change\" to tackle gender inequality. She got the idea from her mentor, Australia's former sex discrimination Commissioner Liz Broderick .\nOne of these champions, Ahmed Fahour, chief executive of Australia Post credits Jenkins with helping to drive change in his workforce. After meeting with groups of staff to discuss gender issues, Fahour has now introduced case workers to help women transition back to work from maternity leave. And he says he'll be announcing broader changes in October, when Australia Post launches a gender action plan.\nVictoria's male champions include other corporate heavyweights with huge workforces, like Andrew Thorburn, chief executive of National Australia Bank, and Luke Sayers, chief executive of PwC Australia, but Jenkins was conscious to also recruit those with cultural clout, such as AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan and Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne. The men have begun generating some media attention, such as when another male champion, president of the Supreme Court of Appeal Chris Maxwell, announced he was boycotting elite male-only clubs .\nFahour says Jenkins has \"achieved a tremendous amount in a short space of time\" by combining a lawyer's aptitude for strong processes and strategy with a \"very supportive, thoughtful\" manner.\n\"She created the environment for us to talk, put ideas out there and for us to make the changes happen. It takes a talent to do that,\" he says.", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/melbournes-elite-gentlemens-clubs-must-dispense-with-discrimination-and-join-21st-century/story-fni0fhh1-1227456230256", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/womenofinfluence_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:05:23.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
