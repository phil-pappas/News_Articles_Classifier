While depositors want more attractive interest rates, banks seek regulatory exemption in the form of reserves benefits and the government is unwilling to relax any ‘know your customer’ norms and may even ask investors to reveal the source of the bullion. Unless these issues are addressed practically, the monetisation scheme risks being a damp squib, like the one in 1999 that generated only about 15-20 tonnes in all these years, analysts feel.\nResponding to a query on whether the source of bullion would have to be mentioned under the monetisation scheme, economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday: “All requirements under the I-T Act have to be complied with. The government doesn’t want the unaccounted-for black money (in the form of gold) to be converted into white money through the scheme.”\nMoreover, while banks want the facility to pledge more gold and less cash with the Reserve Bank of India against their reserve requirements so that they can use the excess cash to lend at attractive interest rates, the government said it was still in discussion with the central bank on this issue. So, analysts said, a lot will rest on the fine print of the policy when it is notified for its success.\nHowever, to make the monetisation scheme attractive to households, the government has allowed an individual to deposit gold even in tiny quantities of 30 grams each in a bank, compared with the minimum deposits of 500 grams under the old scheme. The interest earned on the gold deposits will be exempt from income, wealth and capital gains taxes. The interest will also be valued in gold, and the customer will have the option of redemption either in cash or in gold, which will have to be exercised at the time of making the deposit.\nWhile the government said the revenue department will consider making capital gains on gold bonds tax-free from the next fiscal by amending the existing provisions of the Income Tax Act, sources said such a benefit would most likely be granted. Indexation benefits to long-term capital gains arising out of transfer of bond could also be provided from 2016-17.\nAlthough the government desisted from forecasting the amount of gold it can generate through the bond scheme on Wednesday, the draft note on the scheme — circulated earlier for stakeholders’ comment — had targeted investments to the tune of 50 tonnes, worth around Rs 13,500 crore, in the first year of introduction.\nUnder the new scheme, the tenure of the gold deposit will be a minimum of one year and with a roll-out in multiples of one year. Like a fixed deposit, breaking of the lock-in period will also be allowed, albeit with a penalty. India, the world’s second-largest bullion consumer, imports as much as 800-1,000 tonnes of the precious metal each year. Authorities hardened a crackdown on gold imports, especially in 2013-14, after the current account deficit had hit a whopping 4.7% of GDP in 2012-13.\nWelcoming the move, World Gold Council managing director (India) Somasundaram PR said: “The question is no longer whether the scheme will work, but how to make it attractive for customers.” He added that the scheme should be given more time to stabilise and evolve under the new framework so that it can be a success. In an earlier interview to FE, he had said the government must not expect too much in the initial years and instead focus more on strengthening the processes.\nAs far as the sovereign bond is concerned, its will be issued with a nominal interest rate, which will be linked to the international rate of gold for borrowing. The bond will be issued on payment of money and would be linked to the price of gold. Upon maturity, the investor would get the equivalent of the face value of gold in rupee terms.\nThe bond would be usually in denominations of 5, 10, 50 and 100 grams, although it can be in other denominations as well. The investment could be for a minimum period of 5-7 years “to protect investors from medium-term volatility in gold prices”. The bonds would be issued by the central bank on behalf of the government, and they could be marketed through post offices and by various brokers or agents who may need to be paid a commission (like for Kisan Vikas Patra).\nThe risk of gold price change will be borne by the gold reserve fund to be created by the government. The benefit to the government will be in terms of a reduction in the cost of borrowing (the interest outgo on gold will be far lower than those on other G-secs), which will be transferred to the reserve fund.\nFirst Published on September 10, 2015 1:38 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:44:18.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
