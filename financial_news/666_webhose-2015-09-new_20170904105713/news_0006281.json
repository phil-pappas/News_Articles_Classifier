They then work towards success, doing the best they can to ensure that they accomplish something on a daily basis. They create an action plan and stick with it. Should there be a need for them to adjust their plans, they make sure that their end-goal isn’t affected. \nOn the other hand, those who find it hard to change their lives for the best don’t just have a simple case of laziness.
