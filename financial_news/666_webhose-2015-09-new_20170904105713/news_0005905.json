On Monday, he said that the Labour leadership election showed that “new policies and Jeremy’s have been roundly endorsed”. \nSuch a move would reverse what is considered one of the biggest achievements of Tony Blair’s first term in office. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was under his Labour government that Gordon Brown and Ed Balls engineered the independence of the Bank. \nToby Nangle, head of asset allocation, EMEA at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said: “Bank independence was associated with a sharp decline in inflation expectations, reducing the cost of borrowing for households and companies as well as boosting asset prices.” \nSince 1997 monetary policy has been set not by politicians or the Treasury, but by a nine-strong team known as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) ), a move welcomed by the financial markets. \nThe difference between the yields on US and UK government bonds with a 10-year duration stood at around 1.8 percentage points before the Bank became independent. In 1997, this spread fell sharply, and has averaged just 0.13 percentage points since. \n“If this operational independence were revoked I would expect an inflation risk premia to return to the UK and some combination of a weaker and more volatile currency, lower asset prices and higher borrowing costs to prevail,” Mr Nangle said. \n• Is central bank independence really such a brilliant concept? \n• Corbyn has just appointed a man from cloud cuckoo land as shadow Chancellor \nMartin Weale, a member of the MPC, has previously said that the central bank’s independence is “a cornerstone of credible policy making, which ensures that the public have faith that it is free of political interference”. \nJonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said that a move to reverse the Bank’s independence “would go very strongly against the prevailing thinking”. \n“There is a general perception that independent monetary policy has been a success, and that the policy cycle has decoupled from the political cycle,” he said. \nPrior to the establishment of the MPC, politicians were frequently accused of “electioneering”, setting interest rates in order to shore up support among voters, rather than to ensure the health of the economy. \n“One would have to fear that policy would lose credibility, once again becoming the preserve of politicians who would set it for their own political purposes,” Mr Loynes said. \nHe added that Bank independence had brought about “tangible benefits, in terms of lowering inflation expectations and interest rates, the latter of which has saved the government and the taxpayer money”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:35:14.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
