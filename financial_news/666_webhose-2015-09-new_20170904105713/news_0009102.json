Louise Kennerley \"We're going to see prices start to settle,\" Ms Phillips said.\nThe relative affordability of Melbourne, where the median house price was $620,000 - almost two-thirds that of Sydney's median $900,000 price - was likely to draw investors who were finding themselves priced out of the NSW capital, she said.\n\"If you want something below $600,000 you've really got to go out to Blacktown or beyond, whereas you can still buy in the eastern and outer suburbs in Melbourne,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\"It's looking good value for money at the moment. If you're getting priced out of Sydney, particularly for investors, Melbourne looks equally as attractive.\"\nValuer Propell says: If you're getting priced out of Sydney, particularly for investors, Melbourne looks equally as attractive.\" But while both houses and apartments in Sydney are likely to grow 5 per cent over the next 12 months, the oversupply that already means 20 per cent of Melbourne CBD properties are selling at a loss was likely to weigh on unit prices in Melbourne.\nTwo-speed Melbourne Apartments in the Victorian capital are likely to rise just 2 per cent over the the year to come, less than the 2.9 per cent gain they have made over the past year, Propell says.\nFurther, Melbourne residential real estate is likely to see a geographical split over the coming year, with the gap in price growth between east/southeast and west/northwestern suburbs widening, Ms Phillips said.\nIn Melbourne, the predicted 5 per cent growth is also a slowdown, but less of a fall given that city's more-modest 11.5 per cent increase in house prices over the past year. That gap already exists. Over the past 12 months, for example, the median dwelling price in Melton-Wyndham on the western side of Port Phillip Bay rose just 0.5 per cent to $373,000, while in Greater Dandenong City, southeast of Melbourne, the median price jumped 10 per cent to $496,000, the Propell figures show.\nThe southeast was currently benefiting from rising prices in the city's eastern suburbs that were pushing up prices in neighbouring suburbs, Ms Phillips said.\n\"We're seeing interest in Dandenong and Frankston,\" she said. \"There will come appoint where people start turning their attention west and north, but it's not there yet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:49:32.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
