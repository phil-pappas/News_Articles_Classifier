The Guardian Score for technology, which measures a combination of price and volatility trends to gauge the market's direction, has been moving lower for two years, and the market turbulence in August and September accelerated the deterioration of its technical factors. \nSpecifically, the short-term moving average price trend for technology fell below its long-term average on Aug. 31, and its volatility levels surpassed long-term averages by the market close this Monday, triggering the negative alert. Sector stalwarts like Alphabet ( GOOGL - Get Report ) (Google) and Facebook ( FB - Get Report ) have been the best technology performers this year, but they've received no help from a flat Apple ( AAPL - Get Report ) stock and could not overcome the weight of sector laggards Qualcomm ( QCOM - Get Report ) , Oracle ( ORCL - Get Report ) and Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) . \nSource: Reality Shares Research \nMust Read: Ackman Wonâ€™t Follow Peltz Into GE -- 3 Other Trian Investments He Could Consider \nThis is only the third time in the last 15 years when Guardian would have triggered a negative warning, with the most recent negative period beginning just before the financial crisis, on Jan. 10, 2008, and lasting through July 14, 2009, when the S&P 500 fell 33.78%. Before that, Guardian would have been negative for the tech crash, beginning Sept. 15, 1999 and remained bearish for all but three trading days until May 22, 2003, which would have avoided a decline of 20.87% in the S&P 500. (Guardian was introduced this past August, but its methodology has been applied to past periods to help investors make historical comparisons.) 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:27:11.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
