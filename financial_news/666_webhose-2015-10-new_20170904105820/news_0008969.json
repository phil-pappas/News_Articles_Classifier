The V10 is a one of a kind smartphone that comes with a secondary display. While the YotaPhone features a secondary e-ink display at the back, this particular device will feature a mini screen on top of the display, just besides the front camera. It’s basically a screen which can show a variety of information in brief like weather, notifications, battery status etc. What’s interesting is that this secondary display will be always on. \nThe LG V10 takes its basic design from the flagship G4. However, the similarity ends there. The phone is targeted at the ultra-premium market with a stainless steel durable body that looks pretty good. There will be a massive 5.7-inch display up front, with 2K resolution. The secondary display on top will be of 2.1-inches and will come with 160 x 1040 pixel resolution. Along with the ability to display notifications and other details, the secondary screen can also display shortcuts for apps when the phone is in use. \nAlthough the secondary screen is unique by itself, the company is really marketing the imaging experience of the new LG V10. The phone will come with a powerful front facing camera ideal for selfies and groufies. Yes, that’s one of the phone’s marketed features. Up front, there will be dual 5MP cameras, each one taking shots from different points of view and combining them into one picture. This should definitely attract a lot of selfie lovers. At the back, there will be a powerful 16MP sensor as well. \nThe smartphone is really capable when it comes to video shooting. In fact, LG claims that the V10 is the first smartphone to feature manual mode while shooting videos. The phone allows the user to edit a number of factors such as shutter speed, frame rate, ISO, white balance and focus while recording to create the perfect video. They can choose between three resolutions, HD, FHD, UHD and in two aspect ratios, 16:9 and 21:9. \n“The LG V10 was designed from the ground up primarily as a multimedia smartphone for the sharing ecosystem,” LG Electronics Mobile CEO Juno Cho said in a statement. “We heard from many customers that until the G4, they weren’t comfortable going on vacation or outings without a separate camera. With the V10, we hope to do for video what the G4 did for photographs. \nAs for the other specs, the LG V10 will come with Snapdragon 808 hexa-core chip underneath with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, expandable up to 2TB via MicroSD, removable 3000mAh battery and Android 5.1.1 Lollipop OS. \nThe first LG V10 smartphones will go on sale in Korea for $680 later this month, followed by US, China and other regions.
