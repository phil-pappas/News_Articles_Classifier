It was a Friday night at the end of September. We had met after sunset in the bright bustle of Stockholm central station, made a pit stop at a grocery, and driven further and further away from civilization along increasingly empty, unlit and unpaved roads, until we finally stepped out of her taupe-colored Fiat at the end of a gravel street, 45 minutes and five islands away from Stockholm. To our right, dimly lit by a sliver of moon and its own lamps, was a house on the water. In front of us, down a slope from where we stood, were a few docks and boats, including a rowboat that would carry us across the gently rippled surface of the water to our destination.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7033\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] Ideas Island when I arrived that first Friday night (Laura Shin)[/caption] It wasn't really my island, but it would be for a week — a week that represented a dream a year and a half in the making. In the spring of 2014, I had heard via [entity display=\"Facebook\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"facebook\" ticker=\"FB\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/15317\"]Facebook[/entity] about Ideas Island , a place where Swedish creativity speaker and author Fredrik Haren lets people stay on his island for free as long as they work on ideas (and make a $1,000 donation to a charity of his choice). I immediately knew that I wanted to write about the place. I had long had obsessions with both ideas and small islands: in college, a friend and personality tests had labeled me an ideas person, and at one point, I realized that when I traveled to foreign countries, I usually sought out their tiny islands, whether Indonesia’s Gili, Ireland's Aran or Italy's Aeolian islands. I’d even had an idea to write a book about living on small islands around the world for a year. Plus, in recent years, I had been fashioning my own writer’s retreats, holing up in a friend’s cabin or renting a room in rural Tuscany. A month after hearing about the island, even though I had not contacted them, I was surprised to find that I was one of only five people that Ideas Island was following on [entity display=\"Twitter\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"twitter\" ticker=\"TWTR\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102047\"]Twitter[/entity]. After Haren’s assistant reached out to me, I knew I had an invitation — it was just a matter of when I could go.\nI finally managed to squeeze in a trip for the final week of September 2015 — the last slot for the season. After securing the date, Haren’s assistant sent me a PowerPoint that can best be described as homemade. It was a pastiche of maps of the subway, bus routes (a bus swings by only twice a day) and nearby grocery; and photos of the code for the padlock to the boat, the boat itself, how to dock it, the hiding place for the keys and other items. Most of it was pasted over with red arrows and comments. Using this treasure map of sorts, I was expected to get from central Stockholm to the island using the subway, buses and boat, not only carrying my suitcase, but also while picking up a week’s worth of groceries. It was Ideas Island: DIY Edition. My greatest fear was losing my suitcase, computer, or week’s supply of food into the water’s depths.\nBut I didn’t end up arriving on the island alone. The guests scheduled before me canceled and it rained that week, so Sofia Myrenberg, a Stockholm-based TV executive who also assists Haren, decided to take me out there herself since the boat would be full of water. Then, although guests usually swap in and out of the house on Saturdays, my Friday night Airbnb host in Stockholm backed out on short notice so I was suddenly in need of lodging. We decided we would make our trip Friday night. I was glad that I wouldn’t be struggling alone with my suitcase and groceries.\nThat night, finding that, indeed, the boat had become a small wading pool, Sofia enlisted the help of the neighbor, Halvard, who had a huge white bucket. With Sofia wearing her galoshes in the boat, they dumped the water, bucketful by bucketful, out of the boat in eight minutes flat. (Later, when I had to empty the boat of much less water, it took me a half hour with a small bucket.) After Sofia helped me brush up my rowing skills, I rowed us the rest of the way over, which, according to the PowerPoint, is “200 meters” or about 650 feet. It was a bit awkward since the boat had one long oar and one short oar, but I made it. Once we got inside, she set up the heat and water — the tap water is not potable so she gave me jugs of freshwater — and showed me the basics of the house. It had looked so sun-filled and welcoming in photos, but now seemed cold and scary with our reflections staring back at us from the windows which revealed nothing from the dark night beyond. Though the main areas were fairly spacious, each of the three sardine-can-like bedrooms was just big enough to fit a twin bed, with one containing a bunk bed. But a sign over the kitchen counter such as those used for birthday parties said HAPPY PLACE, and guests had decorated some parts of the house with their own drawings. Once I was set up for the week, I brought her back over to the other side. Then, I got in the boat by myself. I began to row back, the wind propelling me in the same direction. Every stroke pumped elation up from deep inside me. Finally, I was going to experience my dream of spending a week on Ideas Island. I was practically flying toward it.\nSofia shouted at me across the water. “Are you okay?”\n“Yes!” I shouted. “Doing great!” As I approached the dock, I thought I might miss it, but, using both oars to spin the boat sharply at the last second, I glided right in.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7034\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Me rowing to the island Friday night; hanging in the hammock; happy on Ideas Island (Sofia Myrenberg, left and top right; Laura Shin bottom right)[/caption] The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market Don’t let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good. Performance Pressure\nThe first few days on the island were marred by the pressure I felt to make the most of my experience, not only because I had been dreaming about it for so long, but also because I wanted to tell a good story for this article. It didn’t help matters when, each of the first few days, I let precious hours slip away on what I felt were unimportant activities. On Saturday, my first full day, I needed to cook the salmon because I intended to eat all the fresh foods within the first few days, leaving the frozen ones for the second part of the week. But Swedish ovens are not like American ones, mostly because they are in Celsius and Swedish. In the end, it took me an hour and 45 minutes just to make, eat and clean up my underdone salmon lunch (at home, I broil salmon for four minutes). In the process, I discovered that [entity display=\"Google\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"google\" ticker=\"GOOGL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1821\"]Google[/entity] Translate also could not decipher the words on the oven and I wondered how long it would take people to figure out I had died on my first day on Ideas Island from eating nearly raw salmon.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7036\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Left, a bedroom; top right, the main area; bottom right, the sun room (Laura Shin)[/caption] I also knew I would be embarrassed to admit in this story that I slept like a newborn the first three days — and being unconscious for 12 or 13 hours a day limits productivity. For instance, that Monday, I didn’t get out of bed until 10:30, did yoga until about 12, and after showering, eating breakfast, watching the swans eat (more on them later) and doing physical therapy exercises for my wrists, I took a 20-minute nap. By then, it was almost 3pm. In my defense, I had not slept enough for most of the summer and had just spent several days with a few friends in Copenhagen, ambitiously touring the city’s museums, shops and restaurants. Aside from sleeping a lot, I also spent the first few days doing yoga, reading old magazines, and avoiding the one last real assignment I had. Thankfully, I had already declared I was going off social media for a week, or I might have wasted time scrolling through Facebook as well.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7074\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Top, the house on Vifarnaholme; Bottom, the view toward the north (Laura Shin)[/caption] But the sleep resulted in a dream that I felt had an important real-life message for me and one New Yorker article captured me so that I read it twice and it led it to the first idea I had on the island — to learn ukulele. This seems random, but it felt significant. On my mother’s side, I come from a family of musicians and though I played music with people when I was younger and felt that making music with others could be a transcendent experience, I had not played music seriously for more than 20 years. I settled upon the ukulele because it was portable, and I, and others, could sing along with it. Plus, I was about to become an aunt, and I thought I could play this instrument for the baby. This idea set the tone — pardon the pun — for the later ones I had on the island.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7070\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Left, the northern side of Ideas Island; top right, sunrise; bottom left, the dock (Laura Shin)[/caption] Later, I realized that some moments I considered unproductive were actually more beneficial than any obvious work I might be doing. The first full day started off windy, overcast and cold. (For most of the week, the highs were in the low 60s.) After yoga and my lunch ordeal, out in the hammock, I braved the wind and wrote in my journal: “My mind is feeling slow and empty, and I already wish I had been more productive.” I had, however, explored the island, which did not take long. There was a U-shaped dock out front with tables on each side (both covered in spiderwebs), a large rock for sitting and taking in the sunset to the far right and a tiny beach next to that. The back, north-facing side of the island looked out on an expanse of water, in the middle of which sat a tiny jewel of a rock- and tree-forged island that I spent the next week looking at longingly from the kitchen window. Larger, green islands lay beyond. The occasional boat floated by. That morning, I carefully stepped over moss-covered rocks, long grasses, prickly bushes and the occasional log as I made my way toward the back. That’s why I didn’t notice until I was close to the water that a group of swans was feeding there — two white and seven gray ones. I watched them extend their necks down into the water to feed on the plants below and heard, for the first time, the low grunting/honking sound that they make, to which I would become accustomed over the next week. When I got back in the house, I googled “gray swans,” and learned that the seven gray ones, although they were the same size as the white, were likely baby swans, or cygnets. (I later found confirmation of this when I saw that a previous guest had drawn two adult swans with seven fuzzy babies swimming between them.)\n[caption id=\"attachment_7075\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"] Top, the family of swans; Bottom, a previous guest's drawing of the swans (Laura Shin)[/caption] It was just the beginning of many Internet searches about swans — and of general observations about nature. The journal entry I made in the hammock ended with what is not typical diary fodder for me: what a strange thing wind is, because it is a physical thing but not in the way that most objects are, and how, despite its evanescent nature, it could be much stronger. Later that afternoon, when the sun came out, after clearing the spiderwebs off the table and chairs, I sat out on the lefthand side of the deck and watched the long grasses on the island and in the water bend with the wind. Dragonflies zigzagged through the air. Something under the dock moving with the water made a glug-glug sound. The waves rolled toward me. The sun felt warm on my forehead and cheek. The work-till-midnight-start-again-at-6am weekdays I clocked last spring and my time-zone-shifting summer during which I managed to produce the biggest story of my life thus far felt far away.\nI took in the sunset from the big rock. Ripples of shimmery pink, purple, gray and slate streaked the sky. One duck stood in the water in front of the beach. A motorcycle zipped by on the larger island. Far away, a car rumbled. Opposite the sunset a budding crescent of moon rose. In the water next to me, bubbles emanated from one spot, evidence of an underwater battle or play, suddenly punctuated by two streaks that darted away from each other. One large purple cushion of cloud bore an underbelly of pink gold. Rolling curlicues turned shades of blue, gray and pink, like varieties of snow. Further in the distance, cumulus clumps took on the appearance of rocks in a stream of rushing water. By 2:30pm the next day, when I returned to the dock to write in my journal, the spiders had already re-created their webs.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7040\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] The sunset the first night (Laura Shin)[/caption] The Island’s Ideas\nBy the end of my third full day, Monday, I had written only one story, and it wasn’t part of my designated island project. It was an article due that week that I hadn’t finished before arriving. On the fourth day, I finally wrote the first part of my intended task, but completing it was such a struggle that I began to question whether or not I wanted to do it at all. By Wednesday, after finding myself doing Internet “errands” that I could easily accomplish when I was in a less special place, I decided to turn off the Internet unless I absolutely needed it, but I didn’t actually follow through until Thursday. Wednesday was also the day I realized that putting pressure on myself to get a lot done on Ideas Island was defeating the purpose. One of my friends likes to adopt a hokey farmer voice and sing to me, “you gotta rest your brain, you gotta rest your brain,” and I decided to write if it came to me but not to force it and instead go with where my mind took me.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7053\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] Sunrise on Ideas Island (Laura Shin)[/caption] In the way that I observed how the wind and currents changed, I found that my mind kept drifting toward my career. Surprisingly, I realized the plan I had been mentally keeping for the past year may not be what I actually want to do. I began to consider other possibilities. I also thought about my life and work/life balance, in particular how to improve my health, which has suffered from overwork. I had been wanting to try rock climbing for months, but this time I decided I would do it when I got back. I had an idea to take a coding course related to my reporting and signed up. Because I felt so rested from following my natural sleep schedule, I decided to buy the amber-tinted glasses that paleo aficionados wear after sunset in order to filter out the blue spectrum waves from artificial light that keep us awake longer than we would naturally stay up. By the end of the week, I had thought about taking back up some of my old loves, including dance and Italian classes.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7072\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] Ideas Island sunroom (Laura Shin)[/caption] Finally, on Thursday, I kept the Internet off most of the day. While sitting in the sun room watching the rain, I wrote pages in my journal mulling over some of the career questions I was facing and then examined some of my unhealthy habits — namely, my Internet addiction, which caused me to neglect important areas of my life. “There’s something to be learned about how better to approach my work based on what I’ve learned here,” I wrote, adding that starting the day with yoga, turning off the Internet from 9pm to 9pm and checking email at a few specified times throughout the day would be a good start. I also realized I needed more nature in my life, and thought about ways to integrate it. Throughout my journal entry, I paused to make observations about the clouds, the waves, the color of the water, the direction of the wind and its howling.\nThat night, after watching the sunset, I went back in to make dinner and several minutes later, after passing by the sunroom, I realized that a dark, gradual rainbow filled the Western sky. Twilight. I ran back outside to watch the colors deepen from the big rock. Two ducks stood still in the gloaming. Bats flew overhead. After soaking in the subtle but awesome colors, I turned back to the house. On the opposite side of the sky, the nearly full moon hung low — glow-y and ripe. In two nights would be the blood super moon. A streak of water glittered below.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7062\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] (Laura Shin)[/caption] That night, I wrote, “Today was probably the first day I really felt like I got into the groove of the island. Obviously, I wrote in my journal a lot, but also I kept the Internet off most of the day and read without guilt or wondering if I should be more productive.” Once the sun set, I kept all artificial lights off and just let my eyes adjust to the dark. The nighttime version of the house was no longer scary. I had a mini dance party, which had been on my list of things to do ever since arriving on the island. With my eyes mostly closed, I let the music move my body. Outside, the moon shimmered on the water and bats flitted about. Inside, I swayed, jumped and spun. It was bliss.\nThe Journey\nOn Friday, I was ready for a new adventure. That afternoon, I decided to take a row. Because it had been raining on Wednesday and Thursday, I spent half an hour emptying the boat using the tiny buckets that were available. Due to the wind, I didn’t want to go too far afield and face a hard row back. So at first, I decided just to circle the island. But after I turned the last corner, planning to pull back into the south-facing dock, I noticed that the swan family was swimming away from that corner of the island. They must have been feeding moments before. I decided, that instead of disrupting their meal, I would row out to the tiny island I had been admiring from the window.\nI made a U-turn and set out upon the open water, where the waves were much choppier. Because I was rowing backward, I kept having to turn around to make sure I was aiming the boat correctly. Even though I was moving with the wind, I kept drifting off course. Was it because of my mismatched oars? Instead of rowing as the crow flies, I was taking a skier’s path toward the island. I contemplated turning back. Finally, 20 minutes later, I was near enough to take a few shots. In the time it took me to do so, the boat drifted off course so much that I would now have to circle the island from the west rather than from the east.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7042\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] The small island north of Vifarnaholme (Laura Shin)[/caption] As I had gleaned from the kitchen window, the island was a sparse and primeval amalgam of stone and tree. It was small and alone in the expanse of water, but solid and radiant. It looked like the perfect place for a picnic as long as I had galoshes and, well, food. After a few photos, it was time to row back. This time, I would be going against the wind. Surprisingly, it was much easier to stay on course. I accomplished the trip in three sets of 100 strokes each and then another 50 as I turned around to the calmer waters of the southern side of Ideas Island. I swung into the dock on my first try. One of the exercises in Haren’s Idea Book — which is half activities and inspiring Quote: s, half blank pages — was to find metaphors for problems. I felt that the trip out to the island that I had been longingly gazing at for the previous week was not dissimilar to my career. Though it might be an unsteady and challenging journey to a seemingly unattainable goal, once I reached it, the rowing during the rest of my career would likely be much easier.\nThe next day, my last full day on the island, I woke with more motivation than I had had all week. The feeling has mostly stayed since I’ve returned home. My first weekend back, I started learning to rock climb. I’ve been interspersing my days with dance breaks, walks, and naps, and start the day with yoga when I can. I am much more conscious of and judicious about my Internet use. As for the amber-tinted paleo glasses, although I haven’t used them every night since returning, I do fall asleep earlier on nights when I do.\nOn my last Saturday on the island, though it was a gorgeous, sunny day — at a high of 67 degrees, the warmest all week — I spent most of the day indoors, happily working. At sunset, I went out to the big rock to watch the show. As I sat down, I suddenly noticed that the family of swans was making a beeline for me from the docks to the south. Since I had spent most of the day inside, it was my first time seeing them after I had interrupted their meal the day before. They stopped just in front of the big rock and began feeding right in front of me, as if to say, “We haven’t seen you all day! Where have you been? Thanks for letting us eat in peace yesterday.” The wind was calm. Ripples radiated from the swans’ bobbing necks. The sky glowed with a peachy golden light. It was the grandest sunset all week.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7043\" align=\"\" width=\"1632\"] The swans and sunset on my final night (Laura Shin)[/caption] [gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://fredrikharen.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00K6KOK0K", "http://fredrikharen.com/the-idea-book-page/", "http://ideasisland.com/"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:16:10.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
