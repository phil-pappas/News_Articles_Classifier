His home had been used as a meeting place for the campaign to remove Mr Abbott.\nTony Abbott accepted handshakes from many around him but kept a civil distance from Mr Hendy. Joe Hockey gave Mr Hendy a nod. But that was it.\nSix places to their left and a row back, Bronwyn Bishop, the former Speaker, watched it grimly.\nThe House quickly got on with the serious matters of swearing in the new Liberal MJP for Canning Andrew Hastie, and mourning Curtis Cheng, the civilian police worker murdered by a terrorist in Parramatta.\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten’s first question to Prime Minister Turnbull inquired along the lines of: You said Mr Abbott was a great Prime Minister, so why did you remove him?\n“I am delighted that the leader of the opposition showing his gallantry has given me the opportunity once again to praise the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott),” said Mr Turnbull, crediting his predecessor with bringing to an end the “a period of reckless spending, dysfunctional” Labor government.\nQuestions about the fate of children in asylum seeker detention camps, debate over cuts to penalty rates, and anti-terrorist measures followed.\nBut silent attention also was given to the sight, uncommon in the Liberal Party, of three formerly senior ministers pretending to be busy on the backbench.\nFor most of the time their heads were bowed over paperwork, the frequent pose of those who like to indicate their life is too busy to totally make way for this routine parliamentary stuff.\nMr Abbott has not decided or announced whether he will stay in parliament. Mr Andrews is expected to remain. Mr Hockey has signalled his intention to quit, probably for the job of ambassador to Washington, and might give his valedictory speech next week.\n The walking wounded of politics", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/tony-abbott-joe-hockey-and-kevin-andrews-take-to-the-backbench/story-fn5tas5k-1227566311165"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:49:06.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
