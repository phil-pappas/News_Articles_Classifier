Tom Wolf is ordering a hiring freeze and restrictions on travel. \nThe Democratic governor issued the order Thursday. \nIt imposes a general hiring freeze for most salaried and wage positions, although it says job offers made through Thursday will be honored. It doesn't apply to caregivers and people involved in law enforcement or state revenue. \nWolf's order also prohibits most travel and related costs, but allows essential \"mission critical\" trips and travel reimbursed by third parties. \nThe order also continues the curtailment of discretionary spending and purchases of goods and services that are not critical. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:49:15.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
