It will also help our UK petrochemical assets to have ongoing access to competitive energy,\" INEOS Chairman Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. \nFor LetterOne, the sale will allow it to focus on its plans to acquire further assets in Europe and North Africa, a spokesman said. He would not comment on the value of the deal. \nLetterOne emerged as the frontrunner for the acquisition of German utility E.ON's (EONGn.DE) Norwegian North Sea assets, banking sources told Reuters last week. \nIneos operates Scotland’s largest manufacturing complex at the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant, the destination of a pipeline from North Sea fields. \nLast year, Ineos announced plans to invest $1 billion in British shale gas exploration using fracking technology with an ambition to become the country's biggest shale gas player. \nThe offshore gas assets would compliment any onshore production, it said. \nIneos also said on Sunday it has set up a new oil and gas subsidiary, Ineos Upstream in order to conduct a strategic review of the potential opportunities in the North Sea. \n(This version of the story was refiled with attribution in paragraph 4) \n(Editing by David Clarke and William Hardy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:42:19.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
