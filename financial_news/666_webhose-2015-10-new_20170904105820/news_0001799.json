They also want the Banking Fraud Investigations Unit stopped from continuing their probe on how the 20 frozen accounts were used to siphon money from the youth service. They have also asked a court to stop the Director of Public Prosecutions from charging them. Through lawyer Joseph Wagara, the companies argue that they were paid for supplying road construction materials to project sites in Kibera, Mukuru kwa Reuben and Mukuru kwa Njenga slums in Nairobi. The companies are Form Homes Builders Ltd, Reinforced Concrete Technologies Ltd, Roof and All Trading Company Ltd, Gurumum Engineering, Tegmen Trading and Draco Capitol. The owners of the firms are Josephine Kaburu, Peter Omari Otwoma and Catherine Njambi Kinuthia. The three claim the police are still harassing them even after they gave statements. 20 ACCOUNTS FROZEN A Nairobi court last week froze the 20 accounts in different banks to carry out investigations into the youth service scandal. It is suspected the money was paid to Form Homes Builders Ltd's account at Family Bank before being transferred to other accounts in 11 different banks. On September 29, anti-corruption detectives raided National Youth Service headquarters and took away vouchers used to pay suppliers. Mr Wagara accused the police of using false claims to freeze the accounts. \"Payments made to third parties accounts have no relation whatsoever to theft at the National Youth Service. It has resulted in innocent people's accounts being frozen because investigators have turned a commercial transaction to a criminal case,\" said Mr Wagara. He said Banking Fraud Investigations Unit continues to harass companies' officials by requiring them to appear at their stations whenever summoned. Justice Joseph Onguto declined to unfreeze the accounts. The hearing is on October 19.
