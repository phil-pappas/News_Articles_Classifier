AP by Sewell Chan A coalition of labour unions, businesses, lawyers and human rights activists won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday \"for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution of 2011\".\nThe prize to the coalition, known as the National Dialogue Quartet, comes nearly five years after an unemployed street vendor set himself on fire, touching off a political earthquake that toppled Tunisia's longtime authoritarian president and proceeded to reverberate throughout the Middle East and North Africa.\nAmong the disappointments of what has become known as the Arab Spring - collapsed states in Libya, Syria and Yemen; the return of rule by a military strongman in Egypt; and the rise of the Islamic State in the sectarian caldron of Syria and Iraq - the relative success of Tunisia's transition to democracy has been a wisp of hope.\nThe quartet comprises four organisations: the Tunisian General Labor Union; the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts; the Tunisian Human Rights League; and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. But the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasised that the prize \"is awarded to this quartet, not to the four individual organisations as such\".\nKaci Kullmann Five, chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the prize was above all intended as \"an encouragement to the Tunisian people\".\n\"The Arab Spring originated in Tunisia in 2010 and 2011, but it quickly spread to other countries in North African and the Middle East,\" said Five, who announced the prize in Oslo. \"In many of these countries, the struggle for democracy and human rights has come to a standstill or suffered setbacks. Tunisia, however, has seen a democratic transition based on vibrant civil society, with demands for respect of basic human rights.\"\nIn Tunisia, the winners rejoiced. \"Congratulations to Tunisia, to the quartet and to all parties that facilitated the mission of the quartet,\" the labour union's secretary-general, Houcine Abassi, told Radio Mosaique FM, a Tunisian station. \"This prize came at the right time, because our country is still threatened by different security challenges.\"\nThe prize, the 96th to be awarded since 1901, is 8 million Swedish kronor.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:03:49.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
