It is an oligopoly, so why would they be charging less for loans when they could be charging more?\" Mr Abernethy said.\nWhile Westpac shares were also catching up to several days of rises in other bank stocks, it has been the strongest-performing bank share since last Tuesday's close, even though it has diluted investors with an equity raising during this period.\nSince last Tuesday's close, Commonwealth Bank shares have gained 2.9 per cent, National Australia Bank shares are up 2.3 per cent, and ANZ Bank shares have risen 1.2 per cent.\nWatermark Funds Management investment analyst Omkar Joshi said the positive reaction might encourage other banks to follow suit but they would be wary of political reaction.\n\"They've kind of gotten away with it, so the other banks will probably be thinking, 'will we do the same thing'? But the question is by how much, and I don't think they will increase their rates 0.2 percentage points,\" Mr Joshi said.\nDavid Ellis, head of banking research at Morningstar, said Westpac's share price may also have risen due to stronger-than-expected performance in its profit margins.\n\"I think it's a sensible response from Westpac and I expect to see the other banks follow,\" Mr Ellis said.\n\"The cost of a much so-called 'safer' banking system is borne not just by shareholders, it is going to be borne by customers as well.\"\nWestpac's raising, via an entitlement offer, allows shareholders to buy one new share for every 23 held at $25.50 a share, a discount of 13.6 per cent to the dividend-adjusted pre-raising price of $29.50.\nA letter from chairman Lindsay Maxsted sent to retail shareholders on Monday highlighted that the bank was still lifting dividends, with a final dividend rising 2¢ compared with a year ago, to 94¢ a share.\n\"We also recognise the importance of dividends to shareholders and while we are raising capital and increasing the number of shares on issue, we have not changed our dividend approach,\" Mr Maxsted said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:30:34.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
