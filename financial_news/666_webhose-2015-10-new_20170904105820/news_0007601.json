The Bureau has also concluded, as it must under the Dodd-Frank Act, that imposing such limitations by regulation would be consistent with its recent Report to Congress. \nBACKGROUND - \nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) mandated a CFPB study on the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses in consumer financial products and services, with a report of its findings sent to Congress. \nPlease see full Alert below for more information. \nFirefox recommends the PDF Plugin for Mac OS X for viewing PDF documents in your browser. \nWe can also show you Legal Updates using the Google Viewer; however, you will need to be logged into Google Docs to view them. \nPlease choose one of the above to proceed! \nLOADING PDF: If there are any problems, click here to download the file. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Morrison & Foerster LLP Morrison & Foerster LLP on: \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email…\" Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy. - hide Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) : \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.
