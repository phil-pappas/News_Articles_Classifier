Photo: Bradley Kanaris\nThe former chief executive of David Jones has called on Australian businesses to diversify their workforces if they are to survive the 21st century.\nPaul Zahra, who resigned as David Jones CEO last year following the company's takeover by Woolworths South Africa , told a business lunch in Brisbane on Wednesday that diversity was vital for modern business.\nAnd that nice Maltese girl that (my mother) wanted me to marry? Well his name is Duncan.\nPaul Zahra Citing his own experience at David Jones, Mr Zahra said it was doubtful the retailer would have survived what he called a post-GFC \"perfect storm\" that saw the Australian dollar go beyond parity and an increasingly fragmented retail sector.\n\"Our newest competitor could have simply been somebody who had started an online business out of their garage,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"We also had an avalanche of new international retailers – the H&Ms, the Uniqlos, the Zaras etc – hit Australian shores.\n\"With all of this going on, David Jones had no digital strategy and a web store that had been previously closed in 2003, so we were simply not prepared.\"\nNow a global retail adviser with PwC, Mr Zahra counsels businesses on transformational change, leadership and diversity.\n\"I believe that people have the human right to show up as themselves at work,\" he said.\n\"We as business leaders need to step up and give our people the opportunity and confidence and trust them.\n\"Authenticity in the workplace creates a powerful workplace culture and is great for productivity and is also great for business.\n\"We are entering a new era when it comes to freedom of choice as human beings and every industry and every role is being disrupted.\n\"As a result, there will be a lot more choice and a lot more liberation.\"\nMr Zahra said, as the first openly gay CEO of an ASX 200, he was well aware of the personal challenges that came with coming out.\n\"It's sad to say, but I think there's no doubt that for some LGBTI people, being out can actually impact your career,\" he said.\n\"It's one of those choices you've got to get your head around and it's unfortunate in today's world that can still occur.\n\"There's no doubt during my career there were times it certainly worked against me.\"\nMr Zahra said, for him, it was as simple as competitors for advancement questioning whether he was up for the job.\n\"Masculinity is judged on your sexuality rather than your character as a human, and that's why part of the work I'm doing now is educating people that difference is a good thing,\" he said.\n\"And in fact in the workplace it's even better because it drives a whole series of thinking that, at David Jones, if we didn't have those differences in thinking we would never have been able to solve the problems that we had.\n\"It drives innovation, it drives creativity and gay guys can pick colours better than anyone else in the room, so there are a lot of reasons you'd want a diverse workforce.\"\nBut Mr Zahra said, even in 2015, there was still some way to go.\n\"There are certainly people in the CEO circle that have kept their sexuality away, and that's their choice, I'm not judging them at all,\" he said.\n\"What I would like to be able to do is help.\n\"I do believe it's every gay man's responsibility, or LGBTI responsibility, to be open about their sexuality because if they are, I think it normalises it for everybody and everybody gets over their own obstacles and issues.\n\"So I'd like to see a world where that would occur.\"\nMr Zahra also outlined his own struggle as a gay man coming out to his family.\nAfter an initial acceptance, Mr Zahra said, he was disowned by his parents.\n\"I'm pleased to report, after 25 years – after a quarter of a century has passed, it's mindblowing – that I've been back in contact with my parents,\" he said.\n\"We've reconnected where we left off some 25 years ago, so it's been a cathartic experience to say the least.\n\"Like me, the years have broadened and deepened their views around difference and diversity and my parents are exceptionally proud of me and my partner.\n\"And that nice Maltese girl that (my mother) wanted me to marry? Well his name is Duncan.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:46:31.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
