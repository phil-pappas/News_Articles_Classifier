Photo: AP\n JPMorgan Chase & Co is set to pay almost a third of a $US1.86 billion ($2.6 billion) settlement to resolve accusations that a dozen big banks conspired to limit competition in the credit-default swaps (CDS) market, according to people briefed on the terms of the deal.\nJPMorgan is paying $US595 million, with the lender's portion of the accord largely based on the plaintiffs' measure of market share, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the firms haven't disclosed how they're splitting costs.\nThe settlement also enacts reforms making it easier for electronic-trading platforms to enter the CDS market, according to a statement on Thursday from attorneys for the plaintiffs, which include the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association.\nMorgan Stanley, Barclays and Goldman Sachs Group are paying about $US230 million, $US175 million and $US164 million, respectively, the people said. Plaintiffs' lawyers disclosed the approximate size of the settlement in Manhattan federal court last month, saying they were still ironing out details. They updated the total on Thursday.\nAdvertisement The accord averts a trial following years of litigation by hedge funds, pension funds, university endowments, small banks and other investors, who sued as a group.\nThey alleged that global banks -- along with Markit Group, a market-information provider in which the banks owned stakes -- conspired to control the information about the multitrillion-dollar CDS market in violation of US antitrust laws.\nCredit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Corp will pay about $US160 million, $US120 million and $US90 million, respectively, the people said. BNP Paribas, UBS Group, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and HSBC Holdings also would pay less than $US100 million apiece, the people said.\nSpokesmen for the banks said the companies had no immediate comment or didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\"We look forward to the court reviewing the settlement and bringing this important matter to a just conclusion,\" Dan Brockett and Bruce Simon, lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said in the statement.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:24:51.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
