Erik Metanomski, founder of Lanyon Asset Management, says if you can’t buy an investment at a fair or discounted price, keep your money in cash.\nANTHONY KEANE News Corp Australia Network GOING against the herd has made Erik Metanomski one of Australia’s most successful investment fund managers, and he says a key to success is being able to say no.\nMr Metanomski, known for sitting on large piles of cash while other investors rush into rising markets, said most successful investors said “no” probably 99 out of 100 times.\n“If you haven’t got a very good reason for holding something, you shouldn’t be holding it,” he said.\n“If you calculate that the downside is very, very significant or equal to your upside, you just don’t buy it.”\nMr Metanomski is co-founder and director of Lanyon Asset Management , whose Australian Value Fund has averaged annual returns after fees of 13.6 per cent over the past five years, more than double the Aussie sharemarket’s 6.3 per cent.\n“If you can’t purchase an asset at a fair or discounted price, it is better to hold cash regardless of its yield,” he said.\nMr Metanomski, who has moved from Adelaide to Indonesia where he does humanitarian work, returns next week to speak at Hood Sweeney’s Masters of Investing event.\nHood Sweeney senior director of finance Tony Michaels said the firm’s investment committee, which Mr Metanomski chairs, chose stocks that were overlooked by investors and trading at a discount to their underlying value.\nHe said Hood Sweeney’s philosophy was not to chase yield, as many investors had done globally amid historically low interest rates.\n“I think there is a lot of confusion about the definition of risk. Risk to us isn’t volatility – that can create opportunities. Risk to us is permanent loss of capital and our job is to preserve capital,” he said.\n“For example, we are underweight in banking stocks and financials generally because we think they are overvalued. People are jumping into the Commonwealth Bank because they are trying to get the extra yield without realising that a fall in the share price will knock that yield out pretty quickly. We’ve seen that happen.”\nOther speakers at Masters of Investing, which runs from noon to 3pm on October 27 at the Adelaide Hilton, are Magellan Global Fund chairman Chris Mackay and the managing director of real estate investment fund Folkestone, Greg Paramor.
