Since it was founded nine years ago, the San Francisco-based micro-blogging site has lost nearly $2 billion, the Associated Press reported . \nInvestors applauded the move, but without rousing acclaim. Twitter stock rose Tuesday by 1.1%, closing at $29.06. More Headlines Here's What Jack Dorsey Told His Staff After Twitter Announced Layoffs \nTwitter's layoffs, announced by company co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey in a letter to employees, signal that its days of rapid and bloated growth are over. Dorsey conceded as much in his note. \n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team,\" Dorsey said. \"And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.\" \nThe painful job cuts are sure to reverberate in this tech-centric city and also serve as a wake-up call to dozens of tech startups that are struggling to turn their first profit. \nThe company's retrenchment will also affect a formerly vacant and blighted part of downtown San Francisco known as Mid-Market. Twitter moved its headquarters to Mid-Market in 2012, taking over an old Art Deco building. Other companies, including Square and Uber , then followed. Before it announced the layoffs, Twitterhad been planning to expand across the street from its headquarters, taking additional space in the building that houses Square, a mobile payments start-up that is also run by Dorsey. \nBut now Twitter had decided \"to opt out of a previously planned 100,000-square-foot expansion of its San Francisco headquarters, according to two people familiar with the company's plans,\" the New York Times recently reported . The company's decision to nix the expansion was first reported by the San Francisco Business Times. Any halt in the expansion of Mid-Market would also affect the many restaurants and service businesses that have moved into the area to cater to the tech crowd. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:19:11.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
