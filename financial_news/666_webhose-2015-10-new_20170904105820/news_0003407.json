So did households tuck the money away, pay down debt or splurge?\nNew research, based on examining the spending patterns of millions of consumers, found that households were quick to spend most of the benefits from cheaper gasoline. The study finds Americans were far less cautious than previously thought in spending their extra cash.\n“Consumers report that they are using their gains at the pump to pay down debts and save. Our data show they are spending most of them,” the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute study said.\nIndividuals spent 78 cents of every dollar saved on gasoline, with about 18% of that going to eating out and 10% to groceries, according to the study. Other big categories included entertainment, electronics and appliances, and charitable donations.\nThe findings run counter to earlier studies and conventional wisdom, which interpreted soft overall consumer spending and a rising personal saving rate earlier this year as evidence that households were pocketing their windfall from lower gasoline prices. U.S. retail and food service sales, for example, fell in December, January and February and were flat in April and June, according to Commerce Department data.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/10/08/u-s-consumers-splurged-with-gas-savings-after-all-study-finds/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:32:32.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
