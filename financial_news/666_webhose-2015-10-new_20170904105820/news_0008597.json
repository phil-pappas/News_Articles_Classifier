The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 2.04 percent from 2.06 percent Monday, while the 30-year slipped 2.87 percent from 2.90 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:43:05.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
