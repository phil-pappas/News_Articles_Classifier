While the bulk of the hiring happens in November, “if you’re going to find those jobs you need to start today,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president, business development at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Many holiday jobs have the potential to turn into full-time positions, as employers often hang onto the best of the holiday hires, Challenger said. If you’re only interested in temporary employment, you shouldn’t mention your short-term intentions at your interview, Challenger said. Instead, emphasize your ability to work flexible hours in various positions as needed.\nPositions generally pay between $8 and $12 an hour. While that’s not much, even a little extra cash can come in handy around the holidays. What’s more, many retailers extend their employee discounts to holiday hires, which usually range from 10% to 20%. Those collecting Social Security payments before their full retirement age should keep in mind that they’ll see their benefits reduced if they earn above certain thresholds. While major retailers list seasonal openings on their websites, the best way to land a job is through good old-fashioned shoe leather, Challenger said. Visit stores where you’d like to work and ask if there’s a manager you can talk to about possible opportunities. It’s best if you target stores where you like to shop. “They love to hire people who love their products,” Challenger said.\nGetty Images D MA MB MC MD ME MG ZG ZQ ZR ZS ZT ZU Butterball \nButterball’s 50-plus experts staff the Turkey Talk-Line from November through December. But the number of local hires the Naperville, Ill.-based Talk-Line makes is relatively small, since the company gets so many repeat employees with backgrounds ranging from registered dietitians to food stylists. These days, it’s not enough for experts draw on their “long history of turkey knowledge” to help panicked home cooks nationwide, said Nicole Johnson, co-director of the Turkey Talk-Line. Experts also have to be adept at fielding calls and questions through social media and live chats.

The company is looking for seasonal warehouse workers and packers throughout the country, and successful candidates will be able to lift merchandise weighing between 30 and 47 pounds regularly, and up to 60 pounds infrequently, according to one job posting.

Not all positions are customer facing. For example, the company is looking for a seasonal administrative support team member in its Downey, Calif. location to oversee scheduling and facilitate hiring, among other duties.

The company is looking for a seasonal associate in its Rego Park, N.Y. location whose primary responsibility is to “smile and say ‘hi’” to customers. While that might seem simple, “not everyone can do that,” Challenger said. It’s an excellent position for an extrovert.

The company’s website says seasonal positions may last from mid-September to late January. Seasonal employees may be required to work multiple shifts or during nights, weekends and possibly holidays.

Many of these jobs are in the warehouse, but they don’t necessarily require heavy lifting. The company uses robots and sophisticated tracking software to make sure goods get where they need to go. “It’s more of a thoughtful job than a brawn job,” Challenger said. See openings here.

These stores typically fill positions through word-of-mouth. Retirees are often attractive candidates, Koff said, since they often have good communication skills and a robust network of friends who will visit the store to shop and socialize.\n\n\nElizabeth O'Brien covers retirement for MarketWatch.
