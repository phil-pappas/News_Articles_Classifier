It began its regional venture by launching a Telugu television shopping channel on Wednesday, and will introduce language-specific channels in Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali and possibly Gujarati over the next one year. All these markets have people who don’t speak Hindi but have disposable income.\nOver time, Shop CJ Network Pvt. Ltd, a 50:50 joint venture between South Korea-based CJ O Shopping Co. Ltd. and US-based private equity firm, Providence Equity Partners LLC, expects 45% of its revenues to come from these regional markets with the Hindi-speaking belt making up the rest.\n“With the launch of 24X7 Telugu home shopping channel, we have begun the process of introducing region-specific niche channels,” Kenny Shin, chief executive officer of Shop CJ, said. The regional channels will not have dubbed content but will feature original programming in vernacular languages by local content creators and artists.\nShin and Gopi Krishna Vaddi, director at Providence Equity Advisors India Pvt. Ltd, declined to reveal the investments the company would be making for its regional entry. The company has invested Rs. 1,000 crore since it entered the Indian market in 2009.\n“We have the capital. We are committed to investing in the regional markets,” Vaddi said. “We have deep pockets,” added Shin.\nProvidence manages funds worth $40 billion and has invested in 140 companies worldwide, while CJ O Shopping is the world’s second largest television shopping network belonging to CJ Group, a Korean chaebol (conglomerate). CJ O Shopping, which has a presence in 10 countries, primarily in Asia, generated sales of $4.8 billion in 2014.\nMedia firm Star India sold the stake held by an affiliate to Providence in June last year as part of its strategy to exit non-core businesses.\nShop CJ expects to sell Rs. 250 crore worth of goods in the Telugu markets of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over the next 12 months. That will mean about 20% of Rs. 1,200 crore sales it expects to do by March 2016. Shop CJ’s gross merchandise value (GMV), or total value of products sold on its platform, during financial year 2014-15 was Rs. 850 crore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:31:26.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
