They shared how lease expiration management (LEM) improved their ability to offer flexibility to their residents and prospects but more importantly, aids in controlling exposure to take advantage of seasonal demand, preventing costly vacancy swings.\n“Lease expiration management is a vital component of revenue optimization in the multifamily industry, and many of our customers have enjoyed the benefits of improving resident flexibility and eliminating wild vacancy changes,” said Rainmaker President Tammy Farley. “Rainmaker remains focused on delivering solutions and services that have the greatest impact on the overall revenue performance of our customers. By enabling our customers to strategically adjust lease expirations to better coincide with traffic and demand, Rainmaker is helping to ensure and grow long term profitability for multifamily portfolios.”\n“Lease Expiration Management is an instrumental component of an effective revenue management strategy,” explained Wynne. “The goal is to deliver a monthly turnover rate that will match, or be slightly less than, the monthly forecasted demand for an apartment. However, it is never a one-size-fits-all process.” Wynne suggests that when considering LEM, it is important to always include the following in the program:\n Determine which leases – new or renewals – will help the community meet its LEM goals. Renewals have proven to deliver the fastest impact on shifting expirations with the least disruption to sales teams. Consider the abilities and limitations of the maintenance staff to turn units when finalizing the target number of lease expirations during certain months. It’s difficult to prepare 60 units in a single month. Ensure regional managers have a strong understanding of long-term revenue goals to help guide what method of LEM is preferable for each community. Train, and continually train, the sales team so they promote the preferred terms with applicants and renewing residents to help further control leasing velocity and reduce high vacancy exposure.\nMask discussed how amenity pricing helps to further enhance ECI’s LEM practice. “While amenities do not necessarily affect LEM, leveraging amenity values is a simple way to increase revenue and decrease vacancy loss based on demand,” she said. “While varying unit types have higher demand at different times of the year, the same can be said for amenity values.”\nLikewise, Mask recommends owners and operators review amenity pricing as often as possible as they are closely aligned to seasonality, market conditions and the competition. Demand for pool views, wooded views, attached garages, screened porches, sunrooms, and flooring varies throughout the year and from market to market. For example, residents may be willing to pay more for a pool view in summer vs. winter, attached garages may be worth more in winter in snowy markets compared to summer months, the wooded view in Spring and Summer is beautiful, but barren in fall and winter. Logically it makes sense to use amenity pricing to help ensure LEM strategies are completely in-line with seasonality.\nLEM is a relatively new practice in the multifamily industry and has seen even more hesitancy in the area of new development lease-up. Zeqiri believes LEM is a great tool to help move away from the standard use of concessions in the lease-up phase and enable a community to better maintain its pricing power.\n“Developers love a speedy lease-up and often encourage management to offer incentives to prospects to generate a maximum number of move-ins,” Zeqiri said. “Upfront concessions, discounts, and other specials offered to push velocity during lease-up skew seasonality curve. By cloning LEM data from an already stabilized property to help set your lease-ups pricing, you are not only able to meet the occupancy pro forma but you are also better protecting your seasonality curve, ensuring you are accurately renting based on real-time traffic in year two and beyond.”\nLearn more about LEM strategies shared at MAXIMIZE here .\nAbout LRO\nRainmaker LRO® is the leading multifamily revenue management software as a service solution used to maximize revenue from apartment leases.
