More Xi lands in London for ‘golden era’ visit \nThe committee also said the Pension Wise website, which provides information on options at retirement, but not guidance, was “not fit for purpose”. \nThe report follows an investigation by the MPs into how the flexibility, introduced six months ago, is progressing. But the report has found a lack of regulatory clarity over what is “advice” and “guidance” is putting savers at risk of poor decisions. \n“Good quality, co-ordinated and accessible guidance and advice will be the best tools to ensure people make the best, informed decisions about their retirement savings, and protect them from scammers,” the report says. \n“We call for clarification of the distinction between guidance and advice; the definitions of safeguarded benefits; and protections in providing advice to insistent clients. We also expect to see a reduction in the use of jargon and complex pricing structures.” \nIn response to the report, the Treasury said Pension Wise had been a “real success story”, with 1.5m visits to the website and 20,000 guidance appointments, and was considering ways to make the service “even more useful” for consumers. Labour is urging the government to look very closely at this report and act now in order to avert the next great mis-selling scandal \n- Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow pensions minister \nThe committee’s report followed interviews with industry and consumer groups, which gave evidence on the first six months of the pension freedoms. But the committee said a “dearth” of government information about the use being made both of the freedoms, and of the Pension Wise guidance service , made assessment of progress “very difficult”. \n“Reluctance to provide information about how a reform or service is working is rarely a good sign,” said Frank Field, who chairs the committee. “It is very difficult for the government to support its claims that all is well, or for us to make any assessment of progress, when no data are forthcoming despite repeated requests. \n“The scarcity of information regarding Pension Wise, in particular, is not conducive to effective scrutiny. The committee repeats its call for government to address these omissions urgently, and particularly to introduce a research programme tracking consumer outcomes.” \nThe report also recommended stronger signposting to the Pension Wise service by pension providers, and for the free guidance to be personalised for savers, who should be offered more than one session. \nThe committee also recommended that the government “urgently redouble” its publicity efforts around pension scams and for the regulator to tighten its scam awareness and reporting requirements for regulated firms. \nLabour said the report showed the government was failing to protect and inform consumers. “Since pension freedoms have been introduced, money lost through scam activity has increased,” said Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow pensions minister. \n“Labour is urging the government to look very closely at this report and act now in order to avert the next great mis-selling scandal.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
