They've rallied 2.3% the past month, a bit more than midcap funds' 2.18% but less than big-cap funds' 4%. \nThe average small-cap mutual fund rose an average annual 8.53% in the past 10 years. That trailed the 8.92% annual pace of the average midcap stock fund, but exceeded the 7.57% from the average large-cap stock fund and 7.61% from the S&P 500. \nA $10,000 investment in each category on Sept. 30, 2005, would have grown to $21,856 for small caps by Oct. 9 this year, $22,687 for midcap funds, $20,232 for large-cap funds and $20,272 for the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. data.

View Enlarged Image \n\nTop-performing small-cap mutual funds have skated well above average â€” not only of their peers and large-cap funds, but of midcap funds as well. \nMany of the top-performing small-cap funds are closed to new investors. Homestead Small Company Stock is one of the few top-performers still accepting new-investors' dollars. It's returned an average annual 10.94% the past 10 years. The $1.2 billion fund is down -0.64%, in line with the 0.55% by the S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market . \nThe blend fund, which invests in both growth and value stocks, has been managed by Mark Ashton since 1999, and Prabha Carpenter and Greg Halter since 2014. \nThe fund on its website says that it aims to grow \"through investment in stocks that are priced below what we consider to be intrinsic value and in companies that are positioned to make a change in their business that will lead to an improvement in their competitive position or financial returns.\" \nThe fund's recent holdings include Dycom Industries (NYSE: DY ). The telecom engineering and infrastructure company has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, and shared by only one other company in the 31-stock Telecom-Infrastructure group. \nStock analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters expect Dycom's earnings to rise 35% in the current fiscal year ending in July and 17% next year. The stock is trading in new-high territory, having recently rallied off its 50-day moving average. \nFollow Doug Rogers on Twitter: @IBD_DRogers .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:49:43.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
