Darrian Traynor by Ben Potter I've barely had time to sit myself down next to the white brick wall of the Agapi Restaurant in Richmond when Jeff Kennett declares, \"I love multiculturalism\" and proceeds to celebrate the rich heritage of the inner Melbourne suburb. Richmond has been a working class ghetto, a factory enclave and Melbourne's Greek-town. Now it is being gentrified and the old Rosella factory is an advertising agency.\nOther factories have become offices, including nearby Balmain House – nerve centre of Kennett Inc, one of the more successful post-political careers. Less to the former Victoria premier's liking, large apartment blocks have sprung up, choking the trams, trains and roads. Kennett gives the wine list a cursory glance and says, \"We have to have a Greek – so we can really wash our mouths out.\"\nIt's a 2011 Katogi \"Dry Red Wine of Greece\" from near Thessaloniki, a city Kennett compares to Melbourne. Kennett also likes Thessaloniki for its wonderful archaeological sites and proximity to men-only Mount Athos, an Orthodox seminary where he was surprised to find 40 or 50 Australian novices.\nThe wine is fruity and full-flavoured. Agapi is a Swan Street institution – Swan Street is less glamorous than Bridge Road but is coming into its own. Kennett is on first-name terms with Peter, the maître d' , and after an informal chat the food starts to flow, starting with melizanosalatas – eggplant and garlic dip.\n\"I value the gift of life more than anything else,\" Kennett says. Darrian Traynor Kennett is a keen walker and gardener. He can stow away a good lunch and still looks fit and trim at 67. It is five days after the AFL Grand Final, so there's only one topic to start with – Hawthorn's third premiership on the trot, its 13th since 1961.\nHe has seen every one of them, and was president of the \"family club\" from 2005 to 2011. I am a lifelong Hawk fan.\nKennett's legacy for Hawthorn Kennett's presidency marked Hawthorn's return from the wilderness to the top of the AFL, giving opposition supporters who objected to the blunt way he turned Victoria's economy around as premier in the 1990s a double dose of umbrage.\nTalking of food: The excellent fare at Agapi in Richmond includes the mixed grill, a huge platter of lamb cutlets, sausages, souvlaki, hamburger and red peppers. Darrian Traynor He's happy to take some of the credit for putting in place a smooth administration that has restored the club's finances and made sustained on-field success possible.\nThe grilled calamari and octopus are springy, sweet and delicious. The wine is surprisingly good. But there is a small elephant in the room.\nIn 2013, things were not looking so hot.\nHawthorn had made an iffy start to the season after losing the 2012 Grand Final to the Sydney Swans. Kennett called for the sacking of the coach, Alistair Clarkson, who had been installed just before Kennett became president and lifted the club to its 10th premiership in 2008.\nThe grilled octapodi at Agapi is springy, sweet and delicious. Darrian Traynor \"Without me making those comments he wouldn't have been focused enough to go on and win,\" Kennett jests.\nHe praises Clarkson's exhaustive preparation and experience, but notes that it takes a team to win a premiership – or government. Hawthorn is a case study of good governance, he says, for a commercial organisation, a non-profit or a sporting club.\nWhen he and Clarkson next spoke, \"we just laughed\", he says. The fan in him doesn't rule out matching Collingwood's record four premierships in a row in the 1920s as a spur. Some wags are calling Hawthorn \"Fourthorn\".\nLightning rod Kennett has just become chairman of The Torch, which offers art materials and training to Indigenous prisoners in Victoria: \"It's not welfare. It's giving them the confidence to rebuild their lives.\" Darrian Traynor At Hawthorn, in state government or at Beyond Blue – the mental health advocacy group he has chaired since 2000 – Kennett has seen his role as a \"lightning rod\".\nIt's a recurring theme. He's good at getting attention. Beyond Blue – with other groups – has played big a role in raising the profile of mental health and reducing the taboo over it.\n\"You wouldn't have asked me about it 10 years ago,\" he says. \"The ABC wouldn't have run the program (the recent Mental As series, in which he participated). Sportsmen and women wouldn't have been coming out and talking about their problems.\"\nA huge platter of grilled lamb cutlets, sausages, souvlaki, hamburger and red peppers lands on the table.\nOne sportsman Kennett knows well is Buddy Franklin, the boom forward who began his career at Hawthorn as a teenager, switched to the Sydney Swans on a $10 million deal in 2014, and pulled out of this year's finals series because of mental illness.\n\"The Buddy Franklin/Swans' declaration of Buddy's illness actually directly says . . . that a sportsman or sportswoman's health is more important than a premiership,\" he says.\nHelping people get treatment for mental illness is part of Beyond Blue's work. But the greater part is preventative – giving people the tools they need to deal with stress and anxiety in their daily lives, Kennett says.\nHis own method is homespun. He reflects on what he's done well and what he could have done better at the end of each day, so he can go to sleep with a clear head, and gives thanks each morning for another day on earth.\nIt's not a religious thing. \"I value the gift of life more than anything else.\"\nThe gift of life Losing an election (in 1999) hurt, but it barely rates alongside that gift of life, he says now. We are hoeing in to our succulent mixed grill, washing it down with Katogi and mineral water.\nToo many people have forgotten this, he says. He challenges me. Like most people, I don't give thanks for each day, and haven't developed defences against day-to-day stress and anxiety, he asserts.\n\"You have just been told by the Financial Review that you are going to lose your job,\" he hypothesises. \"How are you going to handle that?\"\nKennett worries that the good life has diminished individual responsibility, and that high youth unemployment – nearly 30 per cent in some country towns – is making young people bored, easy prey for ice dealers.\nLarge numbers of young Australians – three generations in some cases – may never have meaningful work, he says.\nKennett is wrestling with his post-politics persona – a more sympathetic one than the hard man of 1990s' Victorian politics.\nHe is starting to think welfare recipients should have to be \"occupied\" - he doesn't specify how - \"for their own good health\", except for the disabled or severely disadvantaged.\nBeyond Blue takes up 35 per cent to 40 per cent of Kennett's time. Outside of his family, it's the most important thing he's done, he says – running the state included.\nBut nothing lasts forever. Later he will reveal plans to move on from Beyond Blue.\nWhen Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott to become Prime Minister five weeks ago, Kennett panned Turnbull for disloyalty on Twitter.\n\"That was quite deliberate and done for a reason,\" he says.\nBut it was another lightning-rod moment. He recanted next morning, on Channel Seven's Sunrise .\nKennett takes pride in leading bipartisan organisations in his post-political life. But he is still a rusted-on Liberal – economically conservative and socially liberal, like Turnbull.\nHe hopes Turnbull gets a fair go, five to eight years. He praises Abbott, saying people take \"stopping the boats\" for granted – \"Look at Europe\" – and that free trade deals struck on his watch are giving us access to new markets.\nBut he says Turnbull will have to make \"tough decisions\" to get us to a better place and \"the public will wear that if he takes them with him\".\nThe \"great tragedy\" is that for the last 10 years, \"the public has had no idea where the government has been trying to take them\".\nMessianic zeal This brings Kennett to a subject he tackles with messianic zeal – the need for a national water and food industry policy.\nGreat changes are afoot in global food markets. Asia's swelling middle classes want clean and green protein. They see a \"Produce of Australia\" label as a guarantor of that.\nBut Australia hasn't put in place policies to capitalise on this surging demand.\n\"I'd have as a KPI the capacity by 2025 to be able to feed 500 million,\" he says, backed up by water, science and technology policies. By 2050, \"one billion people\".\nHe's not opposed to Chinese purchases of agricultural land, but would rather have Australians in the driver's seat.\n\"Every child should understand the importance of having a progressive and strong food industry.\"\nKennett's role earlier this year as go-between in a dispute between Coles and its suppliers reinforced the lesson. He interviewed 250 of them, and, in his capacity as court-appointed independent arbiter, awarded them more than $10 million for the supermarket giant's high-handed treatment.\nThis has led to \"fundamental change\" in the relationship. Every supplier contract is being rewritten. Coles is investing in suppliers' growth. \"It's going to be very good for their suppliers.\"\nSome of them have been approached by overseas buyers, offered better terms and payment in advance. It's made them realise they are less beholden to the supermarkets than they thought. Overseas demand is only going to increase.\nIt's made Kennett think our access to food may not be as secure as we think unless big buyers change their tune. But there's also a huge opportunity.\n\"What better way to build relationships with countries and governments [in the region] than to become a major supplier of the produce that keeps their populations alive?\"\nIt's well after two o'clock and we are eating baklava. It is sweet, nutty, fragrant. Greek coffee is also on the table.\nWhat's next? Kennett has some unfinished business.\nHe has told the board of Beyond Blue he will step down as chairman on June 30, 2017.\nEver since he was minister for Aboriginal affairs in the early 1980s, he has carried around \"a knot of guilt in my gut\" about white settlers' treatment of Indigenous Australians.\nHe has just become chairman of The Torch, an organisation which offers art materials and training to Indigenous prisoners in Victoria to improve their post-incarceration prospects.\nWith typical gusto, he wants to raise $3 million by Christmas, prove the model up so it can be taken to a second state by 2017, and eventually make it a national program.\n\"It's not welfare. It's giving them the confidence to rebuild their lives.\"\nMenu Agapi,\n262 Swan St, Richmond, Melbourne\n1 eggplant puree with garlic, $7.50\n1 grilled calamari, $19.50\n1 grilled octapodi, $22.50\nMixed Grill – souvlaki, gyros, sausages, hamburger & lamb cutlets – for two, $60\nGreek salad for two, $29\n2 hot pita bread, $4\n2 baklava, $15\n1 Katogi \"Dry Red Wine of Greece\" 2011, Thessaloniki, $48\n1 Mineral Water, $8.50\nGreek Coffee on the house\nTotal: $214", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:07:10.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
