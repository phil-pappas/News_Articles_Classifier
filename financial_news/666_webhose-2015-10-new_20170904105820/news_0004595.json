The last time the Treasury labeled a country a manipulator was China in 1994.\nBefore the devaluation, the currency had been appreciating as the Chinese government sought to support its aim of shifting the economy's main engine from exports to domestic demand.\n\"Further currency appreciation is key...and will support the purchasing power of Chinese consumers and help shift production towards non-traded goods and services,\" the report said.\nChina is pushing for the yuan to be included in the International Monetary Funds's benchmark currency basket as a means of reducing its dependence on the dollar, but policymakers have yet to decide if it has met all the market-based criteria.\nElsewhere in the report, the United States again called for South Korea to curb currency interventions and repeated that the won appeared to be \"undervalued\" and should be allowed to appreciate over the medium term.\nThe U.S. Treasury also urged Japan to recalibrate fiscal policy to support economic growth and reduce reliance on yen depreciation to boost exports.\n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Krista Hughes ; Editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:19:43.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
