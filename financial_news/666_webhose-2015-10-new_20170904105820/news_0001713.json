The news sent its shares down more than 9% and shaved about 40 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.69% .\nThe retail giant WMT, -8.57% said it has drawn up a three-year plan that includes capital investments of about $11 billion in fiscal 2017 and another roughly $1.1 billion to be spent on e-commerce and digital initiatives. That’s after an estimated $12.4 billion of capital investments in fiscal 2016. \n“Fiscal year 2017 will represent our heaviest investment period,” Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said in a statement. “Operating income is expected to be impacted by approximately $1.5 billion from the second phase of our previously announced investments in wages and training as well as our commitment to further developing a seamless customer experience.”\nAs a result of the heavy investments, the company expects per-share earnings to decline 6% to 12% in fiscal 2017, he said, putting the number well below the current FactSet consensus, which is for growth of 4%. But Wal-Mart says EPS will return to growth by fiscal 2019, when it is expected to rise 5% to 10%. \nMeanwhile, the company is expecting net sales growth of 3% to 4% over the next three years, equal to $45 billion to $60 billion. Sales are expected to be flat in fiscal 2016, mostly due to the impact of the strong dollar. \n“This framework is intended to enhance the experience in stores, leverage Walmart’s unique supply chain capabilities to lower costs and build deep digital relationships with customers,” the company said. \nWal-Mart is under growing pressure from Amazon AMZN, -0.80% , which has a much bigger market cap at about $257 billion compared with Wal-Mart’s $213 billion. \nShares are down 29% in the year-to-date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 4.8%. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:13:53.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
