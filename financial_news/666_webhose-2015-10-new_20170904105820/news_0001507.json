Ghana is already challenged with power supply and to forestall a worsening situation, government has decided to step in. \nThough the sources would not mention the actual figure owed by Ghana, they said the issue is being resolved at a “diplomatic level”. \nAccording to NGAs, Ghana needs to pay them so that they can also pay WAPCo to transport the natural gas to Ghana. \nJoy News has also learnt that West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited would hold a press conference tomorrow to shed some light on the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:14:31.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
