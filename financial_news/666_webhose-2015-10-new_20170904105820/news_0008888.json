But Tesla's stock is dead last among automakers — including General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Volkswagen (OTCPK: VLKAY ) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) — on two key qualitative measures.\nInstitutions Sell Tesla Stock \nTesla had an D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating as of Wednesday's close. The A/D Rating measures net buying or selling by mutual funds and other big institutions in recent weeks. A D- A/D Rating is near the bottom of a scale that goes from A+ to a worst-possible E. Back on July 20, when Tesla broke out of a 10-month base, the stock had a B rating. But the breakout failed and big funds sold shares, especially in recent days. Wall Street has not been impressed with Tesla's high Model X price tag .\n  View Enlarged Image \nWhy is institutional support important? For one, mutual funds and other big buyers have the heft to push a stock up or down. Without bulk buyers, a stock can't make a powerful advance. Also, while big money isn't always smart, the experts that run huge funds aren't exactly stupid either.\nUpdate: Tesla stock fell 2.3% on Thursday, its third straight decline in above-average volume. Tesla's Accumulation/Distribution Rating fell to a worst-possible E.\nMeanwhile, General Motors boasted a solid Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B on Wednesday, and kept the grade on Thursday as shares rose modestly in light volume\nVolkswagen had a B- A/D Rating on Wednesday, then rose to a solid B on Thursday. That's right: Volkswagen, facing tens of billions of dollars in fines, lawsuits and lost sales for its diesel emissions scandal, enjoys more institutional support — very recently — than Tesla. Admittedly, this follows a 56% from March 17 to Oct. 2, when VW had a worst-possible A/D Rating of E. Funds may see the stock as cheap, or at least due for a short-term bounce.\nFord Motor (NYSE: F ) had a B- A/D Rating on Wednesday and Thursday. Shares have been rising, but not on much volume.\nFiat Chrysler had an A/D Rating of C on Wednesday, which was actually an improvement in recent days despite concerns that the United Auto Workers would declare a strike at Wednesday midnight. Just after midnight, the UAW said it had reached a tentative deal with Fiat Chrysler, averting a crippling strike. Fiat Chrysler continued to rebound Thursday, though its A/D Rating remained at a C.\nNissan Motor (OTCPK: NSANY ), which doesn't trade that much on U.S. over-the-counter markets, actually has the best A/D Rating at B+. The rating was unchanged Thursday after a low-volume stock gain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:48:51.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
