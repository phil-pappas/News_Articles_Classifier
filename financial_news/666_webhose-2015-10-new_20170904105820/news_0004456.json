The newspaper did not specify which asset classes might be sold.\nIt said the size of the sales was expected to be about 9 billion dinars ($30 billion), as officials believed selling assets with returns of below 9 percent would be a relatively cheap method of covering the budget deficit and financing big infrastructure projects that are being planned.\nThe KIA did not respond to calls and an email seeking comment on Sunday. Some other Gulf states, principally Saudi Arabia, have already begun liquidating assets to cover their deficits in an era of cheap oil.\nAlthough Kuwait is one of the wealthiest oil exporters in the Gulf and is in no financial danger, state revenues have been hit hard this year by low oil prices.\nThe government ran a deficit of 1.094 billion dinars in the first five months of the fiscal year which started in April, after a deduction for the Future Generations Fund, which is part of its sovereign fund.\nFinance minister Anas al-Saleh said last month that the government also planned to sell local currency bonds by the end of this year to help cover its deficit.
