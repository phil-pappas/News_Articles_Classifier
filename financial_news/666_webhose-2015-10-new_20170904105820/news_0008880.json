It said on its website that it is working to provide sustainable solutions to the challenges, which, at present, prevents the company from operating.\nNo further details on a possible relaunch of flight services are available.\nThe startup launched flights between Denmark, Greenland and Iceland in June 2014 using a Fokker 100 on wet-lease from Dutch ACMI provider Denim Air, but stopped flying after just three months.\nGreenland Express has been granted permission to fly scheduled domestic services within Greenland following a government decision on April 7 this year.\nATW understands it is economically very difficult to operate an airline in Greenland. The population of 56,000 people is decreasing; around 30,000 tourists visit the world largest island. The home market is more or less at a standstill, so any passenger growth must come from the international market. Also, airlines face high taxes and airport fees in Greenland, as well as challenging operations due to harsh weather conditions and weak infrastructure at some airports.\n“Our costs are at a very good level and it will be quite hard to compete with us,” Air Greenland CCO Christian Keldsen told ATW during a recent visit in Greenland´s capital Nuuk. He said Air Greenland main competitors are charter companies and Air Iceland, which operate several routes from Iceland to Greenland.\nAir Greenland transports around 380,000 passengers per year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:27:22.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
