It is meeting the other half by liquidating foreign assets.\nThere's no immediate danger of banks running out of money to buy the bonds. Commercial banks' non-statutory deposits at the central bank plus holdings of central bank bills totalled 228 billion riyals in August, central bank data shows.\nThat's enough to cover 11 months of bond sales at the current pace without causing the banks to divert money from private sector lending.\nThe banks could bring money back from abroad; their net foreign assets totalled 219 billion riyals in August.\nBut several factors are causing banks to hold back funds, pushing up rates. One is the open-ended nature of the bond issuance programme; the finance ministry has not set any limit for it in terms of time or size. If oil stays around $50 for years, heavy government bond issuance may become a permanent feature.\nAnother problem is that bond tenors of five, seven and 10 years mean Saudi banks hold more of their assets in long-term instruments yet remain heavily dependent on short-term funding. This may increase the risk of liquidity squeezes.\n\"We expect a further widening of the structural asset maturity mismatch in the system due to our expectation of a gradual shift from shorter- to longer-term assets,\" credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said in a report last month.\n\"Saudi banks are almost entirely funded via local customer deposits that generally have less than six months' maturity and account for 74 percent of total liabilities.\"\nPressure on liquidity may increase further if the United States hikes interest rates in coming months, and if any slowdown in the Saudi economy due to cheap oil causes banks to set aside more money for bad loans.\n\"We believe that the sector's non-performing loans have bottomed out and will trend higher,\" said Mehboob. \"Historically, there is a negative relationship between oil prices and sector NPLs - thus lower oil prices will result in sector NPLs rising and higher provisions.\" ($1 = 3.7501 riyals) (Editing by Andrew Torchia/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:21:30.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
