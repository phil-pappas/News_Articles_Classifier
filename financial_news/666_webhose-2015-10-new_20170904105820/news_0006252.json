Photo: Orlando Chiodo\nThe court found Park Trent had engaged in a financial service without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence when it advised clients at their homes, at Park Trent's offices and at seminars on how to set up and maintain an SMSF and also how to invest in property through an SMSF.\nAdvertisement ASIC did not seek an order restraining Park Trent's Mr Cross, the man who, according to the court, conducted many of the seminars and drafted the power point presentations used to lure clients.\nThe court also found Mr Cross was the key decision-maker on behalf of Park Trent and the Park Trent Group as a whole.\nInvestors at seminars along the eastern seaboard were wooed with claims that property investing through SMSFs were a get rich quick scheme over a period of five years, according to court.\nAt a seminar in Melbourne in September, would-be clients were told by Mr Cross: \"Go and do the numbers and work out where your superannuation is and then take the pathway that maybe you come into the Park Trent operation and we look at setting you up with a self-managed super fund and putting a wonderful property in there that will work for you\"\nAccording to the court, Park Trent's own third party accountant warned Mr Cross in 2011 about their investment programs saying that if a Park Trent representative recommended to a client to set up an SMSF it would be \"a very serious breach of Corporations Law for Park Trent and their representatives and could result in serious financial penalties [or] incarceration.\"\nPark Trent did not follow this advice, according to the court.\nThe court found Park Trent's contraventions of the Corporations Act have influenced investors to purchase properties through SMSFs without receiving appropriate financial advice.\n\"Investors have therefore been influenced to make decisions that... expose the investors and their superannuation accounts to significant risks of financial loss (notwithstanding the optimistic projections presented to them),\" Judge Ronald Sackville said.\nHowever, Justice Sackville stopped short of restraining Park Trent from \"facilitating the purchase of investment properties by means of an SMSF\".\n\"The reason for this exclusion is that such an order might prohibit activities customarily performed by real estate agents (although Park Trent's past conduct in facilitating purchases through SMSFs has gone considerably further).\"\nJustice Sackville also noted Park Trent is \"permanently restrained .. from .. facilitating or otherwise assisting in the establishment of an SMSF by clients or the transfer of a client's superannuation accounts or balances to an SMSF.\"\nASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said the judgement demonstrated the courts, ASIC and the public \"will not tolerate this type of unscrupulous behaviour\".\n\"Property spruikers who recommend people invest in property via SMSFs, or facilitate such an investment, and who do not have an Australian financial services licence are breaking the law.\"\nPark Trent had advised 860 clients by the time ASIC filed court action against the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:34:44.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
