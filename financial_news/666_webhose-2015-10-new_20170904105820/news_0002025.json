The music streaming company says it pays out 70 per cent of revenue to rights holders. Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason ﻿\nThe world's largest music-streaming service, Spotify, has claimed that the number of artists protesting at its royalty rates is shrinking rapidly because acts are beginning to generate meaningful income from the rapidly growing streaming phenomenon.\nIn an interview with Fairfax Media, Spotify's chief revenue officer Jeff Levick also said Spotify is making its free, advertising-funded service available on more platforms in a push to attract greater numbers of listeners.\nTaylor Swift is the most high-profile pop star to have boycotted Spotify by pulling her music from the service that has changed the way many people consume music, by making vast libraries available for a low monthly – fee or free with advertising.\nMr Levick launched a robust ﻿ defence of the Swedish company's payment policies, saying the company has been good for the industry that has been ravaged by piracy.\n\"We've paid back billions of dollars into the music industry,\" he said. \"In our view, this is a revenue line that was decreasing, not increasing. We feel very strongly about what we're doing.\n\"The fact is, the music that we offer on Spotify is fully licensed from the labels; every stream generates a royalty flow back to the labels – even on the free platform.\n\"I think that, like anything that's new, there's a lot of education and a lot of misunderstanding of the new way to do things. I think what you'll find is the list of those who aren't on board is greatly decreasing and the list of supporters is greatly increasing.\"\n Rights holders get 70pc Spotify said 70 per cent of every cent it makes is redistributed to rights holders. However, rights holders can vary from labels to publishers to the artist directly.\nAt last count, Spotify had 20 million paying subscribers, who collectively contributed the vast majority of its $US1.3 billion ($1.8 million) revenues in 2014.\nSpotify has many more customers using its free version, which is funded by advertising and generates far less revenue.\nThe ad-free service has not been available on all of the platforms Spotify is on but the company has now launched a free version on the PlayStation and Google Chromecast.\nMr Levick said the move would allow advertisers to target niche markets, such as the gaming community.\n\"Instead of working with other companies and trying to create models of audiences they think might be gamers, by being able to directly target PlayStation users, we know they're actual gamers in the actual gaming environment,\" Mr Levick told Fairfax Media.\nHealthy revenue stream \"For us, the goal is to be able to have a healthy revenue stream of both free and paid [services]. On the paid side, the average revenue coming from each user is significantly higher than it would be on free because of the monthly subscription.\n\"That said, advertising is very important to us; on the free service, while it's free to consumers, there is a cost to Spotify, a royalty is generated every time someone listens to a song and our strategy to help pay for that is it being subsidised by advertising.\"\nMr Levick said Spotify was always seeking more devices on which to offer its services.\nSpotify, which launched in 2008, reported losses of $US197 million in 2014. Mr Levick said the business was still \"heavily focused on investment mode.\n\"We're not burning money; we're trying to be very smart about how we spend it. The places we're spending it are really focused on growth,\" Mr Levick said.\n\"We think right now is probably one of the most exciting times of growth in streaming. We think it's really important for us to accelerate our growth and accelerate our efforts around the world.\"\nSignificant proportion of earnings Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) chief executive Dan Rosen said streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora generate a significant proportion of most artists' earnings.\n\"My starting proposition is always that artists get more off streaming services than they do off piracy. I think as these services grow in popularity, then the pool of money grows and more people sign up to the paid model of streaming services, then the pool that can go back to the artist and labels grows,\" Mr Rosen said.\n\"It is a different way of getting your money – under the download model, it's one lump sum, [whereas with] streaming, there are smaller payments over a longer period of time. The hope is that the money grows [with both the increased] time your song is available and the number of people signing up to streaming services.\"\nMr Levick would not comment on a much-rumoured listing of Spotify.\n\"We haven't commented on IPO [initial public offering] or timings of the like. We continue to grow, we've got a lot of sophisticated investors and I'm certain at some point there will be an expectation of some form of liquidity in their investment.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/jay-z-nicki-minaj-beyonce-and-more-spark-backlash-with-promotion-of-spotify-rival-tidal-20150330-1mbm3l.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:06:35.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
