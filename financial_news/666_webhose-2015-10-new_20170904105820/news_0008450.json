The other focal point is whether U.S. wages rose enough to offset disinflationary pressures.\nDespite weakness in China, the U.S. economy and labour market have stood on more solid ground, keeping alive prospects of the Fed raising rates this year after it opted not to do so in September.\nThe dollar was steady at 120.02 yen, confined to a tight 120.60-119.245 range so far this week. The euro was flat at $1.1185, having drifted down from this week's peak of $1.1282 struck on Tuesday. The common currency was poised to lose a modest 0.2 percent this week.\n\"Fed Chair Yellen has already mentioned that labour conditions are improving and hinted that developments overseas, notably in China, and prices were chief concerns,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\n\"A very bullish report would of course have a big impact. But the Fed may not make its rates decision on employment data alone,\" he said.\nSome analysts saw commodity currencies showing a potentially bigger response to the U.S. jobs data than the majors, which have been trapped in narrow range all week.\n\"Currencies like the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars could see bigger swings against the dollar. 'China risk' has already put these currencies on the defensive, and they would look even more vulnerable if the employment data improve prospects of a U.S. rate hike,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, a market strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\nThe Canadian dollar hovered near two-week highs scaled overnight thanks to a surge in prices of crude, a major export commodity for Canada.\nThe loonie fetched C$1.3237 per dollar after hitting the two-week high of C$1.3219. The Canadian dollar fell to an 11-year low of C$1.3457 early this week when commodities including crude took heavy hits amid jitters over slowing global growth.\nAhead of the U.S. jobs data the Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7021, nudged off a one-week high of $0.7085 scaled the previous day when a release of Chinese manufacturing activity was not as bad as feared.\nThe Aussie was on track to lose about 1.5 percent this week. The currency, often used as a proxy for China trades, hit a 6-year low of $0.6892 in September when a meltdown in the Chinese stock market fanned fears of a global economic slowdown.
