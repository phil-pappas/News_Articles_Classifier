Data that comScore and Realtor.com shared shows that 64% of Americans 21 to 34 years of age visited real estate websites and mobile apps in August. That should be encouraging in a nationwide real estate market that is up 9% so far in 2015. And to some extent it is - and it isn't. \"People who believe that Millennials are disinterested in homeownership are grossly mistaken,\" says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com. \"This generation hit the job market during one of the largest recessions of all time, and they've had to work hard to establish credit and save for a downpayment. With the older segment just beginning to enjoy the life events that drive homeownership - marriage and children - now is the most appropriate time for them to consider homeownership, and that's what we're seeing.\" Smoke also points to some \"top impediments\" that \"signify significant barriers of entry\" for younger homebuyers, although he thinks the younger can set can overcome those challenges. \"Despite the increased role of Millennials in the housing market, setbacks still exist and are preventing first timers from making even more of an impact,\" he says. Among other barriers, Smoke says 37% of Millennials can't find a home that meets their budget; 28% can't come up with a decent downpayment, and 40% haven't found a home that meets their needs. Not helping matters are tougher mortgage rules from the U.S. Federal Housing Administration, which will factor in student loan debt when considering home mortgage applicants. With an average student loan balance of $27,000 for Americans 40-and-younger, that's a problem for many Millennial homebuyers. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:58:52.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
