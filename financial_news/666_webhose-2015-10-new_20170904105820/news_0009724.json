Not surprisingly, technology is the most represented sector on the list, followed by health care and consumer discretionary stocks. \nThe Secular Growth Stocks list is compiled both quantitatively -- the investment firm first scans its coverage list for buy or hold rated stocks with at least 15% expected earnings-per-share growth for the three years through 2017 as well as 10% expected revenue growth in the same time frame. Analysts are then asked to pick stocks that they had a \"high conviction\" for \"secular growth\" characteristics, regardless of the economy and including some stocks that fall outside of the original screen. \n\"We now have a modest bias for Growth over Value,\" Morgan Stanley analysts reiterated in the Oct. 7 note. \"Earnings and revenue growth expectations for Value stocks are negative, but very positive for Growth. This is not due exclusively to Energy; expectations for Growth ex-Energy are actually lower.\" More Headlines 11 Companies to Invest In If You Are Optimistic About Driverless Cars \nSince the list's inception (September 20, 2010) the basket is up 128% vs. +89.9% for the S&P 500. Over the past year, the basket has outperformed the S&P 500 by 630 basis points. \n\"We believe that the names selected for this report can grow strongly even if the global economy grows more slowly than our current GDP forecasts. Indeed, growth stocks on the whole tend to be less impacted by cyclical forces, one of the reasons that, over time, they generally beat estimates while value stocks generally miss,\" the report said. \nHere's the 16 tech stocks from Morgan Stanley's growth basket, paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nExpected Revenue Growth 2014-2017: 13% Expected EPS Growth 2014-2017: 20% \nMorgan Stanley Rating/Price Target: Overweight/$155 \nMorgan Stanley said: We see premium pricing, high usage, repeat purchases, and category expansion as reasons AAPL should trade more in line with platform stocks longer term. We see both near- and long-term catalysts that would drive this re-rating. In the near term, the combination of accelerating upgrades, more attractive financing/leasing plans, and continued growth in China should drive iPhone growth ahead of more bearish investor expectations for flat shipments. Longer term, we see several large markets where Apple is likely to capture incremental value, including wearables, TV, and potentially automobiles - with the combined size of these markets over 3x Apple's current addressable market. \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 over the same period. Although other factors naturally played a role, the company's strong earnings growth was key. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. APPLE INC has improved earnings per share by 44.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, APPLE INC increased its bottom line by earning $6.43 versus $5.66 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.13 versus $6.43). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has greatly exceeded that of the S&P 500, but is less than that of the Computers & Peripherals industry average. The net income increased by 37.8% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $7,748.00 million to $10,677.00 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 36.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 32.5%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. Current return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. When compared to other companies in the Computers & Peripherals industry and the overall market, APPLE INC's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500.
