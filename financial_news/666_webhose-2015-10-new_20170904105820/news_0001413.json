HSA Contribution Limit For Two Plans Or Mid-Year Changes by Harry Sit on Leave a Comment \nWe all know that to be able to contribute to an HSA you need to have an HSA-eligible high deductible health plan (HDHP) and no other coverage. The HSA contribution limit looks quite straight-forward at first glance. There’s one limit for individual coverage, and there’s another limit for family coverage, which is about double the limit for individual coverage, give-or-take. If you are 55 or older, there’s an extra $1,000 catch-up. \nSo far so good if you have just one health plan throughout the entire year. It gets more complicated when you are married and the two of you are on different health plans. It gets yet more complicated when your health insurance changes mid-year. The insurance change could be due to a job change, marriage or divorce, enrolling in Medicare, birth of a child, and so on. \nExample 1 : Husband has HDHP covering himself. Wife has non-HDHP insurance from her own employer. Wife quits mid-year and husband adds her to his HDHP. \nExample 2 : Husband and wife have HDHP covering both of them (no kids). Husband enrolls in Medicare mid-year. Wife continues HDHP for just herself. \nWhat’s the HSA contribution limit in these situations? \nBefore we continue, it’ll be easier if we understand some ground rules. No Joint HSA \nAlthough there is a higher contribution limit for family coverage and, once contributed, the money in the HSA can be used to cover eligible medical expenses incurred by anyone in the family, the HSA is in one individual’s name only . There is no joint HSA. Each person’s eligibility to contribute to his or her HSA is determined separately. \nThis is probably the most important part in understanding the HSA contribution limit. Once you drill this into your head, everything else becomes easy. No HDHP Coverage = No Contribution \nBecause it’s an individual account, only the person who has HDHP coverage can contribute. Suppose the dad covers himself and kids in a family HDHP and the mom has her own non-HDHP coverage. Only the dad can contribute to an HSA in his name (at the family coverage level). If the mom is over 55, she’s not able to contribute her $1,000 catch-up because she doesn’t have HDHP coverage. Age 55 Catch-Up In Own Account \nAgain, because an HSA is in one individual’s name, the person who is 55 or over can contribute the catch-up only to his or her own account if he or she is eligible for a contribution to begin with. If both husband and wife are 55 or over, they must have separate accounts if they want to contribute the maximum. Both Covered By Family HDHP = Split Contribution \nIf both husband and wife are covered in a family HDHP, they can split the family-level HSA contribution limit between the two of them however they want. It can be 100% into one person’s HSA, 50:50 into separate HSAs in each person’s name, or anywhere in between. It would be easier to understand if you simply split 50:50. 2 Self-Only Plans Are Not Family Coverage \nOn the other hand, if husband and wife each has their own self-only HDHP, they can only contribute to two separate HSAs in their own names at the individual level. They can’t contribute at the family coverage level to just one person’s HSA. Month-By-Month Prorate \nFinally, when insurance coverage changes mid-year, you break it down month-by-month. You fill out a table like this: Husband", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:46:54.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
