Philip Castle, apcagency.com.au by Dan Thawley The final days of the Paris Fashion Week calendar not only hold some of the biggest blockbuster productions, but also a handful of collections designed by crucial innovators – designers whose minds search considerably further than fashion and aesthetics to express their point of view. Faced with commercial pressures to perform, stretching the mindset of product-focused buyers and trend-savvy editors is not an enviable task, but when achieved can successfully transcend the vapid connotations of such an image-based industry. The Spring 2016 season saw this phenomenon achieved in differing measures and with differing means, as everyone from Karl Lagerfeld to Iris van Herpen explored what it means to dress women in 2016 and perhaps far beyond.\nSince the 1980s Karl Lagerfeld has spun success at Chanel through his clever twists – the subversion of classics and his appropriation of streetwear into the luxury sphere. Lagerfeld's latest Grand Palais extravaganza centred around the recreation of an airline terminal, Chanel Airlines if you will, projecting his fashion message through a utopian airport setting. With uniformed attendants at hand, Lagerfeld's models walked the runway with quilted suitcases (some girls held a micro-sized trolley as an evening clutch) and long, slim iterations of the Chanel tweed suit cut into brightly coloured checks and wing-shaped jacquard patterns. Tessellated origami evening wear came layered with flared denim, full ruched skirts, and baseball caps, making for a rather heady styling shall certainly have heads turning in the first class lounge come February.\nLater in the same day, the Dutch designer Iris van Herpen exhibited almost equally mind-blowing feats of craftsmanship as Chanel, although instead her runway featured an unnerving altar where Game of Thrones actress Gwendoline Christie (that's Brienne of Tarth, in case you were wondering) lay beneath a fine mesh dress crafted from laser-cut and 3D-printed textiles. Like an ominous totem, Christie's outfit set the tone for Van Herpen's most romantically beautiful collection to date, which channelled her experiments with architecture, science and technology into incredibly fine, diaphanous lace structures that shivered with transparencies, Swarovski crystals, and metallic reflections.\nOne could almost draw parallels between Van Herpen's work and some pieces that Nicholas Ghesquière sculpted for Louis Vuitton the day after, however ultimately they represent drastically different things. Whilst Van Herpen has the luxury of being an independent designer immersed in avant-garde expression, Ghesquiere is the artistic director of a global fashion powerhouse, and his clothes need to translate to a much, much wider audience. Since arriving at Louis Vuitton he has been weaning his public onto the more conceptual elements of his design language, and last Wednesday's collection was his most powerful and daring evolution to date, marrying a barrage of historical and urban references in a startling mix of colour and texture that read bohemian, tribal, romantic, athletic, and cyberpunk all at once. There has never been any doubt to Ghesquière's radicalism, but when one begins to describe and unpeel the layers of detailing buried within these designs (from the airbrush prints, to fringe, ruffled cotton, monogram leather…) it becomes clear that he is one of a handful of designers working today who are adept at expressing a truly postmodern view on fashion design.\nA model wears a creation for Vivienne Westwood's Spring-Summer 2016 ready-to-wear fashion collection, presented during the Paris Fashion Week in Paris, Saturday Oct. 3, 2015. AP Another is most certainly Miuccia Prada, who's Miu Miu show traditionally closes fashion month with a tainted, girlish view on dressing up. This season she remixed an opulent treasure trove of vintage tropes that summed up many of the seasons leitmotifs – negligee silks worn under (or in some cases over) scaled gingham and optical jacquard suiting, a generous shoulder silhouette, and lashings of leather, fur, and feathers that played up 'naughty' against her many layers of \"nice\". A trio of gothic-illustrated silk dresses and blouses by Japanese artist Eri Wakiyama added a rich historical subtext to the collection, featuring imaginary flowers, cigarette lighters, and dripping candles. Though Miu Miu certainly harboured little in the way of \"futuristic\" fashion, it did hint at the haphazard way that girls today are creating their own stories out of the past, piecing together references they find on the Internet, perhaps.\nThe house of Balenciaga may soon find itself similarly in tune, what with the announcement that very morning of Alexander Wang's successor at the house – Georgian-born, Antwerp-trained Demna Gvasalia, whose own label Vetements has made serious headway of late for its rogue, streetwear spirit. Spurred on by the same anonymous, collective power that Gvasalia operated under in his prior role at Maison Margiela (before a stint at Louis Vuitton), he has promoted gender-neutrality, street casting, and casual, quiet luxury until today. Let's give him the time he deserves to work out what that might mean for the storied house of a Spanish couturier in Paris.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:07:19.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
