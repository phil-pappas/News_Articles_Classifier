But, overall loan impairment expenses were down 14 per cent to $74 million. \nBoQ's cash earnings after tax for the 12 months to August 31, most banks' preferred measure of performance, increased 19 per cent to $357 million. \nThe bank attributed the improvement to a 15 basis point rise in net interest margins - the profit it makes on loans - to 1.97 per cent, mostly due to the higher margin BOQ Specialist service it acquired from Investec in 2014. \nThe professional finance unit generated cash earnings of $43 million, beating guidance of $38 million by almost 13 per cent. \n\"BoQ has now delivered record results for five successive halves, a significant achievement in an environment of low growth and changing regulations,\" Mr Sutton said. \n\"Though we have more work to do ... we remain a bank that has come a long way in recent years and we are confident that we are well positioned for sustainable growth into the future.\" \nMr Sutton forecast further \"solid returns\" for shareholders. \nBank of Queensland shares were up 90.5 cents at $12.515. \nBULLISH BANK OF QUEENSLAND \n* Net profit up 22pct to $318m \n* Revenue up 16pct to $1.088b \n* Fully-franked final dividend up four cents to 38 cents @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook BoQ hopes to benefit from Qld house prices AAP \nBank of Queensland hopes to benefit from the house price boom outside its home state after it announced a record â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:45:37.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
