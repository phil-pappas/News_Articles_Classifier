Acting national police commissioner Phahlane was thrown right into the thick of things on Wednesday as he was immediately put to work by Parliament's police committee, which had been in the middle of a meeting with Phiyega when the Presidency announced her suspension. Phahlane, who earlier in the day had briefed the committee on the status of forensics in the SAPS, was sitting in the seat vacated by Phiyega two hours after she was suspended, directing staff to answer questions. Phahlane, who is currently the divisional commissioner for forensic services at the SAPS, was announced as the new acting commissioner just minutes after President Jacob Zuma suspended Phiyega. Phiyega will remain on suspension with full pay until the board of inquiry investigating her fitness to hold office has completed its work. Committee chairperson, Francois Beukman, welcomed Phalane to his new position and reiterated the committee's pledge to work with him.
