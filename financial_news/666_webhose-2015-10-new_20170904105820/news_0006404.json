It's a store. Its latest approach involves partnering with retailers to turn shops into dual-purpose banking hubs. The newly conceived physical solution is rolling out across Germany.

The retailer is in the process of reissuing all its REDcard credit and debit cards to chip and PIN cards.

Target suffered a massive date breach at the end of 2013, which exposed the personal information of up to 70 million shoppers. The company offers three types of cards: credit and debit cards that are only accepted at Target, and a co-branded card through MasterCard that can be used anywhere.
