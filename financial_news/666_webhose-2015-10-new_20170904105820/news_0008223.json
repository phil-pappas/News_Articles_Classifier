The company launched a £1bn rights issue to help fund the purchase and some analysts questioned the price being paid. \nHowever Babcock said that the experience of servicing helicopters after taking over Avincis helped it to secure the Navy deal. \nBabcock also said that its contract to service and store the Army’s light weapons and vehicles had been enlarged after “successfully meeting an early milestone in the service provision”. As a result the company will take on further responsibilities. \nPeter Rogers, Babcock chief executive, said: “We are delighted to continue to grow our partnership with the MoD, both in the air and on the ground. Babcock is committed to delivering the improved performance levels, enhanced operational capability and increased cost effectiveness which are critical for our customers.” \nIn December last year the company struck a 10-year contract with the MoD to take over maintaining British Army equipment. The blue-chip company paid £140m for the Defence Support Group’s land business, a Government Trading Fund owned by MoD that maintained the Armed Forces’ equipment. \nAt the time Babcock estimated that providing maintenance, overhaul, repair and storage for vehicles such as Warrior armoured personnel carriers and Challenger (Hamburg: 4SE.HM - news ) tanks would generate revenues of about £2bn over the contact’s 10-year duration. There is also an option for the contract to be extended by five years. \nLast year the company had annual revenues of £4bn and made a pre-tax profit of £313m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:29:33.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
