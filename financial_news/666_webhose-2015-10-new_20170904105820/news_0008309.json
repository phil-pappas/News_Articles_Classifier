Picture: THE TIMES Related articles LETTER: Free education pricey LETTER: Students get repaid LETTER: Academics don’t follow own advice LETTER: Rectifying by refund LETTER: Money grows on trees THE central argument in Sean Archer’s letter (Free education pricey, October 20) is correct: state aid to students should be loans, not grants (which was the original National Student Financial Aid Scheme formula) until the government has first provided all primary and high schools with libraries, laboratories, toilets and qualified maths teachers.\nWits University vice-chancellor Adam Habib has made a similar argument. It gives added weight to the Archer-Habib solution of loans not grants that student numbers have doubled since we became a democracy, and the National Development Plan proposes to triple current numbers.\nThe Treasury does not have funds for the extra burden. As it is, university library-purchasing budgets often become the soft targets of desperate university cost-cutting.\nWe might qualify slightly when Mr Archer’s letter says, \"Thirty years ago in Australia, (people asked) why should bus drivers pay for the education of lawyers?\"\nThe proportion of black South African graduates who have to support retrenched parents and unemployed siblings is far higher than in the case of Australian lawyers. Such support must be rationed when it has to be shared with monthly repayments to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.\nThe second reason is that the world has changed in 30 years, with qualification creep.\nAn increasing proportion of nurses now graduate from universities not colleges, but this does not reduce the ratio between doctors’ and nurses’ salaries. Increasing numbers of police and prison warders study for the B Criminology degree, but this never gives them the remuneration of lawyers.\nStill, SA’s financial plight often requires trade-offs and second-best solutions, not only in post-matric education funding.\nKeith Gottschalk\nClaremont", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:29:53.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
