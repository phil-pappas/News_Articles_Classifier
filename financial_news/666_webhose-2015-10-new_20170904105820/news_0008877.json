Franklin Templeton Investments Chairman Mark Mobius says he’s already hunting for bargains among Brazilian stocks that are near their cheapest since 2000. Gam UK Ltd. investment manager Tim Love has ratcheted up holdings of Brazil banks in his portfolio “on valuation grounds alone.” And Solitaire Aquila Ltd. portfolio manager Patrik Kauffmann said he sees an opportunity in beat-up bonds from oil producer Petrobras and state-development bank BNDES.\nTheir cautious optimism -- while hardly the consensus -- marks a shift in market sentiment in a nation battered by a sweeping corruption scandal and political infighting amid overall anemic appetite for risky assets worldwide. The benchmark index Friday continued its longest winning streak in two years, sending stocks up 12 percent in nine days. The real, the world’s worst performing currency in 2015, is on course to post its best weekly gain since February 2011.\n“As always, when the market remains in a vicious circle, it’s difficult to spot the exact bottom,” said Love, who helps oversee $130 billion in assets at Gam in London. “However, we are definitely in the zone.\"\nKey to the debate is whether a Rousseff ouster would be good or bad for Brazil. Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd. says an impeachment could be positive for asset prices in Brazil -- but only initially. Certainly, the possibility of Rousseff being kicked out of office is no longer being seen by some investors as the dooms-day trigger it once was.\n“It’s no longer a disaster scenario,” Klaus Spielkamp, the head of fixed income at asset management and investment banking firm Bulltick LLC, said from Miami.\nStill, the “long-winded and acrimonious” impeachment process would ensure any asset bounce could be “short-lived,” Aviva money manager Daniel Klusmann, who oversees $2.2 billion in emerging-market debt, said from London.\nRousseff moved a step closer to impeachment when an audit court recommended late Wednesday that Congress reject her 2014 budget accounting amid allegations her government broke fiscal laws to hide a deficit. The government will demonstrate she did nothing wrong, the presidency said in an e-mailed statement after the ruling was announced. The next day, Lower House President Eduardo Cunha said he had received two new impeachment requests, bringing the total to eight.\nStocks on the IBrX Index, which includes the top 100 securities on the Sao Paulo exchange, were traded at an average 1.15 times their book value Sept. 28, the lowest ratio since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two-thirds of the stocks on the Ibovespa benchmark trade at a price-to-forecast earnings ratio that’s lower than their global peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nBrazil’s stock market and the real have posted short-lived rallies at other points this year, only to turn around and continue to slide. Brazil’s outlook is still very negative even as stocks get a bounce from bargain hunters and the real benefits from bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off on raising rates, according to Marcel Kussaba, an analyst at asset management firm Quantitas, which manages $5.3 billion in assets.\nUnemployment has crept up to 8.6 percent, inflation is running at almost 10 percent and the economy is forecast to contract almost 3 percent this year.\n“We have to separate what has happened in recent days from the medium-term trend,” he said from Porto Alegre, Brazil. “There’s still a lot of uncertainties in the scenario, and we can’t yet say if Brazilian stocks are cheap enough.”\nAs Brazil’s political soap opera unfolds, markets will remain volatile, said Kauffmann, the asset manager who helps oversee $11.2 billion of assets at Solitaire Aquila. Lower House President Cunha, a critic of Rousseff’s, said he will likely decide to accept or deny the remaining impeachment requests by early next week.\nThe volatility and uncertainty over a possible Rousseff ouster -- not to mention concern over slowing growth in China and whether a recent commodities rally can be sustained -- will continue to make it tough to call the bottom in Brazil. Kauffmann said he’s still going to try.\n“If you see value and a lot of bad news already priced in, you need to consider increasing your exposure progressively,” said Kauffmann, who has recently increased his holdings of securities from BNDES, state-run oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA and chemicals maker Braskem SA. “Once the clouds are gone and the sun shining, there will be no value left.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:00:15.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
