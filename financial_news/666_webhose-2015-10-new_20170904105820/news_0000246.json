Once the audit report is out we will decide on how much money we will be giving to the company,” said another state-run bank official.\nLenders had agreed to give additional funds to the debt-laden company but asked the promoters to bring in some equity first.\n“We have made it clear to the promoters led by Arvind Dhamm, that they need to bring in some equity first and accordingly we will give them funds,” a public-sector banker had earlier told PTI.\nAmtek Group owes over Rs 26,000 crore to 32 banks including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and UCO Bank, among others.\nBanks have an exposure of around Rs 8,000 crore to Amtek Auto, which is the flagship of the Amtek Group.\nAgainst this, its FY 2014-15 revenue stood Rs 20,000 crore.\nThe company, which has global presence, is in urgent need of a liquidity infusion of Rs 800 crore to redeem foreign bonds.\nTrouble mounted for the company after leading fund manager JP Morgan Mutual Fund in August restricted withdrawals from two of its funds.\nJP Morgan restricted withdrawal of two of its debt schemes — the short term income fund and India treasury fund — which have a collective exposure of about Rs 200 crore in Amtek Auto.\nMajority of these lenders have exposure in form of term loans, while others have by way of bond subscriptions.\nLast month, Amtek Auto had said it was considering selling some assets to overcome the financial crisis.\n“As of date, the company is considering various means to de-leverage the balance sheet, including selling of non-core business, minority stake in overseas companies and some industrial real estate assets within the business,” the company had said in a BSE filing last month.\nIn September, the promoters of the Delhi-based company had infused Rs 75 crore to mitigate the “temporary cash flow mismatch”.\nThe promoters also said that they will infuse more funds in future if required.\nThe company had attributed the financial stress to the current market scenario “which caused decline in the sales and profit margins of the company”.\nAs the crisis deepened, global rating agency S&P in September cut Amtek Global’s, its Singapore-based international arm’s credit ratings, citing “heightened liquidity risks” at its parent Amtek Auto.\n“The downgrade reflects heightened liquidity risks at India-based parent company Amtek Auto.\n“We see a risk that Amtek Auto may not have sufficient liquidity to meet its interest or debt obligations, which could lead to a default at Amtek Auto, or a debt restructuring,” S&P Rating had said.\nThe group is also under the Sebi scanner after it has been found that its subsidiary Castex Technologies allegedly manipulated share prices.\nDuring the crisis, the Amtek counter had fallen by 70 per cent, following exchange decision to exclude the company’s F&O contracts from equity derivatives segment, with effect from October 30.\nOn September 3 alone, the Amtek Auto counter had crashed 35 per cent.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 3:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:50:03.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
