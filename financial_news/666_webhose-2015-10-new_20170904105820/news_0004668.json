Virginia Star Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Commonwealth Bank of Australia's rise in home loan rates lit up currency trading desks on Thursday afternoon, sending the dollar plunging half a cent, as traders bet the move will raise pressure on the Reserve Bank to ease monetary policy.\nThe Australian currency experienced its first major action of the day when the Commonwealth Bank followed Westpac to raise it rates for variable home loans. It lifted by 15 basis points rather than 20 as Westpac did, but the dollar plunged half a cent to the day's low of US71.8¢.\nGroup executive for Retail Banking Services Matt Comyn​ attributed the decision to the recent financial system Inquiry leading to a reassessment of the bank's home loan rates.\nWhile the reaction was stark, the dollar had been dropping slightly for most of the day, as more doubts emerged about Chinese demand for iron ore and a strengthening US dollar.\nA robust NAB quarterly business sentiment survey couldn't buoy the Aussie.\n\"The quarterly survey confirms the trend improvement in current conditions in the non-mining economy, while the outlook is also looking notably better,\" NAB chief economist Alan Oster said.\n\"Lower interest rates and currency depreciation appear to be having the desired effects.\"\nHowever the major influences on the Aussie's trading price were already pointing it lower: the strengthening US dollar and further evidence of China's waning appetite for iron ore.\n \"The move down in Australian dollar looks to have been triggered by comments from a People's Bank of China policy adviser, Bai Chongen, who stated that China shouldn't stretch to maintain a 7 per cent growth in the future and that China was investing too much in infrastructure,\" Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency analyst Elias Haddad said.\nThe combination of these comments appeared to rule out any lingering hopes the Chinese steel industry, and therefore the Australian iron ore industry, could be the beneficiaries of a stimulus from central authorities in Beijing.\n\"The impression of softer Chinese demand is a negative for commodity prices, and underpins our lower medium-term Australian and New Zealand-dollar outlooks,\" Mr Haddad said.\nOversupplied iron ore market Most analysts are forecasting little to no chance of a short-term rally in iron ore as major miners are producing record levels of iron ore that is entering an already-oversupplied market.\nGlobal mining giants such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Vale have all reported increased supply despite the fact the engine of the steel economy, China's infrastructure boom, is cooling.\n\"This continued focus on de-bottlenecking and improving efficiencies at current operations is keeping supply growth strong and likely to keep downward pressure on prices,\" ANZ analysts said.\n\"Following the decline yesterday, pressure has remained on the Australian dollar.\"\nThe pressure is nothing new. The Australian dollar has lost 17.6 per cent in the past12 months, shedding 15¢ to drop from US87.8¢.\nMost forecasts have the dollar falling further, to US68¢ by the end of 2015 and US65¢ by the end of 2016.\nOn Thursday, the world's largest trader, Citigroup, likened the dollar's recent performance and near-term future to 1998 when the previouscommodity boom slowed.\n\"When you look at Australia, the dynamics that are probably likely more important are the commodity complex itself and what commodities will do,\" managing director of currency strategy Thomas Fitzpatrick said.\n\"When the dust settles and that might take some time, we're going to see an Australian dollar closer to US60¢ than to US70¢.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:06:13.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
