John Shakespeare Share on twitter by Christopher Joye The shocks keep on coming. First, \" Grexit \", then the China crash, followed by the US Federal Reserve's anxiety-inducing failure to lift rates , the global ructions caused by the extraordinary Volkswagon scandal and, in the final days of September, Glencore's apparent implosion , which triggered a 4 per cent, single-day loss in Australia's resource-exposed equities.\nWith so much confusing noise and exogenous event risk that cannot be controlled, it pays to focus on fundamentals. And there is nothing more fundamentally important than the performance of the US economy. It is the world's largest and the most influential marginal price-setter across financial markets, including Australian equities and bonds. Understanding where this $17 trillion behemoth is heading is, therefore, crucial to the outlook for all portfolios.\nOne of the most striking features of the current US cycle is the rapid rise and sharp fall in the jobless rate from a recent nadir of 4.4 per cent in 2007 to 10.0 per cent in 2009 and then back down to just 5.1 per cent today. Looking over US data since the end of the Second World War, another fact jumps out at you: the inevitability of the fluctuations in the business cycle, notwithstanding the belief that policymakers can mitigate, if not eliminate, its extremities.\nIf we measure a recession not by the usual yardstick of two quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product but rather by an increase in the jobless rate of 1.5 percentage points or more, there have been 9 downturns since 1950, or about 1.4 recessions every decade.\nPerhaps policymakers have succeeded in elongating business cycles, given the frequency of recessions seems to have shrunk to about one per decade over the past 35 years. On the other hand, the amplitude of the downturns has increased: the average 4.2 percentage point rise in the jobless rate since the 1980s is 1.5 times greater than the 2.7 per cent average between the 1950s and 1970s.\nJudged by the peak unemployment rate, the global financial crisis (10.0 per cent) was the worst recession the US has endured since the 1982 contraction (10.8 per cent). As a consequence of unprecedented government stimulus, we've also experienced the second-largest fall in the US jobless rate in the past 65 years (specifically, 4.9 percentage points versus 5.8 percentage points in 1982).\nFed not remotely close to unwinding Of course, the Fed has not come remotely close to unwinding its stimulus even though its chair, Janet Yellen, conceded in September that the labour market is all but fully employed. In particular, Yellen said the Fed now believes the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) – the level below which you start getting price pressures – is about 4.9 per cent, or only 0.2 percentage points beneath its current mark. And yet short-term interest rates remain near zero.\n Another reliable characteristic of the US economy is the causal relationship between labour market tightness and underlying, or \"core\", inflation. After you hit full employment, consumer prices inflate more rapidly. A wrinkle is that the NAIRU is constantly shifting and nobody really knows where this line in the sand currently lies.\nThe good news is that since central banks began explicitly targeting inflation in the 1990s, there has been a clear reduction in both the level and volatility of consumer price movements. This is because central banks' inflation-fighting credentials have come to be accepted by both financial markets and the community. Surveys of long-term inflation expectations have been well-anchored during booms and busts.\nOne of the greatest investment questions of our time is whether we see the return of high and volatile US inflation as the Fed injects excessive stimulus and pushes its jobless rate below the NAIRU. In September, Yellen revealed that the Fed is engaged in precisely this experiment: \"A modest decline in the unemployment rate below its long-run [4.9 per cent] level for a time would, by increasing resource utilisation … have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 per cent inflation,\" Yellen said. It sounds so easy with no unanticipated consequences, including distorted resource allocation and financial system imbalances, in sight.\nWith a still-modest labour force participation rate and elevated part-time employment, there are reasons to believe the US NAIRU may have dropped, which means it might take a jobless rate with a 3-handle in front of it before bona fide price pressures materialise. Based on the rate of decrease since January 2014, I estimate that event is likely 15 months away.\nBut when the day arrives, it could be profoundly important if the Fed is forced to junk the prevailing \"low rates for long\" mantra, which has become a defining bedrock in most portfolios. This is why, while everyone thinks the inflation bogeyman is dead, you should be incorporating a hedge.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:07:31.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
