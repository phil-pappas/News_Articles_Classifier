Italians are quite formal at the table. They give themselves time to get together, time to eat, and time to digest their food. Alla Fratelli, Murdoch books by Barry McDonald\nShop like an Italian Comprare come un Italiano\nNobody goes to the market in Italy with a shopping list, unless they're shopping for a wedding. They don't need a list, because they have their eyes. They can see for themselves what's best, and they can tell what's in season because there's lots of it.\nCavolo nero and mushrooms and truffles in winter. Strawberries and peaches in summer. They use their noses, too. Even the fish section in a good market smells good, with a fabulous fresh, ocean smell. I remember walking along a market aisle in Florence one day and being hit with this intensely sweet smell, as if I'd walked into a flower farm. It took me three more metres to find out it was coming from a tiny stall of wild strawberries. Now, when the Kensington Pride mangoes from Bowen in Queensland are on, I always put a pallet of them right in the doorway of Fratelli Fresh. The smell drives people crazy.\nJust when you start worrying that there's no food to be seen at an Italian lunch, out will come a platter of this, or a bowl of that. And that's just for starters. Alla Fratelli, Murdoch Books Italians like to shop for the day, and not for the week. So they go to the same shops and the same market stalls every morning; they say hello, have a coffee. It's a social outing as well as a shopping trip. It keeps them alive, keeps them young.\nLike market shoppers everywhere, they haggle, but they don't haggle about price – they haggle about quality. They point to the exact piece of fruit or vegetable that they want, and simply won't settle for anything else. What they don't do in Italy is touch and prod and squeeze the fruit and vegetables. As the sign says, \" Si prega di non toccare la merce esposta .\" Please don't touch the merchandise.\nAnd once they know what they're going to buy, they know what they're going to cook.\nThere's a symbiotic relationship between Italians and markets. I head straight for the markets when I'm travelling in Italy, before I go to any art galleries or museums. They're my churches; I feel at home there, as if I know the people already. And even though I'm staying in hotels, I can't help but buy bunches of tiny, scented basil, a donkey salami, a bag of wild mushrooms, just because I can.\nIt's important to shop for the day, and not for the week. It's a social outing as well as a shopping trip. Alla Fratelli, Murdoch Books The Mercato Centrale in Florence, the amazing Neo-Gothic Rialto Market in Venice, the beautiful Campo dei Fiore in Rome… they're not tourist attractions, but wheeling, dealing parts of Italian daily life.\nSlower start for morning markets In Australia, you get to the wholesale market at 4am or everything will be gone. But Italy doesn't get up that early. At the Campo dei Fiore, for instance, things don't kick off until about 7am. So I always get there too early, but it gives me a chance to catch the setting-up, which is fascinating. All these little cobblestone streets that converge onto the piazza and the stallholders coming in from every direction with their carts and their three-wheeled scooter trucks loaded high with wooden boxes and plastic crates. It's mayhem, as they're setting up and raising the canopies and waiters from the nearby cafes come rushing in with trays of coffee, yet it works.\nFamilies run a lot of the stalls. First you see the kids, then you see the parents, and then finally the grandmother turns up. You can tell these people have been doing this forever. They are absolutely meticulous in their preparation. I watch as they peel back their lettuces, check over their fruit and trim the artichokes ready for sale. Every piece of fruit is placed individually. It really is an art.\nI remember one woman who was selling parsley at so much per 100 grams. She was breaking off bunches, putting it on the scales, taking one sprig off, putting two on, until it was spot on. All this effort for something like 20 cents.\nBy 1.30pm, the market is winding down and the council trucks move in. The cleaning-up operation is like a finely honed military exercise, in contrast to the mayhem of setting up. The nearby cafes start putting out their chairs, and the local kids often drift into the square to play football.\nAt night, the place is a party, and the piazza turns into a kind of natural amphitheatre as the street musicians and performers come to entertain all the al fresco diners. Then there is an hour or two of silence, before the carts and the trucks and the whole thing starts all over again. There's a rhythm to it all.\nI don't go to the wholesale markets every day any more, but what you learn never leaves you. I can't walk past a display without checking it, improving it. I have to stop myself rearranging the apples in the supermarket.\nWhen you're in the business, you can tell when things aren't as fresh as they seem, because you know all the tricks. You can tell when the tired bits have been cut away or when the asparagus has been trimmed back. The real give-away is the radicchio. In a lot of markets, you can come back every day and watch the radicchio get smaller and smaller and smaller as they trim off the dead leaves. So clever shoppers go where the turnover is greatest, not smallest.\nIf I had to give people advice on shopping, it would be to use your eyes, ears and nose, not just your hands. Over time, you get a feel for great produce; it stands out, it ticks all the boxes and you know you just have to have it.\nEat like an Italian Mangiare come un Italiano I love how when you turn up to lunch at an Italian friend's place, there's no food to be seen.\nJust as you start to get worried, a dish of olives comes out and you have a bit of a nibble on them. Then someone gets up and disappears and comes back with a platter of finely sliced prosciutto or bresaola, and maybe some crisp, thin grissini.\nMore time goes by, and more talk, then out comes a bowl of roasted red peppers or eggplant under vinegar. Maybe some bread, maybe not. Some ripe figs, or crisp pears, depending on the season. A hunk of cheese.\nBy this time, you're quite happy to have a coffee and go home. That, of course, is when they bring out the big, steaming bowls of pasta. And that's just the primi , the first course.\nAfter that, often quite some time after that, comes the secondo , or main course, which is usually really, really simple: just some meat in its own cooking juices, or a whole grilled fish and a salad. The secondo is usually accompanied by contorni , or side dishes. Maybe there'll be a bowl of tender white beans on the side, tossed with rosemary and gleaming with rich extra virgin olive oil.\nAfter that, there might be a bowl of fruit, or a little slice of cake with an oily black espresso coffee. Then just when you think you should be getting going, a little silver tray of glasses will appear with a lethal homemade liqueur that will blow your head off. And some crunchy little biscotti.\nItalians don't really believe in breakfast (you can see why). It's usually a cup of coffee taken with a little pastry, a cornetto (croissant) or a cigarette. They still smoke in Italy.\nSunday lunch at mum's Lunch is traditionally the main meal of the day, and dinner is often lighter and simpler. The old custom of the man leaving work in the middle of the day and calling his stay-at-home wife to put the water on for the pasta is dying out now. But there is still the ritual of the Sunday family lunch at home. Apparently, only 5 per cent of Italians eat out on a Sunday; instead, they all go to their mother's. And of course, there's la passeggiata , the slow stroll after the meal, in equal parts to aid the digestion and to check out what everyone's wearing on the street.\nIn Italy, it's as much about how you eat as what you eat. Italians are quite formal at the table; they take care of their elders, and make the kids welcome. If you sit and watch an Italian family at the table, you'll see there's a lot of touching, hugging and kissing, a lot of eye contact, a lot of respect for each other. They give themselves time to get together, time to eat, and time to digest their food.\nI reckon a lot of the real benefits of the Mediterranean diet are as much due to taking this time, as they are to the use of olive oil and the popularity of grains and greens. I also think that Italians really benefit – they have one of the longest life spans in the world – by simply being passionate about their food and wine. Ars vivendi – it's the art of living your life with passion.\nWhen you prioritise something like food and wine so strongly, you don't let your standards slip into eating junk food or drinking too much. We're so lucky in Australia to be surrounded by so much good food and so many options that we take it for granted.\nBut you can tell, behind every Italian's big personality and big, generous table, there's a tiny, tiny fear that the good life will be taken away from them, that life could one day be hard, and that nothing should be taken for granted. It's this sense of history that makes them appreciate good food and wine. So much of their connection to food is through festivals and religious days and family; it's very celebratory, as if every day will be their last.\nIt won't be, of course, but it means they make the most of everything that comes their way.\nDrink like an Italian Bere come un Italiano In all my trips to Italy and hanging around in bars – doing important research – I don't think I've ever seen an Italian who has had too much to drink.\nItalians seem to treat alcohol as a special occasion, even if that special occasion happens every single day. Nobody drinks to get drunk. Glasses are small, not large. Drinking is always seen as an integral part of eating and being with other people, rather than as a substitute for either. There's no showing off, just a clear understanding that wine is a part of life.\nThe best way to drink like an Italian is to know your befores and afters.\nBefore the meal, the aperitivo reigns supreme, and after the meal, the digestivo takes over. There are serious reasons for both: one to stimulate the gastric juices before the stomach has to digest the food; and the latter to help with the digestive process.\nI haven't seen any research on the scientific proof of either theory, but I'm not convinced that's important. It just makes sense.\nThe thing about aperitivo , derived from the Latin aperitivus , to open, is that it refers to both the drink itself and the occasion surrounding the drinking. Milan started the habit, apparently, by lining the bar with platters of snacks and bowls of crisps to entice people in for a drink at the end of the working day. Different cities call this different things, from spuntini to stuzzichini to the Venetian cicchetti .\nLook out for it in Milan, Turin and Florence, where chic bars will lay on a spread of cheeses, salumi, pastries and nibbly bits between 7pm and 9pm.\nThe custom has grown, more recently, into a bit of a free-for-all buffet for the price of an (expensive) cocktail, which is a bit of a shame and not half as classy. I prefer it when it is more elegant and spare; just a few well-chosen things, put together with care and eaten over time and over talk. To drink like an Italian, to me, is to pay attention to detail.\nEach small act becomes an occasion The lovely, heart-warming thing about Italians is how they surround the smallest act – pouring a drink – with a sense of occasion and with its own little set of rituals and unspoken rules. The aperitivo itself can be just a glass of prosecco. However, it's more likely to involve one of the bitter liquors that Italians find themselves drawn to, such as Campari, Aperol or vermouth; either straight, over ice or in classic cocktails such as the negroni, the Americano and the Cin Cin.\nThe spritz is a light aperitivo popular in northern Italy and especially in Venice, made with prosecco, a dash of either Campari or Aperol and a top-up of sparkling mineral water. And there's beer, of course. Any of the famous Italian brands of Moretti, Peroni and Menabrea are just the thing before a crusty pizza.\nCutting straight to after the meal, it's time for a digestivo , also known as an ammazzacaffe (\"coffee killer\") if taken after an after-dinner espresso.\nThese also lean towards the bitter; the almost medicinal liqueurs made from jealously guarded recipes involving bitter herbs, roots, plants and spices. There could be an Averna or some other brand of amaro with its distinctive herbal bitterness.\nThen there's the artichoke-based Cynar, the outrageously bitter and vaguely minty Fernet-Branca and Ramazzotti, which includes no fewer than 30 herbs and roots in its maceration.\nLimoncello is often homemade from sun-dried lemons and offered at the end of a meal; it's good when it's not too sweet.\nA shot of grappa, a high-proof wine liquor made from pressed grapes, is like a breath of pure oxygen at the end of a traditional five-course Italian meal. It's also a cheeky little addition to many an espresso in the early morning, when it is known as a caffe corretto – the coffee having been \"corrected\" by the slug of grappa.\nI suspect grappa is the sole secret to Italy's survival. If you can drink that, you can do anything.\nWords and images from Alla Fratelli: How to Eat Italian by Barry McDonald, published by Murdoch Books, $49.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:06:15.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
