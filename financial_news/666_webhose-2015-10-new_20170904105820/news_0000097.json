This has been driven by a clear understanding of what customers want, and fuelled by technology.\" \nN Brown's underlying pre-tax profits, which exclude the restructuring costs and foreign exchange movements, were still 15.9pc lower year-on-year at £35m. \nThe group said that its turnaround of 50s-plus fashion brand JD Williams would take the longest of all its brands after reporting flat half-year sales at £103m. The group's plus-sized womenswear brand, Simply Be, recorded a 21.4pc lift in sales to £50.2m while its Jacamo menswear brand also reported a 21.4pc lift in sales over the same period to £30.4m. \nN Brown has boosted its social media campaigns to drive online awareness, such as by searching for real customers to be the face of this year's Simply Be Christmas campaign via Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) and launching a viral video of former England captain Matt Dawson doing the \"Hakarena\" for the Jacamo brand. \nThe company said that its market niches - it clothes are mainly focused on the plus size and over 50-years-old market - would have significant growth opportunities. \nIn a show of confidence the company said that it was keeping its interim dividend at 5.67p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:57:19.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
