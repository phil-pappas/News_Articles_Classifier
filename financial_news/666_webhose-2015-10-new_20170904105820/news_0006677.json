It will be added to some Model S sedans and Model X SUVs through a software update.\nLike other semi-autonomous systems from Mercedes, Audi and Volvo, Tesla's system automatically keeps the car within its lane and maintains a certain distance from the car in front. It can find a parking spot and parallel park itself. It also uses cameras and sensors to warn drivers about potential side impacts.\nBut analysts say Tesla goes further with industry-first autonomous lane-changing.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:42:37.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
