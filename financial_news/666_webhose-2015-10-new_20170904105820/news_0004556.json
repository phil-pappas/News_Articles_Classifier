A recent survey by Clyde & Co showed that almost 30 percent of all mergers and acquisitions contracts in the Middle East which choose litigation now choose the DIFC Courts. \nIt said settlement rates remain extremely high at 92 percent. \nMichael Hwang, Chief Justice of the DIFC Courts, said: \"There is a clear correlation between the trust that international commerce places in Dubai's ability to settle complex commercial disputes and the increasing value of cases filed with the DIFC Courts. For businesses across the region and internationally, the DIFC Courts are the preferred forum to hear even the largest commercial disputes.\" \nThe total and average values of cases heard by the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) also increased following the extension of its default jurisdiction to cover all claims up to AED500,000 in value, regardless of the nature of the case. \nThe total value of SCT cases heard in the first nine months of 2015 quadrupled from AED3.7 million to AED 14.6 million, while the average claim value increased by 43 percent to AED 82,000. Despite the SCT's increasing workload, over 90 percent of cases are still resolved within four weeks of the case commencing. \nMark Beer, OBE, chief executive and registrar of the DIFC Courts: \"The ongoing surge in the value and complexity of cases heard by the DIFC Courts further reinforces their reputation for providing a certain, safe and trusted environment for businesses to operate. \n\"Moreover, the ability to maintain such high settlement rates is testament to the significant investments made into world-class people, facilities and processes, as well as the ongoing efforts to connect with other courts systems around the world.\" \nSince the turn of the year, the DIFC Courts have signed memoranda covering the mutual enforcement of money judgments with courts in Singapore, New York and Kazakhstan. These build on treaties such as the GCC Protocol and Riyadh Convention, treaties with China and France, and arrangements with many other common law courts overseas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:11:12.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
