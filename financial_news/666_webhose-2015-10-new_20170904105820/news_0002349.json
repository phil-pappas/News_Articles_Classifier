Public borrowing was driven by record revenues for the month from income, VAT and corporation tax. \n\"The Chancellor will obviously be hoping that the economy can kick on and is not hampered by global growth being held back by a marked slowdown in China and emerging markets,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. The Household Finance Index survey by Markit showed less British households believed the Bank of England will raise interest rates in the next six months. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) revealed 34% of households polled in October expect the central bank will increase rates within six months, compared to 42% in September and 48% in August. \nBoE and PBoC reach deal Meanwhile, the BoE and the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) have agreed to renew an existing reciprocal sterling/renminbi currency swap line for another three years. \nIn an announcement during a state visit to Britain by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the BoE said the maximum value of the swap line will be raised to 350bn renminbi. \nThe BoE also announced separately that Britain's smaller lenders and British units of foreign investment banks will avoid the central bank's annual stress tests on their ability to withstand a financial crisis.
