The Nikkei reported the talks between Toshiba and Sony earlier on Saturday, without saying where it got the information.\nSony has taken the lead in global market share for chips that smartphones and cameras use to capture and digitize photos. The company is already quadrupling spending on semiconductors this year to 290 billion yen to meet demand for the sensors from customers including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.\nToshiba spokesman Tatsuro Oishi said on Saturday that nothing has been decided. Sony spokesman George Boyd declined to comment.\nSony controlled about 40 percent of the $8.7 billion image sensor market last year, compared with about 16 percent for its next biggest competitor, Techno System Research estimates. The market is forecast to climb to about $12 billion by 2019, and the company expects its sales to increase as much as 62 percent to 1.5 trillion yen in three years.\nJob Cuts A Japan Inc. stalwart, Toshiba makes everything from nuclear power plants to laptop computers and memory chips. In September, the company sold its stake in medical equipment maker Topcon Corp. in a 49 billion yen deal for a gain of about 30 billion yen.\nAlso in September, Toshiba agreed to sell a 30 percent stake in a building it owns for 37 billion yen and prior to that, sold its 4.6 percent stake in Finnish elevator and escalator maker Kone Oyj, for a gain of about 113 billion yen.\nSeparately, the Yomiuri newspaper reported Saturday that Toshiba may reduce its workforce within Japan by a few thousand people.\nMasashi Muromachi, the company’s president, in September pledged to prune underperforming businesses, including workforce reductions in appliances, personal computers, televisions and semiconductors.\nToshiba had some 198,700 employees as of March 31, the lowest since at least 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAbout 491 billion yen of Toshiba’s market value has evaporated since the company withdrew its earnings forecast in May and announced an accounting probe that was later expanded. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has fined the conglomerate 91 million yen for the profit misstatements.\nFor Related News and Information:\nToshiba Sells Its $947 Million Stake in Elevator Maker Kone\nToshiba President Quits Over $1.2 Billion Accounting Scandal\nToshiba Scandal Grew From Numbers ‘Too Embarrassing’ to Show\nToshiba profitability: 6502 JP <Equity> FA PROF\nToshiba earnings surprises: 6502 JP <Equity> SURP\nTop stories: TOP\nBiggest technology stories: TTOP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:18:40.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
