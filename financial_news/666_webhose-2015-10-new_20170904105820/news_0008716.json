Using toilet paper to clean your butt is barbaric!,\" says Agrawal, full of incredulation.Agrawal today launched Tushy , a bidet product that fits onto the seat of most American toilets. Tushy promises easy installation within 10 minutes, to clean far better than your\nCharmin\n and save trees and water in the process. \"It shoots a precise spray of water exactly where you need it, and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed,\" Agrawal says, then suggests a couple of sheets of toilet paper to dry off. The average American uses 57 squares a day and 50 pounds of toilet paper per year.So why do most Americans giggle at the mention of this water-powered bum cleanser? According to Columbia University : Bidets are dedicated solely to helping people better bathe their vulvas, anuses, penises, and the regions around them. This requires paying close attention to, and often touching, one's genitalia after urination, bowel movements, et. al. â€” something many Americans find dirty, sinful, embarrassing, or just plain weird. \"Get over it!,\" say health care providers who cheer that bidets clean better than toilet paper, help prevent vaginitis, urinary tract infections, and other ailments, and, leave things cleaner and fresher smelling down there after sex and during menstruation. Bidets are a huge help for people with hemorrhoids, diarrhea, rashes, and infections, which toilet tissue can aggravate and/or spread. Bidets can also help mentally challenged people, the elderly, pregnant women, post-surgical patients, people who are paralyzed, and others for whom standing, reaching, bending, and other movements are painful, difficult, or impossible. Or, as Agrawal explains: [tweet_Quote: display=\"&quot;When a bird poops on your face, you don't wipe it off with a piece of paper. You wash it!&quot; via @twinmiki @forbes\"]\"When a bird poops on your face, you don't wipe it off with a piece of paper. You wash it!\"[/tweet_Quote: ] Agrawal, 36, is a serial entrepreneur. The Canadian born former professional soccer player opened WILD, a farm-to-table, gluten-free pizza restaurant in New York City in 2006, and later partnered with Zappos CEO Tony Hseih to bring the concept to Las Vegas. I interviewed her a few months ago about THINX, which been come to be known as \"period panties\" -- patented, absorbent antimicrobial fabric sewn into pretty lace underwear that promise to mostly replace the need for tampons and menstrual pads. Since launching two years ago, THINX has enjoyed millions of dollars in sales of products sold directly from SheThinx.com , Agrawal says. The tagline is THINX: For Women With Periods, akin to Tushy: For People Who Poop, suggesting enormous market potential.Tushy is far from the first bidet product on the market. Bathroom fixture giant Kholer told The New York Times a few years ago that demand for its bidets were on the rise, especially for the elderly and disabled who can find it difficult if not dangerous to reach around and wipe. The U.S. manufacturer's bidets, as well as nearly all of the bidet seats on the market, cost about $500 or more, compared with the $54 for Tushy's cold-water version, and $74 for the warm-water model that connects to your bathroom sink. However, there are a few brands that rival Tushy sold online -- including [entity display=\"Home Depot\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"home-depot\" ticker=\"HD\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2026\"]Home Depot[/entity] -- within the same price range.Like all of Agrawal's businesses, Tushy has a social mission, and donates a portion of all sales to organizations that support sanitation issues.
