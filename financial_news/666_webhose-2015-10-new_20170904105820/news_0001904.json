That offering was five times oversubscribed and proceeds partly refinanced 54 billion pesos of similar securities due that month.\nThe Philippines’ peso is expected to weaken 3 percent to 47.20 a dollar by the end of the year from Monday’s close of 45.80, according to a median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The currency has depreciated 2.7 percent since Dec. 31, making it more expensive for companies in the Southeast Asian nation to service their dollar-denominated debt.\nThat’s put pressure on San Miguel’s earnings, even amid gains from its oil refining and beer and liquor businesses. Profit in the first half fell 8 percent from a year earlier, the company said in August. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, recurring profit rose 15 percent.\nSan Miguel has some $13 billion equivalent of bonds and loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that, U.S. currency notes total $6.8 billion, with a weighted average fixed coupon of 5 percent.\nThe company is seeking to at least double its revenue over the next five years to between $40 billion and $50 billion, via both acquisitions and organic growth, Ang told reporters in Manila last month. Its stock has slumped 35.3 percent this year versus a 1.9 percent decrease in the country’s benchmark stock index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:42:32.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
