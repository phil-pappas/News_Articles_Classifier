As part of a redesign that will be unveiled in March, Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses. But they will no longer be fully nude.\nIts executives admit that Playboy has been overtaken by the changes it pioneered. \"That battle has been fought and won,\" said Scott Flanders, the company's chief executive. \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture.\"\nFor a generation of American men, reading Playboy was a cultural rite, an illicit thrill consumed by flashlight. Now every teenage boy has an Internet-connected phone instead. Pornographic magazines, even those as storied as Playboy , have lost their shock value, their commercial value and their cultural relevance.\nPlayboy 's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in 1975 to about 800,000 now, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. Many of the magazines that followed have disappeared. Though detailed figures are not kept for adult magazines, those that remain exist in severely diminished form, available mostly in specialist stores. Penthouse , perhaps the most famous Playboy competitor, responded to the threat from digital pornography by turning even more explicit. It never recovered.\nPrevious efforts to revamp Playboy , as recently as three years ago, have never quite stuck. And those who have accused it of exploiting women are unlikely to be assuaged by a modest cover-up. But, according to its own research, Playboy 's logo is one of the most recognisable in the world, along with those of Apple and Nike. This time, as the magazine seeks to compete with startups like Vice, Flanders said, it sought to answer a key question: \"If you take nudity out, what's left?\"\nIt is difficult, in a media market that has been so fragmented by the Web, to imagine the scope of Playboy 's influence at its peak. A judge once ruled that denying blind people a Braille version of it violated their First Amendment rights. It published stories by Margaret Atwood and Haruki Murakami among others, and its interviews have included Malcolm X, Vladimir Nabokov, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter, who famously admitted that he had lusted in his heart for women other than his wife. Madonna, Sharon Stone and Naomi Campbell posed for the magazine at the peak of their fame. Its best-selling issue, November 1972, sold more than 7 million copies.\n Hefner \"just revolutionised the whole direction of how we live, of our lifestyles and the kind of sex you might have in America, said Dian Hanson, author of a six-volume history of men's magazines and an editor for Taschen. \"But taking the nudity out of Playboy is going to leave what?\"\nThe latest redesign, 62 years later, is more pragmatic. The magazine had already made some content safe for work, Flanders said, in order to be allowed on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, vital sources of web traffic.\nIn August last year, its website dispensed with nudity. As a result, Playboy executives said, the average age of its reader dropped from 47 to just over 30, and its Web traffic jumped to about 16 million from about 4 million unique users per month.\nThe magazine will adopt a cleaner, more modern style, said Jones, who as chief content officer also oversees its website. There will still be a Playmate of the Month, but the pictures will be \"PG-13\" and less produced -- more like the racier sections of Instagram. \"A little more accessible, a little more intimate,\" he said. It is not yet decided whether there will still be a centrefold.\nIts sex columnist, Jones said, will be a \"sex-positive female,\" writing enthusiastically about sex. And Playboy will continue its tradition of investigative journalism, in-depth interviews and fiction. The target audience, Flanders said, is young men who live in cities. \"The difference between us and Vice,\" he said, \"is that we're going after the guy with a job.\"\nSome of the moves, like expanded coverage of liquor, are partly commercial, Flanders admitted; the magazine must please its core advertisers. And all the changes have been tested in focus groups with an eye toward attracting millennials -- people ages 18 to 30-something, highly coveted by publishers. The magazine will feature visual artists, with their work dotted through the pages, in part because research revealed that younger people are drawn to art.\nThe company now makes most of its money from licensing its ubiquitous brand and logo across the world -- 40 per cent of that business is in China even though the magazine is not available there -- for bath products, fragrances, clothing, liquor and jewellery among other merchandise. Nudity in the magazine risks complaints from shoppers, and diminished distribution.\nFlanders and Jones feel that the magazine remains relevant, not least because the world has gradually adopted Hefner's libertarian views on a variety of social issues. Asked whether Hefner's views on women were the exception to that rule, Flanders responded that Hefner had \"always celebrated the beauty of the female figure.\"\n\"Don't get me wrong,\" Jones said of the decision to dispense with nudity, \"12-year-old me is very disappointed in current me. But it's the right thing to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:06:11.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
