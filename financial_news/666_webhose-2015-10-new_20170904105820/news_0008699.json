WMT is reportedly striving to beef up its offerings in the health and wellness category and push them to the forefront.\nPer media reports, Wal-Mart wants to give more visible space to protein and health bars like Special K, Cliff and Luna products in its stores starting from January in order to cater to consumers’ changing preference and to keep up with the rising demand for health and wellness products. The retail giant plans to move protein and health bars from diet supplements and the like counters to the grocery aisle, where there is relatively higher traffic. Later, the company wants to move them to the cash registers at the front.\nAs part of this health push, Wal-Mart is also offering free screening for glucose levels, blood pressure, and vision at all of its 4,400 stores on Oct 10, in an event called \"America's biggest health fair.\" In addition, Wal-Mart will make available more than 10,000 licensed pharmacists for immunizations in select stores for a fee.\nWal-Mart’s efforts come at a time when retailers like CVS Health Corp. CVS and Target Corp. TGT are rushing to get a bigger share of the wellness and healthy food business. Last month, retailer Target Corp. announced that it was pushing granola bars and healthy grab-and-go snacks over candy at the checkout aisles in 30 of its stores. CVS Health is also adding more fresh foods and healthier snacks at many of its locations.\nBesides these, other retailers are also opening hundreds of new walk-in clinics, staffed by medical professionals such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants to help Americans with their medical issues.\nThe initiative could help drive more shoppers to Wal-Mart stores at a time when this Bentonville, AR-based company is struggling to perk up sales in the U.S., which accounts for 60% of its total sales.\nThough we are positive on the company’s long-term fundamentals, the current scenario is alarming for its investors as Wal-Mart’s performance has not been up to the mark for quite some time now. Wal-Mart anticipates huge expenses in the near term, as it has already pledged to spend $1 billion to raise employees’ wages and give them extra training. Wal-Mart is also witnessing lower margins at Wal-Mart U.S. and expects pharmacy headwinds in this business to continue in the remainder of the fiscal year 2016. Higher labor costs, pharmacy headwinds along with the company’s efforts to overhaul its stores and investments in its online operations continue to weigh on its earnings.\nWal-Mart currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked retailer is The Kroger Co. KR, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
