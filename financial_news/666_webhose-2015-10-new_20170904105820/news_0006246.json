All times local:\n2:40 p.m.\nBritain has used the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping as an occasion to ease visa requirements for other Chinese visitors.\nPrime Minister David Cameron's office said Wednesday that standard visitor visas will be extended from six months to two years as part of the government's plan to strengthen ties with China.\nPlans for a new 10-year multiple entry visa were also announced.\nThe extended visa will be introduced in January.\nOfficials say Chinese tourists contribute 500 million pounds ($772 million) to Britain's economy each year.\nLondon tourism officials said the new rules should deliver a boost to tourism.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nPrince William and his wife Kate have shown Chinese President Xi Jinping a special exhibit of British and Chinese technology projects.\nThey were joined Wednesday by film star Jackie Chan as Xi continued a state visit that has included a gala banquet at Buckingham Palace. Xi viewed special zero-emission prototype vehicles including an Aston Martin, a London taxi and a London bus developed by Chinese and British firms.\nThe trip is designed to showcase business opportunities inside Britain as Prime Minister David Cameron courts closer ties with China. Cameron plans to meet Xi later Wednesday and dine with him Thursday at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence.\nXi is also thought to be interested in getting some fish and chips at a British pub.\n___\n11:45 a.m.\nPalace officials say a major Chinese firm is offering financial support to Prince William's effort to lead a movement to curtail illegal wildlife trade.\nOfficials said Wednesday the firm Sanpower will work with the Royal Foundation United for Wildlife charity, which is headed by William, his wife Kate and his brother Prince Harry.\nThe announced comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Britain.\nCharity officials say a donation from Sanpower will be used to create two regional ranger training facilities in eastern and southern Africa. Royal Foundation chief Nick Booth said the partnership will bring \"significant new resources to bear.\"\nWilliam has recorded a broadcast for Chinese TV urging that the demand for illegally poached animal parts be squelched.\n___\n9:25 a.m.\nChina's president Xi Jinping is expected to confirm a deal that will lead to China covering 30 percent of the cost of construction of a nuclear power plant in southwest England.\nThe plant in Somerset - set to be completed by 2025 - will be built by French energy firm EDF, in conjunction with a consortium led by Chinese state-owned nuclear company CGN.\nEDF sought outside investors after being unable to cover the cost of the deal alone. Britain's government is also offering a guarantee.\nThe deal has faced criticism by rights activists who suggest that Prime Minister David Cameron has been courting the Chinese for trade deals while ignoring their human rights record.\n.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
