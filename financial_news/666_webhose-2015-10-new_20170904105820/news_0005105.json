The company estimates that inspecting switches and applying heat-resistant grease will take dealers about 45 minutes per fix.\nToyota said it was unaware of any crashes caused by the fault, which resulted from inconsistent application of a sprayed-on grease to electrical contact points in the power switch.\nCar makers are under pressure to hasten their recall processes after coming under fire for time lags between learning about potential flaws and calling back cars for fixes.\nThe pressure has built following recalls by Toyota involving unintended acceleration and General Motors for faulty ignition switches.\nA litany of car makers also are repairing millions of air bags made by supplier Takata due to defective inflators.\nTokai Rika supplied the components involved in Toyota’s recall, said Kayo Doi, a spokeswoman for the car maker.\nTokai Rika will book a ¥14.5bn ($121m) charge due to a customer recall, according to a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nShares of Tokai Rika declined 1.3% to ¥2,655 in Tokyo. Toyota rose 2%, compared with a 1.8% gain in the benchmark Topix index.\nToyota received one report from a US customer of a hand being burnt, and said it was aware of 11 incidents in which switches and door trims burnt.\nThe internal circuit board would be replaced if the switch was not operating normally, the company said.\nThe recalled vehicles were produced between January 2005 and August 2006, and August 2008 and June 2010, in Japan, Toyota said.\nThe cars also include those manufactured outside Japan between August 2005 and August 2006, and January 2009 and December 2010, it said.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:54:16.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
