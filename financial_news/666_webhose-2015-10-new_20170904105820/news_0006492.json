We are seeing both strength and weakness in the economy and no particular sector is leading overall growth. Combine this with the conflicts internationally and our nation’s leadership challenges, and I don't have high expectations near term.” David T. Schaefer, CEO, Mintaka Financial, LLC Bank, Middle Ticket “As the interest rate environment becomes less certain, demand for fixed rate financing should increase as businesses look for predictability.” Alan Sikora, CEO, First American Equipment Finance, a City National Bank Company Independent, Middle Ticket “While we have been optimistic about an improving economy, we have seen some recent signs of a potential slowdown, primarily in our transportation/truck business sales and credit applications. This business tends to lead the economy and so we are uncertain if this is an early sign of a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy.” William H. Besgen, President & COO, Hitachi Capital America Corp. \nSurvey results are posted on the Foundation website, http://www.leasefoundation.org/research/mci/ , included in the Foundation Forecast newsletter and included in press releases.
