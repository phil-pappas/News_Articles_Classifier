It is the platform that we continue to explore to stay in touch with the business community. MTN finds the need to interact with the business community to establish itself as the place where individuals and organizations in the corporate world meet to take advantage of the varied tailor-made solutions and products that MTN Business offers to optimize the productivity of SME have and expand their business.” \nMr. Tunji Alabi, Chief Information Officer of Fidelity Bank Ghana Limited (Partners of MTN Business), explained how bank customers could benefit from reduced transaction costs through mobile financial services such as the MTN Mobile Money. \n“It is possible to achieve a zero cost on banking services. The whole idea is that as competition increases, banks will not be able to charge any money for banking services, it’s going to be seen as value added,” he said. \n“The only way we can get to that level is if there’s efficiency in the way we operate so that the cost to operate becomes as close to zero as possible and that is what we are working towards by ensuring that we have operational efficiency in everything that we do. The ultimate beneficiary is the customer,” he added. \nAccording to Mr. Sofiene Marzouki, Managing Director of Hellofood (an online food ordering site), the MTN Mobile Money Service has helped win the trust of customers and cut the frustrations of delivery personnel who usually were confronted with issues of seeking change for customers who paid cash. \nThe MTN Business Fair before its fourth edition in Accra had been held in the Eastern, Western and the Ashanti regions. \nFollow Amisty on twitter @ElAmistyNobo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:20:14.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
