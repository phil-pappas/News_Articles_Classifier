As many as 88 people are killed by gun violence in America each day, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, The Washington Post citing data from ShootingTracker.com said mass shootings-defined as incidents in which four or more people are shot -- have happened hundreds of times over the last several years.

Only once have seven days passed without a mass shooting and only once have eight days passed. Those are the longest spans-the latter happening in April of this year. Several times, six days have passed. A Congressional Research Service report published in 2013 counted 78 incidents between 1982 and 2014, in which 547 were killed, according to the Post.

Technology giants Google and Microsoft have agreed to drop 18 patent lawsuits between the two companies in the US and Germany, the media reported. The agreement brings an end to legal battles over the use of technology in mobile phones and Wi-Fi and of patents covering games for the Xbox video-gaming console and Windows products, Efe cited the two companies as saying in a joint statement. \"Google and Microsoft have agreed to collaborate on certain patent matters and anticipate working together in other areas in the future to benefit our customers,\" the companies said without disclosing financial terms. The legal battles began in 2010, when Microsoft accused Motorola, later acquired by Google, of non-compliance with its obligation to allow companies to license patents covering wireless networking and video technologies at a reasonable price. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo last year but kept some assets, including the majority of its patents.
