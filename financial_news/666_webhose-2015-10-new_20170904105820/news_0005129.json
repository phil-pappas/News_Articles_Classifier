Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jenny Wiggins Transport planners must prepare for the arrival of driverless cars within the next decade by reassessing investment priorities and regulations, warns NSW Transport and Infrastructure Minister Andrew Constance.\n\"The advent of the driverless car is something which is going to completely transform transport planning,\" he said. \"The technology is around the corner, it will be here within five to 10 years, so we are going to have to do an enormous amount of work very quickly.\n\"I don't want to see governments making multibillion-dollar investments and then it turns out that with the advent of driverless cars we've made the wrong decision.\"\nNSW will host a global technology transport conference next year to analyse how new technologies are changing transport modes and networks, he said. \"Governments have got to get smarter as we see smarter cities.\"\nTransport agencies needed to move away from building \"shiny new toys\" to thinking about analytics and appropriate regulations, Mr Constance added, pointing to the taxi business as a \"classic case\" of an industry where regulations had not kept pace with technological change.\nThe taxi industry is under threat as consumers increasingly turn to Uber apps to book and pay for rides with the privately-held company.\nValue capture The NSW government is also increasingly assessing methods of \"value capture\" when considering business cases for new infrastructure projects, Mr Constance said. \"Parramatta light rail will be the first major test.\"\n Value capture involves adding extra taxes to land near big transport projects to capture the increase in value after the project is built.\nThe first stage of a proposed light rail through western Sydney to Parramatta is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion.\nMr Constance said the government was considering a range of value capture options, such as \"betterment\" levies, special infrastructure contributions and parking space levies, and would work closely with the development community.\n\"Ultimately, this about sharing the increased profit margin that is associated with development when we put the infrastructure projects in.\"\nThe state government was looking at ways of protecting a corridor for heavy rail to the new Western Sydney Airport, but any passenger rail line would need to be backed by \"a sound business case,\" he said.\n\"We've got some fundamental threshold questions to be asked in terms of the timing and the best way to go.\"\nAn environmental impact statement released for the new airport this week called for additional transport options to be considered, including rail connections, with the Federal government indicating it was open to the idea of a direct,high-speed rail link to the airport as well as a heavy rail line.\nMr Constance ruled out introducing congestion charges in Sydney in the near term but noted the city's population would rise by about 1.6 million people over the next 15 years and said the city could not allow congestion to keep increasing at current rates.\n\"The Abbott government had a real focus on roads, I suspect the Turnbull government's going to have a real focus on passenger rail,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennywiggins", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/117166018980952797102", "https://www.uber.com/", "http://westernsydneyairport.gov.au/resources/deis/index.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:06:27.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
