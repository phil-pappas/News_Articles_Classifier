And that has fueled the debate over how these funds should adjust the balance between stocks and other investments in their portfolios as they approach their target date—a balance many fund providers have tinkered with in the past couple of years.\nThe upshot for investors: They should understand that funds with the same target date don’t all have the same exposure to stocks, so some funds might suit their risk tolerance more than others.\nBumpy landing? Target-date retirement funds, by design, own a heftier portion of stocks early in people’s working lives, when they can most easily tolerate an occasional year of poor returns. The funds then automatically trim stock exposure in later years, aiming to smooth the ride as investors near retirement—and beyond, for those who keep money in these funds after the target date.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs The 4 Things to Do Before Retirement Guide to the New Fund Rules ‘529’ Mismatch? Our College Q&A U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 8.2% in Quarter No. 1 fund performer: Polen Growth But with markets off this year, holders of many 2015-dated funds (geared for those expecting to retire around this time) are in danger of a bumpy landing. Their average return for 2015 was about minus 2.9% as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. MORN 0.97 % Some were down more than 4%, about the percentage of assets many people withdraw each year in retirement.\nSuch declines might be less worrisome to anyone focused on the longer term. Still, it is worth looking at what is behind them, says Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt. “These periods of market stress provide a test of whether strategies are holding up as designed.”\nWith around $1 trillion in assets, target-date funds have become a key way for people in defined-contribution plans to save for retirement. Yet there is little consensus about how to design the downward trajectory of the equity holdings—the so-called glide path.\nRon Surz, a retirement-plan consultant in San Clemente, Calif., argues that funds should have zero stocks at the retirement date. He says research shows most people take their money out of their accounts then, which justifies an ultraconservative glide path.\nOthers say such an approach could prove disastrous. People who don’t have a significant holding of stocks well into retirement stand to lose a lot of purchasing power, says Fran Kinniry, principal in the investment strategy group at Vanguard Group, whose $210 billion in target-date assets are the most in the industry. “Compound that out for 20 years, and you are in really bad shape,” he says.\nBoth sides of that discussion are reflected in the design changes some fund providers have made in recent years. Fidelity Investments, whose funds trailed those of some peers as stocks rallied after the financial crisis, increased their equity allocations two years ago. Fidelity’s 2015 fund now has about 55% of its portfolio in stocks, about five percentage points more than before the changes. That’s similar to T. Rowe Price Group Inc. TROW 0.22 % ’s flagship 2015 product and modestly higher than Vanguard’s.\nShould target-date funds have zero stocks at the retirement date? Not everyone agrees. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images Mathew Jensen, director of target-date funds at Fidelity, says the higher equity allocations are aimed at helping investors maintain their living standards through retirement. “When you think about longevity for someone who is 65, they could be living to their early 90s,” he says. “The way individuals are saving today,” he says, meaning not enough, “and the income they need from retirement, they need the power of equities.”\nOthers have gone the opposite way. Capital Group, whose American Funds rank fifth with $34 billion in target-date assets, reduced equity allocations in funds closest to their retirement dates by about 10 percentage points after the financial crisis, says Rich Lang, vice president of its target-date retirement series. Its 2015 fund is 47% equity now.\nCapital Group further softened the landing of its target funds by shifting the equity mix to include more dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be less volatile than other shares, as the funds approach their target date.\nChange is good? “There are a lot of target-date series that have made changes to their series, increasing equity allocations to focus a bit more on longevity risk,” Mr. Lang says. But that may give short shrift to market risk, he says. “A target-date series should really try to address both” types of risk, he says, and that was the aim of the adjustments at American.\nT. Rowe covers both sides of the debate. While its original target-date series still has one of the industry’s highest equity allocations, the firm has introduced a new fund series with an equity allocation that drops to a more conservative 42.5% at the target date, when it’s assumed holders will be about 65. The 2015 fund in that newer series, T. Rowe Price Target Retirement 2015 (TRRTX), was down 2.4% this year as of Sept. 30, compared with a drop of about 3.1% for its older counterpart.\nThe new series was designed to accommodate the risk tolerances of people who want to focus more on stability of principal than on maximizing their potential account balances at retirement, perhaps because they plan to take a lump-sum withdrawal at the target date, says Jerome Clark, who oversees target-date funds at the firm and helped create its first target-date series.\nHe says it is unlikely that employers who use T. Rowe products will offer both series in defined-contribution plans.\nHe adds that analysis of market returns over nearly 90 years concluded that the higher equity allocation used in T. Rowe’s older series tends to produce the best retirement outcomes, enabling investors’ holdings to recover quicker after market reversals.\nMr. Clark counsels investors not to overreact to this year’s market. “What matters most in the end isn’t these short-term market environments—it’s the multiyear outcomes over the long term,” he says.\nMorningstar’s Mr. Holt says investors who are anxious about this year’s returns should recall that more-conservative funds lagged behind peers not long ago, when stocks were booming. “There are a wide range of glide paths and approaches,” he adds, “but there’s no one glide path that is right for everyone.”\nMr. Pollock is a writer in Ridgewood, N.J.
