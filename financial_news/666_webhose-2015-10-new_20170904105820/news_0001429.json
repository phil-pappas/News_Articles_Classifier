Critics of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner saw the near-shipwreck as a metaphor for her government. \nOver the past decade, Argentina has enjoyed a commodity price boom that has fuelled annual average economic growth of around 4 per cent. Ms Fernández has been quick to trumpet that success as her own. But as she prepares to exit office — after next Sunday’s presidential election — she will be leaving behind a country in dire economic straits saddled by a yawning fiscal deficit, double-digit inflation and critically low foreign exchange reserves. \n“Argentina has run out of road,” says Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at EMSO Partners, an emerging markets asset manager. “It’s not a question of whether there will be an [economic] adjustment or not. The real question is whether the next government moves quickly, or whether the market ends up doing the adjustment for them.” \nEnd of the Fernández reign \nConstitutionally barred from running for a third term, many believe Ms Fernández’s departure offers a turning point for Latin America’s third-largest economy. For one it will end 12 years of leftist rule that Ms Fernández shared with her predecessor and deceased husband, Néstor Kirchner, who took power in 2003 as Argentina was reeling from an earlier economic crisis sparked by its $100bn default — at the time the biggest sovereign debt default in history. \nBack then, other populist or centre-left leaders — such as Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — were also being swept to power across South Americ a. In a stroke of fortune, their rise coincided with a period of booming commodity prices. \nNow, however, that boom has ended with tumultuous consequences for some of those most exposed. In Brazil and Venezuela, the successors of both Mr Chávez and Mr Lula da Silva are grappling with unprecedented economic and political crises . \nArgentina is not in a comparably parlous state. But there is a broad consensus among the presidential candidates that whoever wins the race will need to move swiftly to untangle a thickening knot of economic problems and prevent a similar crisis in Argentina. \nWhat distinguishes the candidates is the speed with which they promise to fix these problems. For now the race is too close to call, thanks to a voting system that requires the winner of the first round to scoop 45 per cent of the vote, or 40 per cent plus a 10 point lead over the next candidate. Failing that, there will be a run-off, on November 22. \nLeading the polls , with around 37 per cent, is Daniel Scioli , 58, the so-called “continuity candidate” backed by Ms Fernández. The governor of Buenos Aires province, and a former vice-president under Kirchner, Mr Scioli has promised only “gradual” change. \nHis main rival is Mauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of Buenos Aires, who has committed to restoring the credibility of institutions such as the judiciary, central bank and media — which have come under pressure from the Fernández administration — and to open the door to foreign investment. \nKey to the final result, though, may be Sergio Massa, a former cabinet secretary under Ms Fernández who has split from the government. Although he is running a distant third, with 20 per cent, how his support base divides in a second round run-off vote between Mr Scioli and Mr Macri could decide the eventual winner. \n“The election remains wide open, with a run-off . . . highly likely,” says Laurence Allan of IHS, the risk consultancy. “Scioli and Macri have vowed to improve the business environment, but Argentina’s serious macroeconomic imbalances will pose major challenges.” \nThese challenges are daunting though it is not mission impossible. They include tackling a fiscal deficit equivalent to 7 per cent of gross domestic product — currently financed by printing money; inflation that private forecasters estimate at about 20 per cent; an overvalued currency with a soaring black market rate; a fast-disappearing trade surplus; capital controls ; and shrinking foreign reserves . \nFor financial markets, however, the bigger question is whether the new government can settle a long-running $1.3bn dispute with holdout hedge fund creditors, led by US billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which has effectively locked Argentina out of capital markets for a decade. \nThe court case has resulted in Argentina having exceptionally low levels of debt — a plus as most other emerging economies have leveraged themselves up to the gunwales. But it has also made it a financial pariah . Many expect, or at least hope, a settlement could prompt a surge of capital inflows. \n“We have been out of the markets for so long that there’s a lot of pent up demand for Argentine assets,” argues Federico Sturzenegger, economic adviser to Mr Macri, who has said he will seek a rapid solution to the holdout saga. \nMr Sturzenegger says one priority is to attract $20bn a year in upstream oil and gas investment to develop Argentina’s largely untapped shale reserves. \nLate to the investment party \nOthers are less confident about the scale of financial interest. Even if there is a settlement, investors are no longer as interested in emerging markets as they were when commodity prices were high and ultra-low western interest rates prompted a search for extra yield. Securing investment in shale has been made all the more difficult by the dramatic fall in oil prices. \n“We are arriving late at the party,” cautions Mario Blejer, a former International Monetary Fund economist and now adviser to Mr Scioli, who says he favours reopening talks with holdout creditors but has also been non-committal about how he would approach them — in deference to Ms Fernández, who has refused to negotiate a deal. \nTo Ms Fernández’s many critics, the end of this unyielding stance will be one of the most welcome changes when she leaves office. Yet despite leading a government that opponents often describe as proud, capricious, heterodox, vengeful and even corrupt, Ms Fernández’s approval rating is close to 50 per cent, which could restrict her successor’s room for manoeuvre. \nSupporters say such relatively high ratings are thanks to government policies, which have put Argentina back on the path of prosperity after the crushing debt crisis of 2001. \n“Above all, we have recovered the ability to control our own destiny, which we lacked when the country was excessively indebted and subjected to the IMF and financial markets,” says Aldo Ferrer, a prominent economist. \nTo explain her continuing popularity, backers also point to strong economic growth which peaked at 9.5 per cent in 2010, but fell to 0.5 per cent in 2014, with little improvement expected this year,and generous social programmes. Subsidised energy schemes, for instance, can make the cost of a household’s monthly energy bill equivalent to the price of a cup of coffee. The subsidies, they say, lifted millions out of poverty and reduced inequality, even if they fail to mention how high inflation has since eroded those gains. The Catholic University of Argentina calculates that the number of Argentines living in poverty — defined as someone earning less than $220 per month — rose to 29 per cent in 2014, from a low of 25 per cent in 2011. \nEconomists working for all of the main presidential candidates warn that the country can no longer afford the current level of subsidies. But her successor could also find themselves restricted by what Agustín D’Attellis, another economist close to the government, identifies as a lasting shift to the left in the prevailing economic doctrine. Indeed, even the market-friendly Mr Macri openly approves of the once-controversial 2012 nationalisation of the oil company, YPF . \nBut perhaps Ms Fernández’s biggest legacy will be herself. Although she is not running in the elections as a deputy, senator or governor — many speculated she would seek a seat to maintain political immunity in case of possible future corruption charges — few imagine her disappearing from public life altogether. \n“The great unknown is whether Cristina is going to play a big role and remain a powerful figure,” says Juan Cruz Díaz of Cefeidas, a political consultancy. \nHe points out that this is particularly important for Mr Scioli, who has had to court Ms Fernández’s support by accepting one of her closest advisers as a running mate while distancing himself from her in order to attract swing voters. That has made for a delicate balancing act, “but I wouldn’t underestimate Scioli’s [independence],” Mr Díaz adds. \nA long fall \nA century ago Argentina was one of the most prosperous countries in the world , today it has the dubious distinction of being the only country to have lost its rich nation status. \n“Our [recent] history is divided into two halves: Argentina was the country with the fastest rise between 1880 and 1930, and then the country with the most notorious fall,” says Dante Caputo, a foreign minister during the 1980s, who doubts that the next government will significantly alter the current downward trajectory. \nOn the asset side of the national ledger are some of the world’s largest reserves of shale oil and gas. Argentina also has abundantly fertile plains that have made it the world’s third-biggest exporter of soya — a sector that powered recovery after the 2001 crash. But prices have halved to around $320 per tonne since 2012 although some home the crop can avoid the worst of the end of the commodity super-cycle. \n“The world is eating more and it is eating better, and that is a trend that will not be reversed,” says Gustavo Grobocopatel, a prominent Argentine farmer sometimes called “the king of soya” . “That is a great opportunity for Argentina, which is well positioned to benefit.” \nBut on the liability side of the national balance sheet lies a political class that has seemingly proven itself incapable of delivering long-term stability. High hopes greet each new administration. Yet no government has been able to successfully smooth out the country’s boom-and-bust cycles. \nOne disgruntled voter, Sonia Benedetti, a 69-year-old housewife, is pessimistic. “Sadly, I don’t think the next president will change this country. We don’t just need a new president, we need a whole new political class. Out with the lot of them!” Profiles: ‘A wide open race’ The incumbent’s choice \nBorn into a middle-class family, Daniel Scioli negotiated his kidnapped brother’s ransom and release from leftwing guerrillas when he was just 18. But it was his sporting career that brought him fame. After losing his right arm in a powerboat racing accident in 1989, he went on to win several world championships over the next decade, alongside a business career selling electrical appliances for Electrolux. After being elected to congress in 1997, Néstor Kirchner chose him as his vice-president in 2003. Since 2007 he has been governor of Buenos Aires province, whose 17m population makes it larger than most European countries, as well as the president of the ruling Peronist party from 2010 to 2014. The challenger \nMauricio Macri, the son of a powerful Italian business magnate, spent a decade running one of Argentina’s most popular football clubs, Boca Juniors, during one of its most successful eras. But he says it was a 12-day kidnapping ordeal at the hands of corrupt police officers in 1991 that convinced him to go into politics. He founded a centre-right political party, and later became a congressman before being elected in 2007 as mayor of Buenos Aires. After launching his presidential bid in 2013, he has seen his support rise dramatically over the past year as he campaigned for reform. The outsider \nSergio Massa is a dissident Peronist hoping to capitalise on widespread discontent with the government. After being elected in 2007 as mayor of Tigre, a middle-class suburban district north of Buenos Aires, he was briefly Cristina Fernández’s cabinet chief in 2008-09, before splitting from the government. His candidacy has struggled to gain traction despite an impressive victory for his party in 2013 midterms that effectively barred the president from re-election by leaving her without the congressional majority needed to alter the constitution.
