New Zealand Markets closed Govt urged to avoid Badgerys rail headache AAP â€“ 6 minutes ago View Photo \n\nWestern Sydneysiders have been promised the noise created by planes arriving at the city's second airport will be no worse than a car on a suburban street. \nBut business leaders say a bigger headache looms, with the federal government floating a preliminary plan for Badgerys Creek without provision for a ready-to-go rail link. \nThe draft along with an environmental impact statement released by Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss on Monday suggest long-mooted fears about noise and air pollution from the airport are unfounded. \nIt is anticipated 11,000 jobs will be created from the time bulldozers hit the ground in mid-2016 until the first stage of construction is complete. \nAlthough the draft plan includes provisions for a rail corridor, Mr Truss said the five million passengers expected to pass through the airport initially would not provide sufficient revenue to make a rail connection viable. \nThe head of the Tourism and Transport Forum, Margy Osmond, said that approach risked turning the so-called Western Sydney Airport into a \"hitchhikers' airport\". \n\"Leaving it until a decade after the airport opens ignores the fact there will be significant employment grounds around the airport,\" she told reporters in Sydney. \nDavid Borger, who represents the Western Sydney Airport Alliance and the Sydney Business Chamber, echoed the concerns. \nHe wants to see an \"aerotropolis\", including multiple business parks surrounding the airport, to help ease the jobs deficit in outer western and southwestern Sydney. \nBut Mr Borger said having a rail link in place from 2025 would be crucial. \n\"This should be an opportunity not just to build the airport and connect it but to get all those new town centres that western Sydney needs to push the needle on jobs,\" Mr Borger said. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance have previously described a rail link for Badgerys Creek as essential but there has been no agreement yet about when it should be built or who pays. \nA Transport for NSW spokesman told AAP the department was working with the Commonwealth to develop infrastructure to support the planned airport. \nNSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley wants the airport's eventual private operator to foot the bill. \n\"There will be considerable windfall gains for the operator of a western Sydney airport, and it's only fair they make a contribution to the infrastructure that will be needed to connect the airport to the rest of our city,\" he said. \nAny passenger train line would likely be an extension of the existing South West Rail Link to Leppington. \nThe public will have 60 days to comment on the plan, which includes an initial single runway with a second expected about 2050 capable of handling 82 million passengers a year. \nTHE AIRPORT PLAN: \n* Set to create more than 3000 jobs in 2022, nearly 9000 in 2031, 60,000 in 2063 \n* Same size as Gold Coast airport but within five years will match Adelaide airport \n* 3.7km single runway, with a second runway by 2050 that can take 82 million passengers \n* Construction due to start in late 2016 \n* Operations to start in mid-2020s \n* $3.6 billion roads package, with rail corridor scoped out \n* Community has until December 18 to comment on plan and draft environmental impact statement. \n(Source: Australian government)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:59:16.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
