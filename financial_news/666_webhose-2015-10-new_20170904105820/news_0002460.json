Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe A potential in principle deal on a historic Pacific Rim trade and investment accord spanning 40 per cent of the global economy, has been put on ice until at least Monday in Atlanta.\nTrade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim nations, including Australia, were inching towards an agreement late on Sunday night, but last-minute jitters among several countries over market access issues were holding up a conclusion.\nNegotiators were trying to hammer out the final details, with New Zealand making a last-ditch push to secure better dairy quotas in the United States and Canada.\nThe proposed regional trade pact would open up new markets for Australian business across services and improve on Japanese tariff and quota cuts for beef and other farm-gate produce secured by the Abbott government in the free trade deal with Tokyo last year .\nThe accord would set sweeping new rules for trade, investment, intellectual property, labour, data storage, state-owned enterprises and the environment across Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam. But Australian industry stakeholders on the sidelines of the meeting were bracing for only modest market access improvements for dairy and sugar in North America, due to fierce lobbying and political influence of US sugar growers and Canadian and American dairy farmers.\nOptimism over a deal was high among the US, Mexico and Japan delegates earlier on Sunday, although Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb was more tempered later in the evening.\nNot 'a done deal' \"It's not done yet, but we've [Australia] obviously largely completed with the Americans but there is 10 other countries,\" he said.\nJapan's economy minister Akira Amari said on Sunday there had been \"major progress\" and a solution to the pharmaceutical impasse issue had been found. AAP The 12 ministers were set to meet shortly before midnight on Sunday in Atlanta to iron out late-stage differences.\nA standoff between Australia and the US over intellectual property protections for biologic medicines had held up a final multilateral deal , before the US backed away from its demand for at least eight years of data exclusivity.\nMr Robb and US trade representative Mike Froman reached agreement allowing Australia to retain its five years of data exclusivity for biologics without any changes.\n\"We've got a health system that is delivering effective levels of protection and not putting too much pressure on prices for drugs,\" Mr Robb said.\n\"We're not going to change\" - Australia's Trade Minister says protecting pharma patents under #TPP a \"red line issue\"\nA video posted by Richard Madan (@richardmadan) on Oct 4, 2015 at 3:35pm PDT\nA flexible, non-binding alternative is slated for inclusion in the TPP, in a largely face-saving mechanism for the US that will help the Obama administration sell the deal to Congress members urging more protection of pharmaceutical firms.\n'Major progress' Japan's economy minister Akira Amari said on Sunday there had been \"major progress\" and a solution to the pharmaceutical impasse issue had been found.\n\"We are making preparations now to announce a deal in principle this afternoon [Monday morning Australian time],\" he said.\nBut the US-Australia biologics proposal was being shopped around to other countries, including Peru and Chile, who wanted a maximum of five years of data protection. Their agreement is required before the TPP is signed.\nNew Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser was locked in discussions with Mr Froman over dairy tariffs and quotas.\nKiwi dairy industry sources were desperate to improve a modest US offer of lowering barriers for butter, cheese and milk powder that comprise almost 30 per cent of the New Zealand's exports.\nMexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said earlier on Sunday: \"We do expect a deal today, yes.\"\nBiggest deal The TPP would be Mr Robb's fourth and biggest trade deal, adding to bilateral pacts with Japan, China and South Korea.\nThe accord would set sweeping new rules for trade, investment, intellectual property, labour, data storage, state-owned enterprises and the environment across Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam.\nIt would be the largest trade deal since the Uruguay round in the 1994 set up the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade across 123 countries.\nThe talks are nearly the final opportunity to seal the TPP before the expected rising anti-trade rhetoric in the lead-up to next year's US presidential election and Canada's election on October 19.\nTalks broke down without conclusion in Hawaii in July and the Atlanta meeting was billed as a crucial event.\nâ€‹The TPP is a key part of the Obama administration's \"rebalance\" to Asia, to take advantage of the three billion middle-class consumers.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8bsJRHgO1x/", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:19:03.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
