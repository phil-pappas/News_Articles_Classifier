Together, Learnship and Cartus are helping transform the way companies offer language training and how their employees access it worldwide. This strategic alliance makes Cartus' existing high-quality, in-person training accessible online through a unique, proprietary digital platform with the same personal customization and training expertise.\n\"In Learnship we found a company that shares our commitment to the key elements we know our clients want and need in language training and, in fact, in all of the services we deliver to them: high quality, easy access, accurate reporting, and customized delivery,\" said Kevin Kelleher, president and CEO of Cartus. \"They offer a capability that enhances our language offerings through a digital platform that is dramatically different from any other offering available today.\"\nInitially formed in April 2014, the strategic alliance with Learnship has already broadened Cartus' market opportunities and enabled the company to penetrate the growing Learning and Development (L&D) arena both in the United States and Europe. Learnship's proprietary Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution reduces administrative efforts and generates significant cost savings for the L&D function. Cartus clients also have reported improvements in productivity and project management.\n\"The online Learnship platform offers an interactive classroom in which a live language trainer interacts directly with employees, utilizing comprehensive training modules,\" Kelleher said. \"The platform also incorporates scheduling, reporting, and tracking. And the uniqueness of its flexible 'accessible everywhere, anytime' delivery allows employees to begin training early, maximizing use of training dollars and increasing companies' return on investment.\"\nKelleher added that all Cartus language programs incorporate an intercultural element that takes the learner beyond fluency to a culturally appropriate use of language.\n\"As a result of the strategic alliance with Cartus, we are creating a mutually compelling value proposition for both companies,\" said Learnship CEO and founder, Sushel Bijganath. \"The opportunity to create better, more efficient training while also helping multinational corporations and their relocating employees save money and time, are just some of the benefits to this partnership,\" Bijganath added.\nAbout Cartus\nCartus provides trusted guidance to organizations of all types and sizes that require global relocation solutions.
