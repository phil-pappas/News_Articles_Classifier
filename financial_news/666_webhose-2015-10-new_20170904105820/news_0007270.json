The 11.5 percent drop was far steeper than economists polled by Reuters had projected. \nThe disappointing housing data put downward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields as well as the dollar. \nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was 2 basis points lower at 2.064 percent after hitting two-week high on Friday. \nSweden's Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank of Japan, which all hold policy meetings this week, will be closely watched. \n\"Globally, the focus right now is on central banks and monetary policy as a whole,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) in Tokyo. \nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars have benefited from the improved investor appetite, each gaining about half a percent on the day against their U.S. counterpart at $0.7261 and $0.6790, respectively.
