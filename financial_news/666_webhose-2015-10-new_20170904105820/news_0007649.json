Peter Morris by Angela Macdonald-Smith Origin Energy has had its share price targets slashed by analysts in the wake of news of its $2.5 billion equity raising, although several analysts have reiterated positive calls on the stock while RBC Capital Markets has raised its call to \"outperform\".\nJPMorgan more than halved its target for Origin shares, to $6.40 from $13, after cutting earnings estimates as a result of lower oil price assumptions. It kept its recommendation at \"overweight\".\nThe planned issue of 636 million new shares at $4 apiece means earnings per share estimates have been cut more severely. But the target prices from analysts remain well above the discounted share sale price.\nUBS reduced its 12-month price target for Origin shares to $6.57 from $9.67, while retaining a \"buy\" call. UBS analyst David Leitch told clients that he expected Origin to trade at a 23 per cent discount to its peers amid a lack of confidence in the company after several written-off investments in power generation and the change of tack on the need for a capital raising.\nRBC analyst Paul Johnston also slashed his price target for Origin, to $6.50 from $10, but pointed to \"significant upside from these depressed levels\" given guidance for earnings given by the company on Wednesday for the next two financial years.\nOrigin shares closed at $6.10 on Tuesday before being halted from trading pending the institutional part of the raising, structured as an underwritten four-for-seven entitlement offer at $4 a share. The stock is due to resume trading on October 6.\nMr Leitch pointed to $650 million of write-downs by Origin in the past five years on \"half a dozen generation technologies that haven't had $1 of sales\". He described Origin's acquisition of NSW retailing assets from the government as \"problematic\" and noted a loss of $250 million on the company's investment in New Zealand's Contact Energy.\n\"There are some successes as well but negatives have exceeded positives for some years,\" Mr Leitch said in a note.\n \"The balance sheet was not a problem until it was. As a result we expect the market will continue to put a discount on the numbers until confidence returns.\"\nAs part of the package of measures in response to the prolonged slump in oil prices, Origin also advised of a cut to dividends to 20c per share for the next two years, from 50c in 2014-15, $1 billion of spending and working capital savings, and up to $800 million of asset sales.\nThe moves would bring net debt, which was due to peak at almost $12 billion this financial year, down to below $9 billion by the end of June 2017.\nMr Leitch added that he saw the measures announced on Wednesday as boding well for Origin's share price, but pointed out the significant difference in Origin's position on some key issues from just two months ago at the full-year earnings briefings in August.\n\"We're now seeing the shift in narrative that perhaps should have featured earlier in the oil price slide, with capex reductions, asset sales, cost management and dividend cut all on the table,\" JPM analyst Christopher Laybutt said in his report to clients.\nHe said the measures \"effectively put the company in a position to seek an upgrade to BBB should expectations play out.\"\nOrigin managing director Grant King said on Wednesday that the measures would reduce the key ratio scrutinised by credit ratings agencies of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to below four times in the 2017 fiscal year based in forward market prices for crude oil and exchange rates. It would then fall to three times in subsequent years.\nBoth Standard & Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed Origin's rating on Wednesday at their respective lowest investment grade but both pointed to increased flexibility within that band.\nRBC's Mr Johnston pointed to the substantial reduction of risk on Origin's balance sheet as a result of the raising, which he noted comes after \"months of denial\" of the need for new equity.\n\"Origin does need to deliver on hefty opex cuts but the capex cuts should be relatively straight forward,\" he said in a note. \"The balance sheet risks have been addressed\".\nJPMorgan cut its net profit estimate for Origin in 2015-16 by 41 per cent and its earnings per share estimate by 62.7 per cent. For 2016-17 its estimate for net profit fell by 9.9 per cent, earnings per share estimate by 43.1 per cent and dividends per share by 71.4 per cent.\nOrigin's asset sale ambitions have meanwhile raised some doubts around the value creation from planned sales of pipelines, given the company would need to pay tolling fees to use the pipelines that it sells.\nUBS values the various pipelines at about $200 million, its PErth Basin assets at about $40 million and its Cullerin wind farm at $60 million.\nOrigin also said it would sell its 13 per cent stake in the Cooper Basin gas venture. UBS values the whole Cooper Basin venture at $1.3 billion but said Origin's stake could be worth over $200 million, given venture partners Santos and Beach Energy could potentially sell their interests as well, allowing for a more favourable price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:06:46.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
