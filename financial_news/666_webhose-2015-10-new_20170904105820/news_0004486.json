Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth Chinese miner Citic has been forced to inject $US3.1 billion of capital into its disastrous Sino Iron development in Western Australia , after writing $US2.5 billion off the value of the project.\nThe ballooning cost of Sino Iron, which has now topped $US12 billion ($16.8 billion), forced a bailout of Citic Pacific's balance sheet last year by the government-owned Citic Group.\nBut with the project still facing years of losses, there is intense pressure to allocate responsibility for the debacle, with Citic facing a billion-dollar battle over costs with its lead contractor, China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC).\nThe write-offs announced in March left Citic's Australian arm, Sino Iron Holdings, with net assets of just $US2.76 billion, of which almost half is comprised of tax losses.\nSino Iron's accounts show that by last December total costs for the project in WA had reached $US10.5 billion with a further $US545 million of work contracted. Rob Homer Citic did not disclose the $US3.1 billion capital injection it made on April 1 until last month. It follows a $US2 billion capital issue last year.\nThe position would be worse, but Sino Iron – which has been shipping magnetite ore from Port Preston since January 2014 with two production lines operational – continues to capitalise costs on the project.\nThis includes capitalising the income: proceeds from the ore sales are not reported as income nor in operating cash flow, with the sales revenue instead booked directly against capital outlays.\nSino Iron's four remaining operating lines are due to come onstream by the end of next year, which means that Citic is unlikely to disclose its full-year operating losses until it reports on its 2017 year. This would be in early 2018, four years after commercial shipments began.\nSino Iron has been shipping magnetite ore from Cape Preston Port since January 2014. Glenn Hunt Legal dispute The lack of reported revenue complicates the legal battle with Clive Palmer's company Mineralogy , which is entitled to royalties on exports. The two sides are in dispute over how to calculate these royalties.\nThe dispute with the project contractor, MCC, has continued in the background of the ongoing legal war with Mineralogy.\nSino Iron's accounts show that by last December total costs for the project had reached $US10.5 billion with a further $US545 million of work contracted.\nHowever, these figures did not include additional costs booked by MCC as losses, which would take the total past $US12 billion.\nIn March 2006 Mr Palmer's Mineralogy sold Citic rights to mine 2 billion tonnes of magnetite ore from its Balmoral deposit in north-west Australia, with a $US2.9 billion turnkey contract to build the mine and develop Cape Preston port.\nCitic instead appointed MCC as its engineering, procurement and construction contractor, confident that it could cut costs further.\nCost overruns In January 2013, MCC told Citic it had $US858 million in cost overruns on a fixed $US3.4 billion contract. This covered only two of the six production lines. In its annual report it blamed delays on \"extreme adverse weather condition, including typhoon\".\nIn addition it has cited problems with \"cyclo electric motors\", which had been purchased by Citic.\nMCC (Western Australia), the local subsidiary that has handled the project, has booked losses of $US654 million overall, and said MCC and Citic have commissioned an independent audit into MCC's costs.\nCitic said the audit will also consider \"the extent of the works completed by MCC (WA) in respect of the first two production lines, and the liability of MCC (WA) in respect of the extensive delays on completion of the works under the contract\".\nIn addition, Citic said it can claim $US530 million in liquidated damages for the delays in completing the project. MCC said the prospect of liquidated damages is \"remote\".\nLeading role for Chinese government It's only when the project goes into full production (presumably in 2017) that the audit will be finalised, when MCC said it will \"actively follow up with Citic Group for negotiation and discussion\" to work out how costs will be allocated.\nThe Chinese government is the majority shareholder of both Citic and MCC, which means no matter who wins the costs argument, the government loses.\nBy taking a leading role in rebuffing claims made by Mr Palmer, the Chinese government appeared to have limited its options. Walking away from the project, no matter how large the losses, would involve major loss of face.\nProduction costs are estimated to be more than $US90 a tonne. With the iron ore price trading between $US50 and $US60 a tonne, in full operation the project could lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\nCitic declined to comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:47.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
