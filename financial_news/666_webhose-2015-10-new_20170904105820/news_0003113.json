Ranked 97, Interbrand cited PayPal as one of five new entrants this year. \n\"We are a newly independent public company, and so we're especially honored to be recognized as one of the world’s most valuable brands. At PayPal, we aim to reimagine money for millions of people every single day all over the world,” said Christina Smedley VP, Global Brand and Communications of PayPal. “We value the trust our customers have in our brand, so it's great to see Interbrand recognize it too, as we seek to build a future that will enable the safer movement and management of money for everyone.” \nInterbrand publishes the ranking of the top 100 brands based on a unique methodology analyzing the many ways a brand touches and benefits an organization, from attracting top talent to delivering on customer expectation. Three key aspects contribute to a brand’s value; the financial performance of the branded products or services, the role of brand in the purchase decision process and the strength of the brand has to command a premium price, or secure earnings for the company. \nAbout PayPal \nAt PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL), we put people at the center of everything we do.
