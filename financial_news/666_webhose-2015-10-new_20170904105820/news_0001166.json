NetSpend Prepaid Card + 5% Savings Account by Harry Sit on 2 Comments \nThe Union Plus prepaid card with a linked 5% savings account closed shop. I opened a new NetSpend prepaid card as its replacement. \nNetSpend is a pioneer in prepaid cards. In fact the company behind Union Plus was founded by NetSpend’s founders. NetSpend is now part of TSYS, a NYSE-listed credit card processor with $2.5 billion in annual revenue. A prepaid card from NetSpend comes with a 5% savings account for up to $5,000 with no monthly fee. The card and savings account are provided by MetaBank, with full FDIC insurance. \nIt was very easy to set one up. Here are the steps. Remember to follow these in sequence. Don’t jump ahead too quickly. \n1. Order a card . You go to netspend.com and order a card . You give your name, address, and email. You set up a user id and password. \nIf you want extra $20, click on this refer-a-friend link when you order your card (I will get $20 too). \n2. Activate card . You will get a card in the mail in about a week. When you activate the card, you will see a routing number and account number for transferring money to the card by ACH from your bank. \n3. Set up ACH . You add the routing number and account number from NetSpend as a linked external account in your own checking account. Make sure the name on your checking account matches the name on your card, otherwise NetSpend may flag the account. \n4. ACH Deposit . Transfer $5,005 from your checking account to the NetSpend card. After the money arrives, click on Move Money -> Savings and follow the steps there to open a savings account. Transfer $5,000 from the card to the savings account. \nYou will get an email about qualifying for a low $5/month Fee Advantage Plan. Ignore it if you don’t plan to use the card often for purchases or ATM withdrawals. The fee-per-use plan you started with has no monthly fee. In about another week you will also get a new Premier card in the mail. Just activate it as usual. You can have two cards active on one account. \nDon’t call the privacy opt-out line. Otherwise your savings account may be closed. \n5. Set up recurring ACH . Set up in your checking account a recurring ACH transfer of $2 every 2 months to the NetSpend card. This will avoid the inactivity fee. \nThat’s it. After a one-time setup, everything runs on autopilot. Your $5,000 stays in the savings account earning 5%. Don’t touch it. \nInterest on your $5,000 is paid quarterly (~$60). You can just leave it in the savings account. Amount above $5,000 still earns 0.5%. Having your $60 earn only 0.5% instead of 1% isn’t a big deal. If you’d like, you can move the excess to the card once a year and pull it out by ACH. I wouldn’t do it more frequently than once a year. \nRepeat the above and get up to 3 cards per person. Remember to go slow: completely finish all steps for one card before requesting another card. Soon you will have $15k earning 5%. Double up for a couple and you will have $30k earning 5% between the two of you. Having $30k earn 5% is like having $150k earn 1% in a high yield savings account!
