Average interest rates for online savings accounts are less than two per cent, and for term deposits they are about 2.5 per cent. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied\n“If they want high and relatively stable income flow, bank dividends are a better bet,” he said.\n“But if they can’t tolerate volatility in the underlying investment, bank deposits are a better bet.”\nBank dividends have climbed strongly in recent years as profits climbed, but Dr Oliver said they were unlikely to grow at a similar pace in the year ahead.\n“But I can’t see them cutting their dividends — you would have to have a recession, and that seems unlikely at the moment.”\nShare dividends come with an attached franking credit worth 30c in the dollar, which at current prices pushes their income yield to between 7.9 per cent (Commonwealth Bank) and 9.1 per cent (ANZ).\nIn contrast, savings account interest rates have been falling for two years. A $5000, one-year term deposit at a major bank pays an average 2.52 per cent interest, while the base rate for online savings accounts averages 1.96 per cent, infochoice.com.au research found.\nWhat is the better option? ... While Bank shares are paying out more money for those who can’t tolerate volatility in the underlying investment, bank deposits are a better bet.

If the economy doesn’t go into a deep recession and nothing bad happens, it’s a really good risk to buy the banks.”\nMr Micahalakis said the outlook was tricky but he believed the fall in bank share prices had been overdone. “I think there is some reasonable value in bank shares.”\nHe said we were living in a low-interest world with not enough income, especially for retirees.\n“Retirees may have to take on a little more risk, but not too much. It’s tough,” he said.\nMost economists do not expect rises in savings account interest rates any time soon.\nBIG FOUR COMPARISONS\nIncome With franking Credit\nANZ 6.37% 9.1%\nNAB 6.33% 9.04%\nWestpac 5.83% 8.3%\nCBA 5.53% 7.9%\n1-year term deposit 2.52% N/A\nOnline savings account 1.96% N/A\nSource: Iress, infochoice.com.au (franking credits are 30c-in-the-dollar tax credits for company tax already paid)", "external_links": ["http://www.infochoice.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5d7a114fb831fe82b8d3e30197be7a14", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9b6394cfd03a6b6a640f4f5ec0a554a2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/442e7524bc4e6e5ee0d43de273e5727e", "https://www.amp.com.au/", "https://www.statewide.com.au/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-19T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:18:19.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
