All decisions are subject to the laws of Ireland and European laws,\" he told AFP. \nHe added: \"There's a significant economic benefit to the country having these companies here and we're more than happy to provide adequate first class regulation.\" \nBut there is no doubt the DPC favours a collaborative rather than combative approach to regulation. \n\"The office proactively engages with industry, helping to shape how companies work with data, rather than simply watching for transgressions,\" a DPC spokeswoman told AFP in an emailed statement. \nSchrems said: \"The idea that being friendly with companies is going to help is just childish.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:56:08.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
