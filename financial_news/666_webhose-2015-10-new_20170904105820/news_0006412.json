He started knocking on the doors of real estate agents. Peter Braig Share on twitter by Jake Mitchell\nNo job. No income. A huge mortgage. And five kids. That's where Antony Catalano, Fairfax Media senior executive and former journalist found himself in August 2008.\nIf there was an upside, it was that Catalano was living at his holiday house in sunny Byron Bay on New South Wales' north coast.\nBut things had become so dire that Catalano was considering using his redundancy payout – still a distant three months away – to buy the local coffee shop, Bayleaf, for $250,000. The one-time marketing and circulation head – and wunderkind – had had talks about jobs with Fairfax rivals News Corporation and APN News & Media but there were no offers.\nAntony and wife Stefanie, top right, with all the gang on holiday in Bali. Supplied In any case, he had a six-month non-compete agreement to sit out and, just to make his outlook gloomier, the global financial crisis was in full swing in Australia, decimating corporate jobs and spending.\n\"I was going to buy myself an income because I clearly wasn't qualified to do anything,\" the fast-talking 48-year-old, known as \"the Cat\", tells AFR Weekend over a recent dinner. \"I didn't have a degree, the economy was in tatters, I couldn't get a call back from anyone and the media industry was falling apart at a rate of knots.\"\nBut from that low point – and there was worse in store for him in those next few months – Catalano would mount one of the biggest comeback stories in corporate Australia. He is now Fairfax's biggest individual shareholder, and one of the media industry's most important executives. He's worth an estimated $70 million. And, ironically, the company that cast him off – Fairfax – is the one that has embraced him as he steers its growth engine, property portal and real estate advertising business Domain Group.\nAs its CEO, he's Mr Property in a property-obsessed country.\nDomain CEO Antony Catalano in front of one of many Domain billboards around Australia, this one in Melbourne. Josh Robenstone Charismatic and colourful Citi media analyst Justin Diddams says about 75 per cent of Fairfax's current $2.3 billion market valuation can be attributed to Domain.\n\"What's transpired is we've seen a broad re-rating in Fairfax's share price, underpinned by the value of that Domain asset.\n\"I think Catalano's very important to both Domain and Fairfax in the underlying value of that business,\" he says. \"He's charismatic and genuine. I think you could say a little bit colourful given some of the press coverage over the years. You can't argue that he's not an interesting guy.\"\nCatalano and third wife Stef on their wedding day. Supplied These days, Melbourne-based Catalano spends most of his trips to Sydney at Domain's new, but yet to be completed, office at 100 Harris Street, up the road from Fairfax's Pyrmont HQ at Darling Island. The move – to cope with Domain's bulging headcount, now at 600 nationally – has further fuelled rumours of an eventual spin-off via an initial public offering.\nThe new Domain arrivals are mostly young, digital-savvy types who prefer T-shirts to suits. Catalano is just as comfortable in this environment as he is presenting to the Fairfax board.\nHe's an affable and loquacious character, whose senses of humour and fashion are more Gen Y than Gen X.\nHe can generally be found in a pair of skinny jeans and sunglasses, talking on the phone at a million miles an hour, while still managing to say hi to five people that walk by.\nIt was this gregariousness and energy combined with a resilient streak that got him out of the unemployment line in 2008.\nRock bottom in Byron Bay One other thing Catalano had going for him back in 2008 was his chunky $970,000 Fairfax redundancy payment, even though that didn't arrive until November as he fought successfully for the cash for fringe benefits, such as an MBA with a Harvard component. (Not that he ever got around to finishing it.)\nAnd things went from bad to worse.\nHis wife, Shara, told him she wanted to split. Catalano returned to Melbourne in 2009, to move out of the family home on his birthday, March 11 (a birthday he shares with News Corp's Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson).\n\"In the space of six months, my life's turned to complete shit. I've got no job and my marriage has just ended, with five little kids,\" he says. \"So I went back to the only thing I knew how to do.\"\nCatalano had contacts in the Melbourne real estate market dating back to his days as property editor on The Age, in the mid-to-late 1990s. Ever since then, he had been pitching an idea to anybody who would listen at Fairfax for an equity model real estate publication that would be circulated free in Melbourne's premium suburbs. The theory was that if real estate agents could buy shares in the publication, they would be incentivised to advertise with it.\nBut nobody at Fairfax had shown much interest. So when he returned to Melbourne in early 2009, the jobless Catalano, with nothing to lose, started knocking on the doors of real estate agents, \"just seeing if they were interested in rekindling this idea\", he says.\nThere were a couple of hurdles. Fairfax's then chairman, Ron Walker, had a tight relationship with Melbourne real estate doyen and Kay & Burton chairman Gerald Delany. And Fairfax would be the main victim of such a swoop by Catalano on Melbourne's real estate advertising market.\nFortunately for Catalano's ambitions, in October 2009, Walker left the board. Catalano soon secured the backing of four foundation real estate agent shareholders – including Kay & Burton – for a new, Melbourne-based, glossy magazine. It would be called The Weekly Review , and would be distributed through the east, inner east and down to the southern bayside suburbs, from Kew and Hawthorn, through Toorak and South Yarra, to Port Phillip and down to Brighton and Sandringham.\nDelany was installed as a director of its publisher, Metro Media Publishing – wholly owned by Catalano and the real estate shareholders – and became a key intermediary between Catalano and the estate agents.\nThe four agencies deposited $50,000 each on Christmas Eve, 2009, with commitments for another $150,000 each in February. With his redundancy, loans from his parents and from future wife Stefanie, Catalano had enough cash to launch The Weekly Review in April, 2010.\nThe first edition was a dog-killing, 292-page brick that made a $256,000 profit.\nThe Cat was back.\nReal estate ad wars Fast forward five-and-a-half years and Catalano is at the helm of the division that is helping revive the 175-year-old Fairfax's market value.\nAustralia has a unique property market: high levels of home ownership mean that 70 per cent of the country's household wealth is tied up in real estate; when owners get ready to sell, they have a huge incentive to spend money marketing their home. That, in turn, has driven what is, by global standards, a highly sophisticated real estate advertising market. Meanwhile, as record low interest rates encourage investors and overseas buyers circle Australian pickings, property has boomed.\nDomain has been a regular feature in Fairfax flagship newspapers, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age , for more than 15 years after the existing highly popular real estate sections were rebranded.\nIn the past 10 years, the internet has wreaked havoc on what used to be the \"rivers of gold\" of real estate classified advertising in Australia's newspapers. But, unlike the car and job ads, the newspaper companies have been able to cash in on this vital stream as real estate advertising moved seamlessly online, spawning two thriving digital businesses: Domain and its larger competitor, REA Group, majority-owned by Fairfax's old enemy, News Corp.\nThe unwavering, 50-year war between the two companies now centres on that real estate advertising. News is formidable with its 61.6 per cent-owned REA Group, which controls the country's number one property marketing site, realestate.com.au. Between 2008 and 2014, REA surged from a $500 million company to a $6.7 billion digital titan.\nBut Catalano has an aggressive and innovative style that suits being the challenger. Peter Blunden, The Herald and Weekly Times managing director and long-time News Corp editor, has battled Catalano for more than a decade, as the Melbourne media heavyweights shuffled through various editorial and executive roles.\n\"He was always cutting a deal here and there, with an obvious eye on damaging us in some way,\" Blunden says. \"We've always enjoyed fierce competition and he's always been energetic and tried very hard to be a thorn in our side for many years in all sorts of capacities.\n\"I've enjoyed the competition a lot of the time, and other times I haven't.\"\nSerious contender For the year ended June 30, Catalano's Domain division – offering residential and commercial listings, news and property data – delivered revenue growth of 45 per cent to $229 million for the year, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up by 46 per cent to $86 million – although this included the acquisitions of Allhomes in Canberra and the remaining half of MMP for five months of the year.\nCiti analyst Justin Diddams estimates the rest of Fairfax's underlying revenue was down by 3 per cent over the same period.\nDomain is also the second-fastest-growing website in Australia in terms of additional monthly users, behind video streaming giant Netflix.\nSome have been critical of Domain as it rolls out Catalano's agent equity model nationally. John McGrath, of McGrath Estate Agents, said in April the model might entice agents to make marketing recommendations that were in their own interests, rather than the vendor's.\nMcGrath, who is also an REA director, declined to comment for this story.\nSince 2014, REA's growth has slowed; it no longer commands a hefty 40- to 50-times earnings valuation and its market value has come back to $6.1 billion.\nApplying REA's trading multiple to Domain, Diddams says the challenger is worth around $1.7 billion.\nAnalysts partly attributed REA's slowdown to the business reaching a more mature stage, and partly to broader industry issues such as higher clearance rates meaning less advertising time per dwelling, but it also came after Domain had emerged as a genuine competitor.\nYet compared to the broader sharemarket, REA's growth is still huge.\nThe company's revenue was up by 20 per cent to $522.9 million in fiscal 2015, while EBITDA surged by 27 per cent to $285.8 million.\nFrom here, observers say, the industry will go one of three ways: REA could kick away again, Domain could catch the leader or we'll end up with the kind of steady duopoly that seems to suit Australia so well.\nEither way, Catalano will be critical to the result.\nFrom factory floor to the front page He is also one of the most interesting, headline-prone executives in Australian media. In the past three years, he has been charged with two counts of drink-driving. One was thrown out after a magistrate ruled blood samples were unlawfully taken, while Catalano is appealing the conviction on the other, which saw his licence cancelled for 16 months in August.\nAnd now there are eight kids. His youngest, Jack, was born last month and is one of three with his 30-year-old wife, Stef. She previously worked as a flight attendant, and played a crucial role helping Catalano to launch and run MMP in its early days. He has four children with Shara, who worked in the outdoor advertising industry, and his oldest son, Jordan, came from his first marriage to Leisha Lowe, a teacher.\nThe Catalano tribe likes to holiday at Byron Bay's iconic Rae's on Wategos resort, which The Cat owns (although this was not his 2008 residence).\nHe has about 30 million Fairfax shares' worth of skin in the game. Fairfax shares closed at 94.5 cents on Friday, which values his stake at $28.4 million.\nLike many soldiers in the Fairfax/News Corp war, Catalano has fought for both sides. He tells his stories with relish.\nThe middle child of Italian immigrants Anna and Antonio, Catalano barely spoke English until he arrived at Sacred Heart primary school in 1973. The school was around the corner from the family home in the south-east Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh.\nWhen he finished high school at Salesian College in Chadstone, he went to work as a fitter and turner in a factory, after being spurned by Fairfax's The Age . In January 1985, knee-deep in oil and wearing overalls, Catalano got a call from News Corp's Herald and Weekly Times, asking if he could come in for an interview. He scrubbed up and headed over to the Southbank office.\nDuring the interview, he relates, human resources director Bill Hoey called in The Sun News-Pictorial chief of staff Russell Robinson.\n\"This is Antony Catalano. He speaks Italian,\" Hoey explained.\n\"Well, that'll come in f---ing handy won't it,\" Robinson snapped back.\nNevertheless, Catalano was asked to start as a copy boy on the Pictorial the next day. It happened to be the year The Herald and Weekly Times had launched an equal opportunity program.\n\"Myself and [journalist] Vicki Kyriakopoulos got jobs that year,\" Catalano says. \"It was quite unusual to have us wogs in the newsroom at the time.\"\nThe dreaded \"five-point\" round soon called – five-point was the size of the font used to write up horse racing and district cricket results. After 18 months of that, Catalano mustered up the courage to ask if he could try something else in \"journalism\".\nHe was moved to the police round in August 1987. His first job was covering the Hoddle Street massacre, when a troubled 19-year-old, Julian Knight, shot dead seven people in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of Clifton Hill.\nHumiliating headlines Catalano explains how he and a colleague got through the police cordon by driving through the back streets.\n\"It was a terrifying night in so many ways. Apart from the extraordinary grief of seven people being murdered and another 19 injured, it was the first time I'd ever had to write a story.\"\nIn the end, a coherent piece was filed and a smug Catalano was cautioned that not all of his yarns would run off the front page. But he was soon competing with his fellow police reporters to see who could jag the most page one stories (they kept a tally on the wall).\nCatalano mentions – soberly – that he also saw many young lives tragically ended as a result of drink-driving during his time on the police beat.\n\"If I could have my time again, I would prefer not to have to be contesting a drink-driving charge. It's not something that I condone,\" he says. And he admits Fairfax would prefer not to see his name in the newspapers for drink-driving.\nBut he stresses he is not a big drinker.\n\"Anybody who knows me will tell you that,\" he says.\nCatalano's latest charge – for which he was convicted and is appealing – saw him blow a 0.08 blood alcohol reading in March 2014.\nHe says he was celebrating his birthday last year at a rented house in Portsea, and a few family members and friends headed out when he went to bed about 1am.\n\"They called me and said, 'We can't get home. There's no cabs. Can you come and pick us up?'\n\"I didn't even think about it.\"\nOn the previous occasion, in October 2012, Catalano complained of pains in his arm, which he says had been sustained during a tennis match, after a preliminary breath test showed traces of alcohol.\nPolice called an ambulance and he was taken to Epworth Hospital, where reports have suggested he was unwilling to have his blood taken. He was cleared of charges relating to that incident after a magistrate ruled blood samples taken from him were unlawful.\nIronically, it has been the Herald Sun – which was amalgamated from The Sun News-Pictorial and afternoon daily The Herald, and comes under Blunden's watch – that has given the most column inches to Catalano's drink-driving infringements. Not altogether surprising: he's a big Melbourne identity and works for arch-rival Fairfax.\n'One of the great entrepreneur journalists' But back in 1990 at the Pictorial, nobody could have predicted he would end up on the News hit list.\nFairfax soon came knocking. Catalano was approached to be The Age 's night shift police reporter in August 1990, which led to a brief stint as chief police reporter before he moved to the subeditors' bench. And then there was a fortuitous meeting. He began dating a woman who shared a house with a real estate agent from Hocking Stuart called Scott McElroy, now the head of Hocking Stuart's Melbourne office.\nThe two men got on well. McElroy, his father, sister and Catalano bought a warehouse in Windsor together, for $115,000 each, and subdivided it into four properties.\nThis was towards the end of 1994 and The Age 's long-time property editor, Tim Graham, had just left abruptly. Editor Alan Kohler needed a replacement.\nHe approached Catalano, \"You know something about the property market don't you?\"\n\"Well, ahh … I've been to a few auctions and I'm converting a warehouse,\" the 27-year-old sub replied.\n\"Yeah I heard that. You want to be property editor?\"\nKohler points out now that he put a little more thought into the decision than that.\n\"He was a really hungry reporter … lively and hard-working,\" says Kohler, who went on to found online business newsletters Business Spectator and the Eureka Report .\n\"He was a terrific young reporter and I knew he'd be good at property and that's how it turned out to be.\"\nKohler is another journalist-turned-entrepreneur who, in 2012, sold his Australian Independent Business Media (with co-investors) to News Corp for about $30 million.\n\"Catalano is one of the great entrepreneur journalists in Australia,\" he says.\nPenchant for property Catalano began writing a property gossip column called Trading Places, later Private Property. It was a crucial period in his career. He began forging relationships with Melbourne's real estate agents. They were vital for finding out who was buying what property.\n\"It was really that column that transformed my relationship with the estate agents from being a journo to a trusted reporter within the industry to a friend and ultimately to a business partner,\" Catalano explains. \"People talk about overnight success stories. Mine was a 20-year overnight success story.\"\nIn 2001, Fairfax's current chief executive Greg Hywood arrived in Melbourne as The Age 's editor-in-chief and publisher. Catalano fed information to his new boss about a plot between News Corp and a group of real estate agents to move much of The Age 's Saturday advertising to the Herald Sun .\nHywood noted that Catalano was far more commercially attuned than the average journo and asked him how he saw his future.\n\"I want your job,\" Catalano said.\n\"Fine,\" Hywood replied. \"But you won't get it by staying a journo.\"\nIt was time for Catalano to join the dark (commercial) side of the newspaper.\n\"I made him head of our real estate classifieds business,\" Hywood says. \"He performed brilliantly.\"\nDefeat from the jaws of victory Catalano first thought of the idea for an equity model real estate publication in 1998. He had been brainstorming about ways to \"kill\" Eric Beecher's new glossy real estate magazine, The Melbourne Weekly , which had emerged as an irritant to the The Age . In response, Fairfax launched the Melbourne Property Guide in 2000, with Catalano later installed to run it. But his recommendation that it be based on his idea for an equity model was ignored.\n\"It was the most disastrous launch into the suburban gloss market … a completely uncommercial model,\" he says.\nNevertheless, Catalano went hard at the ball once he was its boss.\nMonday, September 22, 2003, the night of that year's AFL Brownlow Medal presentation in Melbourne, found him in Sydney on Fairfax meetings at The Sydney Morning Herald. And instead of rubbing shoulders with Melbourne's heavy hitters, Catalano was holed up in his room at Darling Harbour's Medina hotel, working on the biggest deal of his budding executive career.\nFive real estate agencies – Kay & Burton, Marshall White, Bennison Mackinnon, Carmichael & Weber and Jellis Craig – made up basically all of The Melbourne Weekly 's $15 million worth of annual property ad revenue.\nCatalano was poised to win them all away. That night, he worked his hotel phone and fax machine into overdrive. By the time he had dropped into bed, exhausted, he had four of the five key agencies, worth about $12 million in ad revenue, signed up to the Melbourne Property Guide . Only Jellis Craig was left and Catalano was due to meet its principal, Richard Jellis, in Melbourne the next day – Tuesday – to sign the contract in person.\n\"I'm in my room on my own, literally doing a jig every time a contract comes through,\" he says. \"Interestingly, all five of those agents would play a very big part of my life in 2010.\"\nSo excited was he that he checked out of the hotel at 5am so he could jump on the first flight to Melbourne.\nThe first thing he saw, when he sat down in economy class, was a man sleeping in the seat directly behind him. Protruding from his front shirt pocket was his boarding pass. The name read \"Chan, Nick,\" – or Nick Chan, the then chief executive of The Melbourne Weekly 's parent company, Text Media.\nChan, who was most recently Seven West Media chief operating officer until he resigned in December 2014, had received a call from a panicked Eric Beecher, telling him to jump on the first flight to Melbourne.\nThe Text Media chief was confident of winning the clients back but he knew what he was up against.\n\"Catalano is Mr Real Estate in Melbourne,\" Chan tells AFR Weekend . \"He knows everyone and knows the market.\"\nBut soon after landing in Melbourne, Catalano had his own mortification. He says Fairfax commercial director Alan Revell rang and, instead of showing delight in Catalano's news, asked him to hold off, sign no more contracts and wait for a phone call from then Fairfax chief executive, Fred Hilmer, the former McKinsey management consultant and chair of the National Competition Policy Review Committee, which presented its Hilmer Report in 1993. (Catalano's mentor, Hywood was, by now, out of the picture, having been removed by Hilmer three months earlier.)\nWhen Hilmer finally called on the Wednesday, he revealed that Fairfax had just done a deal to buy Text Media for $67 million.\n\"Why would you do that? I've just killed it!\" Catalano says he exclaimed in disbelief.\nHilmer added that it was only a handshake agreement with Beecher at that point, and Catalano begged his boss to reneg. To no avail. The deal was announced the following Monday.\n\"I was absolutely gutted,\" Catalano says. \"For me personally it was the biggest coup of my career.\" (Much later, he closed down or merged most of the publications that came with the Text deal.)\nSuddenly sent packing In October 2005, former All Blacks captain David Kirk arrived as Fairfax chief executive and Catalano – by then, The Age's head of real estate and general classifieds – entered an unhappy period. Passed over for the role of The Age 's managing director, he was was made redundant three years later by the man who took that job, New Zealander Don Churchill.\nCatalano recalls a senior management meeting in mid-2006, where the other seven people in the room had less Fairfax experience combined than his 16 years.\nChurchill's focus was cutting costs; Catalano's primary objective was growth.\n\"You manage your costs as a responsible part of business management but you don't cut your way to success,\" he argues. \"So he and I were ideologically opposed from day one.\"\nTension built up with arguments about strategy becoming a daily occurrence.\nOn August 26, 2008, Catalano was made redundant, part of 550 job cuts in Australia and New Zealand. The Age 's editor-in-chief, Andrew Jaspan, went as well, but Catalano was the first.\nSecurity guards at Spencer Street HQ were called to escort the then 41-year-old executive back to his desk. Churchill followed him.\n\"They gave me a few moments to say goodbye to the 100-odd staff in my department and a box for my 18 years' worth of belongings,\" Catalano says. \"Then they escorted me to my car and sent me packing.\"\nThe emotion in his voice is palpable at this point. \"It was a gut-wrenching moment because I'd spent my whole life there,\" he says. \"It was the only thing I knew and I completely didn't see it coming. I thought once this guy left, I would be the MD.\"\nYet Catalano is philosophical about his demise.\n\"I probably was too vested in the business,\" he admits, and adds, \"I'm terrible at managing up. I should have been more respectful with the boss.\"\nBigger and better But in hindsight, Catalano's schism with Churchill paid dividends. Churchill had inadvertently created a monster, a competitor with something to prove. When Catalano went on to launch Metro Media Publishing – and The Weekly Review – in April 2010, he ripped about $20 million of revenue out of The Melbourne Weekly , then owned by Fairfax, with multi-year advertising contracts signed with many of the estate agents.\nThe big media companies that hadn't called the unemployed Catalano back two years before, in 2008, were now lining up to talk about doing a deal.\nMMP rapidly expanded its real estate agent client base; by June, it had launched its second publication, in Ivanhoe, in Melbourne's north-east.\nOne of the first to reach out was old News Corp rival Peter Blunden. A meeting between Catalano and News Corp's senior executive team, including then CEO John Hartigan and then chief operating officer Peter Macourt, was set up at the company's Holt Street bunker in Sydney.\nCatalano offered them 25 per cent of MMP for $25 million but News wasn't interested at that price; some executives in the organisation also weren't comfortable with the agent equity model.\nNext meeting was with Greg Ellis, REA's then chief executive. Catalano offered him 5 per cent for $5 million. The Cat seemed to be working on a magic $100 million valuation overall.\n\"It was about validating to the estate agents that they had created something of real value,\" he says now.\nHe also had talks with Macquarie Group, and former Fairfax chief Brian McCarthy before McCarthy left the company abruptly in December 2010.\nIn the end, the critical phone call came from then acting chief executive Greg Hywood – by now returned to Fairfax at the invitation of new chair Roger Corbett – later that month, when Catalano was celebrating a remarkable year, with Stef, in Las Vegas.\n\"I'm ringing to try to fix this mess you've created for us,\" Hywood told his protégé from nearly a decade earlier.\nBut many of the Fairfax board had been around when Catalano was shot in 2008; they were reluctant to hand over millions of dollars to him. Hywood had the job of convincing them to sign off on the deal, pointing to the risks MMP posed to The Age's real estate revenue, particularly if News Corp partnered up with Catalano.\nIt took a year but the deal was finally announced on December 23, 2011. Fairfax paid $35 million in cash and rolled 32 community titles into MMP in exchange for half of the business. (Three years later, Fairfax would pay another $70 million, mostly in scrip, for the other half.)\nMaster of his Domain MMP took over the sales functions for Fairfax's Domain business in Victoria.\nThe Domain division had already been identified as a strong business opportunity. In 2012, Seven West Media and Fairfax held talks about a joint venture in Perth, although this didn't go anywhere. But Domain needed more investment and the first step was moving it into a separate business unit in April 2013.\nJustin Diddams, Citi's media analyst comments, \"The most sensible thing Fairfax management have done in recent times is to separate out Domain into its own business unit and give it some oxygen to allow the market to be able to accurately reflect the value of that business.\"\nThen Fairfax needed the right person to run it. Given MMP already had control of Domain's sales in Victoria and Fairfax was keen to roll out the equity model nationally, Catalano was the inescapable choice.\nHe agreed on November 17, 2013, and started the next day.\nCatalano has since added hundreds of staff across multiple divisions that cover everything from product to sales to marketing and editorial, overseen the $50 million acquisition of Allhomes, Canberra's leading property portal, and real estate data service PriceFinder, and bulked up Domain's editorial output and social media engagement.\nAs Ray White chairman Brian White says, Catalano has brought Domain \"right into the game\".\n\"It's the first time Fairfax has had an expert in this area that really understands the thinking, motivations and fears of agents,\" White says. \"It was probably the gap between REA and Domain that gave him the opportunity to be fearless and quite creative in his ideas.\"\nIronically, one thing Domain and REA have to look forward to is a cooling property market.\nWith auction clearance rates pushing towards 80 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne for much of the year, fewer houses have had to be readvertised after being passed in at auction. Last weekend, the clearance rate dropped to 65 per cent in Sydney and 73 per cent in Melbourne.\nIn the sweet spot CBA Equities analyst Alice Bennett reckons the sweet spot for the real estate advertising game is about 60 per cent. When the clearance drops to these levels, there are more properties that need to be readvertised after a standard 30- or 45-day campaign, but the market is still hot enough to entice strong turnover.\nREA and Domain are also looking to adjacent businesses, such as generating sales leads for utilities services and mortgages, for the next growth stage. There's a delicate balancing act as the companies try to satisfy the equity market's insatiable appetite for growth, without disaffecting their key estate agent clients through excessive price hikes.\nMeanwhile, Catalano has made his comeback, his money and his point.\nMarshall White marketing director Sean Cussell was the first estate agent to sign the equity deal with MMP, in 2009, and has known Catalano since his days as a journalist, 20 years ago.\n\"Cat's known for building teams around him and because of his confidence and belief in himself, he builds a very loyal team,\" Cussell says.\n\"They know, if he's got a goal in front of him, he doesn't give up.\n\"He's one of those unique individuals that is running 24/7.\"\nSo does Catalano want to be Fairfax CEO or boss of a Domain spin-off?\n\"I've got no particular desire to do that,\" he says. \"I don't know if my personal make-up is suited to being a public company CEO.\"\nSo what drives him?\n\"From a personal point of view, I've spent 20 years at Fairfax,\" he says.\n\"It's an incredibly important part of our community and has played a vital role in being the fourth estate. It use to be funded by classifieds and restoring the rivers of gold was always about protecting the thing we do best, which is journalism.\n\"I really enjoy what I do and I'm not sure retiring to Byron Bay at this age would stimulate me.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jakemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:05:08.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
