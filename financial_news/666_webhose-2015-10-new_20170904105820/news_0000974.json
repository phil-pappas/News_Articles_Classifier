The average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in the in August was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. \nWhile it's great that Tesla's Model X and its falcon-wing doors are going to be able to drive for 250 miles before charging, it's also not going to be here until late 2016 at the earliest. And while it's great that the Model 3 will be about $30,000 when it arrives, Tesla hasn't even mentioned a release date for it in a while. That leaves the current crop of vehicles about halfway to the benchmark that the EPA and Department of Transportation set back in 2012. However, Tesla isn't the only one falling short in the race to higher fuel efficiency. The Chevrolet Bolt that General Motors announced at the Detroit Auto Show more than a year ago claims it will offer 200 miles of electric range for $30,000 after incentives, but is still more concept than reality.
