It suggests that the Masters big-box home improvement chain is still losing money, even though a new store format is said to be delivering encouraging sales growth.\nThe latest top-up occurred just weeks before October 20, when Lowe's can officially exercise a put option requiring Woolworths to buy out its 33 per cent stake .\nAdvertisement Under the terms of the joint-venture agreement, Lowes has to give 13 months notice if it wants Woolworths to buy back its stake.\nAnalysts said Lowe's willingness to inject another $35 million into the joint venture, taking its total investment over the past six years to $1.11 billion, was not necessarily a sign that the US retailer remained committed to Masters in the long term.\n\"They're willing to put it in knowing that they can get it back,\" one analyst told Fairfax Media.\nShut down However, if Lowe's decides to exercise the put option the price it receives from Woolworths may fall well short of its original investment, especially if Woolworths pulls the pin on the heavily loss-making Masters chain.\nThe option requires Woolworths to pay Lowe's \"fair value\", based on a discounted cash flow methodology which takes into account sales density in new-format stores, revised store rollout plans and the time it will take for Masters to reach maturity.\n\"It depends what valuation model they adopt â€“ there's a good chance of a disagreement around that if (Masters) is shut down,\" one analyst said. \"It becomes a more vague concept of fair market value if it's closed down.\"\nThe put option is currently in Woolworths' accounts as an $886.5 million financial liability.\nLosses at Masters blew out from $176 million to $245 million in 2015, while profits at Home Timber and Hardware recovered to $20.9 million, taking total home improvement losses to $224.7 million in 2015 and to $604 million over the past four years.\nSales at new-format stores are stronger than those at original stores, but analysts say sales per store would have to rise 50 per cent to 100 per cent before Masters stores break even.\nThey believe Woolworths will struggle to find a buyer for Masters in its current form and would be better off pulling the plug to prevent further losses. However, Woolworths has indicated it is a patient investor, pointing to the many years it took for discount chain BIG W to make a profit.\nMasters has 10 stores trading under the new format and hopes to retrofit about half its 58 stores by the end of 2016.\nIn a report in April, Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford estimated it would cost Woolworths $1.6 billion to exit leases and buy out Lowe's, but it could recoup between $700 million and $970 million selling sites and stock, so the net loss would be between $300 million and $900 million.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/retail/woolworths-could-unlock-treasure-chest-by-dumping-masters-20151008-gk4ddz", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/clock-ticks-on-woolworths-and-lowes-hardware-partnership-20151006-gk2vja"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:06:04.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
