Sydney jumped 2.10 per cent, Hong Kong finished up 1.41 per cent and Shanghai gained 0.48 per cent. \nHowever, Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand, warned clients \"the stabilisation in risk sentiment looks relatively tentative to us. We'd be wary of another deterioration in Asia today as funding costs spike in China ahead of a week-long holiday.\" \nChinese markets are closed from Thursday for the National Day holiday week. \nWELLINGTON - The S&P/NZX 50 Index fell 19.06 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5593.36. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:36:41.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
