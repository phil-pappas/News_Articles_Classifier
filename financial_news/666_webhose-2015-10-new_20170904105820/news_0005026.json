Earlier this year I received an email from a man asking about reserving accommodation for six days. \nI replied, reserving a room and asking for a deposit of 20pc of the £455 total. He then wrote that his company would provide a French bank draft, from which he asked me to deduct the full amount for accommodation and any bank charges. Two days later he wrote asking me to send the balance remaining from that draft to his “travelling agent”. \nI paid the bank draft for €2,700 (£1,855) into my account at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . No one indicated to me then or later that there was anything untoward about it. The paying-in slip was clipped to a note of warning but no one drew my attention to the practical implications of what this involved. \nSix days later the “guest” wrote asking me to transfer the £1,400 balance to the “travelling agent”. \nA week after paying in the bank draft I visited the branch and asked if it had cleared. I was told it had. Because of my concern about this unusual arrangement, I pressed for further confirmation. The clerk told me that, if it had not cleared, there would be a “U” for “uncleared” against the entry in my bank account. He showed me on the screen that there was no such mark. \nFrom what happened next you will see that Barclays has failed woefully to protect me from fraud. Then, even worse, it will not help me remedy the situation. CB, South of England \nDespite the reassurance you had been given, three days after you transferred the balance you received a letter from Barclays informing you that the bank draft was fraudulent. \nHaving got nowhere with Barclays over this you reported it via Action Fraud to the police. You battled on but the bank denied responsibility, although it sent £200 for goodwill . \n• 'I transferred £400 but it was a scam' \nA cheque or draft issued in foreign currency and payable at a foreign bank to beneficiaries in Britain has to be sent abroad to the bank from which it was drawn. The clearing can take several weeks. This draft was being processed on a “collection” basis. This means that the bank will credit the customer’s account but can still reclaim the money if the payment bounces. This will have been explained in the leaflet you received. \nThis scam made a very large dent in your season’s profit. Barclays is not changing its mind on this and you are taking the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service . \nAction Fraud can be contacted via actionfraud.police.uk or 0300 123 2040. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:34:46.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
