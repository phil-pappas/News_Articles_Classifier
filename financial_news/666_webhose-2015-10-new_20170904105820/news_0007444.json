Wayne Taylor Share on twitter by Michael Smith The loss of Medibank Private's chief executive less than a year after its $5.7 billion initial public offer was something that was never in the prospectus.\nThe decision by George Savvides to step down five months from now looks abrupt and raises questions about why the relatively fit 59-year-old would want to go at this stage of the company's transition.\nSavvides has been waiting in the wings to be the chief executive of a large listed company for the past 13 years. He has been running Medibank for the same amount of time, overseeing its transition to a for-profit company five years ago when the global financial crisis put the brakes on the initial public offer timetable.\nThis makes his decision to step down, less than a year after Medibank listed, even more curious.\nAbout 340,000 Australians have money riding on Savvides who steered the company out of government ownership when it floated on the stock exchange last year for $5.7 billion. This is why the timing of his departure warrants more scrutiny.\nMedibank dropped a bomb just hours before its annual shareholder meeting with news Savvides was leaving 15 months earlier than his contract stipulated. The timing meant that the proxies for the meeting had already been lodged before shareholders were aware the chief executive was stepping down.\nSome investors are incensed by the decision, saying there was no indication when they spoke to Savvides as recently as four weeks ago that he was planning to leave. They are also highly critical of the board.\nHowever, others believe Savvides was the ideal person to oversee the transition but it is the right time for him to make way for someone who can accelerate the work the health insurer needs to do on efficiency gains. They believe Savvides' strengths lay in the softer aspects of a consumer-facing strategy but a new face is needed to make the tough financial and operational decisions.\n Savvides and Medibank chairman Elizabeth Alexander say they have been talking about chief executive succession for some time and that they both agree it is the right time for new blood to steer the company through its next phase.\nWhile Savvides gave a convincing explanation when asked by journalists Wednesday about his sudden departure, there are still unanswered questions about what looks like a sudden decision.\nHe said he has been speaking to Alexander on a regular basis about succession. But when pressed on the matter, he said the actual decision to step down early was made on Tuesday night.\n\"We have touch points on succession at least twice a year,\" he said, side-stepping the question about exactly when he first told the chairman he would be departing 15 months earlier than his contract stipulated.\nIt is understood there has been ongoing tension between Savvides and Alexander, who was appointed chairman in 2013. Some investors say the government-appointed board has been struggling with the accountability that comes running a listed company.\nThe fact that Savvides is sacrificing $1.2 million in performance rights which would have been awarded under a long-term incentive plan is another clue that the timing of his departure has not gone according to plan.\nSavvides' decision to leave just as his efforts to deliver on long-hatched plans to improve shareholder efficiency are bearing fruit follows the departure of Laz Costios, Medibank's former chief customer officer, who moved to Australia Post earlier this year. Finance chief Paul Koppleman has been in his role since May 2012.\nWhile Medibank will also look at external candidates for the top job, internal front-runners include chief operating officer David Koczkar. Some investors also praised Medibank's head of hospitals, Andrew Wilson.\nSavvides has not had an easy run in the last 12 months although he will be leaving on a strong note after the company exceeded its 2015 financial year prospectus targets.\nWhile he will not directly criticise the way the Medibank IPO was priced, Savvides said in an interview with this column in April that his job was made more challenging by the pressure on the government to maximise its returns from the sale.\nThere were suggestions at the time the IPO - priced at the top of the range - was overvalued, although those valuations now look justified based on the current share price. Medibank went to the market at 24 times earnings compared with 18 times for rival insurer nib.\nWhile Medibank had a poor run in the early months following its IPO, the stock picked up after the full-year results.\nRetail investors paid $2 a share for Medibank shares while institutional investors paid $2.15. The stock fell 2.4 per cent to close at $2.49 on Wednesday. It is still up 28 per cent from a 52-week low of $1.94 on August 18.\nMedibank increased net profit 118 per cent to $285.3 million in the year ended June 30, beating the prospectus forecast of $251 million.\nBut the key metric for Medibank is its management expense ratio - the cost of administering policies as a proportion of premium revenue. This fell to 8.6 per cent from 9.2 per cent in the prior year.\nSavvides, who is about to become a grandfather and wants to spend more time with his family, was never going to stick around for years. One line is that the board didn't want a repeat of the distracting succession speculation that dogged companies such as Myer when chief executive contracts came up for renewal.\nSavvides has been vocal in public healthcare policy and says he wants to play a role in reforming the healthcare sector to make it more affordable. He will have no issues finding an advisory role in the sector post Medibank.\nA speedboat enthusiast, he also plays veterans' hockey for Melbourne University.\nSavvides' early retirement adds to the list of surprise departures from the senior ranks of top 200 companies announced on Wednesday. Origin Energy finance chief Karen Moses and IAG chairman Brian Schwartz are also going.\nMiner gets breathing space BHP Billiton has been given some breathing space with a stronger-than-expected first quarter performance which gives it some flexibility to stave off shareholder criticism of its progressive dividend policy.\nThe global miner did not change its full-year guidance but posted strong numbers in copper, petroleum and iron ore which beat analysts' expectations.\nIt also cut its guidance for capital expenditure in its petroleum division by US$200 million to $US2.9 billion in the 2016 financial year. This gives it some balance sheet firepower to maintain its progressive dividend.\nCiti analysts believe further cuts to capex will be required to achieve the sacrosanct progressive dividend policy. They are forecasting a capex burn of US$1.7 billion in the 2016 financial year.\nIt was a good start though for BHP ahead of a challenging year. BHP shares closed 1 per cent higher at $24.23.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:01:58.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
