Rob Homer by Geoff Winestock and Angela Macdonald The RBA says many small miners are on the brink of bankruptcy as the share of companies at serious risk rises to levels last seen during the financial crisis.\nIn its quarterly Financial Stability Review the RBA said the financial ills of the resources sector were masked by the relatively strong BHP and Rio Tinto.\nThe RBA said that after taking these two firms out, the general level of financial health in the sector was weakening quickly as commodity prices remained low and firms started to run through cash they built up during the boom years.\n\"Although the debt-servicing capacity of many of the smaller resource producers has been supported by strong liquidity positions to date, continued low commodity prices would erode these positions in time,\" the RBA said.\nIt said many smaller mining companies could face difficulty rolling over debt. While only a few firms had collapsed so far, the RBA said that banks have told it confidentially that the share of resource-related non-performing loans was rising and could get much worse if interest rates rose.\nThe RBA published a measure of \"distance-to-default\" which found that the weakest 10 per cent of mining firms were as vulnerable as during the global financial crisis in 2009.\n\"The distance-to-default estimated for the more vulnerable (and usually smaller) resource producers and mining services companies have fallen to their lowest levels since the financial crisis,\" the RBA said.\nThe good news is that Australian banks are unlikely to be threatened by defaults of small miners because loans to the resource sector account for only 2 per cent of their assets and are concentrated on safer bigger miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto. Most debt has been raised on wholesale corporate debt markets.\n Several junior iron ore miners went to the wall in 2014 after a dive in prices, including Termite Resources, Western Desert Resources and Pluto Resources, while Queensland coal miner Bandanna Energy also fell into administration.\nThis year has seen the collapse of several mining services companies, including WDS and Big Rim Pty, while several logistics providers to the mining industry have also fallen into difficulties, including Brisbane-based Sargent, and Heavy Haulage Australia, which went into voluntary administration in June.\nNickel producer Mirabela Nickel, which had been revived from administration last year through a recapitalisation plan, entered administration again last month.\nSeveral others are under severe pressure, including debt-laden mining equipment rental company Emeco, while iron ore miner Atlas Iron is surviving by means of a profit-sharing agreement struck with its contractors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:47:00.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
