Lawmakers also held steady the government's outlook for oil production of 2.247 million barrels per day and an oil price of $50 per barrel.\nCongressmen also approved late on Monday a proposal to cut taxes on some sugar-sweetened drinks despite concerns the move would hinder the fight against obesity in Latin America's No. 2 economy.
