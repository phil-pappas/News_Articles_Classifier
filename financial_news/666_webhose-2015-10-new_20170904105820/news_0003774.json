Headquartered in London, the EIC has a global network of offices, from regional UK offices in Teesside and Aberdeen, to international offices in Rio de Janeiro, Houston, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:50:44.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
