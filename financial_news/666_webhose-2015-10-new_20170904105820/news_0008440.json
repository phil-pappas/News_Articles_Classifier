The German conglomerate, which has a market valuation of $96 billion, arguably reigns supreme in the adventure motorbike sector if you're in the market for a two-wheeled steed to tackle desert terrains, jagged mountain corners and dirt. On the road, BMW also manufactured its iconic boxer engined motorcycles such as the R1200RT that has been a staple in their product line-up for years.\nThe one item absent from its product list was a superbike – a sports motorcycle that would tug at the heartstrings of younger, adrenaline-seeking riders who would normally not have glanced at BMW for a potential purchase.\n\"BMW was a brand for old men – it was not sexy,\" Sepp Maechler, BMW Motorrad's product manager, admitted with a laugh. \"But when we did the market analysis, we knew a lot of our customers who were riding say a GS… were also riding a supersports bike.\"\n\"And we thought, why not? Let's give them an opportunity [and] show what BMW is really able to do with a superbike.\"\nS1000RR Enter the BMWS1000RR – a 199 horsepower superbike created after years of research under the watch of German engineers in the company's research and development plants. When the bike was first launched in 2010, it sent shockwaves throughout the Japanese and Italian-dominated supersports market, garnering a fan base of thousands across the world thanks to its razor sharp handling, power output and overall design. BMW now controls 21 per cent of new sales in the highly competitive superbike market.\n This year, BMW unveiled the latest incarnation of the S1000RR. It is now four kilograms lighter, jammed with more electronic aids including up and down quick shifter, dynamic traction control, cruise control and ABS for razor sharp braking control.\nTaking the Double R out on around Phillip Island's MotoGP circuit was pure, unadulterated revhead pleasure. Wack the bike into its most sedate setting – rain mode – and the BMW continues to punch through the corners of the race track as if they were easy target practice.\nThe bike changes direction to tackle one turn to another with a razor efficiency that is a strong salute to its precise German engineering roots. Lean angle sensors give riders a clear vision of how far they are leaning their steeds over, while its powerful 999cc inline four engine red-lines at 14,500 rpm.\nBut the proof is the grins on the faces of riders as they enter pit lane after each session. The verdict? The bike is a weapon of a sports machine to ride.\nAt $22,990 plus on-road costs, the BMW is a luxury sportsbike that would still require serious cash and commitment from fans . The BMW's Japanese counterparts are several thousand dollars cheaper, with increasingly improving technology.\nBut BMW's commitment to the sportsbike market appears to be solid for the foreseeable future. Mr Maechler said BMW had no desire to stop refining the RR, and it would continue pouring R&D funds into improvements.\n\"The people who ride the supersports bikes are technical – but they also have money, and they want adventure and challenge. With this bike, it's a brand-changer and we want to show them what we can do.\"\nR1200R It's a gentleman's machine that has gone through the refinement sieve. BMW introduced its new R1200R roadster in 2015 after much hype about its revamp in Intermot at Cologne, Germany. More than a simple redesign, the new R1200R is a major departure from its predecessor an all-round excellent road bike boasting a tele-lever front end and conventional boxer engine.\nThe R retains an 1170 cc boxer engine, but the new liquid-cooled machine acts as if it's been injected with steroids. Improved handling comes naturally with active suspension that can be adjusted on the fly, while cruise control makes highway mileage an easy exercise. It's also proved to be a high-spirited machine armed with typical BMW stability . Going through a corner, the R's front wheel hit a jagged bit of road at speed – launching the motorcycle about a foot into the air.\nWith the rider hanging on to the handlebars and tank for dear life, the bike landed with a heavy thud and surprising stability, before continuing on its merry way. The R1200R might be a gentleman's machine, but could happily double as a hoon bike on command.\nF800R It is light, considered a \"mid-weight\" all rounder of a motorcycle, and practical for jaunts around town. The BMWF800R with its thumpy 798cc parallel twin engine might not be the sexiest looking of bikes in the BMW stable but as an urban commuter, it is almost unrivalled. Leaving Melbourne for some of Victoria's twisting back roads, the F800R also comfortably keeps up with the larger capacity R1200R in many of the corners.\nIt does however, run out of puff with a 74 kilogram rider at around 210km/h (or when the straight road ends). Designed with a relaxed riding position and a low seat height, the F800R is a comfortable choice for shorter riders, including petite women. Jumping onto the F from a powerful S1000RR, winding on the throttle aggressively on the smaller bike produced a grin-inducing adrenaline rush.\nWatching the bike's revs climb and catching glimpses of the trees and windy tarmac fly by were a thrill. If you're looking for the fastest two-wheeled contraption on the planet, the F800R is definitely not the bike for you. But if you're looking for comfortable fun with the occasional spirited romp , consider the little BMW for sport.\nBMW S1000RR\nPrice: Dynamic package – from $26,200\nEngine: 999cc inline-four liquid cooled\nPower/torque: 146kW/ 113 N·m\nFuel economy: 5.7 L/100 km\nBMW R1200R\nPrice: from $21,950 + on roads and options\nEngine: 1170 cc, liquid-cooled four stroke boxer twin\nPower/torque: 92kW/125Nm\nFuel economy: 3.9L/100km", "external_links": ["http://www.bmw.tv/web/player/index.html?type=embed&autoPlay=false&limit=0&xml=%2Fservices%2Fplayer%2FshowXMLPlaylist.do&id=657&spaceID=2"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:11:16.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
