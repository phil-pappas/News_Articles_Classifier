The surgery will be performed live by Hunaldo J. Villalobos, MD, FACS, in Orlando, Florida, and broadcast into the exhibit area from 11:45 am -- 12:15 pm on Tuesday, September 29.\n\nThe Renaissance system uses advanced 3D planning and mechanical guidance with 1.5mm accuracy to provide surgeons with a better solution for minimally invasive and percutaneous fusions, complex spinal deformity, trauma cases, and cranial procedures. Access Mazor Robotics series of 'How Renaissance Works' videos here. \n\n\"The Mazor Robotics Renaissance system gives me the ability to perform minimally-invasive procedures for my patients, while providing high accuracy with minimal radiation exposure,\" said Dr. Villalobos. \"I am excited to share this technology with fellow neurosurgeons to help advance this technique in spine surgery.\"\n\n\"The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Annual Meeting is known for its leading-edge, progressive program and we are proud to partner with them this year to showcase our technology,\" said Mazor Robotics CEO Ori Hadomi. \"Viewing a live surgery is the best way to see the advantage that the Renaissance Guidance System brings to a spine procedure.\"\n\nNot attending CNS 2015 in New Orleans this year? Mazor Robotics will also have an exhibit booth and hold Bioskills Labs at the North American Spine Society (NASS) Annual Meeting and the Society for Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (SMISS) Global Forum later this year. \n\nTo test-drive the Renaissance system for yourself, sign up for a Bioskills Lab today .\n\nMazor Robotics ( MZOR.TA ) ( MZOR.TA ) believes in healing through innovation by developing and introducing revolutionary robotic-based technology and products aimed at redefining the gold standard of quality care. Mazor Robotics Renaissance (R) Guidance System enables surgeons to conduct spine and brain procedures in a more accurate and secure manner.
