Mr Fifield gave no indications that the rise of digital services would impact of staffing levels but was adamant that rising levels of technology in government, and therefore self-service systems, was inevitable.\n\"If we want to remain a prosperous economy with all of the benefits that go with that then digital transformation for government and business is not negotiable,\" he said. \"We do have to pick up the pace in government and be more agile and to seize the opportunities that are before us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:41:49.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
