That's no hyperbole, says Wells Fargo in its most recent retirement savings study . The study points to a median savings of working Americans age 60 or older of $50,000, against a retirement savings goal of $300,000. \"Yet working Americans age 55 to 59 have saved three times as much as those age 60 or older, having amassed $150,000 toward a retirement savings goal of $500,000,\" Wells Fargo states. The reason for the disparity is clear: the report points out that the 55-59 demographic started saving way earlier (at age 31) than their 60-and-up counterparts (who started at age 37.) \"This study shows what a tremendous difference a few years can make when it comes to retirement savings,\" says Joe Ready, head of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust. \"Those who are not yet retired and working past age 60 started saving at age 37, six years later in life than those in their late 50s. The fact that people in their late 50s have three times the savings of those age 60 or older shows that starting early and saving consistently are key to retirement saving.\" If you're in the latter group, and need to turbo charge your retirement savings, the \"several years\" mindset can work for you, as well against you in retirement planning. \"Just the fact that you know you need to make up ground is, in my mind, a positive sign,\" says J.J. Montanaro, a Certified Financial Planner with USAA, headquartered in San Antonio. \"At least you're trying to evaluate where you stand and not just burying your head in the sand and ignoring the potential problem.\" Montanaro advises retirement savers to revise their plan when they more money, and fast. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:41:22.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
