It also relaxed reserve requirements for banks. The PBOC cut interest rates in August and in June. \n“The People’s Bank has delivered another jolt of stimulus,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, in a note. “The key point is that we shouldn’t take today’s announcement as evidence that policy makers have grown more concerned about the economy. Instead, this is a controlled easing cycle that underlines how China’s policy makers, unlike many of their peers elsewhere, still have room for policy maneuver.” \nIn recent weeks, worries about slowing in the world’s second-largest economy has spurred equity losses world-wide. Particularly hit have been shares in commodity and luxury-goods companies that count China as a key market for their goods and services. \nOn Friday, shares of commodities miner and trader Glencore PLC GLEN, +1.75% finished up 1.8% as a bigger intraday gain faded. Glencore shares still are down 60% this year. In the luxury-products group, shares of Christian Dior SE CDI, +2.76% tacked on 2.8%. \nIn Frankfurt, the DAX 30 DAX, +2.88% surged 2.9% to end at 10,794.54, while France’s CAC 40 PX1, +2.53% gained 2.5% to 4,923.64. \nThe U.K.’s FTSE 100 UKX, +1.06% jumped 1.1% to finish at 6,444.08. \nChina’s rate cut came after the close of trading in Asia. \nStocks held to gains earlier Friday after an initial, or flash, reading of October manufacturing activity in the eurozone came in higher than anticipated . The report indicated that the slowdown in China and in developed economies hadn’t yet dampened private-sector activity in Europe. \nBut standing out among individual decliners was Denmark’s Moller-Maersk A/S MAERSKB, -5.21% with shares finishing down 5.2% as the shipping company cut its full-year profit forecast. Global market conditions had been weaker than expected, especially in container shipping, said Maersk. \nEuropean Central Bank effect: The Stoxx 600 scored a weekly rise of 3.9%. Much of the weekly gain came during Thursday’s trade , when the Stoxx 600 rose 2% after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated the central bank is open to expanding monetary stimulus to help boost inflation. The ECB embarked on a massive quantitative-easing program in March. \nRead: Draghi delivers master class in jawboning \n“The ECB can support domestic demand through policy, and lower oil prices are helping, but their hands are tied when it comes to foreign demand,” said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a late Thursday note. “Nonetheless by saying that the degree of policy accommodation must be examined in December, Super Mario is effectively telling us that he is ready and willing to don his Santa cap this winter.” \nEuro: The euro EURUSD, -0.8281% on Friday fell about 0.5% to $1.1023. The shared currency tumbled roughly 2% on Thursday, after the ECB meeting. It traded above $1.13 ahead of Draghi’s news conference. \nThe $1.10 level “is very significant support in EUR/USD and we expect this level to be tested and breached for a possible drop to $1.08,” said Lien.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:47:42.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
