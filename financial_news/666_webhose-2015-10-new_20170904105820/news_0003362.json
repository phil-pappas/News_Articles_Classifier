It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is also evaluating plans for services to small and medium-sized businesses, or SMEs. \nAnalysts at Citi said in a note the bank's growth had been stronger than anticipated, especially in credit cards, and this could led to upgrades of around 5 percent in earnings forecasts. \nThe bank has hired George Ashworth, managing director of ABN AMRO Lease NV's UK branch, to develop an SME banking strategy. \nHaving received enquiries from small business owners over the past few years, \"it's a natural step for the brand,\" Virgin Money Chief Executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia told Reuters. \nGadhia also said the bank was expecting a moderate increase in interest rates, most likely towards the end of 2016. The Bank of England as a whole is edging closer to an interest rate hike, but voted eight to one last month to keep rates on hold. ( http://reut.rs/1NEZAK2 ) \nGadhia also reiterated the bank's view on free in-credit banking. \n\"Free banking has caused a distortion in the marketplace for sure. I think it's a difficult issue for politicians in particular to revoke. Taking away from the UK consumer something that is free I think is a challenge,\" Gadhia said.
