Share on twitter by John McDuling Netflix does not employ a single person in Australia, but the streaming video company has still managed to permanently alter this country's corporate landscape.\nAnd not just the media sector, where it has struck fear into the hearts of television executives.\nBest known for its streaming video service and its hit original shows like House of Cards , Netflix also pioneered a groundbreaking internal culture that has become the gold standard for technology companies around the world.\nYou know, the types of companies Australia's policymakers are furiously trying to foster.\n\"We will come to see that linear TV declines every year for the next 20 years and internet TV rise every year for the next 20 years\": Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. The company pays its workers top of the market salaries and has a loose expenses policy that is literally five words long (\"Act in Netflix's best interests)\". It offers staff unlimited vacation time and unlimited paid parental leave, an unheard of perk in the US where time off work is relatively hard to come by.\nBut above all else Netflix's culture is built with a laser-like focus on \"high performance\".\nWhat does that actually mean? Put simply, you won't move up the ranks and get paid more at Netflix just by turning up at the office very early and leaving very late. Netflix doesn't care how hard its people work. It only cares what they get done.\nThis philosophy was famously outlined in a slide presentation released back in 2009 that Sheryl Sandberg, the highly influential COO of Facebook, has described as one of the most important documents to have emerged out of Silicon Valley.\n The slides make it clear that people who work hard but achieve only adequate performance at Netflix will be moved on. While people who don't work that hard but do get stuff done will be promoted and rewarded financially.\nOne slide in that presentation is particularly telling. \"We're a team, not a family,\" it reads. \"We're like a pro sports team.\"\nThat might sound like meaningless corporate jargon but when you think it through, it is actually quite profound.\nThink about how professional sports teams operate. When a player gets too old or unfit, or simply no longer fits into the team's overarching tactics, he or she is ruthlessly traded or discarded.\nAnd that's what happens at Netflix, which embraces firing people with a level of honesty few other companies would be prepared to acknowledge. The aforementioned slide points out that Netflix leaders \"cut smartly\" so the company has \"stars in every position.\"\nThe influence of Netflix's HR policies has spread world wide extends to local firms like Campaign Monitor, the incredibly hot email marketing startup which hails from Sydney's Sutherland shire and which raised a record $250 million from prestigious venture capital funds last year. \"We have a very similar performance driven culture,\" Campaign Monitor's chief marketing officer Kraig Swensrud tells Fairfax Media. \"It's not about the number of hours you put in, but it's about the outcome\".\nFor those of us who detest office politics and dreaded \"face time\" – the misguided notion that people need to be seen to be in the office doing stuff just to impress their bosses – a work environment based on outcomes might sound appealing. The reality can be quite different.\nThe very author of the Netflix slide deck, Patty McCord was herself moved on from the company in 2012. As a recent episode of the Planet Money podcast recounted, so was a big chunk of the company's highly regarded engineering team when Netflix decided to outsource some of its web operations to tech giant Amazon.\nAt Netflix, managers are told to ask themselves which staff they would fight hard to keep should they be poached by a rival firm. Anyone that does not fall into that category should be offered a \"generous severance package\" and moved on.\nIt all sounds a bit like a movie you might find on Netflix – the Hunger Games (a drama about a dystopian future where participants in a television show battle it out to the death).\nBut perhaps it is more effective than what most companies have espoused in the past.\nThe idea that your office or company is \"one big family\" has been around for years. It's a completely absurd notion, of course. While many lasting friendships and relationships are forged at work, your colleagues aren't your siblings and your boss is not your Mum or Dad. Sure, the notion that there will always be a role for you at the place where you work is reassuring to people. It's also completely outdated in the modern economy.\nThe smartest companies realise this.\n\"Do we envision that it's like a family where employees are going to be there forever? No,\" explains Swensrud. \"But we do want our employees to do the best work of their careers at Campaign Monitor.\"\nNetflix eschewed annual performance reviews long before it became fashionable . Rather than going through that annoying ritual, managers are constantly reviewing performance, which is made easier by the fact that output in most job functions at the company is easily measurable.\nAnd it seems to be working. Netflix is the best performing stock on the US S&P 500 this year, having more than doubled in value. The company market capitalisation now stands at around $US42 billion ($58 billion).\nUltimately, as Australia looks to foster a thriving digital economy, it is worth recognising that in the high octane, high performance world of global technology, your work is not a family, and a job for life is a thing of the past.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Netflix-slide-2.PNG", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/goodbye-rankings-accenture-gives-annual-performance-reviews-the-flick-20150721-gihn7y.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Netflix-slide.PNG", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/28/435583328/episode-647-hard-work-is-irrelevant", "http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/read-what-facebooks-sandberg-calls-maybe-the-most-important-document-ever-to-come-out-of-the-valley/"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:08:07.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
