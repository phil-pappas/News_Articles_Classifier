For Q3CY15, we expect a soft quarter, as there will be no sales coming in from Maggi.\nWe expect a revenue and EBITDA decline of ~19.5% year-on-year. For CY15, we have trimmed our estimates to take out the impact of Maggi for the year, but for CY16, we are building in revenues of Rs 1,800Cr from the sales of Maggi alone.\nWe have assumed that the product will be launched by the beginning of CY16, but normalized volumes will start 4-5 months after the initial launch.We have always maintained that there would be a short-term impact on sales and profitability of the company for a few quarters, but the company should be able to fix the product and bring it back to the market.\n 20, 2015 12:14 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:33:30.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
