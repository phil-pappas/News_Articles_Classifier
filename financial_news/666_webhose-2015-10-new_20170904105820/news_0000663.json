Photo: Sergio Dionisio\nAustralian equities experienced a choppy but ultimately anticlimactic day as a nervous market waited for and then reacted to Chinese economic data, with strong gains in Westpac offset by losses in the miners and Telstra.\nThe All Ordinaries finished the day up by 0.7 points, or 0.01 per cent on 5304.5 points.\nThe S&P/ASX200 closed 1.5 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower on 5269.7 points.\nWhile the big banks led the S&P/ASX200 to a high of 5294 points within an hour of opening, the gains fell away swiftly as concerns swirled about the early afternoon release of China's third-quarter gross domestic product growth figures .\nThe index reached a low of 5254 points only to recover slightly when the GDP number came in at 6.9 per cent, or slightly ahead of economist expectations of a 6.8 per cent rise, sparking a sigh of relief among investors.\n\"The firmer print has put a floor under risk, as clearly the markets were positioned for a weaker print,\" said TD Securities head of macro strategy Annette Beacher.\nAll eyes were on Westpac in the morning, which surged after exiting a trading halt to raise capital. Australia's second biggest bank launched a $3.5 billion raise on Wednesday.\n\"Westpac is really the only new news and it's good news,\" Aurora Funds Management senior portfolio manager Hugh Dive said.\n\"It's clear that Westpac learned from what ANZ did, and went for a bigger raising at a decent discount so investment bankers didn't get stuck with stock they'd underwritten.\"\nWestpac finished the day up 3 per cent at $31.34. Fellow big banks also rose slightly: ANZ Banking Group added 0.7 per cent to $28.86 and National Australia Bank rose 0.6 per cent to $31.93, while the Commonwealth Bank of Australia finished lower, down 0.2 per cent at $76.43.\n\"Westpac has now set the tone for bank reporting season. Their results were better than expected with improving margins in the second half, so people will be looking at that in ANZ and NAB now.\"\nTelstra led the downward momentum, losing 2.6 per cent to $5.30, closely followed by BHP Billiton finishing 1.2 per cent lower on $24.71.\nRio Tinto also finished lower, 0.6 per cent at $53.35, as did Fortescue Metals Group, down 4.2 per cent to $2.30.\nEnergy stocks were up slightly, with the index adding 0.5 per cent, as analysts anticipate a rising price for Brent crude oil.\n\"The oil price seems to be coming off the floor that's giving a boost to the embattled Origin and Santos,\" Mr Dive said. \"LNG projects in particular have been sold down very heavily and so those are stepping up slowly.\"\nOrigin finished the day unchanged at $5.47 while Santos finished at $5.46, up 1.4 per cent.\nMonday's biggest loss among the top 200 companies was sustained by Evolution Mining, down 5.8 per cent to $1.47 after Phoenix Gold unanimously rejected its takeover offer and the gold price dropped slightly.\nOther significant losses were sustained by Cabcharge, down 5.4 per cent to $2.98 and Regis Resources, down 4.3 per cent to $2.03.\nThe biggest gainer of the day was Treasury Wine Estates , up 14.6 per cent to $7.40 after coming out of a trading halt to raise $368 million.\nMining company Arrium was also among the biggest gainers, up 1chop[4.3 per cent at $0.12 as was infrastructure services company Cardno, which climbed 7.9 per cent to $3.04 as Crescent Capital Partners upped their takeover offer.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/world/china-economic-growth-beats-estimates-20151019-gkcf62", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/treasury-wine-surges-back-onto-asx-20151019-gkcfn6"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:31:45.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
