Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates Heavy digital spending by banks appears to be leaving customers happier, with new figures showing consumers are more likely to be satisfied when dealing with banks through a website or smart phone rather than in person.\nFigures from Roy Morgan on Monday underlined the rapid growth of online banking, with more customers switching to managing their money digitally.\nAt the same time, the survey data showed consumers who dealt with with their bank through digital channels are more likely to be happy with the experience.\nBut in a sign of the intensifying digital contest between banks, some banks have happier online customers than others.\nSuncorp Bank had the highest proportion of customers who were satisfied with their banks' digital offering, at 93.3 per cent, while Commonwealth Bank was next best at 92.7 per cent.\nWestpac – whose chief Brian Hartzer​ is keenly focused on technology – had the lowest number of customers who were happy with the bank's online offering, at 87.9 per cent.\nRoy Morgan published figures for 10 bank brands, including some owned by the majors, such as St George and Bankwest.\nThe report found 90.4 per cent of customers were satisfied with the experience of online banking via a website, while mobile banking applications were close behind at 89.9 per cent.\n Satisfaction levels with branches had improved, and were only slightly lower at 88.4 per cent.\nAs well as overhauling their IT systems, banks are spending millions revamping their branches to be more automated and less costly to run.\nPhone banking had the lowest satisfaction rating of 79.9 per cent.\nThe director of industry communications at Roy Morgan, Norman Morris, said the biggest users of online banking tended to be customers in the top fifth of income earners.\n\"Nearly three quarters of this high-potential group conduct internet banking using [their bank's] website, making it imperative to understand functionality needs, reliability and satisfaction with this critical segment,\" Mr Morris said.\nThe numbers also highlighted a gradual decline in the use of branches and phone banking as digital banking grows.\nDigital banking – through a website or a smart phone – had been used by 62.2 per cent of customers in the past month, up from 58.6 per cent two years ago.\nMobile banking is growing especially fast: 33.6 per cent of customers had used a smart phone or other device to do their banking in the past month, up from 26.2 per cent.\nJust under a third of customers used branches in an average month, down from 35.5 per cent two years earlier.\nMore banking news and analysis", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au//business/banking-and-finance/hartzer-to-slim-down-a-highertech-westpac-20150907-gjguqh"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:08.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
