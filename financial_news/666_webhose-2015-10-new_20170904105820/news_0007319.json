Porn in full color and high-definition video is now all over the Internet.\n\"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just pass√© at this juncture,\" Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times.\nStarting in March, Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer be fully nude. It will become more like Esquire and other magazines with PG-13-type pictures.\nPlayboy has not yet decided whether it will still have a centerfold, according to the Times.\nThe change represents a major shift for the magazine, which broke new ground when Hugh Hefner created it and featured Marilyn Monroe on its debut cover in 1953. It marks the latest step away from depictions of full nudity, which were banned from the magazine's website in August 2014.\nThe magazine said its website audience soared with that move, averaging a fourfold increase in monthly unique visitors.\n\"The political and sexual climate of 1953 ... bears almost no resemblance to today,\" Flanders said. \"We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms.\"\nPlayboy editor Cory Jones recently contacted Hefner about dropping nude photos from the print edition and he agreed, the Times reported.\nPlayboy's print circulation, measured at 5.6 million in the 1975, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media, the newspaper reported.\nThe shift from nudity will be accompanied by other changes in the magazine, including a slightly larger size and a heavier, higher quality of paper meant to give the magazine a more collectible feel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:10:55.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
