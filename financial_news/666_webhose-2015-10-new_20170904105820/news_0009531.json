Currently, health insurance policies are renewed annually, or for two years in some cases.\n“We are looking at long-term health insurance products to expand our reach. Such long-term health policies could carry a tenure of over 3-5 years. There is also a proposal to bring in long-term products for group insurance as well,” TS Vijayan, chairman, Irdai, said at the sidelines of an ICICI Lombard event marking the company’s milestone of 1 lakh policies in long-term two-wheeler insurance. ICICI Lombard is the first general insurance company to have launched long-term product for the two-wheeler industry.\n“We have appointed a committee to evaluate the proposal, which include industry experts besides companies. The committee will bring in a report for long-term health insurance products soon,” Vijayan said, adding that the issue is pricing of products, which has to be streamlined. The insurance regulator is also mulling long-term products in the four-wheeler segment.\nVijayan clarified that claim experience has to be looked into because that is vital for longer-term offerings. On the industry, he said insurance penetration has to increase as the extent of risk cover is a measure of its stage of development. “In the US, almost 80% of the assets are covered by insurance whereas it is just 7% in India,” he said.\nHe said there was an unmet need for long-term products in non-life sector as well.\nAsked about FDI, TS Vijayan said about 6-7 insurers have approached Irdai seeking permission to increase FDI. Refusing to give names, he said they wanted approval to raise the FDI ranging from 36% to 49% in both life and non-life sectors.\nMeanwhile, ICICI Lombard has sold 1 lakh policies of its long-term product, which offers 2-3 options to two-wheeler owners, after it had started actively marketing the product in July this year. Bhargav Dasgupta, CEO, said about 40% of its online two-wheeler insurance sales were coming from the long-term product and the response suggests a new trend in this segment. “Long-term products are going to be a game changer in the two-wheeler segment where renewal of insurance was a major issue.”\n 08, 2015 12:17 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:18:01.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
