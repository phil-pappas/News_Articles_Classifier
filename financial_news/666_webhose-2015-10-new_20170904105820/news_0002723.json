Never the less, he came as close as he dared in a speech at St Peter’s College, Oxford, last week on British membership of the European Union, and he’s been getting stick for it from both sides of the debate ever since. \nThere were some caveats, but Mr Carney left little doubt where he stands. Britain has benefited quite a bit from being part of the European Union , he argued. \nMr Carney didn’t actually say it, but he might well have done, and it is certainly what he believes - like David Cameron and George Osborne, it is to Mr Carney unconscionable that Britain would leave a supranational organisation such as the EU - worse, in the signals it sends to the rest of the world, than quitting the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation, or the International Monetary Fund. \nThis is scarcely the first time a Governor of the Bank of England has waded into the political debate. They used to do it all the time. More recently, Eddie George pre-judged the government’s own assessment of whether it made sense to join the euro by warning in terms of the dangers of Europe’s “one size fits all” monetary policy. Thank goodness for such interventions. \nAnd Mr Carney himself made a possibly decisive intervention in the Scottish referendum vote by telling Scots that they could not have both full independence and the pound . \nIn both these cases, however, there were profound implications for monetary policy; beyond the basically unknowable effect on the economy, there are no such ramifications if Britain were to leave the European Union. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so, I can’t agree with the former Chancellor and now head of the Conservative out campaign, Lord Lawson, that the Governor has strayed beyond his mandate. As one (Other OTC: IUSDF - news ) of Britain’s two mainstay economic institutions (the other being the Treasury) the Bank plainly does have some sort of a duty to assess the economic pros and cons. Nobody is obliged to agree with the Bank’s conclusions, and in particular, I would challenge the Governor’s assertion that Britain has been perhaps the prime beneficiary of the EU’s four freedoms capital, goods, labour and services. As evidence, he points to superior rates of growth in GDP and productivity since Britain joined. These gains, however, almost certainly have much more to do with Thatcher’s capital and labour market reforms than membership of the EU, whose regulatory demands often seem to push Britain in the other direction. \nAll the same, the Governor has in a round about way managed to highlight what promise to be the key drivers of the Brexit debate, at least from an economic perspective. I’m not sure the EU was ever quite the benign globalising force it pretends to be, but if the degree of seemingly perpetual crisis management and further integration thought necessary to salvage the euro is making it into something else defensive, inward looking and protectionist is that really in Britain’s interests as one of the most open and outward looking economies in the world? If it isn’t, might not these interests be best pursued by going it alone? And finally are these potential rewards worth the massive business uncertainty and disruption that would come with the act of leaving? \n= Whither Sir Andrew Witty? = \nI put a version of these questions to Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) , at a Chatham House corporate leaders event late last week. Would it really make any difference to a global company such as his, with its sights firmly set on the growth markets of the developing world, if Britain were to leave the EU? \nWith some skill, Sir Andrew neatly dodged the question, though he did think there remained an opportunity for Britain to make Europe a more competitive place. \nHis diagnosis for the European market from a business perspective was never the less a chilling one. With an essentially static population and relentless downward pressure on prices, Europe was very unlikely to be a growth market for his company, and by implication anyone else’s, for a very long time to come. \nSir Andrew has been CEO of Glaxo for nine years now, during which both the company and the share price have essentially gone nowhere . It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) would be unfair to blame him for this apparent torpor. Beneath the flatlining revenues, there has been huge change, with the Big Pharma business model under pressure as never before. And besides, the share price gives a faintly misleading impression. Since 2008, Sir Andrew has managed to return £35bn to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. \nYet it’s fair to say that questions are being asked among top shareholders, and few are entirely convinced by the big push into lower margin, over-the-counter consumer products. Undoubtedly there are synergies between innovative, development intensive prescribed medicines and what Sir Andrew calls “category creating” consumer brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste in manufacturing and branding - but they are also very different markets that require different skills and marketing techniques. \nIn any case, Sir Andrew will soon need to sit down with his new chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, and decide whether he wants to be the man to take Glaxo onto the next stage, or whether his hugely valuable international expertise might be better deployed elsewhere. Certainly he shows no sign of waning; he’s looking forward to his R & D day on Wall Street next month, when he plans to showcase one of the first big breakthroughs in anti-biotics in years, with evident enthusiasm. Yet with the American market, which hitherto has largely resisted the downward pressures on pharma prices, showing every sign of going the same way as Europe, does he really want another five years of managing Glaxo through the myriad challenges ahead?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:59:33.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
