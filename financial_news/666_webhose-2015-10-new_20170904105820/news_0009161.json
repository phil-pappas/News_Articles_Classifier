Centre for Climate Change Awareness has written Nema and Kebs to compel Volkswagen to declare the emission levels. This follows investigations in the US that found information on emissions by more than 11 million diesel vehicles was manipulated. Lobby executive director Stephen Ndegwa asked Nema and Kebs to demand that dealers also declare whether they were aware of the \"defeat devices\" that falsified pollution tests on diesel engine vehicles. He said studies show the emissions are hazardous. Kenya \nSome 105 MPs have signed a motion to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta over claims he has violated the constitution. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star. All rights reserved.
