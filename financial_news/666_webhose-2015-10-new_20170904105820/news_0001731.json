As our population ages, it is more important than ever to help people plan and prepare for their retirement, while at the same time protecting today's older citizens. \nThis Government is in the process of delivering the biggest pensions reforms for decades, revolutionary changes that have the power to help us all work towards a more financially secure retirement. \n• Q&A: Should you top up your state pension? • Interest rates predictions on the move: 'First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) rise in January 2017' \nOne major change involves the state pension. We are in the process of replacing a system fraught with inconsistency and complexity with one that, over time, will make saving for retirement much easier to understand. From April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016 we will start a brand new system that will be clearer and simpler for the future, giving everyone a clearer idea, in advance, of what they can receive from the state. \nThe new system still depends on the basic concept of a contributory state pension derived from National Insurance contributions, but the old complexities will end, so that everyone's National Insurance counts the same towards their future pension. \nMany of those who have taken time out of work to raise children or care for relatives will receive improved National Insurance credits. Too often in the past, women lost out, but the new system will ensure women have their own individual state pension, rather than being expected to rely on their husband's pension in retirement. This is absolutely right in the 21st century. \nIn the first 10 years after implementation, around 650,000 women are expected to receive on average £8 a week more state pension under the new rules. And other groups that have historically not done so well, including the self-employed, will also benefit. All in all the proportion of new pensioners on means-tested pension credit is expected to fall by half. \nWhile we will reform the state pension system for the future, we know that millions of people already retired - or who reach state pension age before April - will continue to be served by GRAHAM the outgoing system. Some of them have done very well under the old regime and will not lose out, but we are also ensuring that we protect pensioners to give them the best chance of a comfortable later life. \nOne part of that is the \"triple lock\", whereby the basic state pension will be increased by at least 2.5pc each year, or by the rise in wages or prices if higher. \nBut we also recognise that some people might benefit from the chance to pay to increase their state pension further. So to help those who continue to receive their pension under the old rules, we are retaining the generous system of state pension deferral that helps those who put off claiming their state pension and may wish to work longer to achieve higher pensions in future. We are also continuing to allow people to fill gaps in their national insurance record by paying voluntary contributions within set time limits. \nIn addition to these, we have launched a new state pension top-up scheme this week where people have the option to obtain £25 a week additional state pension. The scheme will be open for the next 18 months and if you think you might benefit you can find out more at gov.uk/state-pension-topup . But please bear in mind, with all of these possible ways to improve your state pension, it is important to make sure that you will actually benefit. Not everyone will do so, so take financial advice before you decide. \nWhile we are protecting the state pension that gives a base level of income, it is also vital to help supplement this with a private pension system that makes it easier and cheaper to save. \nThat is why in 2012 we began automatic enrolment into workplace pensions, designed to encourage more people to contribute to pensions. Already 5.47 million employees, working for Britain's large and medium-sized firms, have been automatically enrolled and by the time the process is complete we estimate that around 9 million people will be newly saving or saving more. \nSo far, fewer than 5pc of all employers have begun automatic enrolment, but in the next few years every single employer will need to set up a pension scheme for their eligible staff. I realise this is a huge challenge as we have to help 1.8 million smaller employers enrol their workers, many of whom have no experience of pensions. \nAutomatic enrolment is all about changing people's attitudes to saving for their retirement, and we will soon unveil a brand new advertising campaign urging everyone to engage with their workplace pension. We want to ensure that pension saving at work becomes the norm, with employers also contributing to this by paying into their workers' pension funds to help them secure a better retirement. \nOn top of all this, we have seen the Chancellor's changes to pension rules that have introduced unprecedented freedoms for pension savers to use their pension savings as suits them best. No more forced annuitisation, freedom, choice and better tax benefits make pensions more attractive for the future. \nAll in all, what we are seeing is nothing short of a pensions revolution. Exciting times in the world of pensions, and better pension prospects for millions of hardworking people in a way that is sustainable for future generations. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \n• Have a question for Baroness Altmann?
