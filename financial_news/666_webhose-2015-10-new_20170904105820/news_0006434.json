Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Want a new iPhone but can't afford it? You may have another option.\nTaiwanese tech company HTC has announced its latest One A9 Android smartphone, essentially a slightly larger, cheaper iPhone 6s that also comes in dark red.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view there are few things that separate HTC's new phone from the iPhone.\nNotable differences include a pill-shaped home button and the rear camera is positioned in the middle, rather than the left side. The speaker is also under the camera, rather than beside it.\nThe HTC One A9 will be priced cheaper than the iPhone 6s in the United States. Supplied The phone also has a 5-inch HD display, compared to the iPhone 6s' 4.7-inch screen, but really the physical differences are minimal.\nHTC chief executive Cher Wong said the phone would stand apart in a market increasingly dominated by a \"a company that controls every aspect of your phone\" - Apple.\n\"The HTC One A9 breaks from this trend by offering an incredible design, fantastic performance, cutting-edge software features and the freedom to take full control of your smartphone experience,\" she said.\nBest phone in years The HTC One A9 rear facing camera has 13 megapixels. Supplied Presenting the phone at the Barclays Center in New York, HTC America president Jason Mackenzie said the phone was the best the company had launched in years.\n\"A phone that's beautiful, a phone that's powerful, a phone that's easy to use. But today we're also going to announce a phone that checks a box you didn't even know was available - the freedom to make that phone truly your own,\" he said.\nThe HTC One A9 will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow with HTC Sense. It has 32 gigabytes of storage which is expandable up to 2 terabytes.\nThe main camera is 13 megapixels with a sapphire cover lens, has optical image stabilisation and 1080p video recording.\nIn contrast to the iPhone 6s, the HTC camera has more megapixels and all models come with the stabilisation feature, which is only present in the iPhone 6s Plus.\nThe HTC's camera also supports RAW image capture and hyperlapse video creation.\nThe battery life for the phones is also different. The iPhone 6s will last up to two hours longer while using WiFi, in terms of talk time, the iPhone 6s is also better. But if your phone is on standby, you'll get an extra 8 days out of the HTC One A9.\nThe phones will be available across the world from the first week of November.\nThe price of the phone will vary between markets, but in the United States it is cheaper than the iPhone 6s. The SIM-unlocked version of the 32gb phone will cost $US399 and users will get six months free of Google Play and Uh Oh Protection which allows you to replace your phone for free once if you break it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:08:13.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
