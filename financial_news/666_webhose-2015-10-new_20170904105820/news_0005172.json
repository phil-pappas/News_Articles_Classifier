The new service will supplement the current EK237 Boeing 777-300ER flight departing Dubai at 8:40 a.m. and landing in Boston at 2:15 p.m. The complementary flight times satisfy a need for customers traveling between the eastern United States to Dubai, as well as for those passengers connecting to Emirates’ vast global network of onwards destinations. \nThe second Boston flight will also be operated with an Emirates’ Boeing 777-300ER aircraft with 8 private suites in First class, 42 seats in Business class and 304 seats in Economy class. \n“The additional service to Boston not only doubles our capacity to meet demand, but will also provide passengers with the option to fly to new destinations out of Boston Logan International Airport,” said Hubert Frach, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations, West. “The new flight will also create improved connections for passengers travelling from Dhaka, Kolkata, and many destinations throughout Africa, the GCC and Middle East via Dubai and onwards to the U.S.” \nBoston, Massachusetts’ capital and largest city, is a popular destination for foreign and domestic tourists. Passengers traveling to Boston can take in a baseball game at the famous Fenway Park, journey across the Charles River to explore the stunning architecture and historic sites in Cambridge, or relive the American Revolution at the site of the Boston Tea Party. Boston's many colleges and universities have made the city an international center of higher education and a world leader in innovation. This second flight will now provide even more travel options for students and the academic community in Boston. Just this year, Boston-based StudentUniverse named Emirates the “The Best Airline for Students, Overall (Globally)”. \nA major export from Boston is lobsters. In fact, lobsters account for 55% of the value of Emirates’ cargo exports out of Boston, efficiently transported via the bellyhold of the airline's wide body Boeing 777 and its cool chain solutions. \nApproximately 135 tonnes of lobsters are exported from Boston each month, roughly 223,917 lobsters, and these are primarily delivered to Dubai (DXB), Shanghai (SHA), Guangdong (CAN), Bangkok (BKK), and Taiwan (TPE). Seafood, mainly lobsters, in addition to electronic equipment for industrial use is the fastest growing component of Emirates’ business in Boston. Additionally, Emirates' top imports to Boston are garments and textile products from the South Indian metropolis of Chennai (MAA) and Sri Lanka (CMB). Passengers wishing to travel beyond Boston to onward destinations in North America can take advantage of Emirates’ interline partnership with JetBlue Airways (B6) that allows increased connection options from Boston to a number of U.S. cities. Currently, JetBlue flies to 42 cities from Boston Logan International Airport including Detroit (DTW), Buffalo (BUF), and Raleigh-Durham (RDU). By next year, the number of non-stop flights into Boston will increase to over 55 flights. At Boston Logan International Airport, JetBlue and Emirates both operate from Terminal C, ensuring passengers a quick connection between flights. The codeshare agreement with JetBlue allows customers of both airlines to enjoy the convenience of a single combined ticket on selected routes, including one-stop check-in and baggage transfer.*\nExplore even more of the Americas with Emirates' Pass \nEmirates passengers looking to explore even more of the Americas now have dozens of options with the Americas Pass. \nWith one combined ticket, travelers flying to any of Emirates’ 10 U.S. destinations can connect to more than 90 cities across America, Canada and Latin America through Emirates’ five partner airlines: Jet Blue, Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, WestJet Airlines and Porter Airlines. \nPassengers on Emirates flights enjoy over 2,000 free channels of films, TV shows, music, games and podcasts through ice, the airline’s multi-award winning in-flight entertainment system, regionally inspired gourmet cuisine and Emirates’ renowned inflight service from the airline’s multi-national cabin crew comprised of over 135 nationalities.
