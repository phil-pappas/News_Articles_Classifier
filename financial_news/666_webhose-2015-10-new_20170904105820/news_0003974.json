Photo: Bloomberg\nAMP, Australia's largest publicly-traded asset manager, is hiring staff for its equities division to meet demand from pension savers with $1.5 trillion to invest.\nThe money manager, which oversees more than $115 billion, is recruiting three people for its Australian stocks team, according to Michael Price, the group's head. One appointment has been made and two others are expected to follow, he said, declining to name the people until the process is complete. AMP is also in discussions to allow the public to buy into a small-cap equity fund that his team has been running internally since 2013, he said.\n\"We do want one more portfolio manager - a wise, old head really,\" Price, Sydney-based head of Australian equities at AMP, said in an interview. \"The other area where there's real opportunity is in the smaller-cap end.\"\nWith Australia requiring employers to contribute 9.5 per cent of workers' wages to a national pension system known as superannuation, assets will double to $3 trillion by the end of this decade, according to Deloitte estimates. AMP, Northern Trust Corp and Shaw & Partners are among firms to recruit staff this year as they seek to win more of this cash.\nAdvertisement AMP's in-house small-cap fund, which has about $75 million in assets under management with capacity to take as much as $800 million, has returned 14 per cent per year since it began in January 2013, Price said. The S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries Index has lost 0.1 per cent on an annualised basis in that period, Bloomberg data show. Discussions concerning the target audience and availability of the fund are ongoing and a final decision to make it available to outside investors hasn't yet been made, he added.\nPrice is advising holding fewer Australian bank shares than are represented in benchmark indexes, saying the prospect for dividend increases is minimal. Banks comprise 30 per cent of the S&P/ASX 200 Index, and have slid this year as lenders raised record capital to comply with new regulatory buffers.\n\"You want to be neutral or underweight\" on bank shares, Price said. \"I'm not sure the extra yield is going to compensate for the capital headwinds, bad-debt provision headwinds and potential downside going forward from slower economic growth.\"\nGian Pandit, AMP's former co-head of Aussie equities who left earlier this year, joined Ausbil Investment Management this month. ï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:22:01.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
