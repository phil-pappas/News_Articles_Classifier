MDLZ -0.87 % is changing its marketing recipe.\nFor decades advertisers have relied heavily on television commercials to sell their products to the masses. But as consumers’ TV-viewing habits change, thanks in part to the growth of the Web and the rise of smartphones, companies are looking for new ingredients to add to their advertising formulae.\nThe owner of well-known brands such as Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolates and Ritz crackers is embracing a wide range of newer approaches from spending big on digital channels to using technologies such as holograms in store aisles. At the same time, it has reduced its TV ad spending in the U.S. almost 50% from five years ago, according to ad-tracker Kantar Media.\nChange isn’t easy, and Dana Anderson, Mondelez’s chief marketing officer, has plenty riding on her efforts. The Deerfield, Ill., company is under pressure from two high-profile activist investors, including William Ackman , to cut costs and boost earnings. It is also trying to re-engineer some well-known brands to keep up with consumer demand for healthier or more natural food options.\nMs. Anderson spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how Mondelez has gotten its executives to embrace digital media, how it is seeking more than just ads from the likes of Google and how it’s dealing with belt-tightening. Edited excerpts follow.\nBig shift WSJ: What is the biggest challenge you face?\nMS. ANDERSON: The pace of change. Just think about digital media, for instance. As a company, we’re committed to shifting more of our investment to that channel. But it requires learning new capabilities at a very quick pace.\nWSJ: How do you train your executives?\nMS. ANDERSON: We used to provide capability classes on all kinds of topics that were self-administered. We wanted new training methods to be more effective. We are building a black-belt system for training, where you get your green belt or red belt that measures what you learned and how you apply that to the business. We want our leaders to demonstrate competency at beginning, medium and experienced levels. For our social-media training, the black belt is achieved once the leaders go through all the training modules, ranging from planning to risk and reputation management, and then training other people on that topic.\nWSJ: Why is education critical?\nMS. ANDERSON: When our folks are not confident, they will go back to what they know. So if I know how to measure TV and to look at TV commercials, I am going to feel more comfortable with buying TV. If I am less comfortable in digital, maybe I will step back from that.\nWSJ: How do you protect the marketing budget when activists are pushing for more cost-cutting and when measuring marketing is still a squishy business?\nMS. ANDERSON: We are getting a lot of support for reinvesting our savings back into marketing. We are increasing advertising and promotional spending. We have a team devoted to sharpening and proving the return on our marketing investment. We are also shifting more of our spending to digital, as it typically costs less than traditional media but has twice the return on investment.\nWSJ: Are the issues facing the company distracting?\nMS. ANDERSON: We are all experiencing cost-cutting, it’s not just us. Almost everybody, at least in very traditional businesses, is going through this process and it really is a revelation in many ways. You look back and think, “Wow, how was I spending my money before?”\nENLARGE WSJ: U.S. TV ad spending for Mondelez fell roughly 18% in 2014 from the year before and is down almost 50% from five years ago. Where are those dollars going?\nMS. ANDERSON: To digital media. By 2018, we hope that digital media will represent 30% of our total media spending globally. That is about double where we were last year. In North America, 32% of our total media spending went to digital in 2014 and we expect that to be about 45% this year.\nWSJ: Mondelez has signed large agreements with digital companies such as Facebook FB 2.53 % and Google. Can you explain how those deals go beyond just buying ad time?\nMS. ANDERSON: Google is working with us on new product inventions. They are giving us unprecedented access to consumer insights and feedback. We now have a panel of two million people that Google created.\nWSJ: Mondelez wants to have e-commerce represent at least 10% of its total packaged-goods sales by 2020. How do you get to that goal, and how will marketing play a role?\nMS. ANDERSON: We have added buy buttons to our marketing on platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter TWTR 3.88 % so people can move from a message to a purchase.\nSnacking has not been a large e-commerce player, although it is growing. A lot of our sales are impulse-oriented, so how does that translate online? How do we drive consumer impulse-buying online?\nWe did an agreement with Facebook to bring us a scalable solution on how technology can drive impulse-buying online. Basically, its creating an online “hot zone” that will drive impulse-purchase in the way front-of-store racks created impulse-purchase behavior in-store many decades ago.\nWSJ: What is the most promising thing that Mondelez has discovered recently in shopper marketing?\nMS. ANDERSON: For a soccer-themed campaign called “Pass the Love,” we used holographic displays that created the illusion of a floating advertisement that could be seen in the aisle.\nTaste is king WSJ: How do you promote the fact that some of your products are healthier or have reduced sugar or fat without causing concern that the products won’t taste the same or good?\nMS. ANDERSON: Taste is still king. As we move forward in creating new products, taste absolutely has to be in the forefront.\nSaying “less fat” or “less sugar” is not the pathway anymore. I think the pathway is how it [the product] is formed, how much of it there is and what sizes I give it to you in. For example, Oreo Thins have less calories than regular Oreo cookies, but what we love is the delightful crunch and the taste. So that’s what our marketing for Oreo Thins focuses on.\nIt really depends on the brand equity and the consumer need we’re addressing. For example, in the case of belVita breakfast biscuits, “sustained energy” is a core theme because we know consumers are looking for a tasty and nutritious breakfast option that is also convenient.\nWSJ: What are some of the challenges you see with mobile ads?\nMS. ANDERSON: One of the unforeseen things was design. You can design a package for on-shelf or design a package for an ad, but when you are buying or advertising via a smartphone, you have to worry about what the product looks like. Now that everything I am doing is being reduced to a much smaller image, smaller than a stamp, you have to think about how it looks.\nMs. Vranica is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
