Pat Scala Share on twitter by Perry Williams Billionaire James Packer's bid to appease Macau gaming officials with a new theme-park style casino complex may have paid off, with the $US3.2 billion resort set to receive more gaming tables than initially expected.\nMelco Crown Entertainment, 34 per cent owned by Mr Packer's Crown Resorts, is awaiting a decision in the coming weeks by Macau's government over the number of tables it can operate at the $US3.2 billion casino ahead of its opening night on October 27.\nWhile the $US1.4 billion loan covering Studio City includes a covenant that states the casino needs a minimum of 400 tables, it had been expected Melco may only receive 150 tables when a decision is handed down in October.\nThat led to speculation in September that Melco Crown may strike a $US1 billion deal with the hedge funds that own 40 per cent of Studio City, in a bid to improve the economics of the resort.\nHowever, two reports this week have stated Studio City may now be in line to receive 250 tables.\nThe Hong Kong Economic Journal reported Melco would receive 250 tables, with officials rewarding Melco's efforts to broaden its entertainment offering. It's expected 200 tables will be offered for the opening with a further 50 tables available by the end of 2015.\nChina's anti-corruption crackdown has stymied growth in Macau over the past year, with high rollers deserting the Chinese territory's casinos . Local authorities have responded by capping table numbers and introducing policies to create a more diversified tourism offering.\nIndustry journal Asian Gaming Brief also reported that Melco will receive 250 tables, with 210 offering for the opening and 40 by year-end.\nWhile it remains shy of the 400-table target, Credit Suisse said if the numbers are correct they will probably soothe investors nervous over Studio City's early returns.\n \"Macau Studio City may have secured approval of 210 new-to-market tables for its opening on 27 October and another 40 new tables by year end,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Kenneth Fong.\n\"There is opportunity that Galaxy group may also get additional 50 new tables in the coming weeks (around Studio City opening) and even a further 50 new tables towards end 2015 or early 2016 as to align the interest for new properties. If correct, this would be a potential positive for Melco Crown and Galaxy given the under-allocation of new tables is one of the biggest market concerns for new projects.\"\nMr Fong said if the speculation proves accurate, it would imply an 8 per cent increase in table numbers from the end of 2014, exceeding the annual 3 per cent cap on table growth.\n\"While the actual number of new tables granted could only be confirmed by company/government official announcement, the potential flexibility of table cap implementation is in line with government supportive stance to the industry, in our view.\"\nShares in casino stocks with operations in Macau have surged in the last two weeks, on reports that China's liaison officer in Macau, Li Gang, said Beijing would introduce \"supportive policies\" to help arrest a 16-month fall in gaming revenue in the Chinese city state.\nMelco Crown shares have jumped by a third since the end of September , partly due to better than estimated casino receipts after the Golden Week holiday in the first week of October.\nCredit Suisse said it estimates Macau revenues will clock their smallest decline since January.\n\"We believe the strong run rate should have dismissed the market concerns on junket liquidity,\" said Mr Fong. \"The favourable policy environment and more supportive measures due to [be introduced] bode well for sector recovery, in our view.\"\nStudio City aims to attract a more family-friendly crowd, with a mix of Warner Brothers-themed rides, a Batman flight simulator and Asia's highest ferris wheel set between two art deco hotel towers.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-10-14T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:05:22.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
