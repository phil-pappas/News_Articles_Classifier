It’s all about access: capital markets allow investors to access finance, and allows for businesses to access the expertise needed for growth. But on top of that, listing transforms fundamentally the way in which a business is run – bringing in new efficiencies and allowing for a better return on capital. In real terms, that means jobs, growth, infrastructure, and prosperity.’’ \nLondon’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has celebrated its 20th anniversary. During this time it has raised almost £24 billion and has helped more than 3,000 SMEs to raise equity. Flexibility is provided by less regulation and no requirements for capitalisation or number of shares issued. And many of those companies have gone on to join the main market after growing on AIM. Invited guests highlighted their optimism of Ghana’s Alternative Exchange (GAX) following suit. There was a call on SME’s to consider listing on GAX as it will offer them a better alternative to raising long term capital, they were also encouraged to break the cultural attitude of wanting to own a hundred percent of their business and rather look at getting others to take up shares in their growing businesses. \nThe Lord Mayor noted that developing a country’s capital market is easier said than done. Capital markets cannot function in a vacuum. It takes government commitment, legal support and the engagement of regulators. \n‘’For one thing, we in the UK stand ready to help our friends and partners in Ghana; we will share willingly our knowledge, experience and advice. The UK has some of the finest financial, legal and professional services in the world. We have an international investor base, with experience of capital markets all over the world. We have wide sector coverage: the AIM platform alone has 40 different industries from over 28 countries. And we have a sensational network of advisors who can support Ghanaian organisations at every stage in the process. Those advisors are particularly keen to do their bit. We would all like to explore opportunities to create new partnerships and reaffirm old ones,”’ he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:09:42.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
