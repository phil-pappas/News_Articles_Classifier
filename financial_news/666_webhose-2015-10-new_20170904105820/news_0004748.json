In recent years, banks have raised more than the amount of debt maturing - which means they have increased their borrowing overall, in response to stronger demand for credit from their customers.\nBut after several months of little debt issuance from the banks, they are this year on track to only match, rather than exceed, the amount of debt reaching maturity.\nAdvertisement A credit market specialist with ADCM Services, Philip Bayley, said about $85 billion in debt owed by the big banks would mature on global markets this calendar year, and so far they had raised about $70 billion.\nSimilarly, he said about $25 billion in domestic debt would be maturing, but banks have raised about $22 billion.\n\"The banks have not been as active in bond markets this year. That's both domestic and international,\" he said.\n\"In past years we've seen issuance exceeding maturities. As the banks are growing their loan book you would expect to see that happen.\"\nThis year, however, Mr Bayley said the banks were likely to only replace maturing debt, rather than raise additional funds.\nCost of wholesale debt rising One likely reason banks are raising less funding is the cost of wholesale debt had drifted up in recent months.\nCommonwealth Bank priced $2 billion of three-year domestic debt at 0.78 percentage points over the benchmark rate last week, which compared with a narrower spread of 0.7 percentage points for bonds from other major banks with the same maturity date.\nA key proxy for bank funding costs, the cost of insuring against a default by a bank, in recent weeks rose to its highest point in two years.\nBanks have also raised more than $15 billion in equity funding through capital raisings this year, so that may mean they have less need for extra wholesale debt.\nThe lower fund raising could also reflect softer credit demand due to a slowdown in borrowing by property investors, who until recently accounted for almost half of the growth in housing credit.\nFigures on Friday showed the value of new lending to property investors dropped 0.4 per cent in August, which analysts said reflected a clampdown by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The banking regulator has capped growth in lending to property investors at 10 per cent, which led banks to raise interest rates for investors.\nSt George Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen said housing investor credit growth was softening, which was likely to comfort regulators, and slow activity in home lending overall.\n\"While we expect demand for housing to remain firm, with support from low interest rates and population growth, we expect a less ebullient housing market in 2016,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/bank-risk-spreads-at-twoyear-highs-on-china-fears-20151005-gk1frg"], "published": "2015-10-11T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:09:28.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
