That is why we preferred to go with a negotiated solution.\" \nSwiss authorities obviously deem it easier to show Falciani breeched Swiss data theft and banking secrecy laws, and have pushed ahead with the case against him. \n- Fair trial? - \nFalciani questioned the fairness of the Swiss proceedings against him. \n\"Do I have the right to a just and fair trial? Maybe, but can one really call this a trial?\" he told the Swiss business weekly HandelsZeitung last week. \n\"I have to appear before the court, while the case against HSBC was halted, how is that possible? Am I a greater danger to Switzerland than HSBC?\" he said. \nFalciani became an IT (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) worker for HSBC in 2000 and moved to the bank's offices in Geneva in 2006. \nThe so-called \"Snowden of tax evasion\" and \"the man who terrifies the rich\" obtained access to a massive database of encrypted customer information. \nIn 2007 Falciani took the names of over 120,000 clients and by 2008 headed for Lebanon with his mistress and a plan to sell the data. Swiss authorities described it as \"cashing in\". \nYet suspicious bankers in Lebanon were not interested in buying the dubiously sourced client list, and at least one instead tipped off counterparts in Switzerland to Falciani's activities. \nAfter his plan to sell the data fell apart, Falciani got in contact with European fiscal authorities and began passing them the pilfered information, which prompted numerous tax evasion audits. \nFalciani rejects that he was only seeking financial gain, insisting he had wanted to expose how banks support tax evasion and money laundering. \nThough he remains wanted on data theft charges, France and Spain have offered him protection by refusing to extradite him to Switzerland. \nHe did, however, spend a couple months in a Spanish prison in 2012 at Switzerland's request before winning his release for helping Spain track down its tax cheats. \nFalciani had initially said he would attend his Swiss trial to explain himself, but has changed his mind. \nInstead he has called a press conference later this month in Divonne, France -- a stone's throw from the Swiss border -- to give his side of the story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:24:30.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
