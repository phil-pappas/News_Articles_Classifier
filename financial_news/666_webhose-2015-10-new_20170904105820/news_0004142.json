Investors were shaken as talks between Greece and its negotiators stalled, once again. A special Eurogroup meeting was held on Wednesday, but was unsuccessful, according to CNBC. Greece has a payment due to the International Monetary fund on June 30. Oil ended the trading day lower, settling at $60.27 per barrel. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn sold his stake in Netflix (NFLX) on Wednesday, in an announcement on Twitter. This comes after the company announced on Tuesday it will execute a 7-for-1 stock split come July 14.

Singing, waving Greek flags and banners with slogans such as &quot;No to the euro&quot;, several thousand people filled the street in front of parliament. The demonstration by supporters of Tsipras&#39;s ruling Syriza party and others opposed to the euro, was the second anti-euro rally held this week in central Athens. The latest rally comes a day before a vital summit meeting in Brussels to try and break the deadlock that has left Greece on the brink of financial default.\n5\n 0:55 \nNow watching Up next Greece would Get Hammered If it Left the EU, but would Europe? \nMost economists seem fairly certain a Greek departure from the euro would be a disaster indeed. For Greece. But for the rest of Europe? Some think a Greek exit, or &quot;Grexit,&quot; would not in fact inflict serious damage on Europe&#39;s economy as it struggles to work past a crisis over too much government and bank debt. Comparing a Greek exit to the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which spread panic and deepened a global financial crisis, are misplaced, they say. Others aren&#39;t so sure. They think that while short term market turmoil might pass quickly, letting a eurozone member leave could permanently damage the 16-year old currency that&#39;s now shared by 19 countries. Meanwhile, Greece&#39;s new left-wing government is struggling to convince its international creditors that its reform plans are credible\n6\n 1:37 \nNow watching Up next Why the energy sector will see more upside: Technician \nEnergy stocks have been falling for well over a year, but according to one well-regarded technical analyst, the sector may see a short-term rebound.\n7\n 6:51 \nNow watching Up next Bernanke won't second guess Yellen, but sees headwinds \nBen Bernanke is not envious of the “tough call” Janet Yellen must make with respect to raising interest rates.\n8\n 1:42 \nNow watching Up next Key levels traders should watch in Procter & Gamble: Technician \nAhead of the company’s earnings, shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) are approaching a major technical resistance level that could signal a change in the stock’s long-term direction, according to Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG.\n9\n 3:31 \nNow watching Up next Giphy: We're the next Google \nGiphy co-founder and CEO, Alex Chung tells us why and he&#39;s planning to revolutionize search on the internet.\n10\n 16:02 \nNow watching Up next Apple cleaning up in China, Nike vs. Under Armour and Icahn's track record \nYahoo Finance&#39;s Midday Movers is live each weekday at 12pm ET, covering all the latest news on the markets, the economy and the biggest stories of the day.\nLoad More Sberbank, the biggest bank in Russia, is facing down three so-called \"black swan\" events – unpredictable yet major occurrences which could change its business for good - according to its chief executive. \nHerman Gref, chief executive of Sberbank, told CNBC: \"We are being attacked by new businesses. We are being attacked by new regulations. We have to make newer and newer investments in technologies and this has to be done simultaneously. So we got not one Black Swan but three black Swans.\" \n\"The past year was an extremely tough year for both Russia and for the Russian banking sector…the next year, in our opinion, is going to be much better even if oil prices remain the same,\" he added. \n\nGref is not the only Russian banking boss sounding an optimistic note about the banks' ability to come through one of the worst patches in Russia's economy since the fall of Communism. \nAndrey Kostin, president and chairman of VTB, Sberbank's biggest rival, told CNBC Thursday that \"this is not another 2008\" and he is confident about the country's economic prospects improving next year. \n\nWestern commentators are rather less optimistic about the Russian economy's ability to withstand a combination of low oil prices, a plummeting ruble, and sanctions imposed by the West. \n\"The economy in general is still very much adjusting. We think that conditions for the banks will be difficult for the next 12-18 months in terms of both profitability and asset quality. We are expecting a rise in problem loans, towards the peak of 2009 levels,\" Marie Diron, senior vice president of credit policy at U.S.-based ratings agency Moody's, told CNBC. \n\nThe country's involvement in conflict outside its borders, in Ukraine and Syria, has also impacted its economy, via both sanctions and increased defense spending. \nTransaero, Russia's second-largest airline, this week became probably the highest-profile victim of the recession so far, when Sberbank filed a petition for bankruptcy against it. \n\"I cannot think of any player in the market who would have been able to save this company,\" Gref told CNBC. He blamed the collapse on a poor business model by the airline's previous management.\n\nMore From CNBC \nTop News and Analysis \nLatest News Video \nPersonal Finance \nAustralia International News Budget, Tax & Economy Russia Herman Gref Sberbank", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:56:14.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
