Copper miner OZ Minerals led the sector higher after a private equity firm scooped up a 10 per cent stake in the company, labelling it “undervalued”.\nOz Minerals surged 19.3 per cent to $3.95\nBHP Billiton grew 2.07 per cent to $22.68, while Rio Tinto put on 2.02 per cent to $49.58.\nFinancial stocks were also strong, with ANZ announcing chief executive Mike Smith will be replaced by Shayne Elliott.\nCommonwealth Bank rallied 2.13 per cent to $74.27, while ANZ shares improved 1.62 per cent to $27.52.\nNational Australia Bank lifted 1.87 per cent to $30.54 while Westpac gained 2.32 per cent to $30.39.\nConsumer staples swung into the black after earlier weakness.\nWesfarmers added 1.68 per cent to $39.88, while Woolworths gained 2.66 per cent to $25.50.\nMeanwhile, Qantas rose 2.69 per cent to $3.82, while Telstra added 1.78 per cent to $5.71.\nLooking ahead, the ABS releases retail trade figures for August on Friday.\n Australian share market rallies 1.8%", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/aust-sharemarket-rallies-18/story-fni0dcne-1227552773930"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:17:49.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
