That’s because a child will typically have far longer to remain invested, leaving time for short-term falls in share prices to even out. \nDespite that, 70pc of money flowing into Junior Isas went into cash, and not shares, last year, according to HM Revenue & Customs figures. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas \n“For the majority of Junior ISA investors, cash is simply the wrong choice and parents and grandparents should be looking to a stocks and shares Junior ISA to improve the potential returns,” said Danny Cox, a chartered financial planner for Hargreaves Lansdown, the broker. \n“Investing for new born children or grandchildren is the most popular time with nearly 30pc of our Junior ISAs being set up before the child reaches their first birthday. \n“Sensibly these parents and grandparents are recognising that over the longer term a stocks and shares Junior ISA is likely to provide a much better return than a cash Junior ISA.” \nA wealth of data has shown over generations that shares outperform other asset classes. One of the most authoritative studies is the Barclays Equity Gilt Study which tracks asset returns for more than a century. \nThe table belows shows annualised returns, after inflation, for different asset classes if they are held for different time periods. \nLast year (2014)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:52:56.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
