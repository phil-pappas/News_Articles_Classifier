Alex Ellinghausen by Alan Mitchell The Harper review has the potential to \"unlock enormous economic opportunities for Australia,\" Treasurer Scott Morrison says.\n\"I think you can expect the government to have a very enthusiastic response.\"\nAnd so the Turnbull government has embraced Ian Harper's report on competition policy, with its recommendations that Canberra takes on the economy's remaining citadels of anti-competitive inefficiency, from the taxis to the pharmacists to the government's own social policy delivery systems.\nThat's a big project for a government that already is committing a large amount of political capital to tax reform. Too big for Tony Abbott, whose government all but shelved the Harper report immediately it was released.\nBut Malcolm Turnbull and his Treasurer clearly have come to the conclusion that they will need all the productivity-boosting reform they can get.\nThey are right. Australia has been growing at one and half times the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average for 24 years and voters have become used to the growth in jobs, wealth and prosperity that goes with that. A good many voters know nothing else.\nGrowth at heart of debate As Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens observed at the National Reform Summit, growth is at the heart of the reform debate.\n \"The fiscal policy debate, usually framed as 'when will we get back to surplus?' is actually about: how do we get more growth?\" Stevens said. \"Other discussions, so often framed as about 'fairness' – that is income distribution – might be better framed as: how do we grow the pie? That isn't because distribution doesn't matter. It's because distributional issues surely get easier with growth but much, much harder in its absence.\"\nBut the forces that generated the high growth of the past quarter century have faded. The International Monetary Fund says Australia's potential growth rate will stay at much less than 3 per cent a year over the medium term.\nThe main options available to Turnbull and Morrison are tax reform, workplace relations reform, and competition policy reform.\nIn truth, the government will need all three, although it might be difficult to build a consensus on tax reform while battling with the unions over workplace relations reform.\nCompetition policy reform – the opening of markets to increased competition – entails significant adjustment costs, but it offers consumers increased choice, encourages innovation, and leads to more co-operative workplace relations.\nPublic knows it works Moreover, the public knows it works because they have seen it raise productivity and living standards before. For Turnbull and Morrison that's an important political plus.\nHowever, it could be a mistake to take the gains from competition policy reform for granted.\nMany of the potential reforms are at state level, with the federal government in theory merely providing incentive payments from a relatively safe distance. That might sound appealing to Turnbull, but there is no guarantee the states will fully deliver. The states can take the money and fail to deliver the reform. It has happened before.\nTurnbull and Morrison will have to personally drive through most of the competition policy reform they get.\nIt's gong to be a hard slog, and they should seize the reform opportunities wherever they find them.\nBilateral trade negotiations are such an opportunity.\nGains come from competition Trade reform is just an extension of competition policy. The main gains come from foreign competition – from importing the goods and services we cannot produce economically. Because of that, the Productivity Commission has told the government that the economic gains from unilateral reform covering imports from all countries, and not just one free-trade agreement partner, would be greater.\nOne solution would be to package more productivity-boosting reform into our side of future free-trade agreements, as suggested by the former Industries Assistance Commission head Bill Carmichael.\nThe suggestion has been rejected by the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Varghese, who says it would compromise Australia's negotiating position.\nHowever, if there is a balance to be struck between extracting more export access and reforming the Australian economy, it is clear where the greater gains lie.\nIt is also worth remembering that Australian manufactured exports surged after the unilateral economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s.\nWhy? The reforms produced a sustained improvement in our competitiveness and allowed us to expand our most competitive industries.\nThat's what Turnbull will need.\nAlan Mitchell is The Australian Financial Review's economics editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:13:44.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
