But since dipping below $1.05 in March, it has gained around 9 percent.\nOn Monday, it inched down to $1.1340, close to Friday's low of $1.1335, the currency's weakest since October 9.\n\"Our base is that (the ECB) announces an extension of the asset purchase programme in December, but we see a real risk that they could also go at this meeting, so from an FX perspective we think it certainly makes sense to be short euros heading into the meeting,\" said BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown.\nThe Australian dollar was the biggest mover in a largely flat currency market, strengthening 0.4 percent against its U.S. counterpart after data from China which, though showing growth falling below 7 percent for the first time since 2009, was slightly better than had been expected.\n\"We don't really think that rally is going to last,\" said Lynton-Brown. \"Generally risk assets have performed in an environment of the Fed delaying tightening ... but the reason why the Fed is likely to be on hold is due to concerns about external factors.\"\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was flat at 119.34, having dipped to as low as 119.15 as Tokyo shares opened significantly lower, but it pared its losses as equities regained some of the ground they shed. The safe-haven yen tends to gather bids when domestic equities suffer losses.\n\"There isn't much in terms of U.S. and Japanese data to trade on this week, so participants will look to the Nikkei for incentive,\" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
