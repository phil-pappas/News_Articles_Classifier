Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank AG signaled it may sell a $3.5 billion stake in Huaxia Bank Co. after saying it \"no longer considers this stake to be strategic.\"\nWhile requirements to hold extra capital against such investments have encouraged foreign lenders to sell their stakes, HSBC is yet to give any signal that it’s planning any similar move for its 19 percent stake in Bank of Communications Co.
