Details of financial arrangements and tumours to be studied were not disclosed.\nHowever, the companies did say AstraZeneca's anti-PD-L1 medicine durvalumab would be combined with Lilly molecules, including a TGF-beta kinase inhibitor, a CXCR4 peptide antagonist and an anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody, which will also be assessed with AstraZeneca's tremelimumab.\nThey will also explore other combinations targeting tumour drivers and resistance mechanisms.
