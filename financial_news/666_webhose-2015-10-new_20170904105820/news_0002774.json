I still see reverberations. \n\nFor example, there are plenty of people worried about Kroger   ( KR - Get Report ) , because Walmart's cutting prices for food. That can't be good for gross margins. Others are concerned about what will happen to the Albertsons deal in light of the price pressure Walmart could put on the grocery group . I thought the Albertsons IPO could be a winner if the management priced it in the teens, but they seem inclined to insist on a $20 price point. That's a mistake after the Walmart call if they want the buyers, not just the sellers, to make money.\nThere's some concern that apparel prices could be coming down, too, which is why all the apparel retailers got hit so hard last week. I am not sure how long this pall that's been cast will last. First, the two discounters, Ross Stores   ( ROST - Get Report ) and TJX Companies   ( TJX - Get Report ) are already on the mend and finished strong last week. Action Alerts PLUS charity portfolio name Target   ( TGT - Get Report ) ? I think the Street might be mixing apples with oranges. For instance, Target  has eight different, popular billion-dollar house brands that have awesome margins. I can't say the same about any Walmart brand. You want to wear the house Walmart brand? You want to cultivate that look? I don't. More important, my kids don't, either.\nTarget has long had a price match policy where it will match the prices  of any competitors, including Walmart. But it just hasn't mattered much to the shoppers, and I think that's because the price sensitivity on apparel isn't what you think it is once you rise up a bit on the American ladder. That's right, we often talk about aspirational shoppers as if they aspire to buy clothes at Target. In reality, they aspire not to have to buy clothes at Walmart.\n\nSo if it is not all that bad for the rest of retail, what's the real fallout for Walmart? I have played this one over and over and over again and I think, at long last, I have a theory.\nMust Read: 5 Rocket Stocks to Buy for Big Gains This Earnings Season \nThis investment move isn't about beating up on Kroger or topping Target. It's not about better goods for less. It is about adopting a new investment model. Many people I talk to were unhappy that CEO Doug McMillon dropped such a huge bomb  of lowered earnings forecasts at 10 a.m. and didn't pre-release it, because it is so material.\nThose people don't really get what was going on here -- although I could easily argue that the company should have gotten its change in strategy out there as quickly as possible. Notice, I didn't write \"change in forecast,\" I said \"change in strategy.\"\nGo listen to what McMillon said  on Mad Money . He was surprised that so many were upset with his strategy, because he is going to be boosting revenue substantially with this investment spend. He said he had to do it to beat both the brick-and-mortar competitors and Amazon.com   ( AMZN )  -- whose stock is held in our Growth Seeker portfolio.\n\n1 2 Next › Last » Select the service that is right for you!
