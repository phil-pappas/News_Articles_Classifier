Under that program, insurers whose medical claims costs were lower than expected pay in money to help insurers whose costs were higher. \nFor 2014, insurers that had sicker-than-expected patients requested nearly $2.9 billion in payments, HHS said. But the government has collected only $362 million from insurers that did well. \nThat means insurers who requested payments will get less than 13 percent of what they sought. Some plans may face financial problems as a result, Obama administration officials acknowledged. They said those are expected to be isolated cases. \nA leading explanation for the shortfall is that 2014 was the first year of the program, and insurers were uncertain about where to set their premiums. Things may ultimately balance out, but it's too early to tell. \n\"It shows that insurers set premiums too low in the first year for the health care costs associated with who enrolled,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \"I would expect insurer finances to improve as they've adjusted premiums and enrollment has grown, bringing in more healthy people.\" \nThe insurance industry was disappointed at what its officials called a significant shortfall. \n\"Stable, affordable coverage\" depends on adequate funding of the program, said a statement from Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry lobby. \"It's essential that Congress and (the administration) act to ensure the program works as designed and consumers are protected.\" \nTavenner, who has just taken over at the industry group, was the Obama administration official in charge of the chaotic rollout of the health care law in 2013. \nDespite the concerns of insurers, the Republican-led Congress is unlikely to allocate any additional money for the program, a temporary stabilization fund that lasts three years. \nTechnically, the health care law obligates the government to pay insurers for their claims. How that would happen, however, was not clearly specified by the legislation. \nPremiums for 2016 are due to be announced soon. Overall, increases are expected to be modestly higher than was the case this year. \nSeparately, a White House official said Obama would sign just-passed legislation allowing states to opt out of another requirement of the health care law. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement, spoke on condition of anonymity. \nUnder the law, the size of the small business health insurance market was set to expand Jan. 1 to companies with up to 100 workers, from the current definition of 50 workers or fewer in most states. Employer groups and insurers said that would disrupt the market, leading to higher premiums. \nThe legislation, known as the PACE Act, would allow states to keep the small employer market at companies with 50 or fewer workers. The bill had bipartisan support. \nThink your friends should see this? Share it with them! \nStory copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
