Sadly, the Tories are also at it: as if their luddite attack on Uber and their massive increase in the minimum wage weren’t enough, British business is about to be hit by a punitive new apprenticeship levy. This is part of the flawed narrative that “business isn’t doing enough” (on training, investment and pay) and that the state must, therefore, step in. \nI disagree. Business is already doing a great deal; and the real problem is the public sector, not the private sector. Education in the UK is finally improving overall, albeit slowly, but secondary schools continue to fail hundreds of thousands of children, not least those who would benefit from a much greater emphasis on vocational alternatives. Far too many youngsters leave school with an inadequate grasp of reading and writing, let alone IT (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) and soft skills. It’s a horrendous problem, a blight on the conscience of the post-1960s educational establishment. One consequence is that this imposes a great burden on employers, encouraging some to go abroad for talent. We need universal literacy and numeracy, and far more opportunities for youngsters to learn technical skills; this would allow companies to reallocate budgets away from remedial tuition and towards higher value-added training. \nThe UK also needs individuals to take a greater responsibility for their lifetime development and training. In a world where staff often change jobs, the biggest winners from improved skills are the employees themselves. \nBritain does need more apprenticeships even though numbers have hit 374,200 so far this year, up 59,600 from last year and still has a lot to learn from countries that have mastered the art of training workers in this way. But these must grow organically, according to supply and demand and the needs of the economy, not as the result of a top-down diktat. Central planning never works, in education or in any other area, and forcing too many people to become apprentices is just as silly as forcing too many 18-year-olds to go to universities. Standards will decline, and qualifications will be devalued. \nIt is also vital to remember that not all training is formal. Employers spent £42.9bn on formal training in 2013, less than in 2011, but this category now only accounts for 10pc of training broadly defined. On-the-job learning accounts for 70pc, with mentoring and coaching believed to account for 20pc. Taxing corporate payrolls will merely reduce the amount of cash they have to spend on other things. \nIn some cases, it will force firms to slash apprenticeships to balance their books. One company told the CBI that its training budget is £20m, with £3m of that allocated to apprenticeships. An apprenticeship levy on the overall payroll, as is being proposed, could cost it up to £45m, with devastating consequences on the cash available to train staff. At best, it will divert resources from one kind of training to another; and if labour costs go up, the demand for staff will fall or wages won’t go up as much, cancelling out the cost and ensuring employees, not shareholders, pick up the bill. \nIf, as looks likely, the Government decides to go ahead with a compulsory apprenticeship levy, it must ensure that there are safeguards in place to limit the damage - and keep the tax to well under 0.5pc. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) better, instead of burdening business with ever greater costs, the Government should be welcoming the fact that the Big Four professional services giants have chosen to hire substantially more school-leavers and train them. \nDeloitte is hiring 200 school-leavers a year, and 1,200 graduates; PwC is recruiting 160, as well as 1,500 graduates; KPMG is hiring 256 a year and EY 150. The firms want them to be able to rise to the top and be treated identically to graduates; this is great for social mobility and is helping to erode universities’ costly monopoly on the professions. Such initiatives in other industries could be threatened by heavy-handed levies and state-imposed costs. \nThe training market is gradually fixing itself the Government must be careful not to break it. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:00:55.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
