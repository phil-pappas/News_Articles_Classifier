This has resulted in strong consumer and commercial loan growth and improved efficiency across all lines of business.\" \nNet Interest Income Net interest income increased $0.8 million to $49.6 million compared to $48.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average loans and one additional day in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Average loans increased $105 million for the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to strong organic loan growth. Net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE) were impacted by $2.2 million of accretion from purchase accounting adjustments during the third quarter compared to $2.7 million in the second quarter. Net interest margin (FTE) decreased 6 basis points to 3.61% compared to 3.67% for the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the decrease in accretion of the purchase accounting adjustments and lower rates and fees on loans. \nAsset Quality Total nonperforming assets increased $4.4 million to $24.3 million , or 0.49% of total loans plus OREO, at September 30, 2015 from $19.9 million , or 0.41% of total loans plus OREO, at June 30, 2015 .

The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a decrease in other income related to lower letter of credit and commercial loan swap fees compared to the second quarter of 2015. Noninterest expense decreased $1.6 million to $33.8 million compared to $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was mainly due to $0.9 million of merger related expense in the second quarter of 2015, lower salaries and employee benefits expense related to a reduction in incentive expense and payroll taxes, lower marketing expense and lower shares tax compared to the second quarter of 2015. \nFinancial Condition Total assets increased $81.6 million to $6.2 billion at September 30, 2015 compared to $6.1 billion at June 30, 2015 . Loan growth was strong for the quarter with an increase in total portfolio loans of $128 million , or a 10.6% annualized rate. Commercial loans increased $94.5 million during the quarter, or a 10.3% annualized rate, primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate and commercial construction portfolios. Consumer loans increased $32.9 million , or an 11.3% annualized rate, primarily due to growth in residential mortgages and home equity loans. Total deposits remained unchanged at $4.9 billion at both September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015 . S&T's capital ratios increased this quarter as earnings retention outpaced asset growth.
