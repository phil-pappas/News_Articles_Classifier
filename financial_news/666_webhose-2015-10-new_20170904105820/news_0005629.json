SSH stated it would not provide information on the process, “since any disclosure of information during this phase of the sale process would have a negative impact on the sale process itself.”\nThe Slovenian government attempted to sell the national carrier in 2012 , without success.\n“The offers received will be carefully examined by SSH and BAMC and the sale process will be continued in accordance with the envisaged time schedule,” SSH said.\nIt did not give a timetable for a decision on possible buyers.\nThe small national carrier has fought back from heavy losses in recent years and is close to achieving breakeven. It plans to grow modestly out to 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:26:11.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
