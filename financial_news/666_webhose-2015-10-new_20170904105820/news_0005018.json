It hit $11.968 per barrel on Friday, October 2, 2015. On Friday, September 25, the spread was $13.115 per barrel.\nFor context, the US Gulf Coast crack spread peaked at ~$26 on August 12. The lowest crack spread levels this year reached ~$3.50 early in January.\n\nThe above graph illustrates the US Gulf Coast 3:2:1 crack spread over the last week. The 3:2:1 crack spread reflects a theoretical calculation of the difference between the price of two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of distillate fuel, and the cost of three barrels of crude oil from which these products are assumed to be produced.\nWhy watch crack spreads? Crack spreads represent the price difference between refiners’ revenues, derived from the sale of finished refined products, and refiners’ costs, or the price of crude oil (USO). They’re an important metric that drives refiner profitability and market valuation. This is something investors in refiner stocks should watch.\nA narrower crack spread decreases the profit margins of refiners like Valero Energy (VLO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Tesoro (TSO), which would have to purchase raw materials or inputs at higher costs.\nConversely, wider crack spreads increase profit margins for refiners. Together, these companies account for ~12% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nThese companies spun off some of their midstream assets to form Valero Energy Partners (VLP), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), MPLX (MPLX), and Tesoro Logistics (TLLP). These are all midstream MLPs.\nA narrower crack spread would indirectly hurt these companies. Lower volumes produced by their refining parents would mean less volume to transport. This would hurt the MLPs’ revenues.
