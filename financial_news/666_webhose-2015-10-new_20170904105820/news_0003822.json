It is higher than the minimum wage, which from October starts at £3.87 for under-18s, rising to £6.70 for workers aged over 21, and above the national living wage announced by George Osborne in the July budget .\nThe ONS said that in London, the proportion of jobs paying less than £9.15 an hour hit 19% in 2014, after remaining stable at around 13% between 2008 and 2010, while in the rest of the UK the proportion below the £7.85-an-hour threshold rose from 21% in April 2012 to 23% in April 2014.\nNorthern Ireland was the country with the most low-paid roles, with 29% of jobs paying below the living wage. In contrast, London, the south-east and Scotland had the fewest low-paid jobs, each with 19%.\nGraphic: Office for National Statistics Across the UK, the ONS said women and young people were most likely to be in low-paid jobs. While 16% of jobs done by men in London and 18% outside London paid less than the living wage, among women the figures were 22% and 29% respectively.\nAmong jobs taken by 18- to 24-year-olds, 48% in London and 58% outside were paid less than the living wage.\nThe figures, which are based on data collected in the annual survey of hours and earnings (Ashe), and count jobs rather than workers, showed that cleaning and catering were the sectors where jobs were most likely to be paid less than the living wage.\nThe ONS said 76% of cleaning jobs in London – 37,000 roles – and 68% in the rest of the UK (163,000 jobs) paid less than the living wage. In hospitality and catering the figures were 70% and 65%.\nIn retail, the ONS found that 1.5m jobs around the UK paid less than the living wage.\nA spokesman for the Living Wage Foundation , which sets the figure each year, said despite “significant progress” in many sectors, more jobs than ever were below the voluntary rates.\n“These figures demonstrate that while the economy may be recovering as a whole, there is a real problem with ensuring everyone benefits, and low pay is still prevalent in Britain today,” he said.\nAround 1,800 employees have signed up to pay the living wage, the foundation said. “The living wage offers great benefits to business including reduction in turnover and higher productivity, while 70% of consumers say they would prefer to shop with a living wage employer.”\nGraphic: Office for National Statistics Recently, retailer Morrisons announced it would increase wages for 90,000 staff to £8.20 an hour from March , and other retailers have also committed to increase pay by a smaller amount.\nThe moves follow July’s announcement of a national living wage by the chancellor, which will see over-25s paid more than the current minimum wage. The figure will be set at £7.20 when it is launched in April 2016 and will rise to £9 by 2020.\nTUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Everybody deserves a fair day’s pay for an honest day’s work. But with more and more jobs paying less than the living wage, it is clear that millions of workers are not getting their fair share from the economic recovery.\n“It’s particularly shocking that so many more women than men are denied the living wage. We need to value women’s work more. And we need employers in sectors with large female workforces, such as care services, retail and hospitality, to give their staff fairer pay.”", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645916224/3aad9355-cd22-4532-bb57-44f699c8e7a1-620x265.png?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3d8249497389affccc0c04af8bc6c724", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645803196/a227cca8-7c2e-4431-883e-0c617ba46135-620x302.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=eabe68c9ad89e2ac855302e46645dd47", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645916224/3aad9355-cd22-4532-bb57-44f699c8e7a1-620x265.png?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=dae1ad6c71d68e0a584db1fcc5c7a967", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645803196/a227cca8-7c2e-4431-883e-0c617ba46135-620x302.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=68573fb5f8bb89193ebd97609b630e6c", "http://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-living-wage", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645916224/3aad9355-cd22-4532-bb57-44f699c8e7a1-620x265.png?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=5f4a70b1d2bae763a78d6a5aa1439e11", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645803196/a227cca8-7c2e-4431-883e-0c617ba46135-620x302.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9ce612850e97dfeb26e37ced8377fa7b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645803196/a227cca8-7c2e-4431-883e-0c617ba46135-620x302.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=38f6f996f9ae28612070a81bd3204cfd", "http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/index.html", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/12/1444645916224/3aad9355-cd22-4532-bb57-44f699c8e7a1-620x265.png?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=75b5b746dec4382eae27f6dcef9607b7", "http://www.livingwage.org.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:24:28.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
