Six banks now offer cash or vouchers to new customers who switch their everday banking to them, but does the incentive mean the current account is the best on the market? Below, we look at the best current accounts for incentives and examine whether the incentive makes opening the account worthwhile. First Direct 1st Account – £100 cash First Direct has been offering a cash incentive since 1991, and was one of the first banks to do so. It is currently offering £125 to those who switch to its 1st current account . The internet and telephone banking offshoot of HSBC has a reputation for great customer service. Our own poll conducted last August backed this up, with 26pc of more than 1,000 Telegraph Money readers saying it beat 13 other banks for customer service. This, along with its £125 cash offering, makes the current account an attractive option for those looking to switch. Bear in mind that to qualify for the £125 you must transfer your everyday banking to First Direct using the industry-wide Current Account Switch Service, which means closing your existing account, and pay in at least £1,000 within three months. You will not receive this incentive if you have held a First Direct account in the past. If you aren't happy with First Direct and leave within a year, it promises to pay an additional £100. Clydesdale Bank – £150 cash Clydesdale Bank relaunched its cash incentive offer of £150 to switch. Customers must close their existing current account, set up two direct debits, and pay in a minimum of £1,000 each month, with the first £1,000 payment in the first 31 days of the account opening. To qualify for the cash, new customers must transfer across using the Current Account Switch Service. Halifax Current Account and \"Reward\" accounts – £125 cash Halifax offers £125 in cash to those who switch to one of its three current accounts using the switching service. This means that you must transfer all active credits and debits from your bank account held with another provider and close that account. The Reward Current Account is a good current account for those who want to earn a return on their money but have a slightly lower monthly income, as it requires the account holder to deposit just £750 each month. Most of the other banks ask for a minimum of £1,000. Two active direct debits are also required to earn the £5 monthly reward, which is not interest as it is paid at a flat rate. Halifax's two other current accounts are less attractive. Its packaged account – Ultimate Reward Current Account – for example, offers comprehensive worldwide travel cover and mobile phone insurance, but charges £15 a month. Customers can get this down to £10 if they pay in £750 a month and set up two direct debits. M&S Current Account – £100 M&S gift card M&S Bank's current account, launched last May and branded a \"major challenger to the dominant high street banks\", has no monthly fee and a £100 interest-free overdraft, and comes with a £100 M&S gift card. The current account, despite not paying any interest to those in credit, is a decent account and perfect for loyal M&S shoppers. Not only will account holders be given a gift card, but they will also receive one loyalty point for every £1 spent using the debit card in store or online. For every 100 points earned, customers receive £1 in M&S vouchers, which are sent to the account holder each quarter. The Co-op Standard Account/Current Account Plus – £100 cash and £25 donated to charity on your behalf The Co-operative Bank is trying desperately to attract new customers after its \"ethical\" repuation was tarnished in the wake of scandals involving its former chairman, Paul Flowers, who was arrested for possession of drugs , and the discovery of a £1.5bn black hole in its accounts. In August the mutual admitted to losing almost 40,000 current account customers in the first half of this year. So is the £125 cash incentive enough to draw customers in? Apart from the £125 cash, £25 of which is given to charity, the two current accounts fall a little flat. There is no in-credit interest, and account holders have to deposit at least £800 into the account in the first month to earn the £125 incentive. However, the bank does offer good customer service, according to a MoneySavingExpert poll in August , which placed the Co-op fifth out of 14 providers, with 70pc of those surveyed saying the bank's customer service was \"great\". The £25 charitable donation made on your behalf is an added bonus. The banks that offer non-cash incentives Santander's popular 123 account doesn't offer a switching incentive as such, but its 3pc interest on account balances of £3,000 to £20,000, and cashback on household bills, for a monthly fee of £2, have been enough to attract thousands of customers. In fact, more people have switched to Santander than any other bank since the switching service launched last September. Lloyds' Club Current Account is good for those who can pay in a minimum of £1,500 each month to avoid a monthly £5 fee. Account holders can earn up to 4pc interest on balances between £4,000 and £5,000 and have access to a £100 interest-free overdraft. Lloyds, unlike other banks, offers some added perks for its customers. Account holders can choose from one of three \"Lifestyle Benefit\" options each year. These are an annual Gourmet Society membership, six Vue cinema tickets, or an annual magazine subscription from a selection of titles. dailytelegraphmoney Featured Current Accounts Bank Account Name Reward More details First Direct First Account £125 cashback when you switch Apply Santander 123 Account Up to 3% cashback on household bills Apply Halifax Reward Current Account Earn up to £160 in the first year Apply", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:30:59.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
