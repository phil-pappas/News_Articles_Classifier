Tax credits are a fine example. Mr Brown created a major new welfare payment whose steady growth has left many people dependent on the state for some of their income. Just as Mr Brown surely intended, unpicking that snare by reducing those payments is proving controversial for his successor, George Osborne. \nConservative MPs, rightly conscious of the immediate consequences for low-income constituents, are nervous. They should remember that other major changes in welfare, such as the household welfare cap and the so-called “bedroom tax”, also drew warnings of political and social Armageddon; some even suggested that curbs on housing benefits would lead to the “ethnic cleansing” of major cities. Of course, such fears proved overblown. MPs wavering over tax credits should also recall they were elected in May after those cuts – and on a clear promise to cut another £12 billion from welfare. \nAnd for all Mr Brown’s linguistic cunning in naming his scheme to disguise its true nature, tax credits are indeed welfare, money taken from workers in tax then redistributed by the state according to politicians’ whims. As such, tax credits are inefficient and reduce economic incentives to work and earn more . Despite the short-term political pain, Mr Osborne is right to free Britain from Mr Brown’s snare. This parliament still has more than four years to run and there is more work to be done to balance the books. A retreat on tax credits would weaken the Government and hamper that vital work. Stick to your plans, Chancellor. \nSome £30 billion is spent each year to subsidise people's employment.
