Since it was founded nine years ago, the San Francisco-based micro-blogging site has lost nearly $2 billion, the Associated Press reported . \nInvestors applauded the move, but without rousing acclaim. Twitter stock rose Tuesday by 1.1%, closing at $29.06. \nTwitter's layoffs, announced by company co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey in a letter to employees, signal that its days of rapid and bloated growth are over. Dorsey conceded as much in his note. \nMust Read: 8 Best Large-Cap Financial Services Stocks to Buy \n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team,\" Dorsey said. \"And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.\" \nThe painful job cuts are sure to reverberate in this tech-centric city and also serve as a wake-up call to dozens of tech startups that are struggling to turn their first profit. \nThe company's retrenchment will also affect a formerly vacant and blighted part of downtown San Francisco known as Mid-Market. Twitter moved its headquarters to Mid-Market in 2012, taking over an old Art Deco building. Other companies, including Square and Uber , then followed. Before it announced the layoffs, Twitter had been planning to expand across the street from its headquarters, taking additional space in the building that houses Square, a mobile payments start-up that is also run by Dorsey. \nBut now Twitter had decided \"to opt out of a previously planned 100,000-square-foot expansion of its San Francisco headquarters, according to two people familiar with the company's plans,\" the New York Times recently reported . The company's decision to nix the expansion was first reported by the San Francisco Business Times. Any halt in the expansion of Mid-Market would also affect the many restaurants and service businesses that have moved into the area to cater to the tech crowd. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:57:33.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
