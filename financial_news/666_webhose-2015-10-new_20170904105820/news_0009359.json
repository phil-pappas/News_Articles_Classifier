One of the longest serving members of President Obama's cabinet, Duncan has been a disappointment for many progressives within the Democrat party who looked forward to a roll back of Bush administration initiatives such as No Child Left Behind, which focused on standardized testing rather than critical thinking skills. \nIn a letter to his staff, Duncan said he's going back to Chicago to be with his family. He disclosed no immediate plans, but said anything he's likely to do will \"continue to involve the work of expanding opportunity for children.\" He will stay on at ED until December. \nDuncan became a principal cheerleader for the Common Core State Standards, a national test-everything approach to student and teacher evaluation that grew out of the 1990s American Diploma Project and the standards and accountability movement. Student loan debt went past the $1 trillion mark on his watch.
