Ma's wealth still stands at $22.7 billion. \nBeverage tycoon Zong Qinghou of Wahaha remained in third place with just over $21 billion while Pony Ma, founder of Internet giant Tencent (HKSE: 0700-OL.HK - news ) which operates popular messaging app WeChat, took fourth place with a little under $19 billion. \nLei Jun of smartphone maker Xiaomi, which is seeking to challenge Apple (LSE: 0R2V.L - news ) , jumped five places to fifth by doubling his wealth to more $14 billion. \nYan Hao of road builder China Pacific Construction was sixth while the founder of search engine giant Baidu (Xetra: A0F5DE - news ) , Robin Li, dropped to seventh amid worries over his company's huge spending to expand its business (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:35:48.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
