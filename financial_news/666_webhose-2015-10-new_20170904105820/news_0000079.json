So they started turning more aggressively to product placement in TV shows--sometimes subtle and sometimes super overt. It’s ironic that in 2015, when people really are skipping ads in big numbers, product placement in prime-time TV is waning , as CMO Today reports. Nielsen found that the number of product placements appearing during the first week of the new TV season plummeted by 45% compared to the same week last year. What gives? Simply put, product placements are expensive and hard to do--and there are way more media options out there now. Still, big brands are committed to the tactic, given that these “ads” are pretty much unskippable even for the DVR-addicted.\nFACETUBE : The big difference between YouTube and Facebook when it comes to video has been that people come to YouTube with the intention of watching videos, while people end up watching videos on Facebook as they pop into their feeds. Well, now Facebook is creating a new section designed just for watching video --sort of a YouTube within Facebook, The Wall Street Journal reports. So Facebook will now be able to argue that people that visit this section are in video mode. It’s a good bet that Facebook will put lots of videos there, maybe even with pre-roll ads, something it’s been afraid to do in the news feed environment. Media companies and advertisers have been predicting a move along these lines for a while. And some have even theorized that Facebook could eventually roll out a standalone video app. Either way, the battle of the two titans to own Web and mobile video is escalating.\nREAL-TIME POPE: You probably won’t be surprised that when Pope Francis visited the U.S. last month he had a large entourage with him. But did you know Team Francis travelled with 11 creative folks from the public relations firm Golin--and that his handlers enlisted the likes of Bette Midler to tweet on behalf of his holiness? In fact, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for the first time put together an elaborate social media strategy for the Pope’s six day visit that encompassed activity on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, reports CMO Today. The effort included outreach to 120 social media influencers as well as the creation of real-time GIFs and videos--all part of an effort to reach digitally inclined Americans and young people during a time when organized religion is losing devotees. Did it work? Well, in terms of social media interactions, the data firm Sysomos tracked 73 billion mentions of the Pope on social media during his U.S. visit, compared to 66.5 billion references to the Super Bowl during the big game earlier this year. As for whether that led to more religious interest among Americans, that’s harder to track in real time.\nSNAP DECISION: The Web video content world was still buzzing on Tuesday over Snapchat’s abrupt decision to abandon plans to produce original content--just a few months after the company hired an executive from Comedy Central to oversee those efforts. It seems Snapchat had been right in the middle of taking pitches for original shows when the plug was pulled. But the company may have quickly learned that its users are a lot better at producing content than a new team would be , reports Digiday. Not to mention the fact that making original video content is expensive and failure rates are high. Snapchat will survive just fine -- look at how badly content companies want in on its Discover platform, and how intrigued advertisers are by the app’s huge view numbers.\nElsewhere Facebook is taking regulators in Europe head on [ WSJ ]\nDish filed a petition at the FCC to deny the Charter-Time Warner Cable merger [ WSJ ]\nConde Nast has acquired the indie music-focused publication Pitchfork Media [ WSJ ]\nCurrent and former Wal-Mart workers bashed the company in TV ads that aired during the Democratic presidential debate [ Business Insider ]\nThe New York Times is building out a team focused on digital aggregation [ Politico ]\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump will host “Saturday Night Live” on Nov. 7 [ WSJ ]\nCelebrities could teach Corporate America a lot about how to attract fans in social media [ WSJ ]\nCosmopolitan says it is attracting 3 million viewers a day through Snapchat Discover [ Digiday ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox, at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS481_CMOCol_F_20151012142922.jpg", "https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "http://digiday.com/publishers/lessons-snapchats-retreat-editorial-content/", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "http://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-workers-air-ad-during-the-democratic-debate-2015-10", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "http://digiday.com/platforms/cosmo-says-getting-3-million-readers-snapchat-discover/", "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2015/10/8579538/new-york-times-builds-out-digital-rewrite-team", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "https://twitter.com/perlberg"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:55:39.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
