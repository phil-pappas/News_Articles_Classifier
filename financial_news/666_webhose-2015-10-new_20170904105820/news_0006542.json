As of 09:12 the Footsie was up 12.85 points at 6,390.85, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Composite Index was down slightly, by 0.14% to 3,386.70. \nFigures from China's statistics office revealed the country's gross domestic product expanded at 6.9% year-on-year over the three months ending in September, down a touch from the 7% seen in the first two quarters of 2015. Economists had pencilled in growth of 6.8%. \nNonetheless, the breakdown of the data suggested that stronger growth on the services side of the economy mostly offset weaker factory output, analysts at Capital Economics said in reaction to the data. \nData on industrial production and retail sales for September, also published on Monday, seemed to validate that assessment. \n\"With stronger fiscal spending in the pipeline and credit growth accelerating, we continue to see some potential upside to growth over the coming quarters,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, chief China economist at the think-tank. \n\"The Chinese data should really be seen as win win from an investor standpoint. The GDP reading was better than the market was expecting which ensures that the 2015 7% target is still achievable, while industrial production and fixed asset investment figures were so weak that further monetary and fiscal stimulus this year looks increasingly likely,\" said Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at Oanda . \nInvestors were now expected to turn their attention towards speeches later in the day from two Fed speakers, Governor Lael Brainard, and the president of the Federal Reserve bank of Richmond (Taiwan OTC: 2743.TWO - news ) , Jeffrey Lacker. \nShire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) reassures Lifitegrast will launch in 2016 ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) will purchase UTV Media (LSE: UTV.L - news ) 's television assets for £100m.The FTSE 100 listed broadcaster announced the deal on Monday, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.
