Getty Images by Simon Poidevin Twenty-four years may seem a long time ago, but the dying minutes of the Wallabies quarter-final clash with Ireland on its home ground of Lansdowne Road remains chiselled in my mind and those of my Wallaby teammates, who took the field on October 20, 1991. Irish flanker Gordon Hamilton scored a runaway try that sent the largely local crowd into a screaming frenzy.\nA shocked but determined Wallaby team standing behind the posts was told by Scottish referee Jim Fleming that four minutes remained on his watch. We had time, and the Wallabies leadership group calmly determined that we could snatch a victory. When Fleming blew the full-time whistle, Lansdowne Road was silent and Australia had won. We would go on to trounce the All Blacks in the semi-final then win Australia's 1st RWC crown against England in their own backyard.\nThe Wallabies of 1991 had encountered a near-death experience and yes, history repeated itself last Sunday at Twickenham when Bernard Foley kicked a controversial winning penalty goal to take the Wallabies to this Sunday's semi-final against a red-hot Argentina.\nWatching the game in the early hours of Monday morning for any Australian supporter was truly stressful. Scottish centre Mark Bennett's intercept try in the 73rd minute was looking like the end of the road for Michael Cheika's Wallabies. The rain was falling and the partisan crowd were roaring.\nThe Wallaby team standing behind the posts were no different to the team of 1991 as their minds switched between absolute devastation to a steely determination that their Rugby World Cup dreams and the monumental hard work that had got them to this point were not going to waste.\nThis was Michael Cheika's moment. Building resilience in the teams he coaches is his No. 1 rule of life. It is not an overnight process or a fiery pep talk in the dressing room before hitting the field. Since taking the reins of the Wallabies on October 22, 2014, it has been Cheika's mission to turn the team's culture upside-down.\nHow has he done it? First, by bringing in the best possible coaches in Stephen Larkham (attack), Nathan Grey (defence), Mario Ledesma ( scrum and set piece), and exceptional strength and conditioning expertise.\nSecond, Cheika has established a team ethos that totally respects the fact that success and hard work are inseparable companions.The Wallaby training sessions have been brutal under Cheika's leadership – old school but underpinned by science, psychology and purpose. Cheika is an exceptionally intelligent human being who is rat cunning, charismatic and an exceptional communicator. In 2014, I introduced him to Dr Evian Gordon, one of the world's foremost brain researchers and founder of the Brain Resource Company.\n At the time, Cheika was the coach of the Waratahs and the team was on the way to their first Super Rugby title. Cheika took Gordon through what the Waratahs had been doing under his guidance to train their brains as well as their bodies. Gordon was blown away by the depth of Cheika's understanding and delivery of peak-performance brain training for his players. No psychology degree, no formal training – Cheika was just a natural.\nSnatching victory from the the jaws of defeat against Scotland was no fluke. Resilience, fitness and self-belief got the Wallabies a deserved semi-final berth against the Pumas.\nStiff southern competition The performance of Argentina in this RWC15 has a lot of Australians rightfully nervous about the prospects of the Wallabies progressing to what will be this country's fourth Rugby World Cup finals appearance. It will not be easy, as Argentina has speed, skill and strength across its team.This gives it exceptional line-speed in defence and an ability to launch attacks from anywhere on the field.\nMichael Cheika and his coaches will be demanding a return to the precision and power the Wallabies displayed when knocking England out of its own tournament. Our victory against Wales was built on superlative defence but poor attack. We nearly gave Scotland victory through very poor execution across the park at critical moments, despite playing with admirable intent. Scoring tries against Argentina will only be possible by building multiple-phase attacks that eventually break down a passionate and committed defensive line.\nThe Wallabies of 2015 have experienced their near-death experience, and I believe they will deliver against Argentina as we did against the All Blacks in 1991.\nTalking of the All Blacks – they were awesome against a French team that sadly gave up last weekend in Cardiff. However, they will have to fight every minute of the first semi-final against the Springboks this Saturday at Twickenham. This game will pitch the two historic giants of World Rugby against each other and it will be a lot closer than the form guide may be predicting.\nAnd for the first time in the history of Rugby World Cup, there are no northern hemisphere teams competing in the semi-finals. Why?\nThe answer, I believe, lies in the structure of both hemispheres' professional rugby competitions. Super Rugby is important to any professional rugby player in the southern hemisphere but it is representing their national team that drives the players hardest.There is nowhere to hide in the rugby championship as the three greats of World Rugby, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa join the rapidly improving Argentina in a ferocious competition spread over three continents and an island nation in the South Pacific.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the domestic rugby competitions and the Heineken are rich competitions where player salaries outstrip those in the southern hemisphere. In many ways, the Six Nations Championship can be a secondary consideration for a professional rugby player. There is no doubt northern hemisphere players aspire to represent their nations but I would suggest that players from the south are hungrier, have to sacrifice more in life and are more battle-hardened than their northern hemisphere brothers when it comes to international competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:07:25.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
