Diluted headline earnings per share dropped 15.4% to 120.7c per share from 142.7c per share.\n\"The passing of the new Labour Relations Act initially led to a high degree of uncertainty in the South African market resulting in a knee jerk reaction from a number of prominent clients,\" the group said.\nCEO Richard Pike said the group had lost some clients locally, but international assets had softened the blow.\n\"Our volumes fell quite a bit. These past six months have been very difficult. A significant number of contract staff were either taken on as permanent employees of our clients or simply had their contracts of employment terminated.\n\"While we won’t get local volumes back in the second half of the 2016 financial year, I believe the market will stabilise.\"\nMr Pike said SA remained a key and important market for the group given the scale advantage it offered. There were many market opportunities that still persisted despite a sluggish employment market, he said.\nAdcorp was planning a $100m capital raise in the near future for acquisitions.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=ADR"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:43:33.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
