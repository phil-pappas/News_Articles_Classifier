It boasted several upmarket retailers and was the place to promenade.\nHowever, the opening of Westfield Bondi Junction in 2003 hit the area as some big names moved to the mall.\nNow, it has returned to favour as retailers report stronger trading conditions.\nThe upturn has not been lost on developers and investors.\nIn the past few months, several high-profile pubs have changed hands as traditional operators move in to offer a range of services, including high-profile chefs.\nMitchell Waugh's newly formed Public House Management Group (PHMG) bought the first pub sold by the Ryan family since 1992, the Woollahra Hotel, which was home to Damien Pignolet's Bistro Moncur.\nThe Royal Hotel in Paddington was recently sold to the Public House Group for $15 million and the Light Brigade Hotel was bought by the Bayfield family for $9 million.\nIn the past year, more than than $200 million worth of pub assets have changed hands.\nRay White Hotel's Andrew Jolliffe is also selling the Four In Hand. And the Grand National was sold for more than $7 million.\nHemmes has entered with his Paddington Arms redevelopment and a new hotel in Coogee.\nSupermarket chains Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and IGA also want to expand into the area and are competing for small-format convenience-based offerings.\nAs the major supermarkets' traditional footprint of 4000 square metres in the inner city becomes scarce, more smaller, convenience-based supermarkets will pop up in mixed use developments.\nResearch shows that productivity rates for niche smaller supermarkets are 32 per cent higher than regional and subregional shopping centres, and 37 per cent higher than neighbourhood centres.\nNew suburban high-rise developments also have limited parking so residents without cars tend to do daily, smaller shops and want a supermarket nearby that offers a range of items.\nStephen Bowrey​ and Scott Harris from Property Partnership Australia will soon be marketing a food and beverage or supermarket opportunity in Paddington called the Gordon, through an expressions of interest campaign.'\nThe Gordon is the Uniting Church's development at 1 Newcombe Street, comprising 19 apartments. It is near the Hemmes project and has direct exposure to the Paddington markets and Oxford Street.\nMr Bowrey said the 650-square-metre ground floor would suit a small-format supermarket or provedore that catered for the local community.\n\"It's the largest single retail footprint in the Paddington area to hit the market,\" Mr Harris said.\n\"We have already received some off-market interest from very renowned operators. It will be a highly sought-after location,\" Mr Bowrey said.\nPPA is also marketing The Foveaux, a 53-apartment complex with two retail spaces on the former Legion Cabs depot site.\nCraig Hibbard​ of Property Partnership said the Foveaux retail was also designed to accommodate a small-format supermarket or provedore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:37:09.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
