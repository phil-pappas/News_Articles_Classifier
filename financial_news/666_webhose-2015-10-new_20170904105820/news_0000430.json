( SSRI ) ( SSO.TO ) (\"Silver Standard\") announces that its Marigold mine passed a major milestone with the production of its three millionth ounce of gold on October 6, 2015 . The Marigold mine has been in continuous operation since 1988 and is forecast to produce between 195,000 and 205,000 ounces of gold this year at cash costs below $750 per ounce.\nPaul Benson , President and CEO said, \"Three million ounces of gold from continuous production at Marigold is a testament to the scale and quality of the deposit and the commitment of the Marigold team. Since the mine began operating in 1988, it has consistently replaced Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources and today it has similar mine life as when it opened. We are advancing several exploration targets and the Marigold assay program, which have the potential to increase production throughout the planned mine life and to add to Mineral Resources. The team remains focused on efficient, reliable and safe production at the lowest possible cost and we continue to advance our exploration and operational excellence programs to drive shareholder value.\"\nFor further information contact:\nW.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Generally, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words or phrases such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"assumes,\" \"intends,\" \"strategy,\" \"goals,\" \"objectives,\" \"potential,\" or variations thereof, or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this news release relate to, among other things, future production of gold, future cash costs of gold sold, and our plans and expectations for our properties and operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied. See the various risks and uncertainties identified under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Annual Information Form filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). \nThis list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on what our management considers to be reasonable assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions based on the information currently available to it. Our forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof and we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set forth above, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. \nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors \nThis news release includes Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources classification terms that comply with reporting standards in Canada and the Mineral Reserves and the Mineral Resources estimates are made in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 â€“ Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic U.S. reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. \nCautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures \nThis news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), including cash costs per payable ounce of gold sold. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. The data presented is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. \nSOURCE   Inc.\nView photo\n. Commodity Markets Silver Standard Mineral Resources   Inc. Contact: W.
