Domino’s plans to bring the cars to 25 markets, including Boston, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, New Orleans and Seattle, according to a statement Wednesday.\nDomino’s, the second-largest U.S. pizza company, is attempting to stay ahead of a fast-food industry where delivery is increasingly the norm. McDonald’s Corp., Taco Bell, Burger King and Starbucks Corp. are all experimenting with delivery services, bringing more competition to pizza chains. Though the modified-car program remains small, the idea is to use technology and custom features to give drivers an edge -- as well as creating a marketing tool that can roam city streets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:00:40.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
