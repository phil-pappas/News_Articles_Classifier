Peter Rae That would be a big call. The New Zealanders have had more experience with macro-prudential regulation than we have, but they are struggling to get control of the Auckland property market.\nThe case for a rate cut now turns entirely on the state of non-mining business investment.\nIf it were not for the Sydney and Melbourne property markets, the official cash rate undoubtedly would be lower. The official June quarter capital expenditure survey showed a welcome improvement in the non-mining investment outlook, but the survey's results were less bad rather than good.\nThe RBA's deputy governor, Philip Lowe, last month told the House of Representatives' economics committee that the start of a recovery in business investment was close.\n \"I think we are quite close to the point where we will see business investment start picking up â€“ not dramatically, but a few more businesses will be prepared to say, 'Actually, given the improvement in fundamentals, I think I can now take the risk of committing to capital spending', \" he told the committee.\nBut, to me, that just strengthens the case for a further rate cut.\nA rate cut now would help push the dalliers over the line and, once they are investing, the pressure on their competitors to invest will increase. New capital embodies new technology that gives the owner a competitive edge.\nOf course, the weaker world economy and the increased risks attached to China's outlook are a powerful disincentive to invest. No one wants to be caught with a big debt in a weak market.\nBut the China scare has abated as it has become clear that the risks are more in the medium term, and Australian business balance sheets are in pretty good shape.\nWhat the RBA would want is to have its rate cut spur on business investment without starting a new surge in demand for real estate in Sydney and Melbourne.\nIt would want Westpac's competitors to raise their rates, and might not mind too much if none of the banks passed on its cut in the cash rate.\nThe banks might like that too, but the politicians are unlikely to wear it.\nHowever, a decision by the banks to follow Westpac and then pass on any official rate cut is very likely.\nWill enough of the ducks be in a row in time for the RBA's November meeting? If not, the RBA board probably will sit pat, and harvest another month's worth of economic data while the banks are getting themselves into position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:04:04.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
