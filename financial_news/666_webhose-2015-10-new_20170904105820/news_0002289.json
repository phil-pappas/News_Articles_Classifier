Connect with global executives from companies including: Hershey’s, Dow Jones, Estée Lauder, ABC, Samsung & more, hosted by Innovation Enterprise.\nNew York (PRWEB) October 08, 2015\nOnce successful ideas are created how do they get processed? How do you evaluate the ideas and create a culture where these can be nurtured? And ultimately, how can you efficiently execute these ideas before they become obsolete?\nThe Chief Innovation Officer Summit provides attendees with the knowledge & tools to enhance their innovation efforts and take them to the next level; learning from industry leading figures and collaborating with high-level peers.\nOne major challenge faced is how to successfully & effectively create value from ideas that are generated. Day 1 of the event will include the panel session ‘How Do You Kickstart a Serious Innovation Process?’ Innovation specialists from Bridgestone, Thales, Beckman Coulter and Montgomery Country will be discussing how to pitch ideas to get buy-in, implement the strategy and difficulties in overcoming the barriers & challenges around that. This session will allow delegates to actively engage in the discussion and ask their own questions.\nFor the healthcare industry, there has been a big shift towards a consumer-centric system. This has been caused by non-traditional competitors and the rise of technology - how will providers, insurers & hospitals respond? Innovation experts from Independence Blue Cross, Thomas Jefferson Hospital, Magellan Health & University Hospitals delve into these topics in the panel session on Day 2 of the summit.\n“The fact that this event continues to grow is a reflection on the importance of the innovation role. Knowledge sharing, collaboration and ideation is just as key between industries as it is internally, and the community at this summit is fantastic for that” Richard Angus, Conference Organiser.\nFor a more complete list of speakers, presentations and registration details for the Chief Innovation Officer Summit in New York please visit:\nhttp://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/cino-summit-new-york-15/schedule\nAbout Innovation Enterprise :\nInnovation Enterprise, a CFO Publishing company is an independent business-to-business multi-channel media brand focused on the information needs of Senior Finance, Operations, Analytics, Big Data, Strategy, Digital, Innovation & Sports executives.
