So to that we say: 'Welcome to the Jungle', as the thick cover of leaves may be hiding some dangers still lurking.\" \nIn the note, Krinsky highlighted 15 \"sell ideas\" within the consumer discretionary sector. He also named four stocks to buy, across sectors. \"While names like Amazon, Home Depot , Starbucks and Nike have boosted the Cap-Weighted Discretionary Index above Staples, an equal-weight look shows that Consumer Discretionary is actually underperforming Staples. While it is nothing like we saw in late 2007, it is noteworthy, in our view,\" he further wrote. \"While we continue to think the overall 'market' has limited upside potential in the near-term, we can always find stocks that we feel will at least work on a relative basis, if not an absolute basis.\" More Headlines 9 A+ Rated Financial Services Stocks with Great Growth Potential \nHere's MKM Partner's list, along with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for additional perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n1. Bob Evans Farms Inc. Industry: Consumer Goods & Services/Restaurants Year-to-date return: -15.7% \nBob Evans Farms, Inc. owns and operates full-service restaurants under the Bob Evans Restaurants brand name in the United States. The company conducts its operations through Bob Evans Restaurants and BEF Foods segments. \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates BOB EVANS FARMS as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate BOB EVANS FARMS (BOBE) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, good cash flow from operations and growth in earnings per share. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself, generally higher debt management risk and poor profit margins. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry. The net income increased by 521.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$1.02 million to $4.28 million. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 107.86% to $40.15 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, BOB EVANS FARMS has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -59.32%. BOB EVANS FARMS reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, BOB EVANS FARMS reported lower earnings of $0.70 versus $1.18 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.94 versus $0.70). Currently the debt-to-equity ratio of 1.52 is quite high overall and when compared to the industry average, suggesting that the current management of debt levels should be re-evaluated. Along with this, the company manages to maintain a quick ratio of 0.29, which clearly demonstrates the inability to cover short-term cash needs. BOBE has underperformed the S&P 500 Index, declining 10.65% from its price level of one year ago. Looking ahead, we do not see anything in this company's numbers that would change the one-year trend. It was down over the last twelve months; and it could be down again in the next twelve. Naturally, a bull or bear market could sway the movement of this stock.
