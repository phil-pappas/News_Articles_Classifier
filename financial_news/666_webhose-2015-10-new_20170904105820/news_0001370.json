Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Treasury is modelling the effect of increasing or broadening existing state taxes as the federal government widens the net on options for tax reform, rather than just focusing on increasing the GST to 15 per cent or raising other Commonwealth taxes.\nTreasury secretary John Fraser, along with his state counterparts, will model the impact, for example, of broadening or introducing land taxes, ending payroll tax exemptions and adjusting stamp duties. These will then be put to the next meeting of state and federal treasurers in early February.\nFederal Treasurer Scott Morrison said it was only reasonable to look at the state taxes given the Commonwealth had responded to the states' request and modelled an expanded GST and an increased Medicare levy.\n\"None of these things have been proposed, just like no-one has (formally) proposed increasing the GST or broadening its base,\" he told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"But at the end of the day, the public have got to have a lot of confidence that, when and if we go forward, we've looked at all this and say 'this is actually the best package, this is the thing that meets the objectives, grows the economy, doesn't increase the tax burden but actually results in a better outcome'.\n\"If we got to a position on GST, for argument's sake, and we said 'well, we can do this, or we can broaden the land tax base', that is the argument. I am trying to turn this into a relative argument about taxes, not an absolute argument about the level of the GST.\"\nTax increases At the treasurer's meeting in Sydney on Friday Mr Morrison presented the states with Treasury modelling on tax increases the premiers proposed at a retreat with Tony Abbott in August.\n It is understood the modelling canvassed various scenarios including lifting the GST rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, lifting it by a lesser amount but with a broader base, and doubling the Medicare Levy from 2 per cent to 4 per cent as Victoria and Queensland want.\nThe Medicare option would raise about one-third the revenue of the 15 per cent GST option and Mr Morrison has all but ruled it out because it would render Australia's income tax rates even more uncompetitive.\n\"We all have taxes, they all have an impact, there are always options on all of them,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"They may or may not be palatable politically, they may or may not be palatable from a policy integrity point of view either, like the Medicare levy increase, but that doesn't mean that you don't put them all on the table.\"\nMr Morrison said he told the states on Friday it was not a matter of the Commonwealth lifting taxes to fill funding gaps. NSW and South Australia have led the tax push to help fund the growing health funding gap, exacerbated by a $50 billion cut for public hospitals over a decade unveiled in the 2014 budget.\nBut he said the Commonwealth faced its own yawning gap in trying to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\n\"Some states have a view about a fiscal gap regarding health and hospitals but they seem to forget many of them are in surplus or closer to surplus than the Commonwealth and we have the NDIS,\" he said.\nMr Morrison said his decision to introduce into the debate the Harper competition recommendations, in which the states would open up the delivery of health and other human services to competition in return for incentive payments, was designed to assure the public.\n\"Because if the states are going to get more revenue, and that's the argument, then the public needs to be confident that ... there'll be improvements in the expenditure.\"\nWriting in today's Financial Review, Liberal MP and chairman of Parliament's economics committee, Dan Tehan proposes abolishing income tax for anyone on and up to the minium wage, which is presently about $33,200 a year.\nThis would act as a strong incentive for people to move from welfare to work as well as make the tax system more efficient.\n\"This reliance on income tax hurts those on low incomes as well as the nation. What's more, the people in the lowest tax brackets are also those who need tax reforms most,\" he said.\n\"Targeting income tax relief in Australia would not only increase the incentive of work over welfare, but it would put us in line with the rest of the world, pushing us closer to a simpler and more productive tax system.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:05:02.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
