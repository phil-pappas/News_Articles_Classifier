In 2014, the FinTech industry reached more than $12 billion in investment. Investors include major banks like Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Startups are leveraging trends like big data, mobile, and social networks to change the landscape of traditional banking. Payment processing (Obopay, Square), peer-to-peer lending (Lending Club, Prosper), and New Credit Scoring Models (OnDeck, Kabbage) are among the hottest sectors for these FinTech startups and they are being bought by big banks in dozens. \"FinTech companies are making traditional banking more convenient and more accessible,\" says Jim Francesco, President of Equipment Vine. \"We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. Sectors like equipment financing have yet to be brought into the mobile world.\" Francesco's FinTech company, Equipment Vine, will be one of the first to offer businesses a way to access equipment financing online, without the need of an intermediary. Similar to credit marketplaces like Lending Tree and Fundera, Equipment Vine will allow business owners to choose from a variety of offers. What differentiates Equipment Vine is that owners will not have to worry about multiple inquiries on their credit -- a practice that will lower your credit score. From 2013 to 2014, the amount of capital invested into FinTech companies jumped 201%, a growth that dwarfs the total invested over the previous 5 years. The world of banking is being reimagined, and the pioneers behind these startups are gaining big investments from the world's largest banks. With much of the financial industry still untapped, FinTech will be seeing greater growth in the next few years. Equipment Vine was set up to service the needs of the consumer and the interest of the lender. Small business owners can use Equipmentvine.com to navigate through the numerous lending options and find a loan that best suits their needs while keeping their credit score protected.
