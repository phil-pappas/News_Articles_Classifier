The most interesting part of the judgment features more than two pages of the letter X where Federal Justice John Logan answers the crucial question: \"Should an early release order be made?\"\nBut it does not mean that the judgement is without value for his many former investors.\nPeter Foster was to serve 18 months of a three-year prison sentence for flouting a court-ordered ban. Photo: Supplied\nIf Foster is to remain free of our criminal justice system he must \"not directly or indirectly engage in or be knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct by a corporation of any business relating to weight loss, cosmetic or health industry products or services of any kind;\"\nAdvertisement When released, Foster told reporters \"I'll just go home to my mum and make a cup of tea, hold her hand and tell her I'm sorry for the last 12 months.\"\nPresumably he won't be serving SensaSlim tea, although his lawyer did promise his days of wheeling and dealing are not over.\n\"I'm sure he would like to get back into some business ventures on the Gold Coast,\" said his solicitor, Terry Fisher .\nJustice Logan did not shy away from the potential moral hazard of bestowing clemency on someone who has not exactly shown the greatest respect for our justice system.\n\"Although Mr Foster's deliberate and false purporting to have been in Fiji when all the while he remained in Australia both at the time of his sentencing for the contempts and thereafter until arrested in 2014 was deeply dismissive of the administration of justice and entirely consistent with the deficiency of character described when he was sentenced for those contempts, there are countervailing considerations, albeit of a nature which must remain for the present confidential, which warrant his early release from prison,\" said the judgment.\nBigger News It might have surprised some that the ACCC's top dog, Rod Sims , has let Rupert Murdoch extend his tentacles even further into Australia's media landscape by green-lighting the Foxtel Ten deal.\nThe thumbs up was accompanied by the statement that the competition watchdog \"has not found sufficient evidence to establish a link between these minority acquisitions and the competition concerns raised by market participants.\"\nOh well, what's effective control of a commercial broadcaster actually going to achieve for someone like Rupert anyway?\nOf course, Sims might be relying on News Corp shareholders to do his work for him.\nThe group's loss making local newspapers would have shuddered at the votes from the company's recent AGM.\nIt revealed that, for the second year in a row, News Corp's other investors came dangerously close to unwinding the dual share structure that allows the Murdoch's to control 40 per cent of the company's voting stock with a 14 per cent economic stake.\nThe proposal to eliminate the dual share structure was voted down by 89.6 million votes to 87.8 million â€“ a winning margin of 1.8 million votes out of 200 million voting shares.\nSo the transaction nearly became a redundant matter for Sims.\nTaking out the Murdoch's vote against the proposal, 10 million shares were voted in support of their controlling structure and nearly 88 million shares were voted against it.\nBruce Almighty The other big billionaire stomping around our media landscape, Bruce Gordon , lodged details of his big interest in another commercial broadcaster, Nine Entertainment.\nThe substantial shareholder notice lodged on Wednesday, revealed that Gordon paid $192,112,428.78 for the 118,587,919 Nine Entertainment shares he acquired from hedge fund, Apollo.\nThat works out to $1.62 a share. Which is a bargain compared to the $2.05 that investors paid in Nine's IPO barely two years ago.\nThere is the small issue that Gordon has not actually paid for the shares yet.\nThe paperwork reveals that Gordon has paid a non-refundable deposit of $50 million, with the balance due Monday, November 9.\n\"If the completion payment is not paid by 5pm on the completion date the deposit is forfeited and you will have no interest in the deposit,\" said the agreement from Apollo Management accompanying the statement which was labelled \"commercial-in-confidence\".\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:11:08.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
