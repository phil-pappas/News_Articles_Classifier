He attacked RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav over his ‘Hindus also eat beef remark’ and dubbed the grand secular alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) a ‘mahaswarth bandhan’.\nHere are the top 10 points from Modi’s speech:\n1. For the first time, the elections in Bihar are based on the idea of development. On this day in 1979, we lost our leader Jayaprakash Narayan. JP fought corruption all his life. He died so early because he was sent to prison during Congress -imposed Emergency. Those who supported him are now with Congress, the same Congress that had put JP behind bars.\n2. I wonder the devil got only his (Lalu) body to enter. I want to know how the shaitan got the address (of Lalu). The devil got no other body in entire Bihar, India and the whole world except that of Lalu. And he also welcomed the devil as if some relative has come.\n3. What is he saying? What all Yadavs eat? Whatever position Lalu rose to, it was because of these Yaduvanshis and he insulted them. What kind of abuses you are hurling at them. Is it not an insult of Yadavs and Bihar? Do not humiliate the Yaduvanshis so much?\n4. I come from the land of Gujarat. Dwarka is the land of Lord Krishna where people worship cows. They brought white evolution. As as far the question of following the true Yaduvanshi tradition is concerned, it is being done there. And here the leaders are meting out these kinds of insults to Yaduvanshis.\n5. Nitish came to power promising to end jungle raj. He has now joined hands with Lalu to bring Jungle Raj 2. What relationship is there between this Bada Bhai and Chhota Bhai.. The three parties that destroyed Bihar have come together.\n6.Political pundits will be forced to change their thinking in Bihar. For the first time it will be (fought) above caste considerations. It will be fought on the issue of youth and development. These will be the central issues now.\n7. Do you want they (anti-BJP coalition) should continue their loot in the state? Congress has no power, no influence. Congress was never this powerless. The reason behind Congress’ such sate is the ego of its leaders. But public is aware about everything. Like Lok Sabha, the public will show the Congress its real place.\n8..It is the fight between Jungle Raj and Vikas Raj. Do you want Jungle Raj to return in the state? The biggest manifestation of Jungle Raj was kidnaping. Kidnapping was an industry here. Do you want kidnappings to return? I have full faith in youths of Bihar.\n9. From water to sand, they (Bihar government) have looted all. Here you chant ‘Modi, Modi, Modi,’ and they (anti-BJP coalition) lose sleep. The Chief Minister had promised you 24 hour electricity. Did he fulfill his promise?\n10. I have a dream. In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of Independence, I want 24 hour electricity supply in every household. Bihar needs development and the development will come with the Rs 1.65 lakh crore package.\n 08, 2015 6:15 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:17:57.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
