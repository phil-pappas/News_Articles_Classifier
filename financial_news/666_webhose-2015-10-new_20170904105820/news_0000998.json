But if you thought that you could use the same practices and procedures you’ve used in hiring office workers and apply that to hiring a flexible worker, think again. There is a definite learning curve when it comes to recruiting for flexible jobs. Employers, this is what you need to know in order to recruit for flexible jobs—in four easy steps! Here are four easy steps to recruit for flexible jobs: 1. Make your job descriptions stand out. \nRemote employees are a different breed of workers. They value the importance of work-life balance and understand the need for flex in their own lives. So if you’re writing a ho-hum job description, you’re not going to attract the right type of people to your organization. In writing your job descriptions for flexible jobs, you’ll need to stress why the position is integral to the company (so they feel valued), what makes working for your company so cool (so they’ll understand your company’s culture), and, of course, the benefits that come with the position, particularly the flex part (flexible schedule, telecommuting options, job sharing, etc.). After all, if you’re looking to fill a flexible position, it makes sense then that you write the job description that’s going to appeal to those wanting that type of work! 2. Know how to speak about flexible work options with candidates. \nDuring a job interview, a star job candidate asks about the company’s flexible work policy, and if it would apply to the position he’s interviewing for. It’s a good idea, then, to know where your company stands on flexible work before speaking with potential employees. Talk to your manager or the company’s HR person and find out the organization’s official stance on flexible work. If the company offers flex freely to its employees, you can let your interviewee know about it. But some companies only offer flex to certain employees at various seniority levels, so be sure to know about the flexible work options as they relate to the specific job you’re trying to fill. 3. Turn a high-level, full-time position into two part-time positions. \nStudies have shown that American workers work more than almost any other nation in the industrialized world. But slowly the tide is turning, and more U.S. employees are favoring flexible work over grueling 60+ hour workweeks. If you have a high-octane job that you’re looking to fill, it might make more sense to break the position up into two part-time jobs . This is what many employers are putting into practice. Not only will you increase your candidate pool to include top-tier job candidates, but you’ll decrease your chances of having top talent quit due to burnout from having to handle the entire position by themselves. 4. Look for the right attributes in potential flexible workers. \nFor the most part, you want a job candidate who can accomplish the duties required of the position. But there are also a slew of other soft skills you’ll need to consider when recruiting and hiring telecommuters or other flexible workers. For example, an employee who telecommutes must have super strong communication skills, since he won’t be in the office every day. You’ll also need a potential employee who has a strong work ethic and who is dedicated to the mission of the company. But no matter what type of workplace flexibility is built into the job (i.e., a full-time telecommuting job, a part-time job, a job share, or a freelance gig), you’ll want to have someone who is self-motivated, can manage themselves (and their time) well, shows initiative, and has the ability to work independently. Armed with these characteristics, you’ll ensure that the person you hire will thrive in his new job!
