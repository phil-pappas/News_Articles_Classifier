Spun out of the Post Office on 1 October, 1981, it was in charge of virtually all telephones in the UK, was abysmally managed, employed 250,000 staff and suffered from such poor financial controls that it didn’t really know from which parts of the company its profits came from. \n• Charles Moore: My 18 years getting to know Mrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) Thatcher \nAstonishingly for the younger generations, a quarter of a million people were on a waiting list at the time yes, a waiting list for a landline. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) more scandalously, BT couldn’t even be bothered to tell people when their request for a new line would be met, leaving them in the dark. The company was the embodiment of everything that is wrong with monopolies. \nThat year, Cable and Wireless’s Mercury service was licensed, allowing the first real challenge; and Thatcher’s top ministers, led by Lords Youngs and Joseph, convinced her that BT should be privatised. Crucially, though, she remained concerned about a lack of competition. \nAs Moore reveals, she told Patrick Jenkin, the secretary of state for industry, that “you can’t have a monopoly [once the industry was privatised]. Why not break it up into \"61 separate areas\"? \nYoung agreed with the thrust of this, advocating that BT be split into an international firm and six or seven UK ones, injecting competition into the system more quickly. In the end, the pro-competition view was defeated by the Treasury, which wanted to maximise the proceeds to the taxpayer by selling BT as a single entity; there undoubtedly was also nationalist pressure, as smaller firms could have been snapped up by foreigners. \nThe world has since changed dramatically: Mercury is no more; telecoms is a highly competitive industry; and landlines, mobiles, broadband and TV content are converging. But some believe that Thatcher’s original vision has yet to be fully realised: together with many of BT’s rivals, they want to break the company up, hiving off its Openreach network division, which is used also by other competitors. \nThe network is highly regulated and can’t discriminate in favour of BT; but some believe that the structure nevertheless helps BT and is leading to an under-investment in UK infrastructure. BT, needless to say, disagrees. \nThe case isn’t clear-cut either way; trying to centrally plan competition often has nasty side-effects. But if BT wants to retain the status quo, it must do more to show that the current system is working and give Openreach, which continues to let down too many consumers, a kick up the backside. Lady T would certainly have approved of that. \n= Free up Sundays = \nIt is vital that the move to free up Sunday opening hours not be delayed or derailed. We are allowed to shop whenever we want online, and quite rightly so; so shops ought to have the right to open their stores as they see fit, meeting the needs of consumers. \nSome retailers aren’t keen on the idea, of course: it means more competition for their smaller convenience stores and an even more intense battle to attract consumers. \nSuccessful incumbents never like change. In reality, the only thing wrong with the Government’s proposal is that it doesn’t go far enough and that it is too bureaucratic: it wants to allow local authorities to decide for themselves whether stores should have the right to open for longer than the current six hours on a Sunday. \nThe Government would quite like, it seems, for tourist areas and high streets to be given more leeway, though not necessarily out-of-town retail parks. \nBut while something would certainly be better than nothing, it would make much more sense to sweep away all restrictions without inventing any new ones, or at the very least to increase the total shopping hours allowed on a Sunday by two or three hours across the board and country. \nIn practice, however, it seems that real liberalisation is politically impossible and that the best that can be hoped for is the Government’s original plan. It would certainly be an improvement, and it deserves to be supported by all MPs who believe in the right of their constituents to choose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:54:33.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
