It's trying to clear a 192.37 buy point after leaping above its 50-day line Wednesday in huge volume.\nAuto-parts retailers have benefited as consumers increasingly choose to repair instead of replace their vehicles. The average age of cars on the road has increased steadily, from 8.4 years in 1995 to 11.4 years at the end of last year, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Meanwhile, lower gasoline prices have encouraged drivers to put more miles on their vehicles, leading to an increase in repairs.\n\nYet analysts say Advance may have trouble digesting General Parts International, a supplier of parts to auto-repair shops and other commercial markets under the Carquest and Worldpac brands. Advance bought General Parts last year.\nJefferies initiated coverage of Advance on Sept. 15 with a hold rating, calling the acquisition \"transformational\" but adding that \"elevated expectations and subsequent premium valuation warrant a conservative approach.\"\nIf all goes well, the purchase could give Advance a boost in the \"do-it-for-me\" market and reinvigorate growth in same-store sales, or sales at stores open for at least a year. The key metric helps investors determine if a company is growing due to higher demand or because it's opening new stores.\nAdvance soared 11% Wednesday, briefly clearing the 192.27 buy point, after activist hedge fund Starboard Value took a 3.7% stake in the company. Starboard is urging the retailer to focus on commercial sales and boost margins. Annual pretax and quarterly after-tax margins have lagged behind rivals such as AutoZone (NYSE: AZO ) and O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY ).\nProfit for Q3 is seen rising 10% to $2.08 a share, up from gains of 6% and 9% in the prior two quarters. Sales are expected to rise 2% to $2.33 billion, in line with the past two quarters but well below the double-digit pace of earlier periods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:07:47.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
