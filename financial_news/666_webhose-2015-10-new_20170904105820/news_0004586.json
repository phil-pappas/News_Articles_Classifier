The company expects it to break even next year, as the new Financial Conduct Authority registration of all consumer lenders pushes many competitors out of the market. \nGlo, Provident’s new guarantor loan platform, has been given the green light to continue lending after a successful trial period. Meanwhile its recently-acquired car finance outfit Moneybarn added 3,000 customers to take its total to 29,000, who have £209m of loans receivable. \n“Credit quality in these businesses is sound which leaves the group in good shape to deliver further good-quality growth as it enters the important fourth-quarter trading period,” said Peter Crook, chief executive. \nCenkos analysts raised their full-year forecasts to assume revenues of £1.13bn and adjusted pre-tax profits of £291m for the year. \n“It is a good statement, and confidence appears high going into the fourth quarter – traditionally, Provident’s busiest period ahead of Christmas trading,” said analysts at Citi. \nShares in the FTSE 250 company opened 3pc higher following the update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:14:58.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
