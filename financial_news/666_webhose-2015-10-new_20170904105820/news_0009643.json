Ananthalakshmi \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold fell to a two-week low on Friday, extending losses into a sixth straight session as investors positioned themselves ahead of U.S. jobs data that could help gauge when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. \nEconomists polled by Reuters expect Friday's nonfarm payrolls report to show U.S. employers hired 203,000 workers in September, improving from August's 173,000 increase. The unemployment rate was forecast to hold at 5.1 percent, a near 7-1/2 year low. \nA strong report would support views that the economy was recovering strongly enough for the Fed to raise rates this year, which in turn could hurt non-interest-paying gold. \nSpot gold had eased 0.1 percent to $1,111.66 an ounce by 0347 GMT, after dipping to $1,110.55 earlier in the session - the lowest since Sept. 16. It has lost nearly 3 percent for the week, its biggest such decline since the week ended July 24. \n\"Our call for gold prices to touch $1,050 at year-end is still very much intact on the grounds for a Fed fund rate hike before the year is up,\" said OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan. \nThe Fed will hike rates by 25 basis point hike this year on the back of a recovery in the economy, he said. \nThe U.S. central bank has said the timing of a rate hike would be data dependent. Higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold, while boosting the dollar. \nWednesday's robust ADP data on U.S. private-sector jobs, bolstered expectations that the nonfarm payrolls report would also be strong. \nOther data on Thursday showing a slowdown in manufacturing activity failed to provide any relief for gold, as traders were reluctant to place big bets ahead of the jobs report. \nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams on Thursday renewed his call for an interest-rate hike \"sometime later this year,\" citing near-full employment and rapidly rising house prices that may be a sign of excessive economic optimism. \nAmong other precious metals, palladium was trading near a three-month high of $679.50 reached in the prior session. It was headed for its fourth straight weekly gain, its longest such winning streak since June-July 2014. \nThe metal, chiefly used in catalysts for gasoline engines, was boosted by data showing strong car sales from major automakers. It has also benefited from views that demand for gasoline cars would increase after Volkswagen's emissions scandal raised concerns about diesel engine demand. \nPlatinum, which is used in diesel cars, was on track for its second straight weekly drop. \n(Reporting by A.
