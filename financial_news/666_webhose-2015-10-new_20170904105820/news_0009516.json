In the meantime, the few winners include safe-haven government bonds and gold.\" \nFriday's respite comes as gold has been hit also by weaker demand from China, the world's second biggest economy after the United States. \nConcerns that China -- which accounts for one out of every eight dollars of world gross domestic product -- is slowing more than thought sent world markets into a tailspin in recent weeks as investors fretted about its impact on global growth. \nLooking ahead however, and according to Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at dealers Gain Capital (NYSE: GCAP - news ) , \"a pickup in inflation should boost the appeal of gold\". This is because gold is seen as a good store of value amid rising prices for goods and services. \nThe Federal Reserve has repeatedly said it wants to see more indications of tightening in the jobs market -- including both rising wages and incomes -- and prices before it begins moving interest rates higher toward a more normal policy stance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:43:39.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
