I have always conducted my business openly and in full accordance with the rules. In the best interests of the party, I have taken this decision.\"\nIt was bad news for Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, currently campaigning in Ontario, as he tries to capitalize on a surge in support that has vaulted him into first place in the polls with less than a week before the election.
