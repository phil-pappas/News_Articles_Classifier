Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Technology giant Hewlett Packard has launched a new range of laptops, tablets and printers in Australia, including its thinnest, lightest laptop ever, as it tries to claw back its innovative, market-leading position of days gone by.\nBut the company is now facing even more competition in the laptop market, following the launch of Microsoft's first laptop, the Surface Book, earlier this month.\nThe newest editions to HP's Australian products include a limited edition rose gold HP Spectre x360 with Bang and Olufsen speakers, the HP Spectre x2 tablet, the 13 inch HP ENVY notebook and the 34 inch HP ENVY curved all-in-one.\nHP ENVY notebook HP's latest ENVY Curved all-in-one device has a 1 terabyte hard drive. Supplied HP said the ENVY was its thinnest, lightest notebook yet. The 13 inch ENVY weighs 1.27 kilograms and has 10 hours of battery life.\nThe notebook also has a hinge which slightly elevates it to create a more efficient cooling system. It also has a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader.\nThe device is on sale for $1299, making it a few hundred dollars cheaper than the Macbook Air, however it is also heavier and the battery life is shorter.\nThe HP Curved All-in-One meanwhile has a 34 inch diagonal curved display, a sixth generation Intel Core processor and a 1 terabyte hard drive. Through a deal with Dropbox, owners will also get 25 gigabytes of free online storage for six months.\nHP's latest LaserJet printers are 150 per cent faster at double-sided printing than the previous generation. Supplied In time for the new Star Wars movie, HP has also released a limited edition themed laptop. It includes a Star Wars Command Centre where users can browse special content such as behind-the-scenes photos and set designs.\nResponding to questions about the competition from Microsoft's new Surface Book, HP South Pacific personal systems director Paul Gracey said any innovative changes in the sector were a good thing.\n\"If it's coming from Microsoft, so be it,\" he said.\n\"That release will innovate the premium segment within PC and certainly our partnership with Microsoft is a very strong one. We've seen what they've done with Surface in the last 12-18 months and that innovation and marketing engine is good for the category in total.\"\nPrinting products HP also launched a range of new consumer and commercial printers.\nThe consumer-targeted ENVY 4520 printer comes in a sleek, matte black design and allows users to send a mobile print job from their mobile device, as well as PC.\nIt also has a touch screen and automatic arm which extends upon printing to catch the paper.\n\"Consumers today are becoming more mobile, connected and focused on style,\" HP South Pacific inkjet printing systems category manager Manpal Jagpal said.\nIn its business product range, HP announced the HP OfficeJet 4650 printer and a new series of LaserJets.\nThese printers offer two-sided colour colour printing, 150 per cent faster than its predecessor. They also have improved toner cartridges, allowing more pages to be printed per cartridge.\nThere was no mention of 3D printers, but this has previously been flagged as a growth market for HP.\nFuture of HP Earlier this month HP's board of directors approved the split of the company into two entities, an enterprise division and HP Inc, as announced in October last year.\nHP Inc, which will be composed of the PC and printing segments has been a lead weight on the company, hit hard by declines in PC and printer sales.\nIn September the business announced another 25,000 to 30,000 job cuts , as part of the split, bringing total job cuts to about 10 per cent of the company.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:03:36.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
