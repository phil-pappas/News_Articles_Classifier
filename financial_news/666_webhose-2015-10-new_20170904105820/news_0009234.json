American officials, who now acknowledge they underestimated the complexities on the ground, watched as recruits fought the wrong enemy, handed over equipment to al Qaeda or melted into Syria’s chaos. The program’s early setbacks have reduced American influence in the country and left an opening for Russia—a long-standing Syrian ally— to ramp up its military assistance for the country’s embattled leader , Bashar al-Assad. To identify rebel brigades eligible to receive support, the Americans created a color-coded ranking system—green dots for brigades deemed acceptable to all parties, yellow for borderline groups, red for radicals—leading one senior Turkish official to observe, “The Americans color-coded; the Russians invaded.”\nPacific Pact Global trade flows have stagnated since the financial crisis but there may at last be a ray of hope across the Pacific. The U.S. and 11 countries in the region are in the home stretch on talks to complete a sweeping trade agreement that will lower barriers to goods and services and set commercial rules of the road for two-fifths of the world’s economy. The U.S. and Australia reached a tentative accord on perhaps the most difficult dispute in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks—the length of intellectual-property protection afforded to biologic drugs. Officials were still negotiating in Atlanta on Sunday evening, the fifth day of talks, although they expressed optimism for a completed deal. All is not yet settled, however. Any deal will have to be approved by national legislatures, with the U.S. Congress likely to pose the biggest challenge.\nEngineering a Scandal Two top Volkswagen VLKAY -2.74 % engineers who found they couldn’t deliver a clean diesel engine as promised for the U.S. market are at the center of a company investigation into the installation of engine software designed to fool regulators. The men, Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi NSU 0.08 % ’s chief engineer, and Wolfgang Hatz, developer of Porsche’s Formula One engines, were put in charge of research and development at Volkswagen shortly after Martin Winterkorn became chief executive. The pair are viewed as two of the best and brightest engineers in German industry. Volkswagen has acknowledged that managers masked the emissions of new-car engines to sell so-called clean diesel technology to skeptical American consumers. Finance officials at the car maker are evaluating the impact of the emissions-cheating scandal and assessing options should the crisis take a greater-than-expected toll.\nPulling the Plug Inventor Nikola Tesla’s century-old prediction of commercially viable, wireless power transmission is expected to come true next year. Many companies are vying to alleviate the frustration of forgetting to plug in your device. But wireless power, Journal columnist Christopher Mims writes, will be not just a convenience, but a fundamental enabler of whole new platforms. With power transmitters that cover entire rooms, ambient energy could fuel the Internet of things, leading to “smart” everything. The basic types of wireless power include mats, “magnetic resonance” and transmission through radio or sound waves. Each has its issues, suggesting the three-pronged outlet won’t be obsolete soon, but vindication is likely for Mr. Tesla.\nTOP STORIES U.S. More Police Decide Against Naming Mass-Shooting Suspects\nLow Profile Fits Marco Rubio’s Strategy\nWORLD Doctors Without Borders Closes Afghan Hospital\nPortuguese Coalition Loses Parliamentary Majority\nBUSINESS UAW Aims to Salvage a Fiat Chrysler Pact\nVegas Casinos Fight to Buy Their Own Electricity\nMARKETS Glencore Oil Deals Could Bite Banks\nConnecticut, America’s Richest State, Has a Huge Pension Problem\nToday’s Video Catching Air ENLARGE Wingsuit fliers from around the world have been competing in the U.S. Parachute Association’s first National Wingsuit Flying Championships in Illinois.\nNumber of the Day $2.5 billion The size of the stake that Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has accumulated in General Electric since the middle of May—roughly 1%—making the activist investor one of the company’s top 10 shareholders and adding urgency to GE’s efforts to revive its long-depressed stock price.\nQuote: of the Day ‘ We’re running an all-out war against Palestinian terrorism. ’\n—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will deploy more soldiers to Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and increase administrative detentions of Palestinians following a pair of stabbing attacks against Jewish citizens over the weekend.

It is ironic that the ‘concessions’ made by union members—a significant contributor, no doubt, to the domestic auto industry’s stabilization as opposed to being on life support—are the first thing the unions want to reverse.” J. Meythaler weighed in from Florida, “Maybe the WSJ should publish upper- and middle-management salaries to put the hourly workers’ wages and benefits in context. In that light, most Americans would likely see the workers’ point. Though coercion might give the wrong optics, that same sort of coercion was used by ownership against the union to gain concessions when things were going south.” Diane Brighton of California commented, “Of course the auto makers should share their good fortune with their workers. The workers chose to keep their jobs and accept lower benefits and wages when times were tough. Now it’s time to reward their sacrifice. I’m willing to bet that management has been enjoying higher salaries and bonuses.” Also from California, Tom Lindemann wrote, “The pendulum always swings too far. The opportunistic unions will take advantage of the vulnerable car companies during their recent good times. Then they will give back when the next debacle hits the auto industry. Car-buying consumers always pick up the tab.”\nThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.
