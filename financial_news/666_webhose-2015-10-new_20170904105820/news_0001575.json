Inflation for September is due on Tuesday, and is likely to show the annual reading was steady 0.0 percent, unchanged from a month ago. \nSterling was up 0.35 percent at $1.5361, not far from a two-week high of $1.5382 struck on Friday. The dollar hovered near a three-week low versus a basket of major currencies with Fed vice-chair Stanley Fischer the latest to sound mixed on the chances of a hike by December. \nThe euro was down 0.1 percent at 74.05. \n\"Repeated comments from BoE policymakers that they still intend to raise interest rates over the next year will prevent the pound from an aggressive period of weakness, but another weak inflation reading might also remind traders the BoE will not be raising rates until at least the second half of 2016,\" said Jameel Ahmad, chief markets strategist at FXTM. \nSterling has been underpinned for most of this year by expectations the BoE would follow the Federal Reserve in raising rates, but that view has been challenged given a global slowdown. \nBut recent data has shown growth in the UK maybe slowing. The country also racked up a larger than expected trade deficit in August, while construction output surprised by sinking in both annual and monthly terms. \nLast week, the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for a second time this year and also trimmed growth prospects for Britain. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) now expects the UK economy to grow at 2.5 percent in 2015 and 2.2 percent in 2016. \nStill, the British economy is expected to outperform other major economies, a factor that should help the currency. \n\"We prefer buying dips in the pound with the UK much further from easing than other major central banks, holding a yield advantage,\" said Josh O'Byrne, currency strategist at Citi.
