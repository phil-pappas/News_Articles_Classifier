WGBS rallied a significant 47.4% (72 cents) to $2.24 on Oct 8 following encouraging third-quarter preliminary revenue announcement.\n\nThird-quarter revenues, projected between $1.9 million and $2 million, are expected to be an all-time high for WaferGen,\n\nMeanwhile, full-year sales are expected within $7.8 million to $8.2 million, up from the earlier guided range of $7.5 million to $7.8 million. The recently launched Icell8 single-cell system drove the guidance upgrade.\n\nIcell8 single-cell is a smartchip-based system that can “isolate thousands of cells and process specific cells for analysis, including next-generation sequencing”. The whole procedure is done with the help of CellSelect automated imaging and software.\n\nThe system is capable of running multiple samples or experiments on a single chip, by dividing the chip into as many as eight sections. As per company data, the Icell8 system is capable of identifying rare cells from a cell population at a sensitivity of <1%.\n\nGenentech, Karolinska Institutet, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, National Jewish Health and The Broad Institute are some of the early access partners of WaferGen’s system.\n\nThe commercial availability of Icell8 single-cell System is expected to boost WaferGen’s customer base. Moreover, higher adoption of the SmartChip platform (67% of the total revenue in third-quarter 2015) is a key factor behind the impressive revenue growth. The SmartChip platform is a flexible and high-throughput system capable of target enrichment, qPCR and SNP genotyping.\n\nWe believe WaferGen’s SmartChip platform has substantial long-term prospects, reflected by the string of contract wins. In August this year, China-based enterprise Annoroad selected the SmartChip platform for high-throughput target enrichment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, SNP genotyping services and library quantification for next-generation sequencing.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks \n\nWaferGen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nBetter-ranked stocks in the Medical Instruments industry are Cyberonics Inc. CYBX, Masimo Corporation MASI and Mazor Robotics Ltd. MZOR. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
