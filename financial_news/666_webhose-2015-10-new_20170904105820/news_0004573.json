What we have witnessed today is a bank that truly understands what it takes to please a customer.' \nWelcoming patrons of the play at the National Theatre, the Managing Director of Access Bank Mr Dolapo Ogundimu, highlighted the rationale for which the bank uses the customer service week to bring attention to the needs of customers. \nHe said: 'The differentiating factor for the banking industry is how the customer is served. The quality of your service is the determinant factor as to whether the customer will stay loyal to you now or in the future. We recognise this fact and have prioritised Customer Service excellence across our operations. For us at Access Bank we know and believe that everything we do revolves around one person, the customer.' \nThe week-long programme was marked with activities across all the Bank's branches nationwide and customers were treated to enhanced customer service and special appreciation packages. \nHighlights of the programme this year include Service Quiz competition for staff. Management members also took the opportunity to interact with customers within and outside the banking halls. \nAccess Bank uses the annual celebration to heighten staff awareness to achieve and maintain service excellence as well as appreciating customers for their brand loyalty and decision to do business with the Bank. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:04:55.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
