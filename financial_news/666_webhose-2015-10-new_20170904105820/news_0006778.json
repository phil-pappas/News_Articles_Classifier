Nic Walker by Matthew Stevens Brookfield Infrastructure is said to be surprised by a bellicosity made explicit in the competition regulator's decision to force a pause in progress of the Canadian's $8.9 billion bid for our recovering national rail and port champion Asciano.\nAnd no one should have any doubt about it – the pair of red lights flashed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission at Brookfield's bid are so bright you have to wear shades.\nReinforced by a weight of strong stakeholder feedback, the commission has expressed very particular concerns about a set of infrastructure assets that Brookfield already owns in Western Australia and Queensland and the market power that might be expressed from the overlap that would occur if Asciano's Pacific National train sets are laid over the top of them.\nBut the almost philosophical underpinnings of the regulator's disinclination for the Brookfield's deal are as much a worry as the detail that inspired the statement of issues released early on Thursday morning.\nThe regulator has stated two intellectual positions very, very clearly.\nFirst, the effects of vertical integration on competition are difficult to predict, hard to identify and hard to regulate. So, second, rather than regulate vertically integrated businesses, the regulator has expressed a clear preference deal that result in vertical integration should not be allowed to happen in the first place.\n\"The ACCC's strong view is that the only way to avoid the risks to competition that are likely to be created by vertical integration is to avoid the creation of vertically integrated market structure altogether,\" the regulator said.\nSo what is it in the Brookfield deal that so concerns the regulator?\n Well, Brookfield owns regional railways in WA that connect farmers and miners with export ports and the wheat growers in particular have been loudly critical of the management of that network. Pacific National is a large users of those tracks.\nAnd Brookfield also owns the 85 million tonnes a year Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal (DBCT), one of two export facilities at Mackay's Hay Point. Pacific National is the second biggest provider of train services in the Queensland coal chain.\nAccording to the regulator, and those whose complaints have informed its position, the deal proposed \"would\" deliver Brookfield with \"ability and incentive to foreclose competitors of Pacific National\".\nThose doing it tough digging up coal in Queensland's Bowen Basin know all about the risks of vertical integrated infrastructure. The state's coal rail paths are all owned by Aurizon. Aurizon is also the biggest coal train operator in the Bowen. This combination continues to cause very public anxiety for customers and competitors alike.\nNo paradox seen Somewhat paradoxically, a leader in the charge against Aurizon's expression of integrated market power has been none other than Asciano.\nMind you, Brookfield doesn't see any paradox there because it does not accept the ACCC's characterisation of the merger process it hopes is still in train.\nThe global infrastructure operator opened its case to the ACCC back in July with the position that there was no overlap between the Brookfield and Asciano offerings in either WA or Queensland. And it maintained that position after earning its red lights on Thursday.\nIn response to the ACCC's SOI, Brookfield noted that the integrated grains monopoly CBH stands a countervailing force between the train tracks and the wheat growers. It noted that access and its pricing are regulated by the WA competition overseer, that Pacific National carries no grain in WA and that 45 per cent of the state's crop is hauled by road.\nOver in Queensland the risk of foreclosure of competition is mitigated by market and management structure that work in concert with behavioural undertakings offered too and overseen by the Queensland Competition Authority.\nThe Brookfield proposition is that it may own DBCT, but responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the port lies with a management company that is owned and operated by five of the six coal miners that use the terminal.\nThe other protection in Queensland is that the coal logistics chains works on a series of one-to-one contractual relationships. To get coal to port, coal miners needs to write three separate contracts, one with the track operator, another with the freight provider and then finally one with the port operator.\nSome customers of DBCT have expressed concerns to the regulator that this might change with the takeover of Asciano with the result that Pacific National would start acquiring terminal space and with that exercise greater pricing power.\nMisplaced concerns Brookfield insists there concerns are misplaced. It would seem likely that undertakings that specifically address those and other concerns have been offered or soon will be.\nWhat might they look like? One DBCT customer has offered a model in its opening submission to the regulator, suggesting a regulated transparency that would force functional separation of the terminal from the rail business. Each would be required to maintain separate accounts, management and boards.\nThe Brookfield strategy from here will be to isolate the technical from the philosophic. Brookfield will attempt to progressively ring fence each ACCC concern with a firm and enforceable undertaking. While refuting claims that this deal makes Asciano substantially more structurally aligned than it already, Brookfield will not spend a whole lot of time attempting to disabuse the regulator of its concerns about vertical integration.\nWhy not?\nWell, because the ACCC mandate in cases such as these is to protect the community against arrangements that demonstrably and significantly lessen competition. That is the test here. The way Brookfield sees it, the fact that the ACCC does not much care for vertical integration is neither here nor there in the eyes of the law it is charged with enforcing.\nNew calm at the Third Force A year of living angrily appears to have come to a close at Fortescue Metals with the Third Force demonstrating a new and admirable circumspection in confirming another impressive quarter of cost reduction and debt management.\nHaving moaned and argued its way through much of 2015, Fortescue management has patently decided to refocus on themselves and their company's achievements rather than sustain a diverting and ultimately unwinnable war of words with its Pilbara peers and their collective competitor in Brazil.\nOver the September quarter Fortescue's cash costs dropped to $US16.90 a tonne. Just two years ago that same number was very nearly $US49.44. So if things had stayed the same, Fortescue would barely be cash break-even given that it was paid an average $US50 a tonne for exported tonnes through the most recent quarter.\nEven by the cost-reduction standards of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, this is an impressive achievement and one born of a clever and effective roll-out of processing technologies that has allowed Fortescue to tap shallower ores that could not have been economically been mined previously.\nFortescue's boss Nev Power reckons there is no reason that the business cannot join Rio and BHP at the lowest point of the iron ore cost curve by producing at a cash cost of $US15 a tonne.\nThat might not see Fortescue match it for the break-even of the Pilbara's legacy giants, but it will likely leave the Third Force highly competitive with the world's biggest producer Vale. As we keep saying this is important because, at times of oversupply, the iron ore price will be set by the highest cost major producer.\nAs things stand, Vale sits as the marginal producer in the Chinese market. Fortescue's challenge is to ensure that remains the case as the Brazilian introduces a new generation of low cost production. The evidence suggests the Third Force is on track to do just that.\nOne reason why Fortescue's break even costs sit maybe 30 per cent higher than BHP or Rio's is that the Third Force is carrying the cost of $US8.9 billion ($12 billion) of comparatively high cost debt. But debt is now one of the most interesting cost levers being pulled by Fortescue management.\nBecause Fortescue sells pretty much all that it digs up every quarter and does so at an expanded cash margins, it continues to throw off an awful lot of free cash flow. Given the company is no longer throwing that cash at capital works, it is free to deploy an expanded pool of cash elsewhere.\nOver the September quarter Fortescue re-purchased $US384 million ($529 million) worth of its own debt. But, because debt markets are increasingly uncertain about the minerals sector generally and Fortescue particularly, it bought that debt at an average of 80¢ in the dollar.\nThe result is Fortescue will book a $68 million gain on the retirement of that debt and save itself $US33 million in interest payments. No surprisingly Power says Fortescue will continue to buy itself while the market discount persists. And it is. Presently the various tranches of Fortescue debt are trading in a range from 67¢ to 97¢ in the dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:03:37.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
