The broadcaster announced in July 2014 that Motsoeneng would be permanently appointed to the post of chief operations officer (COO). This was despite a recommendation by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that he be suspended pending a disciplinary inquiry. Madonsela found that he lied about having a matric certificate, and that his appointment as acting COO, and his salary hike from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year, were irregular. Last year, the Democratic Alliance approached the Western Cape High Court for an order in two parts. The first was to have Motsoeneng suspended and a disciplinary inquiry held. The second was to have his appointment as COO set aside. The court granted the first part of the order. It would deal with the second part on Tuesday. Motsoeneng, the SABC, and Communications Minister Faith Muthambi approached the Supreme Court of Appeal to dispute the high court's first order. Last week, the SCA dismissed their appeal. The SABC however did not suspend Motsoeneng. Spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said they would first study the SCA's ruling.
