PUBLISHED: 11:20, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:56, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 GETTY Britain is set for the coldest winter in 50 years, but energy bills are still overpriced \nAs the worst El Nino in history recorded brings warnings of the coldest winter in 50 years , the biggest energy giants are using a fall in wholesale costs to boost their bottom line, rather than bringing down prices for customers. It's estimated last winter saw the highest rate of cold deaths in five years with people having to chose between heating and eating. \nCampaigners fear this year could be worse due to the severe arctic temperatures. A spokesperson for Energy Bill Revolution said: \"Many of these deaths can be prevented, it's about keeping old people warm.\"With wholesale energy costs are now at a five-year low, Britain's households are long overdue a bill cut that could help save lives, campaigners say. Gas and electricity prices for providers have plummeted by as much as 40 per cent since January 2014. But over the same time period, household energy bills, however, have fallen by a measly 10 per cent.
