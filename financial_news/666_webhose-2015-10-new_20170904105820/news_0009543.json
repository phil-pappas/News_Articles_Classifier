But don’t give up the Whole Foods dream just yet — there are ways to save at the popular market. \nWe enlisted savings expert Teri Gault, author of “Shop Smart, Save More” and CEO of TheGroceryGame.com , to share her tips on how to save at Whole Foods and find the best Whole Foods deals. 1. Shop in Season Throughout the Store \nAny shopper knows that buying produce — like blueberries, strawberries or squash — out of season is going to cost you. But Gault said that center-of-the-store items go on sale according to the seasons, too. \n“For instance, you’ll find more soups and canned food sales heading into winter, and more sales on BBQ sauces, condiments and salad dressings through summer,” she said. And since many of these items have a long shelf life, she recommended stocking up. \nRelated: 5 Easy Ways to Save Money on Your Next Grocery Run \nAlso, remember that even some foods that seem perishable can last longer than you might think. “Sour cream is good for up to two months, cream cheese up to six months and so on,” said Gault. “Check the tiny date on the package, and if it’s on sale, stock up accordingly,” said Gault. 2. Opt for Frozen Foods \nFrozen fruits and vegetables are often seen as second-class to fresh. But the truth is, many studies have shown that frozen fruits and veggies are actually higher in vitamins and antioxidants. And, said Gault, at Whole Foods, they are often lower in price. If you use frozen foods for the correct purpose, you could save money without sacrificing taste. \n“Frozen fruit is fine in smoothies or when cooked into a sauce or pie,” said Gault. “Frozen vegetables are best when cooked into soups, quiches, omelets or other dishes. Frozen meat or fish may cost less or even be on sale when the fresh version is not.” Pretty cool. 3. Use Organic Coupons \nYou might think that just because foods are from smaller or all-organic brands, they don’t offer coupons. Not true, said Gault. “Coupons are no longer just for junk food,” she said. “Food marketing folks know that the trend has gone more toward healthier food choices, so that’s why we’re seeing more healthy and organic food manufacturer coupons every year.” \nBut often you’ll have to go directly to the manufacturer’s websites or social media sites to find Whole Foods coupons, said Gault. “These coupons are key to viable savings, but they come and go as there are overall print limits as well as individual consumer print limits,” she explained. “You may find that some make you jump through too many hoops to print a $1 coupon, so just don’t go back there.” But, others might pay off with several dollars off — check your favorite brands often. \nRelated: 10 Sites for the Best Online Coupons 4. Visit Whole Foods Online \nIn addition to learning about chain-wide programs and sales from the Whole Foods Market website, there’s a user-friendly tool that allows you to find Whole Foods deals, sales and printable coupons redeemable at your local store. Just click on the “On Sale” tab one the website’s homepage, then use the menu to choose your store. The savings can be significant. 5. Grab the Scooper \nIf you enjoy anything from nuts and trail mix to quinoa, grains or even coffee, Whole Foods’ bulk bins are a great chance to save money. For instance, in her post for the 100 Days of Real Food blog, Kiran Dodeja Smith found that the savings on bulk bin items routinely topped 20 percent compared with the packaged equivalents. \nAlso, Smith pointed out, buying in bulk can result in less waste since you can get only the amount you will use. 6. Go Non-Organic \nLet’s face it, we’d all buy everything organic right down to our car tires if we could. But we can’t, and choosing a few items where non-organic is perfectly safe could save you some cash, said Gault. \nAccording to the Environmental Working Group, there are 12 fruits and vegetables — known as the “Dirty Dozen” — you should always buy organic because their non-organic versions tested positive for 47 to 67 different chemicals. There’s also a “Clean 15,” which are safe to consume in the non-organic version.
