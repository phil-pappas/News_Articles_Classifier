October 21, 2015 16:30 ET Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Profit \nBalance Sheet Growth With Quality Loan Production Fuels Increase in Net Interest Margin and Earnings \nBALA CYNWYD, PA--(Marketwired - Oct 21, 2015) - Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. (\"Company\") ( NASDAQ : RBPAA ), parent company of Royal Bank America (\"Royal Bank\"), is pleased to report net income attributable to the Company of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and $4.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. This is compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and $4.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for 2015 were fully impacted by the issuance of approximately 16.7 million common shares during the third quarter of 2014 as a result of the private placement and shareholders' rights offering, which increased average common shares outstanding. \nKevin Tylus, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, noted, \"Loan and deposit growth, coupled with the continuing trend in improved credit quality, positively contributed to third quarter and 2015 year to date earnings. Our financial performance is allowing us to expand the Royal Bank brand through our relationship based and private banking models. Net loan growth in commercial, consumer, and leasing segments and more economical delivery channels, including a loan production office, is helping drive customer growth. Our newly implemented public funds strategy is serving as a cost effective component of our multi-faceted deposit plan; helping us to meet the challenges community banks face to attract lower cost deposits.\" \nHighlights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included: \nBalance Sheet Growth: At September 30, 2015, total assets were $761.7 million and grew $34.5 million, or 4.7%, from $727.2 million at June 30, 2015. Total assets were $732.6 million at December 31, 2014. Total loans were $471.2 million at September 30, 2015, an increase of $23.6 million, or 5.3%, from $447.6 million at June 30, 2015, and an increase of $56.1 million, or 13.5%, from $415.1 million at December 31, 2014. Current quarter increases were recognized in multiple loan portfolio segments. Total deposits were $553.8 million at September 30, 2015, an increase of $22.3 million, or 4.2%, from $531.5 million at June 30, 2015, and an increase of $23.4 million, or 4.4%, from $530.4 million at December 31, 2014. \nAsset Quality Trends: The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.08%, 1.20%, and 2.36% at September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Excluding tax liens, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.84%, 0.99%, and 1.99% at September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Non-performing loans of $5.1 million at September 30, 2015 decreased $286,000, or 5.3%, from $5.4 million at June 30, 2015 and decreased $4.7 million, or 48.0%, from $9.8 million at December 31, 2014. The decline in non-performing loans and the overall improvement in loan quality contributed to increases of $165,000 and $617,000 in the credit for loan and lease losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 1.83%, 2.19%, and 2.67% at September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Excluding tax lien assets, the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.57%, 0.67%, and 1.19% at September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Non-performing assets of $13.9 million at September 30, 2015 decreased $2.0 million, or 12.4%, from $15.9 million at June 30, 2015 and decreased $5.7 million, or 28.8%, from December 31, 2014. The purposeful downsizing of the tax lien business, which is not core to Royal Bank's overall strategy, has seen a favorable reduction from a high of over $100 million in total tax lien assets in 2009 to approximately $16.0 million in total tax lien assets at September 30, 2015. \nIncome Statement and Other Highlights: The return on average assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased to 0.82% and 0.84%, respectively, compared to 0.78% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. The return on average equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 9.24% and 9.45%, respectively, compared to 9.67% and 10.60% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. The return on average equity for 2015 was impacted by the increase in average common equity as a result of the private placement and shareholders' rights offering which closed in the third quarter of 2014. At September 30, 2015, the Company's Tier 1 leverage and Total Risk Based Capital ratios were 12.5% and 19.0%, respectively, compared to 11.9% and 19.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4% at September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased $594,000, or 10.7%, from $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased $670,000, or 4.0%, from $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The growth in the quarterly and year to date net interest income was primarily related to an increase in interest income and the average yields earned on average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin grew to 3.51% for the third quarter of 2015 compared to 3.25% for the comparable period in 2014 and was 3.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 3.25% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net interest margin was directly related to an increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets. Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $700,000 and decreased $504,000, or 41.9%, from $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. The quarterly decline in non-interest income was impacted by declines of $158,000 and $107,000 in net gains on the sale of investment securities and net gains on the sale of premises and equipment, respectively. Additionally, net gains on sales of loans and leases and net gains on sale of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") decreased $80,000 and $50,000, respectively. Non-interest income was $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and slightly increased $38,000 in the 2015 period. Net gains on the sale of investment securities and the sale of OREO grew $322,000 and $136,000, respectively, in 2015 as compared to the 2014 period. These increases were partially offset by declines of $223,000 and $107,000 in the net gains on sales of loans and leases and net gains on the sale of premises and equipment, respectively, when compared to the 2014 period. During 2015, the Company sold lower earning investment securities to fund the loan growth, which included selling the majority of the corporate bonds in the investment portfolio. Non-interest expense was $5.4 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. For the third quarter of 2015, professional and legal fees and the provision for unfunded loan commitments declined $190,000 and $82,000, respectively, and were offset by a $232,000 increase in OREO expenses and impairment. During the third quarter of 2015, the unfunded loan commitments related to construction loans declined $5.5 million due to construction advances on those commitments. Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $16.5 million and increased $749,000, or 4.8%, from $15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 was related to increases of $320,000, $347,000, and $277,000 in employee salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, and the provision for unfunded loan commitments due to the growth in such commitments. Partially offsetting these increases was a $237,000 decline in the FDIC and state assessments. \nAbout Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. \nRoyal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc., headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, is the parent company of Royal Bank America, which is headquartered in Narberth, Pennsylvania.
