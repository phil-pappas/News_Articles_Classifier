Temando has been a major part of the Magento ecosystem for over five years as a Magento Silver Technology Partner, helping to solve the complex fulfillment and shipping challenges retailers face every day.\nMore than just shipping software, the company exists to connect the world’s logistical resources into a single intelligent platform and make commerce universally accessible to everyone. Temando empowers merchants to convert shipping and fulfillment, a notoriously complex cost center, into a retail weapon to be used in the battle for more sales and more cost-efficient processes. Temando connects with any online store powered by Magento to provide merchants with an easy way to access rates and services from multiple couriers at once while helping increase conversions and lower costs.\nRussell Schulman, Digital Business Manager for Krispy Kreme Australia said “Temando’s Shipping Extension for Magento has helped increase our online conversions by a record 38.5 percent, including a 276 percent increase in shipping transactions.\"\nAs a result of Temando’s success in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), Temando recently raised a $50 million Series B investment from Neopost Shipping to expand its existing operations in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. Temando has grown a tremendous 711 percent in year-over-year revenue in 2014.\n“As connected consumers drive global eCommerce, shipping and fulfilment becomes increasingly inefficient and costly for retailers to master. Retailers need to optimize shipping processes with inventory, warehouse and store locations, courier selection and courier costs while creating better experiences for their customers.” remarked Carl Hartmann, CEO and co-founder of Temando. “Our partnership with Magento has given us the opportunity to solve all of these complex problems. Our multi-courier platform helps drive conversions and provides retailers with the tools (dashboard) they need to deliver better eCommerce and shipping experiences for today’s discerning consumer.”\nMagento boasts the largest open commerce ecosystem of more than 5,000 Magento-certified professionals and over 300 proven solution partners worldwide. Powering more than 240,000 sites globally, its high-performance, open and scalable platform was recognized as the leading eCommerce platform on the 2015 Internet Retailer Top 1000 and Hot 100 lists.\n“A closer partnership with Temando enables online retailers to grow their businesses easier and faster by automating the shipping experience. Focused on delivering excellent solutions to our clients, we are excited to name Temando a Magento Gold Technology Partner,” said Marty Armstrong, head of business development and technology partnerships at Magento. “Delivering the Temando Intelligent Shipping Platform is yet another step in providing our clients with the best solutions in commerce today.”\nBob Schwartz, former president of Magento and strategic advisor and board member of Temando said, “The Temando technology gives merchants tools, dashboards and power to optimize and fine tune across the entire fulfillment and delivery customer experience starting with check out, to delivery and through returns.” Schwartz continued, “Temando is a breath of fresh air for merchants of all sizes who know that intelligent inventory location, fulfilment and delivery choices are truly powerful factors in your business success.”\nSchwartz is CEO of 47 B Street and a serial company-builder of technology and consumer Internet companies, producing over $1 billion of value for shareholders and founders via acquisitions by Amazon, eBay, Nordstrom, Packard Bell, First American, Cendant, Aetna and others.\nAbout Temando\nTemando (“I send you” in Spanish) is a global technology company that exists to connect the world’s logistical resources into a single intelligent software platform and to make commerce universally accessible to everybody.
