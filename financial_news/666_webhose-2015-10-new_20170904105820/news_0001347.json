The rupiah surged 2.4 percent and the ringgit rallied 2.2 percent against the dollar. South Korea's won was 1.2 percent higher, while the Taiwan dollar and Thai baht each gained 0.5 percent. \n- 'No reason to raise rates' - \n\"What you?re seeing in the movement right now is an unwind of the bullish-dollar story,\" Douglas Borthwick, head of foreign-exchange at New York brokerage Chapdelaine & Co, told Bloomberg News. \n\"The Fed has no reason to raise rates when you?re getting the data that we?ve been getting lately.\" \nEmerging market currencies have suffered heavy selling over the past year as the Fed was expected to lift rates, with dealers shifting into the United States looking for higher and safer returns. \n\"The US dollar index was drifting lower for much of the day yesterday, but the move was compounded by the release of disappointing US retail sales data,\" Kymberly Martin, a senior market strategist at the Bank of New Zealand, said. \n\"In the detail the disappointment appeared genuine, likely emboldening doves within the US Fed.\" \nThe greenback was also under pressure against its major peers. In New York Wednesday it fell to 118.88 yen while the euro hit $1.1469, compared with 119.68 yen and $1.1385 in Asia earlier in the day. \nOn Wednesday it was at 119.00 yen and the euro bought $1.1472. \nHopes for a continued low Fed rate provided support to regional stock markets, with Hong Kong -- where monetary policy is tied to US policy -- climbed one percent. \nBargain buying also helped equities rally following broad losses on Tuesday and Wednesday after weak Chinese trade and inflation data reignited worries about the world's number two economy. \nSeoul was 1.22 percent higher, Tokyo added 0.77 percent by lunch and Sydney gained 0.33 percent. \nShanghai rose 0.67 percent, with dealers buoyed by hopes Beijing will unveil more economic stimulus measures (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:35:35.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
