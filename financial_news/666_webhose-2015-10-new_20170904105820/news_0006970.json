But no more. Rental payments, especially, are now joining with credit card, auto, and mortgage payments as key indicators in credit agency scoring formulas. The shift toward on-time rental payments and improved credit scores, a trend that has really accelerated in the past year, is making a big difference. Experian notes in a recent study that before it included rental payments in its scoring formulas, 11% of select U.S. renters it tracked weren't even included in credit scoring, as they had no credit file. \"But as a result of adding the positive rental tradelines, these same individuals now are scoreable and eight out of ten of these former no-hit individuals now had more than 12 months of rental payment history data in the Experian RentBureau database,\" Experian states. \"These residents now would receive credit for not just one positive payment, but for months of responsible, on-time payments, and now would be able to leverage the existence of a credit file and build a credit history.\" Another recent study, this one from Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Rent Track, shows that consumers with two months of rental payments included their credit scores saw their scores rise by 9%. Better yet, subprime consumers with the same payment experience saw their scores rise by 29 points. \"This is a paradigm shift that every renter should take advantage of, especially students and those who are just starting out,\" says Matt Briggs, chief executive officer at RentTrack. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:19:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
