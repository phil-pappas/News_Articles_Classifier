But Bisignano focused instead on touting the company's \"transformation\" since it went private in 2007 and on cutting some of its $21 billion debt before interest rates rise. The disconnect didn't bode well for the initial public offering. \n\nBisignano and his team made a better impression in private meetings, and actually do have a coherent, pretty solid plan for the First Data's future, Renaissance Capital analyst Will Preston said. \n\nBut in a notably skittish market , the short-term bet was that investors would press for the low to middle end of an $18 to $20 a share range when the IPO was priced. First Data decided to price below range, selling 160 million shares and raising $2.56 billion, Bloomberg  reported . Shares of the company, which now has a market value of $14 billion, will begin trading Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ( FDC ) .  \nThe outlook for the stock is not strong. \n\nThe problem is simple: First Data's calling card is that it's the leading payment services provider to the e-commerce industry, involved in 28% of global e-commerce sales volume, but it's growing much more slowly than the e-commerce industry as a whole. The Census Bureau says e-commerce sales in the second quarter were 14% higher than a year ago, but First Data's first-half sales rose less than one-seventh as fast.\n\nPreston points out that the rise of the dollar had something to do with that -- First Data's revenue would have grown 5% to 6% if the dollar had been near last year's levels, he said. He gives a good review to the company's newer products, especially an app platform that lets outside developers run services such as employee scheduling for small and medium-sized businesses using First Data's technology, creating a new revenue stream. The company's unit that provides outsourced services to private-label credit card issuers is also growing faster than the rest of First Data.\nMust Read: Here's Why Omid Kordestani Will Be a Great Addition to Twitter's Board \n\"Think of it as 5% growth in the core, with some investments that people don't know how they will turn out yet,'' Preston said.\nThe bad news is, the company will still have an $18.4 billion debt load after using $2.5 billion of IPO proceeds to pay off debt, according to its regulatory filings. Most of the debt being repaid carried a 12% interest rate. The time it will take for other moves to reduce and restructure debt, and for the newer products to become big enough to help much, are the primary reasons to be cautious about First Data's IPO.\n\n1 of 2 Check Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:24:12.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
