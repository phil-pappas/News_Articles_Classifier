David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The federal government's wholesale acceptance of David Murray's recommendations for reform of superannuation, banking and financial advice open the way for the creation of a more competitive and efficient financial system.\nAustralia's retirement incomes system was already the envy of the developed world because it long ago shifted the responsibility and liability for investment returns from super fund scheme sponsors to individual members.\nWe still have our fair share of defined benefit super funds, but the vast majority of Australians are not living in the unrealistic expectation that they can fall back on a guaranteed income stream for the rest of their lives equal to three-quarters of their last pay packet as happens in Europe and the United States.\nThe schemes in Europe and the US are unsustainable. It is unlikely governments or corporations will be able to underwrite these benefits in perpetuity.\nWhile Australia managed to bite the bullet early on the need for accumulation schemes there was always a missing piece in relation to the purpose of super.\nMurray's recommendation that the objectives of super be enshrined in law means that any crazy proposals for directing the investment of the $2 trillion in super assets can be measured against the agreed community aims.\nThe definition might well be as simple as reducing the cost to taxpayers of the ageing population. That could allow the cost of health care and pensions to be included in policy considerations.\nAnother definition of the objective might be to have sufficient super assets to achieve a higher standard of living in retirement than living on the pension.\n Arriving at an appropriate definition of the objective for superannuation will be an important part of restoring confidence in the system.\nSignificant recommendation will happen One of the most significant Murray recommendations was for the passing of laws to allow the sale of comprehensive income products for retirement.\nThat will now happen. It will be an important adjunct to defining the long-term purpose of super.\nDealing with this bigger picture objective should provide the opportunity to end the bitter fighting between not-for-profit funds and bank-owned super funds over the best model for corporate governance and the need for competition in awarding default super mandates.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison have wisely decided to move quickly to reform the default super allocation which is the preserve of the Fair Work Commission.\nThe current system, which covers about $10 billion in super assets, allows unions and employers to decide where super contributions are made .\nThat defeats the principle of freedom of choice which was meant to be enshrined in the system.\nThe government's response said it would \"extend the choice of fund arrangements to more employees by removing the deemed choice for certain enterprise agreements and workplace determinations.\"\nIt will call on the Productivity Commission to develop alternative models for a formal competitive process for allocating default fund members to products.\nTurnbull and Morrison are also pushing ahead with plans to introduce compulsory appointment of at least three independent super trustee directors as well as toughening up the penalties for trustees who fail to act in the best interests of members or take actions to further their interests to the detriment of members.\nThe industry fund campaign against independent directors and preservation of default funds suffered a fatal blow on Tuesday when Helen Rowell, a member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority delivered a speech punctuating some of the myths floating around the industry.\n\"APRA's view is that, given the size, nature and increasing complexity of the industry, it is appropriate for the governance requirements for the superannuation industry to be more closely aligned with those that apply to banking and insurance,\" she said.\n\"After all, the industry is now an increasingly critical component of the Australian financial system.\"\nBanks and insurers have had to have a majority of independent directors and an independent chairman since 2006.\n\"Independent directors broaden the skills and capabilities that can be brought to the board table, and improve decision-making by bringing an objective perspective to issues the board considers,\" she said.\n\"They are also well placed to hold other directors accountable for their conduct, particularly in relation to conflicts of interest. As outlined in our submissions to the financial system inquiry, we consider the diversity of views and experience that independent directors bring supports more robust decision-making by boards.\"\n'Not comparing apples with apples' Rowell also took the opportunity to blow up the primary argument of performance differences which have used by industry funds for preserving the current, outdated governance structures.\nShe said the comparisons that have been used have not compared apples with apples.\nRowell appeared to make a plea for industry funds to bury the hatchet about focusing on different returns between industry super and retail funds.\nShe said the advent of MySuper products which have low fees and costs means that everyone can now focus on long-term performance.\nThis means it will no longer be relevant as to which segment provides the product.\nFinally, Rowell exploded the myth that independent directors on the boards of industry super funds would force some unwanted cultural change.\n\"The proposed changes do not impose a one-size-fits-all approach,\" she said.\n\"Rather, they provide a golden opportunity for trustees to reflect on and review the board's current governance arrangements and determine the governance framework and approach that is most appropriate for them into the future.\"\nThe government endorsement of crowd-sourced equity funding is an important breakthrough. If legislation is to be ready before the end of the year it will have to be circulated within the next eight weeks.\nAustralia gets IPOs thumbs up A who's who of Australian equity capital markets gathered in Sydney on Tuesday morning for the release of a study that implies Australian capital markets are more efficient than the United States in pricing initial public offerings.\nIt was a timely release given the financial system inquiry concluded Australia would benefit from greater competitiveness in the financial system including increased use of debt and equity capital markets to fund growth.\nThe Macquarie Graduate School of Management hosted the released of the study by Alex Frino, Jin Boon Wong and Jagjeev Dosanjh.\nFrino , who is professor of finance and dean of the MGSM, presented empirical analysis showing that the average underpricing of IPOs in Australia was about 12 to 15 per cent less than the sample of matched IPOs in the US.\nUnderpricing is used as a measure of capital market efficiency with a larger discount indicating less value for vendors.\nThe study controlled for a large number of variables known to influence pricing including deal size, issue price setting and owner sell-down.\nFrino says one possible reason for the better value in IPOs in Australia is the mass of institutional investors targeting companies in the S&P ASX 200.\nA panel discussion revealed a wide range of views about why there are differences between Australian and US IPO markets.\nRoger Feletto, co-head of Greenhill Australia, said it was a mistake to judge the efficiency of the IPO market from the day one pricing.\nHe says in the US IPOs are used to raise growth capital and that means the after-market trading is important.\nFeletto said there were factors that were not easily quantified by the research including the risk profile of the company. He said the decision to list was often driven by a range of issues including where management works and investor understanding of the company.\nAmelia Hill, a managing director at Moelis & Company, said one possible explanation for the larger underpricing of IPOs in the US was that financial forecasts were not allowed whereas in Australia financial forecasts can be included in the prospectus.\nShe said that it was a tradition in the US market that those who were willing to take on the risks of investing in a company without financial forecasts enjoyed the share price spike in the first day.\nHowever, Philippa Stone, partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, said the curious thing was that the IPO price pop in the US occurred even though there was no additional information theoretically to the market than the information which was available in the bookbuild process before listing.\nShe highlighted the fact that the study found that after 120 days the prices of the stocks in the sample were about the same. In other words, US investors appeared to anticipate the longer-term valuation without having the financial information at the time of listing.\nRichard Kimber, chief executive of OzForex, said the information flow in Australia was very good, but it was important to maintain close relations with fund managers and investment analysts.\nFrino took the opportunity to respond to recent comments by Mike Cannon-Brookes from software firm Atlassian saying Wall Street was much preferred to the ASX for listing.\n\"We in this room think Atlassian is a big company with a value of $3.5 billion but in the US it would not even make the cut off for the S&P 500,\" he says.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/10oct/fin_recommends_hype/index.html", "https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-10-20T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:05:16.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
