Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The Sydney residential market will be a buyers' market by the middle of 2016, Aussie Home Loans chairman John Symonds has declared.\nNot all suburbs will experience the same pace of \"cooling\" with CBD areas like Potts Point and Surry Hills persisting with more buyers than sellers.\n\"It is suburb by suburb. But the prices are levelling out. There will certainly be no collapse in prices because the appetite for real estate is so great in this country,\" he said at the Citigroup's investment conference in Sydney.\n\"Next year, some areas will increase 7 to 9 per cent, some about 2 to 3 per cent. And then there will be others which will have a 4 to 5 per cent drop.\"\n\"The good news is steam is coming off and sanity is returning.\"\nSydney's final auction clearance rate last week came in at 63.7 per cent representing a substantial fall from the previous week of 69.6 per cent, Corelogic RP Data said .\nThis is the lowest for Sydney since early 2013.\nWestpac won't be alone in raising rates\n The market will continue to soften when other banks eventually follow Westpac footsteps and raise home loan rates, Mr Symonds added.\n\"They are all lining up...they won't let Westpac hang out to dry.\"\nOn Thursday, the Commonwealth Bank announced a 15 basis point rise in its rates .\nWhile borrowing becomes more challenging for investors - the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is also tightening investor lending - there will be room for owner occupier demand.\n\"There's slowing in investor loan growth because of the higher capital charge. Banks have already increased investor loans by 25 to 30 basis points but they've also reduced owner occupier loans by 25 to 30 basis points.\"\n\"The sweet spot for banks is owner occupier loans on a fixed term over three years, it has the lowest capital charge. That's where everyone wants to increase their loan book.\"\nThis ties in with Stockland's push for owner occupier sales.\n\"We want to keep the balance in our communities which is 75 per cent owner-occupiers,\" Stockland chief executive Mark Steinert said.\n\"40 to 50 per cent of Stockland's first home buyers and as long as they have a job demand to buy is still good.\"\nMr Steinert also brushed aside settlement risks for off-the-plan sales.\n\"We have very few defaults. We try to only sell about six to nine months out of settling land, and in that window, people's decision to change their mind is very [minimal].\"\n\"And to mitigate settlement risks for foreign buyers - impose a higher 20 per cent deposit.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:06:03.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
