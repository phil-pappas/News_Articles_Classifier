But there is one place where ads are declining: smack in the middle of prime time TV shows.\nThe number of product placements appearing during the first week of the new broadcast season declined 45% to 104, compared to last year’s premiere week, according to Nielsen.\nThe number of in-program placements has declined for several seasons. There were 4,455 product placements made during last year’s broadcast TV season, a 3% drop from the year-earlier season and down 20% from the 2012-2013 season.\nWhy the drop? Some blame the emergence of new advertising platforms.\n“There are so many more options available for advertising now and every year its grows,” said Chad Dreas, Nielsen’s managing director of media analytics, pointing to the growth of digital advertising and social media advertising.\nCost is also keeping advertisers at bay. Integrations are a “big commitment,” said Andy Donchin, chief investment officer at Amplify US, an ad-buying unit of Dentsu. “There is an out of pocket premium” that advertisers have to pay that sometimes can be hard to justify, he added.\nStill, some of the world’s biggest brands routinely use the ad tactic. Apple, Starbucks, Chevrolet, Ford and Google were the largest users of product placement last year on broadcast TV. Combined, those brands were responsible for 30% of all in-program placements during the last broadcast season, Nielsen said.\nProduct placement has been a part of the TV business since the early days of the medium. About a decade ago, the practice exploded as marketers saw it as a way to sidestep the damaging effects of TV commercial-skipping devices. At the same time, TV networks jumped on the opportunity and now they aggressively package product plugs into many of their ad deals.\nThat took the product placement business, which had been dominated by small firms that had relationships with set designers and Hollywood show runners, to a whole new level. Product plugs became more pronounced and elaborate. Advertisers were no longer satisfied with having a character on a show reach for a branded soda can – many sought bigger brand integrations that included getting the product or its attributes mentioned on the show. Indeed, there were roughly 8,500 in-program placements during the 2009-2010 broadcast season, Nielsen said.\nDespite the recent decline in plugs, there is evidence to suggest that many advertisers still believe product placements works. During Stephen Colbert’s debut as the host of CBS’s “Late Show” last month, Mr. Colbert spent several minutes poking fun at the fact that he was obligated to promote Sabra roasted red pepper humus on the air.\nNext week viewers will see messages from health insurer Cigna Corp. CI 0.90 % baked into some programs airing on Walt Disney’s ABC. In an effort to promote how important getting a check-up from your doctor is, the insurance company worked with ABC to have some cast members of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live” swap jobs, on air, so they can go to the doctor for a checkup.\nCigna said having its pitch embedded or mentioned in a program helps a TV viewer to better remember the message. The product integration “amplifies the commercial message,” said Stephen Cassell, global branding officer at Cigna.\nA recent Nielsen study found that when a product plug aired in the same program as standard commercials for the same brand, the ability for a consumer—ages 18 to 49—to remember the brand increased 18%. Product integrations “add value and increase the effectiveness” of ads, added Mr. Dreas at Nielsen.\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS481_CMOCol_E_20151012142922.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:51:52.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
