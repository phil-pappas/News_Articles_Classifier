Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a fall to 57.5.\nThe ISM data follows Friday's disappointing U.S. employment report, which showed employers hired 142,000 people in September, far fewer than the 203,000 expected.\nAnalysts expect the data may lead to a change of view among some Fed policymakers who have said the U.S. central bank would end its near-zero rate policy if the economy improves further.\nInterest rate futures implied traders scaled back their bets on a rate increase by year-end. They now see such a move in March 2016 at the earliest.\nExpectations the Fed might refrain from raising rates this year will likely boost demand for this week's coupon debt supply.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department will sell $24 billion in three-year notes, $21 billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year bonds this week.\nOn the open market, benchmark 10-year Treasuries were down 10/32 in price to yield 2.024 percent, up more than 3 basis points from late Friday. The 10-year yield touched 1.904 percent on Friday, which was its lowest since late April, according to Reuters data.\nThe 30-year bond was down 25/32 in price to yield 2.868 percent, up 4 basis points from Friday.\nOn Wall Street, the three major U.S. indexes were up about 1 percent in early trading.
