Bloomberg Share on twitter by Peter Ker Swiss miner Glencore's wild ride has continued, with the company's Hong Kong listed shares soaring by more than 70 per cent on Monday.\nThe extraordinary surge comes after the company's London listed shares fell by almost 30 per cent on September 28, and after a weekend punctuated by rumours about which Glencore assets were soon to be sold.\nThe highly-geared company revealed in August that it would seek to raise $US2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in equity and also sell assets in a bid to lighten its debt load, and London newspapers speculated that a stake in Glencore's agriculture assets was most likely to be sold.\nThe analysts at London advisory firm Bernstein said that sale of the agriculture assets were well advanced.\nGlencore boss Ivan Glasenberg, who infamously noted in August that he was unable to \"read\" the trajectory of the Chinese economy, also indicated he would be open to takeover offers but few in the market expect one to emerge given the company's huge debt load.\nThe Hong Kong exchange is Glencore's secondary listing, behind its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe extraordinary surge was accompanied by huge trading volumes, which looked set to be the company's biggest ever day of trading in Hong Kong.\nThe stock spiked at 72 per cent above Friday's close midway through the session but fell to be 33 per cent higher than Friday's close around the time of writing.\n Glencore told market regulators that it was unaware of the forces behind the share spike.\nGlencore's London shares also followed the trend and were 13 per cent higher in early trading\nThe surge followed a strong day for mining and energy stocks in Australia, where BHP Billiton shares rose by almost 4 per cent and Santos shares rose by almost 6 per cent.\nGold miners enjoyed some of the biggest rises, with Newcrest Mining shares rising by more than 9 per cent.\nMr Glasenberg and his top advisers met with scores of analysts and investors in the wake of last week's mammoth share price plunge in a bid to quell fears and provide more insight into the structure of its commodities trading arm.\nMost analysts subsequently expressed confidence in Glencore's cashflows and debt management strategy, with Barclays analyst Ian Rossouw saying the equity raising, asset sales and cash preservation strategies were a credible way to tackle its debt load.\nGlencore's Australian-based coal boss Peter Freyberg is scheduled to speak about the future of coal at a luncheon in Newcastle on Wednesday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/pgker"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:03:12.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
