Laurie, the mother of the bride and an old friend from college, has arranged the most opulent festivities imaginable, many held in a building called the Cloister.\nIt is all about enjoying the here and now—the sea, the clothes, the food, the wild, exuberant dancing.\nI am here but not here. I stand on the edge of the dance floor, but I don’t dance.\nInstead, I watch Laurie and think about her as she was years back, when we were both at Barnard, and about the other Cloister we liked retreating to—the museum in upper Manhattan. It is a special night and even more meaningful, because of the memories it conjures up of our complicated, enduring friendship.\nIn June, an essay in this section made a startling argument: Why not shed relationships that are no longer relevant—the ones in which old friends stay together simply because of shared memories and experiences from the past.\nThe author invoked the thinking and lingo of the corporate world to make her case, citing the advice retirees get to weed through their closets and discard unneeded items, and invoking the cold calculus of “cost-benefit analysis.”\nIn short, it was a business model for relationships.\nI found myself shivering at the thought of applying the methods of corporate America to our social lives. Would we bring in efficiency experts to figure out which friends have outlived their purpose? Should we attempt to calculate Ebitda of the heart and soul?\nGod forbid, I say.\nTo begin with, businesses are messy, too. They aren’t nearly as efficient as they would like us to believe. More to the point, we live in a castoff society, and in recent years there has been an awful lot of casting aside in the business world. No one knows this more than older Americans, who have experienced their share of rejection and bias.\nIn the face of this, we rely on friends for shelter. No performance evaluations there: Friends can accept us as we are, and keep us grounded and hopeful. That is especially true of those friends with whom we share a meaningful past.\nWhen we are blue, they remind us of happier days. When we are faltering, they can point out all the tough periods we weathered. On joyful occasions, they remember even sweeter times when our parents were there to enjoy them with us.\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images Marcel Proust, that splendid lover of relationships past, devoted multiple tomes to the importance of the past. To Proust, nothing was more sacred than memory, and no one was more precious than loved ones of times gone by—the mom he adored, an elegant family friend named Swann, some lovely young girls of his youth, and an aunt who liked to dip a little sponge cake known as a madeleine into her tea.\nWhen Proust tastes it years later, it is as if he can savor his entire childhood again.\n*** I am a journalist, with a natural instinct to cover people and events around me. I am also a memoirist, and I care deeply about those people and events no longer around me.\nI had a childhood that was by any measure traumatic. When I was 6 years old, I fled with my family from Egypt, our home and country, and together we became part of a massive group of Jewish refugees forced to leave the Middle East.\nLogically, that should be behind me now. Yet I keep returning to those years. I am on a quest to find people who can help me rebuild my lost world, and I feel happiest when I find friends who have a similar history to mine.\nOver the past couple of summers, I have gone to Cannes, on the French Riviera, not only because I love it but because it has become the gathering place for a group of Egyptian exiles.\nThese friends rebuilt their lives wherever they landed—New York, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Monte Carlo. Their names are redolent of our lost world. Elie Moreno was a defense contractor; Yves Fedida, Maurice Dwek and Alberto Levy became entrepreneurs; Loula Levy covered the Cannes Film Festival; Diane Medina was a model and beauty queen. They clearly put the past behind.\nBut those nights when I join them steps from the Mediterranean, the only reality that matters is that long ago we were part of a small magical Jewish community in the heart of the Arab world. That is when I realize we all look back on that time with extraordinary yearning, and wish we were there again.\n*** For someone in love with the past, I am actually terrible at keeping up with old friendships. But I have a few, and they are messy and irregular.\nThere is Laurie Bryk, who was a freshman at Barnard when I arrived as a one-year exchange student from Vassar. We bonded though we were of vastly different temperaments—she was relentlessly cheerful and positive, while I was angst-ridden and moody. That year, we seemed to chat from morning to night. Once, on a bus trip to our favorite destination, the Cloisters, we were so involved in conversation we missed the stop. She had a magical effect on me, and by year’s end I had adopted more of her joyous outlook.\nWe took divergent paths—I focused on career, she raised a large family—and we lost touch. She found me one night when I was lecturing downtown about my new book, a memoir. We have remained friends since, and I find she still has a tonic effect on me.\nThere also is Marlene Ben-Dayan, big sister to my closest childhood friend in Brooklyn. I have come to feel increasingly close to Marlene, retreating to her kitchen whenever I need to be reminded of those years when I felt a stranger in America and she and others welcomed me. She will often give me a cooking lesson, teaching me how to prepare dishes my mom used to make.\nMarlene is by no means tethered to the past, yet she has a reverence for it and perfect recall for places and people. I love when she invokes my mother, recalling how sweet and tender she was. “Refined,” Marlene will say earnestly. “Your mother was very refined.”\nAs Marlene speaks I can suddenly see and hear my mother again. It is as if she is standing in front of me. I guess that is the real power of friends from the past. They have special gifts. They can even bring our loved ones back.\nI, too, have moved on—but I also haven’t—and I always feel kind of sad when I leave that kitchen to return to Manhattan.\nMs. Lagnado is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York and the author of two memoirs, “The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit” and “The Arrogant Years.” Email her at lucette.lagnado@wsj.com .", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/EN-AB404_FRIEND_P_20151014133749.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/EN-AB404_FRIEND_M_20151014133749.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:54:55.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
