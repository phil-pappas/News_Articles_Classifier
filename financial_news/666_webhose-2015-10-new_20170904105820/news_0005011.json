But Berlin wants to be prepared for cost cuts at Volkswagen. \nA government spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. \nWorks council head Bernd Osterloh had said earlier this month it was not yet clear whether the emissions scandal would affect jobs over the medium to longer term. \"At this point, there are no consequences for jobs, neither for core workers nor for temporary staff.\" \n($1 = 0.8814 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Paul Carrel and Arno Schuetze; Editing by David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:08:20.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
