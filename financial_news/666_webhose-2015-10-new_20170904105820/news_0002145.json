Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Christopher Joye The pressure is still on the big banks to boost their equity capital levels by a further $35 billion, notwithstanding excellent efforts to do so over the past 12 months. One silver lining is that the \"total loss-absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) the big banks might be required to hold by 2019 is likely to be substantially less than markets thought.\nBloomberg reported last week that the Financial Stability Board will announce that systematically important banks will have to carry TLAC of only 16 per cent of risk-weighted assets by 2019, which will climb to 18 per cent by 2022. This is substantially lower than the 20 per cent to 22 per cent TLAC range that had been assumed previously in markets and will reduce the volume of hybrid securities and bail-in bonds that need to be issued to satisfy TLAC standards.\nBloomberg says US banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are already compliant with the new 16 per cent TLAC target. The FSB's final TLAC rules are expected to be endorsed by the G20 summit in November.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch says Australia's four big banks have raised an impressive $27.3 billion of extra \"common equity tier one\" (CET1) since June 30, 2014, through a combination of share issues, asset sales, dividend reinvestment plans, and organic capital generation.\nThe challenge for the big banks highlighted in two recent speeches by Wayne Byres, the chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, is that they compare poorly to peers overseas based on their non-risk-weighted \"leverage ratios\". The leverage ratio is calculated as CET1 capital plus \"additional tier one\" (AT1) capital – known collectively as total \"tier one\" (T1) capital – divided by the dollar value of the bank's credit risk exposures. (The latter is to be distinguished from risk-weighted assets, which are only 38 per cent of total credit risk exposures.)\nBottom half of peer banks APRA calculates that in June 2014 the big banks had a 4.5 per cent T1 leverage ratio, which was in the bottom half of peer banks around the world – that is, below the 50th percentile.\n\"While we might give primacy to the [risk-weighted] CET1 ratio … we know that in the financial crisis, the 'leverage ratio', despite [or perhaps because of?] its simplicity, was something investors paid attention to,\" Byres said in a September 15 speech. \"We need to be mindful that the strengthening of Australian risk-based capital ratios has not generated an equivalent strengthening of leverage ratios.\"\n The following day Byres reiterated that the big banks' leverage ratio \"story is less positive\". \"The largest Australian banks compare less well on this measure to peers.\"\nAccounting for new CET1 and AT1 origination since June 2014, I estimate that the big banks' leverage ratios have improved to about 4.8 per cent, which is still $48 billion short of a hypothetical 75th percentile target of 6 per cent.\nThis is an achievable goal over the next four years if the banks allow their dividend payout ratios to drop to more realistic levels, although asset growth will boost the numerator in the leverage ratio equation and therefore deepen the capital short-fall.\nThe really good news for the banks is that with the reduction in the FSB's TLAC benchmark for systematically important institutions to 16 per cent, they are likely to be compliant simply through their equity capital raising initiatives. This assumes APRA is no tougher than the FSB, which is likely when it comes to TLAC. (The big banks are classified as systematically important only on a domestic basis, albeit that they rank among the 30 largest banks in the world by market cap.)\nShort-fall declines While APRA clearly wants leverage ratios to improve, assume, for example, that it concludes the big banks can remain below the June 2014 75th percentile at about 5.5 per cent, compared to about 4.8 per cent now. The equity capital short-fall declines from $48.3 billion to $28.7 billion.\nImportantly, $28.7 billion of additional CET1 and AT1 would mean that the big banks, like many US banks, would be immediately compliant with a 16 per cent TLAC hurdle based on asset exposures today. If we suppose they experience 5 per cent annual asset growth to 2019, the true CET1 and AT1 target is probably closer to $35 billion for a 5.5 per cent leverage ratio.\nThe ultimate result could be that the leverage ratio becomes the binding constraint on the banks, not TLAC or efforts to recalibrate business and residential mortgage risk weights under Basel 4.\nAnother inevitable consequence will be pressure on dividend payout ratios. After recent meetings with banking regulators, central banks and private banks in the US, Britain and Europe, JCP Investment Partners' head of financials research Matt Wilson, says \"there was a clear consensus that total bank payout ratios will have to settle around 50 per cent, compared to the 70 per cent to 80 per cent levels you see here in Australia\".\nCiti and Morgan Stanley have both cut their forecasts recently for the big banks' dividend payout ratios, with more likely to follow.\nChristopher Joye is a director and shareholder in Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income investment portfolios.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-05/u-s-banks-seen-as-winners-if-fed-follows-fsb-on-too-big-to-fail", "https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:07:03.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
