The tenge has lost more than a third of its value since the start of the year.\nMeanwhile currencies in central and eastern Europe traded flat to weaker against the euro with the Serbian dinar a touch stronger after easing on Wednesday when the central bank cut interest rates for the third time in as many months to revive inflation and support the economy.\nIn Ukraine, the government announced that a majority of creditors had voted in favour of its debt swap proposal, critical to its $40 billion IMF-led bailout plan, with the exception of Russia which did not participate in voting on Wednesday.\nRussia will get another chance at the end of the month to vote on the bill but Kiev could take Moscow to court if it refused to participate, said Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/jus35t\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/weh36s\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging Europe performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/jun28s\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI frontier index performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/zyh97s\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see ) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker ; Editing by Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:14:56.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
