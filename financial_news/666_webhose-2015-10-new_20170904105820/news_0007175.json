That takes its total occupancy to 40,000 square metres within the estate. The total value of the facility expansion is about $65 million.\nWalk for charity The property sector has been busy raising cash for charity. More than 1000 CBRE staff worked up a sweat on Friday as they took part in a 10-kilometre walk from Martin Place, through Double Bay and Rushcutters Bay and finishing at the North Bondi Surf Club. It's part of the firm's flagship charity event, Walk For A Wish, which has raised more than $1 million since its inception in 2009. Nine property professionals from JLL's Young Guns group also collectively raised more than $2000 for the Roughtober Sleepout on Friday night. The Roughtober Sleepout raises funds for the homeless support work provided by Rough Edges Cafe in Darlinghurst, Sydney.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:28:25.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
