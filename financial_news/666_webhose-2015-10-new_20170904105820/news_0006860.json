Profit warnings from construction sector panics investors By Tara Cunningham | Telegraph – 12 hours ago 987.00 +37.00 \nMarket Report: Profit warnings from SIG (LSE: SHI.L - news ) and Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) sent investors to the sidelines. \nInvestors panicked on Thursday as two building products businesses issued profit warnings. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in insulation specialist SIG slumped to the bottom of the mid-cap index after it issued an unscheduled trading update. The FTSE 250 slashed its full-year profit guidance by 18pc as market conditions deteriorated in the second half of year. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) now expects profits to come in between £85 and £90m. \nThe stock suffered its sharpest one-day fall in six years due to a weakness in sales in the last two months, particularly in France. In August, the company said it expected to make year-on-year progress assuming the improvement in sales continued in mainland Europe. However, three months on, this trend has not materialised, as trading conditions have become “difficult”. \nThird-quarter sales declined by 0.9pc compared with the previous year, dragged lower by a 2.3pc fall in sales in mainland Europe, while sales in the UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) rose marginally, by 0.4pc. Robert Eason, of Goodbody, described the update as “disappointing”, and one which will cast “further uncertainty” over the group’s ability to drive margins on. \nHowever, SIG said it had concluded its supply chain review in response to the market downturn and expects to deliver additional savings of at least £20m. While broker Jefferies applauded the efforts made by SIG to improve operational efficiency, it also cautioned: “There is so much management can do to offset deteriorating markets.” \nThe stock, which fell by as much 25.2pc in the latest trading session, closed at 141.5p a loss of 20.8pc. \nMeanwhile, trading was also “tough” for Britain’s biggest supplier of building materials, Travis Perkins , as it too warned on profits. \nShares plunged by as much as 8pc to its lowest level since January as it anticipates full-year earnings to come in at the lower end of market expectations. \nThe owner of home improvements chain Wickes and heating supplies group BSS said sales growth was constrained in the summer months due to weaker demand in the repair, maintenance and improvements market. Adrian Kearsey, of Panmure Gordon, said the FTSE 100 company is putting on “a brave face”, as it claims lead indicators suggest there will be a recovery in the fourth quarter. \n“Santa may bring an early Christmas present, but we are not holding our breath,” Mr Kearsey added, as downgrades are now expected to the stock. The stock fell 118p, or 6pc to £18.45. \nDespite a jittery start to the latest trading session, Britain’s benchmark index inched higher after the European Central Bank left its quantitative easing programme unchanged but said it could ramp it up as soon as December. \nJoshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “Draghi proved a drag for euro bulls, yet European stock markets heard exactly what they wanted to today, pushing the likes of the FTSE, DAX and CAC higher following the ECB Q&A session.” The FTSE 100 rose 27.86 points, or 0.44pc, to 6,376.28. * European Central Bank could pull trigger on more stimulus in December, says Mario Draghi Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) also tumbled into negative territory as its third-quarter production report disappointed investors. The miner fell 1.3pc to 596.9p as it announced plans to defer platinum investment decisions until at least 2017 and slashed its diamond output amid soft demand. \nWhile Anglo suffered from a dismal quarterly performance, its peers emerged unscathed after a note from broker Liberum said the platinum sector is “on life support”. Ben Davis, of Liberum said: “Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) with multi-year low platinum prices and significant demand uncertainty in key markets of autocatalysts, jewellery and investment, the cash flow destructive South African platinum continues to attract bids and rescue financing.” \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) rose 5.9pc to 117.1p, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) was 1.8pc higher at £11.17, Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGY - news ) climbed 2.8pc to 561p and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) was 1.8pc better at £24.89. \nPositive read-across from the US also lifted Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) higher. The equipment rental company advanced 37p to 987p. On Wednesday, US rival United Rentals posted revenue growth of 0.8pc in the third-quarter and reassured investors that 2016 will be “another solid year” of industry growth. \nAim-listed Cambian also lowered its forecasts for the year. Shares in the provider of specialist behavioural health services fell 48.6pc as it pointed to hiring and training challenges (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:41:55.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
