Photo: Hwa Goh\nBill Shorten to unveil $10b 'concrete bank' to fund major projects How sad. Even our attempts at a big visions have become small.\n... And the big things of the nation are delayed till hope grows sick, offered up as sacrifices to 'the bridge across the crick.\nC.J. Dennis Labor's new big, bold, infrastructure policy – $10 billion over an unspecified period to turn Infrastructure Australia into a \"concrete bank\" – actually isn't very big or bold. With an $800 billion infrastructure backlog, it's relatively small beer. As for being new, it's acknowledged to be a copy of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and more than a third of the money is already sitting in the \"Building Australia\" fund.\nWhy $10 billion? Why not $23 billion, or $4 billion or $100 billion? It smells like a political amount, big enough to sound big, but not so big as to startle the horses that have been trained to fear the idea of government debt and investment. I haven't seen a justification for the amount based on what is required to be spent, or what the optimum buck might be for the desired bang.\nAdvertisement And it's a concern that Bill Shorten has followed the announcement up so quickly with a photo opportunity for a particular road project in Tasmania. Politicians and pet projects in Tasmania, with that state's disproportionately large political representation, don't have a good history. The Midland Highway has a whiff of C.J. Dennis' The Bridge Across the Crick . It's not alone in that.\nThat Treasurer Scott Morrison didn't immediately rule out the idea has been hailed as a potential breakthrough for bi-partisan infrastructure policy, but it might also be because it doesn't matter much. More to the point, Morrison's response was so immediately qualified as to mean nothing. Labor didn't have great form on such matters, he was quick to add.\nThat Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss was definite in his immediate rejection is more in keeping with the political mindset. The coalition has already run a bunch of projections and possibilities through its PR Mixmaster to come up with what sounds like grand spending. It doesn't need any more actual spending commitments when that debt-and-deficit slogan is still roaming out there in parts of the electorate's consciousness.\nBesides, the spectre of the ABC's excellent Utopia series is still fresh in our minds. Poor old Infrastructure Australia hasn't exactly been setting our world on fire, which might not be that body's fault. Labor is at least having a crack at infrastructure as an issue. That's a good thing. It remains hamstrung though by the government debt bogey that it helped create and the political difficulty it has at various state levels with \"asset recycling\" – the nice euphemism for privatisation. That's another problem it helped create and grow.\nThe tragedy is that the nation can afford the bigger vision our pollies aren't game to touch. Our net government debt level remains low. If invested in the right prioritised projects – projects that will offer a genuine return on investment – such debt is \"good\" and pays for itself.\nIt's when debt is spent on wages and pensions and white elephants that it is \"bad\" and you end up as Greece.\nFor years now, all manner of reasonable economists have been suggesting the Commonwealth has the wherewithal to use its strong balance sheet to borrow big at very low rates for \"good\" debt that would show a much higher rate of return. Some have been prepared to envision large indeed, in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nThe case for greater infrastructure investment was made strongly by Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens , back in June. I've repeated key parts of his message before and they are worth repeating again, particularly what he saw as holding us back from doing what should be done: \"The impediments to this outcome are not financial. The funding would be available, with long term interest rates the lowest we have ever seen or are likely to.\n\"The impediments are in our decision-making processes and, it seems, in our inability to find political agreement on how to proceed.\"\nYou're not wrong, governor.", "external_links": ["http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/denniscj/backblockother/bridgecrick.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:07:00.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
