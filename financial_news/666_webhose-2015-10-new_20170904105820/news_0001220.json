VW declined to comment.\nThe biggest business crisis in VW's 78-year history has wiped more than a third off its share price, forced out its long-time CEO, prompted investigations across the world and rocked both the car industry and German establishment.\nHamburg-based M.M. Warburg analyst Marc-Rene Tonn said it was still unclear whether VW would allocate the 6.5 billion euros to brand or group accounts.\nThird-quarter group results, due to be published on Oct. 28, will also reflect 500 million euros of costs for restructuring in Brazil and Russia as well as 1.4 billion euros in gains from VW's sale of shares in Suzuki, Tonn said.\nVW's namesake brand contributed 1.43 billion euros or 21 percent of the group's 6.82 billion half-year profit, which included strong performances from premium brands Audi and Porsche.\n($1 = 0.8804 euros) (Reporting by Jan Schwartz and Andreas Cremer; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:48:56.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
