I didn’t say smoking three packs of Luckys. Sitting. As in sitting down, kicking back, putting your dogs up, relaxing.\nRelated\nThe Price We Pay for Sitting Too Much If you’ve been following the studies —or have found yourself trapped in a one-way conversation with Standing Desk Guy at the office—you’ve heard that too much sitting is pretty bad for the human body. It’s a form of sedentary behavior, and it increases the risk for cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, among other hazards. Doesn’t matter if you’re sitting at a desk or sitting at the shrink. Sitting is suboptimal for seniors, middle-agers, millennials, even little kids.\nJust sitting here writing this stylish, absolutely unforgettable sports column, I am putting my body—my life—at risk for your mild amusement.\nI know. It’s scary. It makes you want to…sit down.\nThe scariest thing is, as sports fans, we’re sitting on our butts all the time. Sports fans have elevated sitting to an art form. A sports fan slumped on a couch with a beer and potato chips on his or her shirt could practically be the American flag.\nWe sit for football. We sit for basketball. We sit for the 90-hour draft. We sit for everything. Every night, and hours upon hours on the weekends. Sunday night, after that last NFL game, the couch has made a sad crater outline of your body.\nIt’s a disaster. Think of how many times you have said: “All I want to do today/tonight is just sit and watch the game.”\nMounting evidence says you’re making a dangerous mistake.\nAnd it isn’t just the TV room that is a risk. We’re always sitting at live sporting events, too. We’re sitting at the tailgate, in that $10 lawn chair. Then we’re sitting in the car for at least an hour in traffic leaving the game.\nAnd when you get home, exhausted, you need sit down.\nIt’s a fan’s nightmare. You thought the bad trades and the inexplicable coaching decisions and the Game 7 fiascos were going to send you to the grave. Turns out it’s just the sitting.\nMore Jason Gay\nIn the Middle of Football, Brilliant Bikes Bike Worlds Are Here, So Is Taylor Phinney The Extraordinary Journey of Yogi Berra My NFL Fantasy Nightmare The NFL Begins: Is Your TV Big Enough? Modern life does us no favors, either. At home you’re flopped on a chair with the phone and the tablet and the sports Twitter and fantasy team chit-chat. At the stadium, they’re getting rid of those aluminum benches and hard plastic chairs and replacing them with comfy, cushiony luxury seats that encourage you to plop down like you’re in your own downstairs sports cave. Everyone’s too preoccupied with their plush seats and their phones (again) and their $18 Cobb salads to bother rising to their feet. Behind home plate at a Yankees game looks like the waiting lounge at a real estate office.\nLast Sunday, my friend Miami Dom texted me photos from his trip to the Dolphins-Bills game. He was sitting in a fancy “Living Room Suite” at Sun Life Stadium that looked like something out of a Homer Simpson fantasy—cushy chairs, surrounded by TVs, mere feet from the actual NFL football game being played on the field.\nYou’re killing yourself, Miami Dom! Stand up before it’s too late!\n(Dom’s going to be OK. He co-owns a bunch of CrossFit gyms and can lift a Toyota.)\nWhat’s to be done? The obvious answer is “standing,” but standing isn’t always practical—or polite. At a baseball game, you’re going to get a “Down in Front.” Then you’re going to get a “Down in Front, UNPRINTABLE IN NEWSPAPER WORD.” In the bleachers, you’re just going to get a Bud Light to the back of your head.\nAlso: Isn’t standing partly the responsibility of the home team? The team needs to be doing something positive to lift the crowd to its feet, no? They’re on their feet at Wrigley these days, but have you watched a Chicago Bears game lately? They make you want to hide under your seat.\nAnd what about players? Shouldn’t we be worried about our favorite players? They’re sitting on benches and dugouts and, in European soccer, in those leather loungers from Captain Kirk’s garage. Are we shaving years off their careers? Shouldn’t they all be standing?\n(Not you, Jonathan Papelbon. You can sit.)\nWho really stands anymore? The standing-room-only section? Golf fans? Friends watching friends compete in triathlons? Duke University?\nDoes this mean all those blue-bodied Cameron Crazies will live forever? Sheesh.\nThe evidence is clear: we all need to get off our behinds a little bit. I’m not saying you need to start right this second, but let’s do a little advance planning for an event you’re going to host in early February.\nA Standing Super Bowl Party. Here’s how it would go:\n1. Invite all of your friends to your house for the Super Bowl on Feb. 7, 2016. It’s going to be the New York Jets vs. the Toronto Raptors. You can pencil it down now.\n2. Don’t tell anyone it’s a “Standing” Super Bowl Party. You want people to show up.\n3. The morning of the big game, move all your furniture out onto the street. Yes, even the beanbag chair. Sitting in that stupid beanbag chair probably took away 35 years of your life.\n4. When your guests arrive, they’ll arrive to an empty house with just the TV.\n5. Inform them of the rules. They can watch, they can eat and drink, but absolutely no sitting. Not sitting on the floor. No leaning on the wall. No sleeping atop the keg. Your friends have to stand for the entire Super Bowl—even the terrible commercials.\n6. At halftime, take everyone out for a brisk three-mile jog.\nYes, your friends will never speak to you again. But it will be worth it, because you will have saved lives. It’s time to take a stand.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com .
