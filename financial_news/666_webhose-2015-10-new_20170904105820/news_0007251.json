Getty Images by Ben Potter Supporters of AFL reigning premiers Hawthorn are more down-to-earth, salt-of-the-earth citizens than the more well-heeled West Coast Eagles fans, the Perth club trying to seize their crown in Saturday's AFL Grand Final.\nAccording to Roy Morgan Research, Eagles fans are more numerous than Hawks fans (653,000 to 498,000) but less likely to have attended a match than Hawks fans (just over a fifth of Eagles fans compared to just over a third of Hawks fans).\nHawks fans – who include former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, competition regulator Rod Sims and breakfast DJ Anthony \"Lehmo\" Lehman – are more likely to be financial members of their club (15 per cent to 7 per cent) and to play AFL themselves (9 per cent to 7 per cent).\nEagles fans – who include foreign minister Julie Bishop, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann , Macquarie WA chairman Mark Barnaba and property developer and rich-lister Nigel Satterly – are more likely to own a barbeque and a swimming pool, and to have travelled overseas in the past year.\nThey also give more to charity ($327 in past year to $280), spend more each week going out ($84 to $68) and are more likely to have travelled overseas in the past year (27 per cent to 23 per cent) abut less likely to bet on a game (3 per cent to 6 per cent).\n\"The team spirit of West Coast fans may perhaps be dimmed because they're too busy enjoying the good life,\" said Norman Morris, Industry Communications Director at Roy Morgan Research.\nThe results of the survey of 546 Eagles and 386 Hawks fans are consistent with the Eagles' status as the first WA AFL club to enter the AFL (in 1987) and the extensive corporate backing that followed them.\nThe findings upend the popular image of Hawks fans based on their origins at Glenferrie Oval in the leafy eastern suburb of Hawthorn.\n That image has been overtaken by the huge growth of Hawks fas in more far flung and less wealthy suburbs, but it lives on in ABC Radio personalities The Couldabeen Champions ' character \"Haydn from Glenferrie\", an earnest sounding professional type who seems to read from talking points when professing his passion for the team.\nThe AFL Grand Finalists' supporters are more likely than supporters of National Rugby League Grand Finalists the Brisbane Broncos to be financial members of their club and to play the game themselves.\nOnly 5 per cent of the 1.1 million Broncos supporters and 4 per cent of the 389,000 North Queensland Cowboys fans are financial members of their clubs, and only 4 per cent of Broncos fans and 3 per cent of Cowboys fans play the game.\nThey're more likely to have a swimming pool (Cowboys 21 per cent, Broncos 16 per cent) than the AFL clubs fans but give less to charity ($226 last year for Cowboys fans, $266 for Broncos fans).\nBroncos are more likely than Cowboys fans to have holidayed overseas in the past year (24 per cent to 21 per cent) and spend more going out each week ($70 for Broncos fans, ($51 for Cowboys fans).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:04:22.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
