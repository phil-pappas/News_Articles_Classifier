( TMM.TO ) (NYSE MKT:TGD) (\"Timmins Gold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce, further to its news release of September 18, 2015, the closing of a C$6.0 million non-brokered private placement by Goldcorp Inc. (\"Goldcorp\") consisting of 20 million units of Timmins Gold (the \"Private Placement\") at a price of C$0.30 per unit. Each unit consists of one share and one half of a warrant, each whole warrant (a \"Warrant\") being exercisable for one common share of Timmins Gold at a price of C$0.35 per share for a term of 24 months. The Warrants are subject to an accelerated exercise period of 10 days if the Company's closing share price meets or exceeds C$0.60 per share for a period of 20 consecutive trading days. The securities issuable under the private placement and any shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants will be subject to a hold period expiring 4 months and one day from closing. The use of proceeds of the Private Placement will be to pay for the cost of the removal of the plant from the El Sauzal Mine site. \nThe Company expects to close the acquisition of the complete process plant and select auxiliary equipment (the \"Plant\") used in the operation of Goldcorp's El Sauzal Mine in Chihuahua, Mexico (\"the Plant Acquisition\") from a Mexican subsidiary of Goldcorp later this month. The Plant is being acquired for future use at the Company's recently acquired Ana Paula project in Guerrero, Mexico. \nFollowing the completion of the Plant Acquisition and Private Placement, Goldcorp will hold approximately 9.9% of Timmins Gold's issued and outstanding common shares on an undiluted basis. \nAbout Timmins Gold \nTimmins Gold has a proven track record of delivering growth and value creation for its investors and is poised to become an emerging intermediate, Mexican-focused gold producer with a portfolio of high-quality production and growth assets all based in Mexico. The Company owns and operates the San Francisco open pit, heap leach gold mine in Sonora which provides a solid base of operations, allowing the Company to develop two economically robust growth projects with manageable capital requirements, the Ana Paula and Caballo Blanco gold projects. \nNeither the TSX nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX) nor the New York Stock Exchange MKT accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release. \nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities laws.
