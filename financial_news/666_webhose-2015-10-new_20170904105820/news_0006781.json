However, as prices of many commodities have collapsed, the question of hedging has become more pertinent. \n\"Our structural position (on hedging) is very clear,\" Jean Sebastien Jacques, chief executive of copper and coal for Rio Tinto, said at a Bloomberg event that was part of the LME Week industry gathering. \nAccording to Rio Tinto's 2014 annual report, the company's policy is to sell its products \"at prices that reflect the value of our products in the market and not to enter into price hedging arrangements\".
