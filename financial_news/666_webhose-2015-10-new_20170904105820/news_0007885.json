Michele Mossop Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger With its steep rents and high cost of living, Sydney may appear expensive to Australians.\nBut when compared with other global cities such as New York, London and Hong Kong, Australia's most prosperous city is one of the most affordable, with the best-value proposition for start-ups, a new report says.\nThe report by real estate group Savills, set against the backdrop of the rising digital economy and greater workforce mobility, ranked Sydney third on the list of least expensive global city to live and work in, with only Mumbai and Shanghai (cities with arguably inferior living standards and less appealing lifestyles), less expensive.\nIts report, 12 Cities – The Rise of the Digital City, calculated the average cost to set up a small executive team in Sydney (comprising one middle-aged expat chief executive , one senior expat director, a locally-employed director and four-locally employed admin staff) at US$53,000 ($75,000) per person, with 20 per cent going towards office costs and the remainder on housing rents.\nBy comparison, it would cost the same executive team more than double in office and housing rents to set up the same businesses in iconic employment hubs such as New York, London and Hong Kong.\nSavills Australia head of research Tony Crabb said people working in the digital economy were attracted to places such as London and New York, but the costs were often \"almost too much to bear\".\n\"These people could run more profitable businesses if they chose to work and live somewhere like Sydney where the costs are half, provided the opportunities are equal,\" Mr Crabb said.\nImpact of falling dollar The fall in the Australian dollar has also made Sydney more affordable for those businesses earning US dollars – but Mr Crabb said most small or start-up businesses did not repatriate their earnings.\nOn a second measure of affordability – rental costs compared with city productivity – the report ranked Sydney first out of the 12 cities with average office and residential rental costs accounting for just 70 per cent of local gross domestic product per capita, ahead of US digital economy giants such as Los Angeles (80 per cent) and San Francisco (100 per cent).\nIn New York, average rental costs per person exceeded productivity by 150 per cent, in London by 200 per cent and in Hong Kong by 300 per cent.\nMumbai was the most expensive global market on this measure, with per-head accommodation costing five times GDP.\n\"This may not be a perfect measure of real estate affordability, but it gives a good indication of which cities may be fully rented if GDP does not rise and those which have greatest ability to absorb rising total accommodation costs, whether through office or residential rent increases,\" said Yolande Barnes, director of Savills world research.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:02:18.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
