Bentham has recently backed an action by Tesco shareholders over the retailer’s overstating of profits. \nThe pair are attempting to assemble a huge class action following what they call “fundamental dishonesty” at the German auto giant, which plunged the carmaker into crisis after it admitted using “defeat devices” to cheat pollution tests. \nThe admission has been hugely costly for shareholders after it wiped more than €25bn off VW’s stock market value. Recalls and fines worth tens of billions of euros more are also expected. Volkswagen 60-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nNow Quinn Emanuel and Bentham are contacting VW’s biggest investors which include sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Norway to ask them to join the claim. \nVW has admitted that it fitted “defeat devices” to 11m cars that allowed them to fraudulently pass pollution controls, though the company’s senior management has insisted it was unaware of the practices. * Volkswagen emissions scandal: the terrifying numbers * Probe into Volkswagen emissions scandal could take months Richard East, co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel in London, said: “We estimate shareholders’ losses could be €40bn as a result of VW’s failure to provide relevant disclosure [about defeat devices] to the market and gives rise to questions about fundamental dishonesty.” \nLegal action would be pursued in Germany under its Securities Trading Act, according to Quinn Emanuel, which hopes to file the first wave of actions by February. The law firm will argue that VW’s failure to reveal its use of defeat devices to shareholders constituted gross negligence by management. \nMr East added that damages could be calculated from 2009 when VW started fitting the devices to its engines and that if investors had known about them they would not have held or traded in VW shares. “We don’t think it will be very hard to find shareholders who have suffered because of it,” he said. In the driving seat: New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) boss Matthias Mueller says the company will get back in gear in as little as two years “Institutional investors will be under pressure from their own shareholders to act after the fall in VW shares.” \nJeremy Marshall, chief investment officer at Bentham, said that bringing a joint action by institutional investors is a more effective way of suing VW. * VW must bypass its entrenched culture for the road to recovery “We have been in touch with a tremendous number of VW shareholders. We would not be able to get it up and running unless there was sufficient investor appetite,” he said. \nMr Marshall said to fund the case, Bentham would look to get between 20pc and 25pc of any damages paid, adding that it would probably cost between €6m and €7m, before it went anywhere near a courtroom. \nVW is largely controlled by two major investors, with Porsche holding 50pc and the German state of Lower Saxony controlling 20pc, and it is thought they are unlikely to sue over losses, with their own interests closely linked to VW’s health. \nThe next-biggest shareholder is Qatar’s state investment fund at 17pc, then stakes drop down to 2pc or below, among them Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Suzuki, Axa (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) and Blackrock (NYSE: BLK - news ) . * Volkswagen’s US boss knew about emissions problem in 2014 * VW emissions scandal: 'Fewer than 10 people' implicated so far", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:26:57.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
