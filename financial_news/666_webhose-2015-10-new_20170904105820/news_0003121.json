Photo: James Davies\nAre lenders taking advantage of borrowers? Despite interest rates falling this year, lenders have hardly moved the interest rates they charge on credit cards and personal loans.\nMoney’s Borrowing Power Calculator lets you work out what mortgage is right for you. The Reserve Bank cut rates by 0.25 percentage points, on two occasions this year, in February and in May, for a total cut of 0.5 percentage points.\nFigures from finder.com.au show the average interest rate on variable rate personal loans is only 0.2 percentage points less than at the start of this year.\nAdvertisement That is a cut in personal loan rates of less than half the cut in the cash rate.\nOf the variable rate personal loans monitored by finder.com.au most have either increased rates or left rates unchanged.\nConsumers stand to benefit by shopping around as there are a wide range of interest rates on personal loans.\nFor instance, the lowest variable rate on a personal loan listed on Finder's database is 5.35 per cent and the highest is 17 per cent.\nCredit cards Credit card purchase interest rates have been a long-running sore for consumers.\nDespite the cut in the cash rate, purchase interest rates average 17.07 per cent now. That is virtually unchanged since the start of this year.\nThere are other factors that come into play when lenders set their credit card interest rates, but the level of the official cash rate should also play a part.\nAs \"unsecured\" credit, it is expected credit card rates will be higher than, say, mortgage rates where the mortgage is secured against a property.\nThere is an ongoing Senate inquiry into credit cards. The inquiry is asking lenders to explain why interest rates are so high and why card rates have not moved lower as the cash rate has fallen.\nCredit cards have a wide range of interest rates and some have rewards points – though reward cards usually have an annual fee and higher purchase interest rates.\nThose cardholders who always pay off the entire debt by the due date and do not make cash advances pay no interest at all.\nMortgage rates Property investors have been hit hard by increased interest rates on their mortgages despite official interest rates falling.\nWhile owner-occupiers have generally seen interest rates on variable rate mortgages fall in line with the fall in the cash rate, investors have been hit with higher interest rates.\n\"For the last 10 years, owner-occupiers and investors have generally had the same deal on rates,\" RateCity money editor Sally Tindall says.\nBut regulators want the growth in lending to investors to slow. Investor activity has been a major driver of surging property prices in Sydney and Melbourne.\nRegulators are worried that some of the lending to investors has been a bit risky, with sharp growth in interest-only mortgages – where the borrowers pay the interest and the loan size stays the same.\nOver past months, more and more lenders have introduced higher interest rates for investors than for owner-occupiers.\nRateCity figures show that almost half of all lenders now offer different rates for investors and owner-occupiers, with a difference of up to 0.85 percentage points.\nInvestors beware Lenders have increased rates for existing property investors, not just new investors. Investors who are paying higher rates may think they will be able to refinance at a cheaper rate.\nBut as well as lifting interest rates for investors, lenders have been tightening their lending criteria.\nSome require the investor to have a larger deposit. They have also increased their interest rate buffers, which is when a lender tests an investor's finances to see if they would still be comfortable if interest rates were to rise.\nAlso, some lenders are not including the tax benefits of negative gearing.\nThey are also discounting the expected rental income by 20 per cent.\n@jcollett_money", "external_links": ["http://finder.com.au/", "http://twitter.com/@jcollett_money"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:07:50.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
