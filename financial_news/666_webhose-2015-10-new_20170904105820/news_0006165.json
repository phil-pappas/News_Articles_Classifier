Bradley Kanaris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason Competition boss Rod Sims has warned that while the watchdog has given the green light for Foxtel to buy up to 15 per cent of Ten Network Holdings, it will continue to scrutinise deals between the two in the future.\nThe ruling allows Foxtel buy up to 15 per cent of Ten, the home of MasterChef and The Bachelor , and the free-to-air broadcaster take a 24.99 per cent stake in the Foxtel and Fox Sports advertising joint-venture Multi-Channel Network. It will also give Ten the option of taking a 10 per cent stake in the Foxtel-Seven streaming venture Presto.\nThe ACCC said that the transactions are unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition, but because Foxtel is buying a minority stake and Ten would not be a subsidiary of the pay TV provider, 50-50 owned by News Corporation and Telstra, the pair would still be subject to the Competition and Consumer Act in its future dealings.\n\"A lot of people were complaining about this transaction, and their complaint was that this transaction would lead to substantial lessening of competition,\" Mr Sims told Fairfax Media. \"Now, we couldn't get there in that forward looking way. But, if their worst fears are realised and some of the things they're concerned about do actually occur, then we, under the same test – the substantial lessening of competition – could step in to stop it happening.\"\nMr Sims said if Foxtel and Ten were to use joint bids to secure the majority of sport content in a way that hurt Nine Entertainment Co and Seven West Media, then the ACCC could take action.\n\"It's a very usual situation. Yes, we've cleared the transaction, but we haven't necessarily cleared the effect of the transaction.\"\nThe ability to keep an eye on future tie-ups was a key reason why the ACCC did not include enforceable undertakings, effectively a pledge to not engage in certain activities which if breached can be enforced in court by the watchdog.\n\"Informing the view about whether [the transaction] substantially lessens competition, you've got that uncertainty about what the landscape is going to look like; particularly, how much streaming will provide real competition to Foxtel,\" Mr Sims said.\n \"If it does, then the transaction was not going to [be] substantially lessening competition anyway. If it doesn't and Foxtel is still in a strong position and does agreements with Ten that substantially lessens competition, then we can act.\"\nTen shares finished Thursday flat at 19¢, while Seven and Nine dropped 7.6 per cent to 67¢ and 4.4 per cent to $1.515 respectively.\nMr Sims also used the decision to weigh into the debate in media reform, stating the \"reach rule\", which prevents television networks from broadcasting to 75 per cent or more of the Australia population, \"may no longer effective\" in an era where content can be streamed via the internet across the entire country.\n\"The 'reach rule' continues to limit a person from controlling television broadcasting licences that reach over 75 per cent of the population even while commercial free-to-air television networks are now able to stream their services nationally,\" Mr Sims said.\nNeed for media reform Fairfax Media, which owns The Australian Financial Review and BusinessDay and opposed the tie-up, said the decision highlights the need to act on media reform.\n\"The decision confirms that the industry is rapidly evolving across all forms of media, locally and globally, and underlines the need to modernise media ownership law in Australia to keep pace with these developments,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe ACCC also ruled that an additional 8.5 per cent stake in Ten held by Lachlan Murdoch, through his private investment vehicle Illyria, did not lead to control of the free-to-air network when combined with the stake Foxtel will buy.\n\"We believe that is important, but not enough to amount to a substantial lessening of competition; we took into account the full range of interests that are out there,\" Mr Sims said.\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority confirmed that it would not stand in the way of the deal, stating \"at this time\" it will not breach media diversity and control rules, as foreshadowed by Fairfax Media.\n\"The principal issue considered by the ACMA was whether the arrangements would put Mr Lachlan Murdoch in a position to exercise control of commercial television broadcasting licences held by Ten,\" ACMA chairman Chris Chapman said.\n\"If so, an 'unacceptable three-way control situation' would result in the four licence areas, where Mr Murdoch is already in a position to control the Nova commercial radio broadcasting licences and the News Corporation associated newspapers.\n\"However, the ACMA considered that, while Mr Murdoch was in a position to exert influence on Ten, that level of influence fell short of 'control' as prescribed by the Broadcasting Services Act.\"\nFoxtel chief executive Richard Freudenstein welcomed the ruling that will see Foxtel buy its up-to-15-per-cent stake for $77 million.\n\"These transactions will provide much needed capital for Ten and help it to grow revenues by building scale and enhancing services to clients by working with MCN,\" Mr Freudenstein said.\n\"A stronger Ten will further enhance competition in an increasingly competitive local and international media industry.\"\nTen will raise an additional $77 million through a entitlement offer to shareholders. It will use the money to reduce debt and invest to content to continue its ratings improvement.\n\"By entering into the transaction with Foxtel and completing our proposed entitlement offer to all TEN shareholders, TEN will receive the capital it needs to continue its turnaround. Through the arrangements with MCN, our advertising clients will receive the benefit of new efficiencies, improved data capability and broader integration opportunities,\" Ten non-executive chairman David Gordon said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/acma-will-clear-foxtel-stake-in-ten-predicts-expert-20151013-gk7qz4.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:06:57.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
