At the meeting, company management outlined the company’s strategic plans for fiscal 2016 ending January 31, 2016, and for the next three years through fiscal 2019.\n\nRevenue growth Walmart expects to generate incremental sales from $45–$60 billion over the next three years, a projected CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 3%–4% from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019.\nWalmart has downwardly revised its annual sales growth guidance for fiscal 2016, from 1%–2% to 0%, citing the adverse impact of a higher-than-expected US dollar. However, sales are expected to rise 3% on a constant-currency basis. Walmart reported $485.7 billion in global sales last year. Walmart’s sales are marginally down year-over-year in 1H16.\nYou’ll read a more detailed analysis of Walmart’s revenue projections in Parts 3–5 of this series.\nGuidance shocks markets Despite the bullish outlook for its top line, Walmart warned of declining earnings in the near term. It cited higher wage costs and investments in digital, supply chain, and pricing, among others. Walmart’s stock fell more than 10% to close a shade over the psychological $60 level at $60.03 on October 14.\nThe stock continued to fall on October 15 and 16, taking the weekly loss to 11.7%. WMT closed at $58.89 on October 16, its lowest level since May 2012.\nRead more on the earnings and profitability impact of Walmart’s guidance in Part 6 of this series.\nPeers Kroger (KR), Target (TGT), Whole Foods Market (WFM), and Costco (COST) followed the downward trend as well.
