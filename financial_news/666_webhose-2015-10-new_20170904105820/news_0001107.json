But in the short term, Bangladesh will need to address the country's safety issues if it wants to continue attracting buyers. \nFears for the safety of foreigners in Bangladesh, after the recent killings of two Italian and Japanese citizens, has resulted in some international buyers postponing business trips to the country. The US has warned of a “continued threat against foreigners” travelling there, while the UK, Australian, Italian and Japanese embassies have all issued similar alerts. \nFaruque Hassan, newly-appointed SVP of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Association (BGMEA), admits this is a concern and not good for the country's image. \n“It’s very shameful when you look at the history of Bangladesh,” he told just-style on the sidelines of this year's International Apparel Federation (IAF) conference in Istanbul. “This has given us a bad name, but I believe the media and some of the western governments have over-reacted on this.” \nNonetheless, he dismisses the idea of any long-term impact. “I now travel to Barcelona, or Hamburg to take orders. We are trying to meet in the [buyers'] country and also via video conference.” \nIt is understood Swedish fashion giant H&M, and US apparel group Gap Inc, were among the companies who have cancelled trips to Bangladesh, while the BGMEA was forced to cancel a buyers’ conference earlier this month after a number of companies refused to attend. While seen as an isolated incident, it is certainly an unwelcome one given the country is striving to hit its ambitious export target. \nIn six years' time, Bangladesh will be celebrating the country's Golden Jubilee of Independence, but it is hopeful of a double celebration should it hit $50bn. Achieving this figure, however, will be something of a challenge, admits Hassan, given the sector earned $25.5bn in 2014. But he is confident it is achievable. \n“The biggest challenge right now is currency,” he tells just-style. “Currencies have depreciated in all of the importing countries: the euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar. And our competitors' currencies have depreciated: Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, even China. Bangladesh is the only country where the currency is stable. But [the taka] is not an export friendly currency, so this is a big challenge.” Addressing skills shortage \nDespite the safety, and subsequent image issues Bangladesh has faced since the Tazreen fire in 2012, and the Rana Plaza disaster a year later, garment exports have continued to grow at a steady pace. \nIn 2013, Bangladesh's RMG exports totalled $21.52bn , and the country now has a 5.2% share of the $460bn global apparel market, up from 2.6% in 2000. The target is to achieve 8% by 2020, but in order to do this Bangladesh needs to address the sector's skills shortage. \nAt present, the country employs around 4.4m workers in its garment industry, making this its largest employer, with around 20,000 of those foreign workers. Hassan says more skilled workers are needed through better education, a challenge the BGMEA is working hard to overcome with its association accredited Bangladesh University of Fashion and Technology (BUFT). \nLocated in Dhaka, the university was established as an institute in 1999 with the aim of producing technically competent human resources for the country's garment sector. It has since grown, and three years ago was given permission to become a university. Over 5,000 students are now studying; a number the BGMEA hopes will increase to 14,000 once a new campus is finished next year. \n“We will have a lab for everything, spinning machines, knitting, dyeing. You name it,” Hassan explains. “We are training a new workforce, and we have the advantage that 70% of our population is aged below 40, while China and Europe’s population is ageing. It’s a big area where we can utilise skills and bring maximum results. Ultimately [graduates] will enjoy a good salary and their livelihoods will be improved.” \nRecently the university partnered on a project with, and funded by, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to incorporate more CSR and sustainability into the university's curriculum. Around 17 teachers were sent away on an intensive training course with MVO Nederland, an independent expertise and network organisation for CSR. These teachers are now developing the university's curriculum and carrying out industry research. \nMVO Nederland project manager, Tessa Groenen, explains: “The CSR training is very broad, covering international frameworks and guidelines, environmental aspects, worker ethics, as well as the profit side. So, how can CSR improve your business strength? What could be the return on investment? How can certain measures increase productivity.” Cost of production \nIf successful, the university could have a sizeable impact on addressing the industry's skills shortage and helping maintain its position as the world's second largest garment producer. \nBangladesh's GDP growth has averaged at around 5-6% for the last 20 years, thanks mainly to the success of its garment industry. Yet one of the things that has made Bangladesh so successful is something that is proving challenging to fix: cost. \nThe BGMEA has been increasingly outspoken about what it sees as unfair costs imposed on factories to upgrade their facilities, improve conditions for workers, and become more sustainable – and believes buyers should be paying higher prices for the garments they source from Bangladesh. The country's garment workers currently earn a minimum wage of $68 per month. This compares to Cambodia at $128 per month and Vietnam at $88.7 to $126. \nWearing three hats as board member of BUFT, SVP of the BGMEA, and factory owner of Giant Group, Hassan says it has become a “big issue” that brands pay “a fair price” for their garments. \n“We are asking for a price that will enable us to give more attention to the environment, to worker safety, to worker livelihoods and living wages. Frankly, the wages we are paying right now are not covering their living costs, and they are increasing every year. We are investing huge amounts in compliance and safety, and in Bangladesh, bank interest rates are very high. \n“It is just not fair. It’s important they pay more. We’re not asking for a large margin. There is a big difference in our selling price and their selling price. So 15 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, depending on the garment, is nothing for them.” Market diversification \nDespite such challenges, Bangladesh's global exports have continued to grow. In 2014, Europe continued to be its largest export market at 51% thanks to its duty-free benefits under the GSP 'Everything but Arms' (EBA) arrangement, followed by the US at 29%, and Canada at 4.6%. \nBut Hassan says Bangladesh previously depended too much on those three regions and, while Europe will remain its most important market, in recent years has been looking to diversify and focus on more non-traditional and less seasonal markets like Latin America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East. \nIndeed, one of the priorities of a new roadmap the BGMEA is working on to help achieve its export target, and is expected to be finalised by the new committee in early December, will address entering new markets, alongside creating a more skilled workforce, and diversifying its product range. \nBangladesh is now exporting to Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Australia and New Zealand. It has also started exporting to neighbouring countries such as India, China, Korea, and Malaysia. \n“We are thinking about up-and-coming economies, and population. Also, if you think that in Germany, the men’s sizing is much bigger, so you require more fabric. If you ship to India, they have a smaller frame so your fabric consumption is less, your cost is less, and your transportation cost is less.” Hassan says the BGMEA is now working to set up a warehouse in India that will allow it to ship faster to stores. \nAs for product diversification, he adds, this will come as part of the work BUFT is doing with its graduates. “[Design] is a big area we have not yet entered. There is big scope for us to develop our own designs where we can get better prices. We could have our own collection as well.” Grasping the reigns \nIn the near term, however, a question mark hangs over whether Bangladesh will be ready by 2018 to take on the remedial work the Alliance and the Accord have been carrying out for the past two and a half years. \nAlliance Ambassador James Moriarty recently suggested that while remediation is having a positive effect , there is concern about the government's capacity to implement such reforms. \nHassan, however, is “strongly” confident the industry can do so, and that Bangladesh's garment factories will emerge safer and more sustainable. \n“There are three areas that are receiving our full attention: building safety, electrical safety and fire safety,” he explains. “All of the top brands have their own audit teams, offices and inspectors and we are all working together. The BGMEA has a department for fire safety, we have a social compliance team, and we have a structural building safety team. We have also set up a Technical Training Business sector that helps factories reduce environmental issues such as energy consumption. \n“We believe our development partners will continue to support us because they are also a beneficiary of that. Ultimately, European partners and the rest of the world are getting clothing at a cheap price.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:12:03.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
