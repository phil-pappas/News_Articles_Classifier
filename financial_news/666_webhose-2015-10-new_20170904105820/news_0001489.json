But the ones from the Buckeye terminal lifted by BTG Pactual will be supplied by condensate coming from the Utica and Marcellus shale fields in the Northeast and Midwest.\nThe deal is one of the most visible yet for the commodities trading division that BTG set up two years ago, when it spent some $300 million building a global business and hiring hundreds of staff to trade everything from freight to grains to natural gas at offices in London, Geneva, Stamford, Connecticut and elsewhere.\nThe first cargo, which left the New York Harbor in early September, was fixed for delivery in the Netherlands.\nThe STI Beryl entered the New York Harbor on Monday, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.\nBTG did not reply to a request for comment and Buckeye referred questions to clients.\nThe condensate exported from New Jersey is sourced from a stabilizer in Cadiz, Ohio. It is owned by MarkWest Energy Partners, which is being bought by Marathon Petroleum Corp .\nThe condensate began moving to the New Jersey terminal by rail in July to build up supply for the first shipment. Now roughly 20 railcars per day of the condensate are moving to the terminal, according to one of the sources.\nBuckeye Partners last year brought on line a 104-car unit train facility at its Perth Amboy storage and export terminal, but the expansion has not yet been used to capacity.
