He frequently opines on OMA-government relations in the online health policy magazine HealthyDebate.ca .\nThe dispute was sparked when the province unilaterally chopped all fees charged by doctors by 1.3 per cent in September. This was on top of a 2.65 per cent across-the-board cut in February. There have also been fee cuts targeted at different specialties, and taken together they add up to 6.9 per cent in cuts, according to the OMA.\nThe government cut fees because it is trying to cap the annual physician services budget at $11.6 billion.\nDoctors argue that they are charging beyond the cap because they are doing more work by treating a growing and aging population.\nThe government contends the physician services budget was set taking demographic changes into account. As well, it argues that a negotiating framework created at the insistence of the OMA allowed it to take unilateral action.\nBarrett warned that if physicians become disaffected, their support for Ontario’s single-payer medicare system may erode.\n“It’s imprudent in the medium and short term (for government) to act in such a ham-fisted manner in dictating physician compensation,” he said, adding that doctors may agitate for changes such as practising outside the single-payer system and extra billing.\nBarrett said the government’s “obsessive focus on its fiscal position” is blinding it to the fact that it needs doctors onside to make needed structural reforms to the health system.\nA written statement from Health Minister Eric Hoskins, provided to the Star on Friday evening, said it’s important to stay within allotted budgets so that there will be enough money to expand home and community care.\nHe said that, to date, the OMA has refused to offer its view on how best to manage the $11.6 billion budgeted for doctors. Hoskins said he wants to meet with Toth in the near future to discuss how government funding can be used to “put patients first and to ensure the sustainability of health care.”\nHoskins pointed out that a recent report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information showed that Ontario doctors are the best paid in the country, earning $368,000 a year on average, before expenses.\nThere are significant disparities in how much the different specialties earn. For example, family physicians typically earn much less than that average, while ophthalmologists, radiologists, cardiologists and nephrologists typically earn much more.\nMore on thestar.com\nLeftover stuffing waffles a hot Thanksgiving trend\nGiving thanks", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "https://www.oma.org/Mediaroom/PressReleases/Pages/OMAdisappointed.aspx", "http://healthydebate.ca/opinions/unilateral-government-action-threaten-future-medicare"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:20:09.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
