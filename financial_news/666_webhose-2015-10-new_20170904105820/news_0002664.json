Two are from its LifeStratrgy range which blend shares and bonds according to a specified split. \nThe rise in tracker sales has coincided with a turn in global stock market since May and it could be a sign investors are jumping on board at the wrong time. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas \nTrackers tend to do best, relative to actively managed funds, when markets are rising. This increases all share prices and makes it harder for stock-pickers to find winners. Prolonged stock market weakness could see trackers fall behind. \nOver the long term, however, there is evidence that investors do better by sticking to tracker funds because it is impossible to know which active fund managers will beat the market. \nActive funds are more expensive, typically charging 0.85pc on an ongoing basis versus 0.1pc or less for the cheapest trackers. When viewed on a total return basis, this lower cost helps trackers to perform better. Top 10 most traded funds: 01 July 30 September 2015 - Trackers in bold 1. Woodford Equity Income 2. AXA Framlington Biotech 3. Fundsmith Equity 4. Vanguard LifeStrategy 80pc Equity 5. Neptune UK Mid Cap 6. Vanguard FTSE UK All Share Index 7. Vanguard LifeStrategy 100pc Equity 8.

Vanguard FTSE Deloped World Ex-UK Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: “As you move into a different stage of the economic cycle and markets become more volatile, active management may have a greater role to play. \n“Investors should potentially be wary of using either active or passive funds exclusively, as they both have their strengths at different stages of the economic cycle.” \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) added that prices of the largest global companies, in the FTSE 100, had been moving out of step with those of smaller firms during the recent market volatility. \nThis, she said, should prompt passive investors to look beyond large cap tracker funds. \nThe Telegraph has launched its own DIY investment service, designed with simple pricing.
