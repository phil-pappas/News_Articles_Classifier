IPOs in the cash-hungry tech sector are also notably down on last year. \n- Formula One factor - \nThe exact level of demand for the new stock will not be clear until Wednesday but analysts think Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, who is also chairman of Ferrari, has been astute in bringing a restricted number of shares to market. \nThe strategy mirrors the one Ferrari has deployed with its cars: keeping production tight to preserve their exclusive cachet. \nFerrari shipped 7,255 new cars to its wealthy customers last year and the IPO prospectus envisages only a gradual expansion to around 9,000 a year by 2019. \nThe flotation will not have any impact on Ferrari's involvement in Formula One racing, in which it is reemerging as a force after enduring a lean period in the slipstream of world champion Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes (Xetra: 710000 - news ) team. \nFerrari's status as the longest-established and most celebrated team in motorsport's elite championship is vital to the value of its brand. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also accounts for more than 10 percent of its revenue through sponsorship and related commercial agreements, including licencing of the company's name and famous prancing stallion logo. \nFerrari plans to \"selectively expand\" these activities with the IPO prospectus talking of potential branded products in sportswear, watches, accessories, consumer electronics and theme parks. \nThe listing will leave Fiat Chrysler with 80-81 percent of Ferrari which the parent company intends to distribute to its own shareholders next year. \nBefore then Ferrari is due to make a payment of $3.2 billion dollars to its parent, increasing the total raised by Fiat Chrysler from the flotation/spinoff to more than $4 billion. \nAt the end of June, the mass carmaker had net debt of $10.8 billion due to a combination of Fiat (Hanover: FIA1.HA - news ) 's acquisition of Chrysler and ongoing lossmaking activities. \nPiero Ferrari, a son of legendary founder Enzo Ferrari, will retain a ten percent stake after the flotation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:48:53.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
