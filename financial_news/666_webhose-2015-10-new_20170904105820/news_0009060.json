Therefore, the issue of recognition is currently not on the table,\" she said.\nA spokesman for the ministry also said that Sweden had no boycott against exports from Morocco.\nThe Moroccan government did not give details on how the boycott would be implemented or say whether it knew which Swedish companies could be affected.\n\"We are considering it, but we hope Sweden would review its position on the Moroccan Sahara,\" Mustapha Khalfi, Communication Minister and government spokesman, told Reuters. \"That's all I can tell you right now.\"\nHowever, Moroccan authorities have already blocked the opening of IKEA's first store this week, citing a lack of permits.\nSwedish-labelled companies have been operating in Morocco for decades, including Geely-owned carmaker Volvo, H&M and Volkswagen-owned Scania.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:30.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
