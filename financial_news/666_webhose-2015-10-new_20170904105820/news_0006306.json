There are now very limited means to avoid the tax, accountants warn. \nThey say that middle-class buy-to-let investors, who have one or two let properties in addition to their home, will typically be hit either with capital gains tax, on the sale of their investment properties; or inheritance tax, if they do not dispose of them before death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:13:44.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
