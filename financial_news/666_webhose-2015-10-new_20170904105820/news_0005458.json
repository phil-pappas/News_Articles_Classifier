CS, Devon \nWhen you became stranded in your car you called the rescue service and paid the £40 excess that applies to your policy. \nHowever, a kindly motorist stopped and helped you get going again. You tried to cancel the call‑out and believed you had done so before the rescue vehicle set off. However, it still arrived. \n• 'Vodafone kept taking payments after I cancelled' \nAfter that a long wrangle ensued over the timing of the calls and when the vehicle had set off. \nAmong the exclusions in your policy’s terms and conditions are “any charges, where you, having contacted us, effect recovery or repairs by other means unless we have agreed to reimburse you”. \nHad this been explained at the start I feel everyone would have been saved a lot of unnecessary running around. NCI adds that every time it books a recovery agent there is a cost involved from its agents. Clarifying this took far longer than it should have done. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:14:49.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
