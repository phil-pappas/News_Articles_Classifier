Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl Investments by Australian businesses in Asia may be producing returns faster than many people expect and smaller businesses are doing better than some larger ones.\nA survey of 1000 companies by EY Sweeney for the ANZ Banking Group provides a more optimistic outlook about the level of Australian business activity in Asia than some past studies, although the data approaches are not the same.\nThirty-eighty per cent of small businesses surveyed said they had made a satisfactory return within 12 months compared with 29 per cent of medium-sized businesses and 16 per cent of larger businesses.\nThe largest proportion of the medium businessess – or 30 per cent – took two to three years to achieve a satisfactory return, while the largest proportion of the larger businesses – or 27 per cent – took four to five years to achieve the desired return.\nThe smaller businesses also reported that revenue outcomes from Asia were larger than expectations, to a greater extent than the larger businesses. Overall, 47 per cent of the companies said Asian profit margins were higher than in Australia.\nIt finds that 20 per cent of small businesses have operations in the region and 22 per cent are considering doing so, compared with 39 per cent of medium businesses already operating and 19 per cent considering setting up. In line with other such studies, larger businesses are more exposed to the region with 51 per cent already operating and 19 per cent considering entering the region.\nFaster returns ANZ managing director corporate and commercial Mark Hand said companies which decided to operate in Asia were often discovering that a combination of bigger than expected operating scale, and larger cost savings produced a faster return on the investment than first expected.\n The ANZ study – released on Wednesday – came after amid the debate about the willingness of larger institutional investors to support Asian ventures triggered by the decision of the IAG group to pull back from expansion in to China due to opposition from shareholders.\nThe ANZ study is not strictly relevant to companies as large as IAG because it had a cut off point for the 1000 participating businesses of $500 million in revenue and Mr Hand would not comment directly on the case.\nBut he said many private companies captured by the survey found once they had developed an Asian operation, they did not have problems raising capital for expansion.\nReferring the the faster returns from smaller businesses, he said they usually had more motivated investors on board for a regional business expansion and could make faster decisions.\nWith about 350 out of the 1000 businesses already operating in Asia, 27 per cent had been there for six to 10 years, 5 per cent had been there for only a year and 15 per cent had been there for more than 20 years.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:41:46.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
