In the US, crude stockpiles surged... and supply glut remains a concern,\" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY. \nGupta said a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers on Wednesday \"did not produce any meaningful results as no potential production cuts were addressed\". \nHe said the market would be looking at a December 4 policy-setting meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which is expected to \"provide vital clues about price development in the medium term\". \nOPEC, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, has maintained high production levels despite the price decline, as cartel members try to hold onto market share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:03:28.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
