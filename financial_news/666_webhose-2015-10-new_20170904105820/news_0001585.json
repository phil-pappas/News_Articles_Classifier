In retrospect, the summer fall of more than a 10th may come to be seen as just a normal setback in a bull market. \nAs the dust settles, one thing that has happened this year has become clear. The plunge in commodity prices has created a two-tier market. Despite a rally this week, big mining and oil shares have fallen badly. But the rest of the market has, on average, gone up. \nThat is why the FTSE 100, which includes Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , BP and the big miners such as Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , has fallen so far whereas the FTSE 250 index, with medium-size companies and a much lower weighting of mineral companies, has risen. \nBasically, if your portfolio has been overweight in mineral companies, you are likely to have lost money. If it hasn’t you are likely to be in profit. \nDuring the summer panic I raised about 5pc cash in my portfolio as a precaution. But now things are calmer I have begun to invest it again. \nMy latest idea came from shopping with my younger daughter. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) wanted a warm coat before setting off for university. \nSince she has reached her late teenage years, I had no say about where we went and, to my astonishment, I found myself in Marks & Spencer. My daughter is a fashionista. This was really strange. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) more amazing, she suddenly remarked enthusiastically: “There are so many things here I would like to have.” \nIf my supercritical daughter thinks M&S is finally getting its fashion right, I reckoned there might be something in it. \nWe have been waiting for a revival in M&S clothing almost as long as we have been waiting for England to win the World Cup again. Can it be here at last? \nBefore dear old M&S gets too pleased, I should add that my daughter thinks the clothes are badly arranged on the shop floor and that the window displays are poor. But her unexpected approval of the clothes had me hurrying home to look at the shares. \nI find that over the past five years the performance has been humdrum but over the past 12 months it has outdone both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. \nBrokers are forecasting a modest rise in profits in the current financial year, followed by a 9.5pc jump after that. At 505p earlier this week, the shares stand at 13.1 times consensus forecast earnings for the year to March 2017, which isn’t particularly cheap. But the forecast dividend yield for that year at 4.1pc is very satisfactory and, if my daughter is right, the profits may be better than most brokers are forecasting. \nAnyway, I have bought a stake at 504p. I don’t hold out hopes of a major gain but the risk does not seem great either. \n= Stockbroker blues = \nMeanwhile, I am having to change my stockbroker again. Eighteen months ago I moved most of my business from Brewin Dolphin (LSE: BRW.L - news ) when it raised its fees and declined to give a concessionary rate to people like me who buy and sell frequently. I was very sorry to make the change. \nSince then, I have done most of my dealing through Stocktrade, which has been perfectly satisfactory for a low-cost broker. \nBut now Alliance Trust Savings has bought Stocktrade and belatedly I woke up to the fact that I would no longer be talking to the same people and Alliance Trust would not let me continue owning six of my holdings: the ones in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore plus my units in an investment fund, PXP Vietnam Emerging Equity. \nI either had to find a new broker or sell all of them. \nSo I have been scrabbling around to find a broker that will deal in most foreign markets and not charge too much to a frequent dealer. \nI intend to go for AJ Bell, which is low-cost except for a foreign exchange commission on overseas deals. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was founded only 20 years ago and now administers £26bn of assets. So it has done well. I just hope no big company takes it over and reduces the services it offers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:30:42.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
