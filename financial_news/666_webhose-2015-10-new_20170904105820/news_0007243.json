ADVERTISEMENT Sponsored by Reps. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), the legislation would extend the budget cycle from one year to two — a move supporters say would preclude annual spending fights and free Congress to focus more attention on other pressing issues.\n“We're facing budget crisis after budget crisis and by adopting this bill we would able to avoid stress and uncertainty, not only for our government, but for the American people who expect us to do our jobs,” Schrader said. \nThe biennial budget concept has gained steam in recent cycles as partisanship has become more entrenched and spending fights have sucked much of the oxygen from Capitol Hill. \nIn 2013, an impasse over the fate of President Obama's healthcare reform law caused the government to close for 16 days. And earlier this year, a fight over Obama's immigration policies shuttered the Homeland Security Department for a short time. \nWednesday's passage of a continuing resolution prevented a shutdown on Thursday. But funding expires again in mid-December, setting the stage for another end-of-the-year face-off over the size and reach of the federal government. \nBackers of the Ribble-Schrader bill are hoping to eliminate –– or at least reduce –– those shutdown threats for the sake of the nation's economy and congressional efficiency. \n“America is a tremendous economic engine, and our federal budget needs consistency, reliability, and thorough oversight to function efficiently,” Ribble said. \nThe issue cuts across ideological lines, with supporters of the bill ranging from conservative lawmakers like Reps. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a Tea Party favorite, and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the conservative chairman of the Budget Committee, to liberals like Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), both members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \nOn Wednesday, four more lawmakers endorsed the bill –– Reps. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.), Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.) and Fred Upton (R-Mich.) –– bringing the number of co-sponsors to 221. \nIn the upper chamber, Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) have introduced similar legislation. That bill currently has the backing of 25 cosponsors. \n1 day Carson: Blacks have 'been... \"One of the biggest things threatening our nation right now is... Powell: I stay Republican 'because...
