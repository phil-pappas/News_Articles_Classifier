Philip Gostelow Share on twitter by Tess Ingram The resources downturn has cost thousands of jobs and more are expected to be shed in the next 18 months as the last of the major projects transition into production.\nBut as commentators begin to speculate whether the beleaguered industry might be nearing its bottom, a small ray of sunshine has pierced the gloom and it's shining on engineers.\nThe Mining and Resources Job Index, a closely watched barometer of the sector prepared by DFP Recruitment Services, found that advertised job vacancies in engineering rose in September, for the first time since October 2014.\nEngineers are widely recognised as one of the groups hit hardest by the industry's change in fortunes. Prior to September, engineering vacancies had fallen 60 per cent in 21 months.\nIt's early days, but Engineers Australia West Australian division president Francis Norman said anecdotal evidence suggested \"the trend is starting to turn\".\n\"The [resources] industry has decreased in size to the point now where there are about as many people in the workforce as there is work for them so we are now starting to see opportunities come up as new projects, albeit smaller, have an impact on base line numbers.\"\nAfter a volatile year, recent stability in commodity prices has given some analysts confidence the worst is behind them. In research last month, global Citi analysts concluded, \"there is a strong possibility that recent lows were the lows for the cycle\".\nWestoz Funds Management executive director Dermot Woods said when you considered commodities in Australian dollar prices, most were \"pretty close\" to the bottom.\n \"I think it's fair to say in most of the commodity baskets we are bumping along the bottom,\" he said. \"How long we are here for really depends on the demand side of the equation now.\"\nPDC Group engineering strategy and innovation director Mark Azzopardi agreed conditions had stabilised and said the company had recently hired a number of engineers.\n\"We really have noticed it is a buyers market out there in terms of being able to pick the engineers that are most capable,\" Mr Azzopardi said.\n\"They attracted me from iron ore and I work with colleagues that have come from some of the big firms in town and they managed to attract those guys as well.\"\nIt is welcome news for Eloise Green who, after six years of study, is just weeks away from graduating as a chemical process engineer.\n\"When I first started we were told 'be an engineer you will get a job no worries' and it wasn't really until my fifth year that everyone started to say job prospects were tough, which is a big turn around,\" she said.\nMr Norman, who worked in resources engineering for more than 30 years, said a turnaround was critical as the country risked losing disillusioned engineers to other professions and countries.\nLast month, the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM) published a survey of its members which found the unemployment rate for minerals professionals based in Australia was 16.2 per cent, almost three times the national average.\nABS data released on Thursday revealed Australia's unemployment rate held at 6.2 per cent for a second month.\n\"It's probably been the worst cycle I have seen in the last 12 or 14 years here in Australia,\" Mr Norman said.\n\"I think companies have done the natural thing and cut back as far as possible and I am confident that it will start to rebuild but it will be far, far smaller in scale.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:02:06.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
