The lightning bolt indicates it is an Instant Article. When you tap the story, it will load 10 times faster than a standard mobile web article, the company said in a statement. \n\"Instant Articles not only connect readers to stories faster; they also provide a richer reading experience than standard mobile web articles, with dynamic features that make the content more fluid, interactive and immersive,\" Facebook product manager Michael Reckhow said. \nUsers will be able to see Instant Articles from NBC News, The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, The New York Times and National Geographic among others. \nIf you happen to be Android user, you will have to wait a bit to get Instant Articles. The feature for Android will be launched later this year, with a public beta available this week itself, according to the company. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:40:56.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
