REUTERS/Kham By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Henning Gloystein\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Friday as fighting in Syria intensified, but remained on course to end the week largely unchanged as a hurricane was seen as less likely to affect U.S. oil facilities.\nHurricane Joaquin, which on Thursday had prompted fears of storm damage to U.S. East Coast oil installations, was downgraded and is now seen as less likely to pose a major threat, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\nStill, U.S. crude (CLc1) was 85 cents higher at $45.59 barrel by 0200 EDT, after settling 35 cents lower in the previous session.\nU.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) first rallied then slipped on Thursday to end a volatile session flat at $1.3668 a gallon.\nGlobal benchmark Brent (LCOc1) was 67 cents higher at $48.36 a barrel. The contract had closed the previous session down 68 cents.\nTraders said liquidity was low during Asian trading hours due to China's National Holiday which lasts until Oct. 7, but that the active dealers were pricing in a political risk premium into oil markets over Syria, where Russia and the United States are carrying on bombing campaigns. \nThe situation was complicated by the arrival of hundreds of Iranian troops in Syria to join a major ground offensive in support of government troops, a sign the civil war is turning still more regional and global in scope.\nU.S. crude production unexpectedly rose last week despite a drop in active drilling rigs. \n\"Fundamentals remain weak,\" analysts at ANZ said in a note to clients. \n\"We continue to see weaker fundamentals drive crude oil prices lower in the short term.\"\nAsian stocks edged up on Friday and looked likely to end the week with tiny gains, although the outlook remained grim, while the dollar crept higher. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBMI Research, a subsidiary of rating agency Fitch, said that although it expected a short-term price rise in crude due to a dip in U.S. production over the coming months, the longer-term outlook remained weak.\n\"Any price recovery though will be short-lived as the pipeline of major projects coming online globally, high stock levels and new Iranian supply will pressure Brent prices over 2016,\" BMI said.\n\n(Editing by Joseph Radford and Gopakumar Warrier)\nCommodity Markets Syria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:31:43.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
