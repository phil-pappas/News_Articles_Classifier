Apple has also recently introduced its first big Apple Watch operating system update that, supposedly, lets apps run faster. Is it time to buy? Especially since there's a flood of financially oriented Apple Watch apps, from Citi, Redfin, Mint, brokerages others. Should you hop aboard (or maybe try to persuade a loving relative how to remember you at the holidays)? Below we hear from fanboys and antagonists. Phoenix personal injury lawyer James Goodnow squarely counts himself in the ardent fan court, in large measure, because the Apple Watch can silently deliver alerts and updates. His law firm even has a code where if ten silent taps are sent to a Watch that means SOS, all hands on deck. But the beauty of the Watch, said Goodnow, is a steady stream of info tumbles in and there’s no noise to raise the ire of a judge (some of whom cite lawyers for contempt over a ringing phone). Goodnow said he likes Apple Watches so much his firm has equipped four clients with them in a pilot program. “I can stay aware of what’s happening without checking my phone every minute,” he said. Lance Vaughn, CEO at mobile app developer CabForward, joined in singing Apple Watch’s praises: \"I haven't worn a watch in probably 20 years, but my Apple Watch has become a downright necessity for my very busy worklife. I don't wear it on weekends, though, so one could make the argument that unless your career has you juggling a lot of tasks and incoming messages and reminders, the Apple Watch may in fact be nothing more than a fashion statement.” Don’t immediately rush out and throw lots of money at an Apple clerk, however. Tom Coughlin, IEEE senior member, offered caution. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:21.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
