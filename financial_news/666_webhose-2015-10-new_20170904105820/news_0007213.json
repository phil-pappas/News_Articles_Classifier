Turkey is being drawn into the conflict playing out in its neighbour, Syria. AP Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said a gathering of G20 leaders should still go ahead in Turkey next month despite \"depraved\" twin suicide bombings.\nAt least 95 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the blasts which ripped through a pro-Kurdish peace rally in Ankara, tjhe Turkish captial.\nThe G20 meeting is scheduled to take place in the south-western city of Antalya starting on November 15. \"We should not allow terrorist attacks to deter world leaders from carrying out very important global work,\" Ms Bishop said.\nThe explosions brought Turkey's political and ethnic tensions, exacerbated by the civil war in neighbouring Syria, to a grim new level.\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the deadliest terror attacks in Turkey's recent history though suspicion quickly turned to Islamic State. The blasts targeted a gathering before a \"peace and democracy\" march called to urge an end to violence between the government and Kurdish militants.\nThe carnage in Ankara came as US- allied Kurdish forces affiliated with the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, were preparing to advance toward Islamic State's self-declared capital of Raqqa in Syria, according to Nihat Ali Ozcan, an analyst of the Kurdish conflict at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara.\n\"Daesh struck at the PKK in Ankara before a Kurdish offensive on Raqqa,\" Ozcan said by phone, using an alternative name for Islamic State. \"Turkey has become the battleground in a growing war between the PKK and Daesh.\"\nThe attacks follow a July 20 bombing in the town of Suruc that was linked to Syria's civil war and blamed on a suicide bomber with ties to Islamic State. Fighting on Turkey's border is pitting Kurds that Turkey views as terrorists against Islamic radicals it also views as enemies. The Suruc bombing killed dozens of activists rallying support for Kobani, a Kurdish border town in Syria.\n Currency Declines The increased violence and political uncertainty has battered markets while raising fears that Turkey is being increasingly dragged into the civil war in Syria. Turkey's lira has lost 15 percent of its value against the US dollar this year, and yields on government debt are up by almost 300 basis points.\nIn an interview with ATV on Friday, Interim Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said any rebel truce was a stunt, and operations against the PKK would continue until the group, classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and European Union, laid down its weapons.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on state television that the Ankara blasts were aimed at destabilizing the election campaign in Turkey, and called for efforts to join in the fight against terrorists. Putin met Saturday with his security council in Sochi, site of the Russian Grand Prix auto race, to discuss Syria, terrorism and the attacks, according to the Kremlin website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:18:05.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
