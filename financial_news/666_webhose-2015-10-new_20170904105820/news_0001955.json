Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith A visit to Hong Kong for Chanticleer is often accompanied by a string of requests from friends living in the former British colony for Australian products. Milk powder, which has become hugely expensive and in short supply because of demand from mainland Chinese visitors to the territory, tops the wish list.\nBut anything fresh, from mangos to beef and dairy products, is also in demand.\nThe fact there is a list like this at all from people living in a well-heeled international city is anecdotal evidence of the surge in demand by the rising Chinese middle classes for reliable and safe consumables.\nHong Kong has been inundated with waves of visitors from the mainland, who were buying so much milk powder that a limit of two cans was imposed several years ago.\nIllustration: David Rowe The demand story from Chinese consumers hungry for agricultural products is well documented . But exactly how Australia is going to tap that demand is less clear.\nSo far, Australia's success in the race to sell food to China has lagged New Zealand's but economists, politicians, bankers and the companies trying to sell into Asia say they are optimistic about the opportunities. The issue is receiving more attention now with the resources sector in decline and a realisation that assistance for other sectors is urgent.\nLatest trade delegation Behind the scenes, efforts are under way by politicians and senior Australian business figures to step up efforts to sell Australian produce in China. A group of investors and bankers will accompany politicians on the country's latest trade delegation to China in November.\n Next week, ANZ economists will publish new data that predicts Chinese food demand will rise by at least 50 per cent over the next five years. This is 10 per cent average growth year on year, outstripping forecasts for overall economic growth of 6.5 per cent.\nDespite fears about Chinese's economic slowdown amid the country's transition to a consumer-led economy, the long-term demand for fresh, safe and reliable food products will remain strong.\nBut we have been hearing this for a while, and the real question is how governments and businesses are going to exploit the opportunities in China as they compete with other countries like the United States, Brazil and European nations for a slice of the action.\nOpportunities from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was in the final stages of negotiations on Monday, are important but will not generate opportunities on their own.\nAustralian entrepreneurs and executives in the food industry say while ChAFTA will give Australia an advantage against other aggressive competitors such as the European Union and South America, private companies need to increase their presence on the ground to make a difference.\n\"To date we are only making token attempts. Turning up with a stand at Fruit Logistica and HoFex and equivalent trade fairs can only do so much if companies don't deeply understand the market, the distribution networks, the trade,\" says David Meredith, a partner in Tas'Mania, a company launched three years ago that sells fresh produce from Tasmania to consumers and restaurants in Hong Kong.\nPresence on the ground \"To succeed we need industry and private enterprise to commit to investment in having a presence on the ground â€“ offices and people with deep experience and knowledge of China and with local languages and strategies. Until then we are playing on the periphery and will miss the opportunity.\"\nFears about missing the China opportunity have driven businessmen like Fortescue Metals founder Andrew Forrest to try to tackle the issue with initiatives like the Australia Sino Hundred Year Agricultural and Food Safety Partnership.\nAustralian companies need all the help they can get, given Australia's high costs and the dominance of supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths, which have made it tougher for local food companies to prioritise expanding offshore when they are under pressure competing at home.\nMac El-Omari, a Hong Kong-based investment banker who has advised the Business Council of Australia (BCA) on the issue, is a big fan of Forrest's initiative because of the hurdles facing individual companies trying to break into the region.\n\"The Australian consumer companies face a great deal of challenges, given the dominance of the retailers, the intense local competition, and the high labour and input cost,\" says El-Omari, who is JPMorgan's managing director, head of agriculture, consumer, retail and real estate investment banking for Asia Pacific.\n\"New Zealand has done a much better job in plugging themselves into China.\n\"Now we are seeing a very strong push from the government and the entrepreneurs to plug themselves into China.\"\nNo guarantees But he notes there are no guarantees Australian products will do well in China, despite the country's unique brand and reliability as a source for healthy food.\nGetting the branding right and negotiating deals, particularly with Chinese state-owned enterprises that deliver attractive returns, is difficult.\n\"You cannot assume an Australian product will automatically sell in China. You need to communicate it differently and sell it differently,\" he says.\n\"You have to start small. Start small and think big and then move fast and be very nimble. If you follow those rules you can do well in China.\"\nWhile the growing Western influence on Chinese eating habits is obvious in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, there is still often a misunderstanding about what Chinese consumers want. Beef, for example, is often boiled rather than barbecued and served as a steak in a country where people eat with chopsticks instead of knives.\nBankers say the real value will come from high-quality premium products, such as quality wine or breeding cattle from Australia for sale in China, where there is not the land and resources to do it themselves.\nAustralian companies have also been frustrated by the low return on capital offered by state-owned Chinese firms for some food distribution deals. Companies still need incentives such as profit-sharing deals to invest in the market.\nNew breed El-Omari says e-commerce and a new breed of Western-educated Chinese private equity players will be the connection between China and the rest of the world.\n\"They understand both worlds. With the backing of some of the government entities that could be a great way to incubate foreign companies and slowly put the two together over a period of time,\" he says.\nANZ's economist for greater China Li-Gang Liu, who was in Beijing two weeks ago to talk to a New Zealand meat delegation, says there are lessons for Australia from across the Tasman.\n\"The New Zealand government has been very pro-active in fully exploring this free-trade agreement. This is something Australia could also look into, especially at the beginning of the FTA to see if the government can facilitate Australian agri-goods into China.\"\nThis is important for ironing out problems when local governments in China resist efforts by the central government to implement rules around tariffs and other issues.\nOutbound exports are not the only potential source of wealth-generation for the Australian agriculture sector. There has been a wave of deals over the past two months of Chinese investors snapping up Australian rural properties. There are estimates of more than $1 billion of deals in play.\nPledge to invest Chinese bidders are reported to be looking at Australia's largest landholder, S. Kidman & Co, which owns cattle stations , including some in the sensitive Woomera rocket range. New Hope Group has pledged to invest $500 million in Australian agriculture over the next three years.\nIn-bound takeovers are also likely, although there are few listed Australian food manufacturers and beverage companies left on the market.\nSingapore-based oils company Wilmar International and Hong Kong-based investment company First Pacific, which owns half of Indonesian noodle and snack food maker Indofood, acquired Goodman Fielder for $1.3 billion in 2014 . There are plans to take some of Goodman's brands into Asia, but that deal was complicated and suffered long delays while waiting for Chinese regulatory approvals.\nGoodman is yet to pay a dividend for its new owners but there are expectations it will eventually be floated again in coming years, once its starts delivering returns.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR\nTony Boyd is on leave", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:08:53.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
