Verano sales fell 27% through the first nine months of 2016 from a year earlier. Sonic sales have fallen 35% in the same period.\nLast June, the company said it would invest $245 million and hire 300 people at Orion Assembly to build the new Chevrolet Bolt electric car beginning next year, and an unnamed future model.\n\"Orion Assembly is a breeding ground for manufacturing innovation,\" Cathy Clegg, GM vice president of North America manufacturing and labor relations said at the time. \"It serves as a model for how to engage the entire workforce at all levels to achieve success.\"\nMost of the 500 workers laid off at the Orion plant will have the opportunity to move to GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant where the automaker said Thursday it will add a second shift as it ramps up production of the second-generation Chevrolet Volt, the Cadillac CT6 and possibly the Buick LaCrosse sometime next year.\n\"We are confident we will be able to make transfer offers to Detroit-Hamtramck or other GM locations for the vast majority of those who are affected by the shift reduction,\" the company said in a statement.\nUnder a special agreement with the UAW, GM was able to run the Orion Township plant with up to 40% of the work force filled with lower-paid workers.\nThe moves at the two assembly plants come as the UAW moves to negotiate a new labor agreement with GM after workers at Fiat Chrysler ratified their contract earlier this week.\nThe union represents about 52,700 hourly workers at GM plants throughout the U.S.\n3 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LSfpeA TOP VIDEOS Martin Shkreli's $750 AIDS drug undercut by $ 00:48 Wild socks launch this start-up's business 02:05 McDonald's breaks two-year sales low at US locations in third quarter 00:42 What to watch Friday: Will Royal Caribbean cruise beat estimates? 01:30 Here's how much a pair of Back to the Future kicks cost 01:07 The ten most profitable companies in the world 02:05 Don't fall victim to these grocery store gimmicks 01:29 Tech Five: Shares of Twitter, Yahoo slammed 00:36 Turn any car into a smart car 02:12 Americans spend HOW much on Halloween candy?!? 00:58 Smaller bonuses for Wall Street 01:47 This DeLorean is in pristine condition 01:01 Ferrari's $9.8B Valuation: How Investors Are Reacting 02:25 Cuba open to \"all type of businesses\" with US oil companies 00:58 Western digital is dropping $19B to acquire SanDisk 01:00 Uber - no plans to file for IPO soon 00:44 EU: Starbucks, Fiat profited from illegal tax breaks 01:47 Subway agrees to start measuring bread to ensure 12-inch footlongs 01:07 Ferrari is off to the races, to start trading on NYSE today 01:54 'Guitar Hero Live' lets you rock on stage 01:28 Apple lost millions of Music users when trial ended; 6.5M remain 01:05 Facebook will tell you when A government hacks your account 01:20 Yum plans to split its China business 01:03 IBM falls short in revenue estimates, cuts profit forecast 01:42 MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:33:09.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
