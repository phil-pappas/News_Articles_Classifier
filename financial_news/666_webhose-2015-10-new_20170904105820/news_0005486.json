Photo: Andrew Meares\nPeter Martin: Turnbull fixes mistakes of the past Credit card surcharges targeted Financial system set for major overhaul It's going to take a year, but the federal government has just promised to adopt the best recommendation to come out of the Murray financial system inquiry – good ol' No. 9: \"Seek broad political agreement for and enshrine in legislation, the objectives of the superannuation system and report publicly on how policy proposals are consistent with achieving these objectives over the long term.\"\nWell, nearly. There's no mention of seeking broad political agreement, but the government's response to the inquiry does say: \"We will enshrine the objective of the superannuation system in legislation. This will help align policy settings, industry initiative and community expectations.\"\nThat's a start, an important start. To be of lasting value, the legislation will need the broad political agreement inquiry head David Murray suggested. And that means one difficult battle lies ahead in defining just what the objectives of the super system might be.\nAdvertisement A catch-all platitude like \"assist Australians' financial security in retirement\" won't be good enough. It doesn't mean anything more than \"drinking water when you're thirsty is nice\".\nThere needs to be some nitty-gritty in there about the balance of beneficially encouraging and enforcing saving on one hand with the cost to the commonwealth on the other. The objectives need to be clear enough to increase confidence in the system by protecting it from political raids in future while also ending its present status as the world's best tax haven for the wealthy.\nThere's plenty of room there to excite and worry the army of lobbyists hanging off the financial services industry. There are already a great many vested interests to protect and further.\nThus the legislation will be a tricky balancing act. That's why the government is allowing itself a full year to come up with the words, promising to deliver the legislation by the end of 2016.\nHmmm, there's a federal election in that time frame.\nThe hope must be that the Turnbull administration has already shown itself to be open to consultation. It's yet to be seen exactly how open the relevant ministers, Scott Morrison and Kelly O'Dwyer, are. Or how doctrinaire they might be.\nThat might be discovered by what compromise O'Dwyer might be open to over predecessor Josh Frydenberg's industry fund governance changes .\nThe government's response to the Murray inquiry pushes the existing legislation for improving governance. Improving governance is indeed a good thing - like water when you're thirsty, again. It's how and what other outcomes follow that decides whether the legislation is driven by dodgy ideology and well-connected lobbyists.\nToday's response says in part: \"There is scope to improve the performance of the superannuation system in a number of areas. The system is fragmented, costly, complex and suffers from a lack of member engagement ... In the retirement phase, the development of new income stream products can better protect retirees from longevity and other risks.\n\"Governance can be improved and conflicts of interests can be better managed ... We will implement a number of changes which build on existing commitments to boost efficiency and competition.\n\"We will immediately task the Productivity Commission to develop and release criteria to assess the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system.\n\"Subsequent to the development of criteria and following the full implementation of the MySuper reforms, we will task the Productivity Commission to review the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system.\"\nWhich all sounds pretty good. Now define it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:41:18.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
