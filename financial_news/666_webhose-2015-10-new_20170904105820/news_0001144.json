On a sector basis, the stronger performers were industrials (+3.6%) and utilities (+1.8%), which each recorded modest gains.\nActive managers also proved their worth by outperforming the index by 1.3 per cent over the quarter and 2.2 per cent over 12 months, which Clare Armstrong, a principal in Mercer's manager research team, attributes partly to the avoidance of weaker sectors and the banks.\n\"Obviously the materials and energy sectors have been the biggest negative contributors to the market performance, so performing managers are very selective there,\" she said.\nThe top five Australian share managers over the year to September 2015 each beat the index by more than 15 per cent. They were Bennelong Concentrated Equities fund (22.4 per cent), Tribeca Alpha Plus Fund (20 per cent), Martin Currie Australian Real Income (19.1 per cent), Macquarie Alpha Opportunities (16.8 per cent) and Smallco Broadcap Fund (16.6 per cent).\n\"A lot of high-conviction managers also have strong views that led them away from the biggest banks, so the investors that tend to crowd the banks are the yield-seeking investors or individual investors,\" Ms Armstrong said.\n\"A lot of active managers are underweight the banking sector or very selective within the names they will hold and that's been a big contributor to their performance over the quarter and the year.\"\n Bennelong's chief investment officer Mark East said his approach was to avoid companies vulnerable to macro trends.\n\"It's an environment in which one needs to be selective and our focus is on those quality companies that are in control of their own destiny, rather than those dependent on external economic and other forces for their growth,\" he said.\nStrategies that could cash in on the volatility, including long/short positions, offered the best performance when viewed on a quarterly and yearly basis, Ms Armstrong said.\nTargeted volatility strategies outperformed the index by 5.2 per cent over the quarter, the survey shows.\nHowever, over the longer term long/short strategies were the clear winners, outperforming the index by 3.2 per cent and 2.7 per cent over three and five years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:03:22.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
