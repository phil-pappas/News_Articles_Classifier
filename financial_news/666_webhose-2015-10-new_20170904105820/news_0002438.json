Deputy Minister of Petroleum, GhanaColleague MinistersCaptains of the Mining and Oil and Gas IndustryOfficials from Government Departments and AgenciesDistinguished Invited Ladies and Gentlemen We set off on a journey 3 days ago, ECOMOF 2015. Our destination was to bring together the President and Commissioner from ECOWAS, Ministers, senior officials and other representatives of the 15 ECOWAS countries responsible for the Mining, Oil and Gas sectors, and also other stakeholders with the aim of:• Information sharing;• Promoting good-practice lesson-learning from other countries/stakeholders in terms of policies; legislations; standards, structures, frameworks, technologies, initiatives, etc.; and• Promoting enhanced interaction and establishing of linkages among the stakeholdersto thereby facilitate the “Valorisation of West Africa’s Mineral and Petroleum Resources through Regional Cooperation.” Fourteen (14) of the fifteen (15) states from the sub-region were represented at the Forum, with a total participation of some 400. Twenty (20) sessions were held. In addition to the knowledge sharing from the respective country presentations some of the key focal topics discussed included: Integrative Approaches to Development, Local Content, Human Resource Development, Artisanal and Small Scale Mining, and Good Governance, with some of the key take away lessons being the strong need to:• Improve governance of the sector, including removing bottlenecks within licencing regimes while improving transparency and accountability in the extractive sectors;• Collaborate among stakeholders to achieve win-win outcomes; and• Ensure that extractive resources feed into the broad-based industrialization development agenda with strong links to local economies and thereby transforming natural capital into longer term produced capital. Did we achieve our goals?Yes, we had some hiccups: attendance at, punctuality to and timeliness of quite a number of sessions could have been better, and some resource persons/facilitators cancelled their participation at the last minute.But certainly there were measurable achievements, notably:-• Interaction;• Lesson learning and• Networkingall in a bid to facilitate collaboration and/or harmonization of the environment for Mining, Oil and Gas. We need to, as soon as possible, identify the teething problems of this maiden edition of the Forum and their causes, so as to minimize, if not eliminate, them at subsequent forums. At this juncture, let me commend the ECOWAS Commission for bringing the Forum to life. The Organizer – AME Trade – congratulations. My kudos to the members of the Local Organizing Committee for your hard work, interfacing with the other stakeholders, to pull this off. To our mother, the Africa Union, we say thank you for your support. We could not have done this successfully without the support of partners like private sector mining and oil and gas operators as well as CSOs, NGOs, multilateral agencies.To all who sponsored and/or supported various aspects of the Forum, we are very grateful and assure you that your names would be carved in the foundations of ECOMOF. Thank you. But this is just the beginning. As H.E. the President of Ghana stated in his Keynote Address at the opening of the Forum, “… the ECOMOF initiative has come to stay. After this pioneering event, I trust that those who did not get involved would have learnt the lesson that it is a laudable forum … and would therefore partner ECOWAS and our respective host governments to sustain the initiative.” As we draw down the curtain on the Forum, I wish you a safe return to your places of abode and hope that we will meet again in the not too distance future, in pursuit of our common agenda of sustainable development for the good of our peoples, through the exploitation of our extractive resources. God bless you all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:12:09.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
