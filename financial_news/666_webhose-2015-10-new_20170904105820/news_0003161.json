Andrew Ellinghausen For example, the first demand was to change the Migration Act to mandate local labour market testing before low-skilled workers could be imported for large projects under 457 visas. There would be no specific mention of China so as not to offend Beijing.\nInstead, the change will be enacted by regulation, rather than legislation, but this makes no material difference in that it will be as binding as legislation.\nThe regulation will also apply to all work agreements, not just the large projects in the ChAFTA known as Investment Facilitation Agreements which apply to projects worth $150 million or more.\nLabor's second demand was that the base rate of pay for 457 visa workers, which the Abbott government froze, be increased from about $54,000 a year to $57,000 and indexed thereafter.\n Instead, the government has agreed that all 457 workers must be paid the market salary for the job they are doing, or, if it is higher, that the salary reflected in relevant enterprise agreement.\nThe government will, however, review lifting the minimum 457 wage.\nLabor's third demand was that skilled workers such as nurses, engineers, electricians, plumbers, welders and carpenters would have 60 days to meet the necessary licence requirements in Australia or have their 457 visa revoked. This deadline has been extended to 90 days under the deal with the government.\nLabor was unable to enforce labour market testing before skilled workers were brought in because that would require a change to the actual agreement which the government would not do, claiming the Chinese would walk away from the deal.\nA letter from Mr Robb to Senator Wong, obtained by the AFR shows the government ready to do a deal.\nSenator Wong conceded Labor did ot get all it wanted.\nThe union movement has vowed to keep campaigning against the deal, believing the negotiated safeguards do not go far enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:10:18.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
