Part of our curriculum is based upon Stedman’s guiding Nine-Step principles.”\n“Stedman Graham has made it his mission to bring identity development programs to people and organizations across our country helping them strengthen who they are based on their interests, natural abilities, talents and passions,” said Wilkie. “His inspirational messages and practical guide to discovering their personal brand has helped thousands of students prepare for meaningful jobs.”\n“I am honored to receive this prestigious award from jobs4america and what it represents for the future of our nation’s young people,” said Graham. “ “Too many of us spend years trying to find out who we are, and, sadly, many of us never do. If we fail to define ourselves, we risk letting others define us by our race, gender and background. We buy into the labels that keep us in a box and, as a result of those limitations, never reach or realize our greatest potential. Through workforce training and economic development programs offered through jobs4america we can provide education, hope, jobs and career development for people as they work toward their personal goals.”\nThe “Spirit of America” award has been presented in the past to Nebraska Congressman Lee Terry; Missouri Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II; Michigan Governor Rick Snyder; Michigan Economic Development Corporation President Michael Finney; and Dialog Direct CEO Douglas Kearney.\n # # #\nAbout jobs4america: Founded in 2012, jobs4america is a non-profit and non-partisan coalition of forward-looking business and community leaders committed to creating jobs in America.
