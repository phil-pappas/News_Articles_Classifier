This approval will enable the company to capture a substantial share of the LAI (long-acting injectable) atypical antipsychotics market for schizophrenia.\nThe above graph shows that, after the FDA’s approval of Aristada for use in schizophrenia patients, Alkermes’s share price rose by about 2.5%. The LAI atypical antipsychotic class of drugs is increasingly capturing the mental health market because there is increasing pharmacoeconomic data that supports the efficacy of the drug class.\nThere has also been an increasing awareness that early intervention with LAI drugs can help reduce relapses in schizophrenia patients. Hence, Aristada is expected to benefit from strong sub-industry dynamics as well as from superior drug characteristics.\nMuted investor response Despite the favorable long-term market dynamics, the news of Aristada’s approval, as reflected by Alkermes’s share price, received a muted response from investors. This could be attributed to the presence of strong competition from other schizophrenia drugs like Otsuka and Lundbeck’s Abilify Maintena, Novartis AG’s (NVS) Clozaril, Merck’s (MRK) Saphris, and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Invega Sustenna (through its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals).\nCompared to Abilify Maintena, Aristada’s label also requires one additional oral Aripiprazole dose during the initiation of therapy. Also, Invega Sustenna has been approved as a once-in-three months drug for schizophrenia—higher than the approved dosage interval of Aristada. These factors could make Aristada less attractive to the patient and physician community.\nIn addition to drug- and company-specific factors, Aristada’s approval has coincided with an overall low sentiment for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in the US. The debate related to high drug prices in the US has been one of the major factors responsible for dampening investor sentiments toward the healthcare industry.\nYou can get exposure to Alkermes’s new LAI atypical antipsychotic drug, Aristada, while avoiding excessive company-specific risks by investing in the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT). Alkermes accounts for 3.68% of FBT’s total holdings.\nCorrection: This post originally claimed that Abilify Maintena belonged to Bristol-Myers Squibb. We have since revised to indicate that it belongs to Otsuka and Lundbeck.
