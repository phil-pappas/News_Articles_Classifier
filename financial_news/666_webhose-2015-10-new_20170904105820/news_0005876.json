Appeals not only help physicians recoup money, but they can also divert auditors from honing in on problematic claims. If a practice can’t show that it’s made an effort to appeal denied claims, it will appear as though physician and their staff are not aware of potential compliance issues, in front of an auditor.\nIt’s a fact that many denials, in fact, are NOT valid? Whether they’re due to a simple typo on a claim or a payer’s oversight, practices have the right to knock on carrier or intermediary’s door and argue their case. Fortunately, recouping the denied payment is really quite simple — if one is aware of the ins and outs of the appeals process.\nHow does a practice improve its appeal process?\nThe majority of practices don’t have the resources to appeal every denied claim, which makes it crucial to device an appeal strategy that ensures ROI. Practices should take into consideration the amount and type of payer for each denied claims. It’s also vital to categorize each denial by type/reason, as this will help practice’s identify patterns and also streamline the appeal process.\nA strong appeal letter can make or break a deal. Practices can always use a typical template letter for some types of denials. However, for denials like medical necessity, a customized appeal letter certainly packs in more punch, as it explains clearly the type of services rendered and the date of service, in order for payers to be able to process the information. Also, practices should Quote: the industry or CMS guidelines in the appeal letter where ever required.\nTo give more in-depth insights on appeal process and how it works, expert speaker Barbara Cobuzzi, MBA, CPC, COC , CPC-P, CPC-I , CPCO, CENTC, an AAPC-approved ICD-10-CM instructor, will present an audio session on each step of this effective — and often underused — method for securing practice or facility’s rightful reimbursements on behalf of AudioEducator.\nThe conference will cover the following topics:\nCoding vs. reimbursement: Why correct coding does not always assure proper reimbursement Review of the elements that effect reimbursement Learn how the appeals process works Find out where the biggest appeals opportunities lie.
