This allows measurement of the return on investment or increases in sales based on money spent on advertising. \nThe association said some publishers have implemented similar programs with \"uniformly positive results (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:40:16.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
