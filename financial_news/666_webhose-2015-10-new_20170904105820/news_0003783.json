Coles is well and truly in the lead as it steals market share from strategically challenged Woolworths, boosted by the perception that its prices are cheaper.\nGerman discounter Aldi is also snapping at the heels of the two dominant supermarket chains, although this is a threat that Wesfarmers-owned Coles has managed to contain for now.\nWesfarmers, the Perth-based retail and industrials conglomerate that owns Coles, Bunnings, Kmart, Target and some poorer-performing coal assets, delivered another set of strong sales figures on Thursday .\nThe comparable 3.6 per cent sales growth in its key food and liquor operations for the September quarter underscored the work being carried out by a focused management team under chief executive Richard Goyder at a time when its main rival Woolworths has lost its way. Total sales rose 4.7 per cent.\nThe comparable sales have seen a moderate slowdown from 4.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter.\nOne interesting angle to the latest sales data is the amount the supermarket giants are funnelling into lower grocery prices in order to stay competitive.Coles is reporting the steepest price deflation in two years, with prices down 1.3 per cent in the September quarter.\n$100 million investment This is largely due to the $100 million Coles has invested in grocery prices in the quarter, which is double the same period last year. Wesfarmers finance director Terry Bowen says it is hard to predict future investment as a lot of it hinges on commodity prices and efficiency gains, but estimates of a $400-million input into prices for the entire year are not wide off the mark.\n This stacks up against the $500 million Woolworths has earmarked to invest in lowering prices as it battles to reverse declining sales and quarantine Aldi.\nThere are a myriad of surveys and statistics on which supermarket chain has the best basket value, but Coles advantage is that it is perceived as being cheaper than its rival, something Woolworths wants to correct. Goyder says he will continue to invest to maintain the price position and that Coles' sales momentum finished the quarter stronger than when it started.\nColes has been waging a price war against Woolworths since Wesfarmers acquired the company in 2007. Its prices were higher back then, which is a reminder the competitive landscape is constantly changing. It is not game over for Woolworths. The rival just has a lot of work to do to catch up.\nGoyder says the strong results across Coles, Bunnings, Officeworks, Kmart and Target are a healthy sign for overall consumer sentiment, although he is too sensible to predict an upswing in business confidence on the back of a change in prime minister. Evidence of that will come later when companies start investing.\nGoyder did say he was hopeful of genuine reform in areas such as tax, productivity and retirement savings under a Turnbull government. He and the new prime minister discussed the issue at this month's AFL Grand Final and Goyder is confident the talk will translate into real action.\nWith hardware chain Bunnings and Officeworks firing on all cylinders, Kmart delivering a standout result, and Target on the road to recovery, Wesfarmers' industrials businesses led by coal are the conglomerate's weak point.\nBunnings reported 8.2 per cent comparable sales growth, which is further bad news for Woolworths-owned Masters hardware chain . Analysts have this week been crunching the numbers on a possible exit strategy for the $2.2 billion joint venture.\nWesfarmers expects Bunnings to remain resilient despite concerns about slowing housing markets but admits it will be hard to maintain 8 per cent comparable sales growth. Goyder says Bunnings still has a strong store rollout program but the percentage space increase will come off in the years ahead following a period of staggering growth.\nWesfarmers' industrials businesses are now the conglomerate's weak spot but Goyder was quick to reject one analysts' suggestion that coal could be the company's equivalent of Woolworth's Masters.\nGoyder says they remain strong businesses worth a lot of money but the days when Wesfarmers' industrials operations delivered $800 million in earnings are long behind it in the current depressed commodity price environment.\nRewards programs under review Loyalty is everything in the retail world and nothing gets consumers more excited than clocking up air miles. For some reason, the human psyche ranks airline frequent flyer points well above other rewards programs which means Qantas and Virgin can get away with charging high fees for banks, telcos and retailers to be signatories to their programs.\nThis means Woolworths cannot afford to take any decision to sever or water down its ties with Qantas' frequent flyer program lightly.\nWoolworths is expected to make an announcement on Sunday about its revamped Everyday Rewards program . It is no secret Woolworths has long been unhappy with the fees it pays Qantas so its shoppers can earn frequent flyer points when they spend money at Woolworths, BWS or Big W.\nBoth sides are playing hard-ball as the supermarket giant seeks to negotiate a new deal as part of a wider effort to cut costs and stem the market share losses from Coles and Aldi. That new arrangement had still not be finalised on Thursday.\nIt is a risky tactic. The airline is a notoriously tough negotiator and it could be argued that Woolworths needs Qantas more than Qantas needs Woolworths.\nWhile Woolworths is Qantas Loyalty's most important relationships, it is believed to make up a fraction of last financial year's $1.369 billion in billings.\nThere are estimates that the Qantas relationship generates up to $1 billion in revenue annually for Woolworths, although that is a figure the supermarket group would likely dispute.\nThe six-year-old arrangement allows Everyday Rewards members to earn one Qantas point for each dollar spent over $30 at its supermarkets and BWS bottle shops.\nThere are obvious savings from not having to pay fees to Qantas but this at the risk of driving away customers who shop at Woolworths for points. It is a point of difference for many shoppers, which is highlighted in the hundreds of comments made on Fairfax Media websites in response to the story on Thursday.\nWoolworths has been looking at the issue for awhile. As part of its supply chain overhaul initiated last year, it started looking at signing on new partners and shifting the focus away from Qantas to shopping vouchers.\nThe uncertainty around Qantas Loyalty is another issue dogging Woolworths as it flip-flops around on strategy as it searches for a new chief executive.\nQantas frequent flyer members can still earn points by paying for their groceries using branded credit cards with partner banks.\nIf the Woolworths relationship collapsed, it would not necessarily stop Qantas from signing future deals with rival supermarket groups such as Coles. Coles, however, this week signed a frequent flyer deal with rival carrier Etihad.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:02:16.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
