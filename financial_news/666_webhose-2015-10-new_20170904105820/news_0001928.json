This is one of them’ BJP a party of bluffers, says Raj Thackeray Social activist Anna Hazare today said the reservation system, which was required only for some time after Independence, pose a threat to the country “as political parties have got involved in it”.\n“The country faces a threat from the reservation system. Reservation was needed only for some time after Independence but now political parties have got involved in it,” Hazare told reporters here.\nHazare also advocated removal of poll symbols from ballot papers and EVMs as part poll reforms.\n“I urge the Election Commission to remove symbol (from ballot papers and EVMs) as this is not a Constitutional arrangement. I am starting this issue from Sikar,” he said.\n“Our fight is not with the government, but with the Election Commission. I am beginning it from Sikar,” Hazare said.\nAccusing both Congress and BJP of being involved in corruption, he said, “These parties can not eradicate corruption. The key for this is with voters.”\nBJP raised the issue of corruption before the Lok Sabha polls, but did not take initiatives to curb it after coming to power, he said, stressing that “50 per cent of corruption could be controlled by Lokpal Bill only”.\nThe social activist also targeted the political parties over the beef issue and asked why it was being raked up now.\n“Why did they not see beef in the last 68 years? This all is just politics,” he said.\n 10, 2015 8:34 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:10:47.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
