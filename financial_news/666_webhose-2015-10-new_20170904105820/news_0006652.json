House Sales Accelerate Despite Shortage By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News â€“ 9 minutes ago View Photo \n\nHouse sales rose at their fastest rate for 16 months in September, helping to limit price growth, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). \nThe organisation's monthly survey found that growth in the availability of mortgage finance contributed to the pick-up in sales, which have been hampered in recent months by a lack of properties on the market. \nThe RICS said the North, East Anglia and Scotland posted the sharpest rises in sales but the number of new instructions had fallen in 13 of the past 14 months. \nThis has been partly blamed on economic uncertainty and worries about affordability. \nSimon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at the RICS, said: \"Unless the stock being sold is replenished there is a limit to how sustainable this modest improvement in market turnover will prove to be. \n\"Unfortunately, the indications are that we are locked in a cycle where the lack of available properties on agents' books is itself deterring some potential vendors from thinking about putting their own property on the market.\" \nThe Prime Minister used his speech at the Conservative conference in Manchester on Wednesday to demand a \"national crusade to get homes built.\" \nDavid Cameron promised an overhaul of Whitehall and town hall planning rules which he says prevent house builders from offering low cost, affordable home ownership. \nBuilders have cited planning laws as a major obstacle to new housing but the industry has also pointed to a skills shortage - caused by an exodus of labour abroad in the wake of the financial crisis which badly damaged the construction sector. \nIn a separate report on Wednesday, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said plans to increase housebuilding and upgrade the railways were under threat from a \"critical\" lack of specialist labour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:56:20.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
