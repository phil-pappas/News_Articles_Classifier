Photo: Josh Robenstone\nIt's a long way from Cairo to the chief executive's office at ANZ Banking Group. But judging from his freshly minted Twitter account, it doesn't seem like CEO-elect Shayne Elliott has had too much time over the past week to reflect on his pathway to the top of Australia's fourth-largest bank.\nAfter a road trip through western Sydney and regional NSW branches in a white rented Corolla on Friday last week – the day after ANZ announced he would succeed Mike Smith on January 1 – Elliott travelled more than 400 kilometres on Monday, visiting five branches and two business centres in regional Victoria. On Tuesday, he tweeted a picture from a trusty Melbourne tram on his way to meet staff at branch at 55 Collins Street. That night, he jetted off to Hong Kong – but not before a quick selfie with the staff at the ANZ foreign exchange desk at Melbourne airport.\nThe impression that comes across on Twitter matches that of many insiders AFR Weekend has talked to. They describe Elliott, 51, as grounded, personable and a straight-shooter. As a manager, he is said to be inclusive and razor sharp with numbers (he's been CFO of ANZ since 2012), skills that will be needed as ANZ and the other banks steer into stronger regulatory headwinds.\n\"When you look at where ANZ is in terms of its development, we have gone through an enormous period of growth and investment, which has been great,\" Elliott tells AFR Weekend.\nAdvertisement \"But at some stage, it's time for a consolidation and more focus on driving returns from what we have already spent. Yes, there is going to be a shift towards driving returns. But that would have happened whether Mike was here or not. It is not about personality, it is where we are in the evolution of the bank.\"\nAs CEO, Elliott won't make headlines like feisty incumbent Smith did, who is bowing out after eight years in the job. He also seems unlikely to make dramatic changes to the bank's \"super regional\" strategy, which seeks to capitalise on growth markets in Asia.\nElliott has been described as an introvert, suggesting the strategy to hit the ANZ frontlines and publish his movements on social media over the past week is a deliberate attempt to humanise the new leader and show he has more to his skill-set than technical proficiency. But there are some investors who question whether being \"nice\" – or a \"safe pair of hands\" as Citi analysts described him – will be enough for Elliott to navigate banking's choppy waters.\nIs Elliott, who was plucked from near obscurity by Smith in 2009 to run ANZ's institutional bank, really a charismatic leader? Can he help erase the lingering question marks over ANZ's strategy in Asia? Will he boost ANZ's performance in Australia, especially in NSW where it has underperformed during Smith's tenure? How will he deal with the headwinds facing all Australian banks, including using capital more efficiently to maintain shareholder returns?\nHe might face a more pressing issue early in his tenure relating to his directorship at Malaysian bank AmBank, of which ANZ owns 24 per cent and which finds itself in an alleged bribery scandal involving the country's Prime Minister. It's a potential distraction but at least Elliott has plenty of international experience on which to draw as he navigates this and other mounting challenges facing ANZ.\nWhen Elliott joined the executive suite at Cairo-based EFG Hermes in 2006, the largest investment bank in the Middle East, he had already come a long way from Te Atatu, an aspirational area in the the western suburbs of Auckland. The son of a builder and a secretary, Elliott attended Waitakere College, a public school which has produced long list of New Zealand sports stars but few leaders in business.\nBut numerical aptitude helped him win a place at Auckland University, where fellow Kiwi big four bank bosses Ian Narev from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Andrew Thorburn from National Australia Bank, also studied. Armed with a degree in commerce, management and finance, Elliott joined Citi's derivatives trading desk in the mid-1980s. It was at a heady time – the spreads were wide and, as Elliott admits, \"You did not have to be smart to make money\". He was appointed to run the NZ derivatives sales and trade desk in 1990.\nTwo years later, at the age of 28, Elliott got the travelling bug and while he was prepared to chuck in his job, Citi offered to relocate him to London, where he worked as head trader for $US swaps. After moving with Citi to New York in 1997, where he was a vice president of strategic planning, he was offered a role as Citigroup's head of Australia. He turned it down because, at 35 years of age, he didn't feel he was ready. So Citi offered him Colombia, Hungary and eventually Egypt, which he liked the sound of, making him the bank's youngest ever country head at the time.\n\"We were in a crappy old building down the back of Cairo. It was really good fun. It was a little bit like Asia. Everything was about growth, hiring and expanding into new products. I really loved it.\"\nThree years later, Elliott got offered the Australia gig, which he took this time. This made him country head of one of the biggest foreign banks in Australia, competing aggressively with the big local banks in a heavily over-brokered market. He focused on pushing the bank's corporate finance and regional capabilities recognising it would struggle to compete with the local banks.\n\"I went from unbridled growth to Australia. Citi has been one of the early foreign banks to turn up and got its arse kicked, basically, for years it lost a huge amount of money and as a franchise was a mess, and I went from one extreme to the other,\" Elliott said.\nOne observer of Elliott at the time says he was young for the role and perhaps \"not enough of a prick\". ​He lasted two years in the role before moving to Citi's Hong Kong office as the chief executive of group transaction banking for Asia Pacific.\nHis 20-year career at Citi would end two years later in March 2005. \"It just wasn't the same place so I decided to move on,\" he says. His next step was to return to Cairo in an \"old-fashioned Wall Street partnership\" – EFG Hermes. The Middle-eastern investment bank that Citi had bought a stake in while Ellliot was in Egypt was growing rapidly but needed someone to help them expand across the region.\nElliott's wife is Egyptian and with a baby daughter he pledged to work there for three years planning to head back to Australasia before she started school.\nOne executive who did business with Elliott in Cairo during this period was Tim Linacre, who was chief executive of British investment bank Panmure Gordon. EFG-Hermes took a 10 per cent stake in the business in August 2008.\nLinacre says Elliott \"exudes integrity\" and was \"charmingly analytical\". \"So while he never flinched from asking the tough questions, he didn't do it in an overtly aggressive way,\" Linacre recalls.\nBut what stood out was the personal touch Elliott showed. \"My wife was going through a pretty terrible course of chemo at the time, and he took a genuine concern in her well-being. In the few times we have been in touch since then he still asks,\" he says. \"That shows he either has a great filing system, or, as I believe to be the case, he actually is a genuinely good guy who cares for those around him.\"\nElliott left EFG-Hermes in 2008 disillusioned with the banking sector after watching the onset of the global financial crisis from Cairo. The following year, he found himself in Rome, in a small apartment he and his wife had bought as a European bolt-hole.\nEnter ANZ.\nElliott, fresh from painting his apartment and dressed in a T-shirt, was lured to an unlikely setting for a video interview – upstairs in a church in the Italian capital.\nElliott says at the time of the interview he didn't want to go back to work in banking but was persuaded by the strategy that Mike Smith was forging in Asia. \"What impressed me and the reason that I joined - long story short – was I just loved the ambition of ANZ, this idea that you could build this super regional bank. If you think about it, it actually hasn't been done not just in our period of time, it hasn't really been done for decades,\" he told ANZ's in-house publication BlueNotes this week.\nHe was tasked with leading ANZ's institutional division and driving its charge to into the Asia region, which Elliott knew well. The division was plagued with problems. The Opus Prime scandal had enraged Smith and cost the job of its head Paul Hodgson at a time when the bank hadn't fully recovered from the damage of highly risky structured credit trades that blew up prior to the financial crisis.\nHis approach was to bring his crude analytical approach to institutional division and refocus the bank towards profitable lines. Elliott set about fixing the institutional division and making it one of the best performing units in the bank.\nIt will be these skills that will come to the fore in his new role, as more intrusive regulation forces banks to think harder about their balance sheets to ensure capital is deployed as efficiently as possible to boost shareholder returns.\nAfter Elliott was appointed as CFO in June 2012, he gradually emerged as a front-runner for the role of chief executive, edging ahead of other internal candidates such as Phil Chronican and Alex Thursby, who both left ANZ in the past couple of years, along with head of international and institutional banking Andrew Géczy, treasurer Rick Moscati, and deputy finance chief Shane Buggle.\nANZ chairman David Gonski said over the past 15 months since he rejoined the bank's board, Elliott had impressed with \"his strategic abilities, his incredible understanding of banking and the fundamentals of that business, his excellent financial capacities in terms of understanding and experience, and his leadership qualities – people rightly trust him and he is undoubtedly seen as a leader\".\n\"I don't see him as introvert,\" Gonski tells AFR Weekend. \"He is a person who is very focused, extremely hard working and amazingly humble. This should not be confused with being an introvert. He does the job he is expected and appointed to do and now as the CEO, being an intelligent man who speaks extremely well, he will rise to the occasion.\"\nANZ's chief for Australia Mark Whelan said this week that Elliott, who will be paid $6.3 million, was \"the obvious choice within the bank. The beauty about the CFO is that they see every part of this (ANZ) business. He is a terrific communicator, both externally and internally.\"\nElliott himself agrees that he's a straight shooter. \"Partly because I am the CFO, that's my job. I think I had that reputation when I ran the institutional bank. I am not hierarchical. When I started as CFO the culture I wanted was more of a partnership.\"\n\"The feedback I often get is that I am good at making complex things simpler and explaining it so they can understand it so they know what to do and why.\"\nBut he warns against assuming that when a CFO becomes CEO \"they will become a super CFO and take all the same things you've spoken about and just say them louder. Well, that's not true because the job is different\".\nEllliott couldn't be more different from the man whose job he is taking. Smith is sharp-witted, belligerent. He dodged gunmen in Argentina, owns a house in France, jet-sets through Asia and maintains a collection of Aston Martins and Jaguar cars. Elliott gets the tram to work and cites his hobbies as home-renovation and parenting. That could reflect a new, cultural direction of the bank. reflecting the conservatism of Gonski.\nThe first internal CEO succession at ANZ since Don Mercer in 1992, Elliott's appointment was generally well-received by market analysts who cited his deep knowledge of all of the ANZ businesses. \"Shayne Elliott is experienced and capable,\" UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said. \"We see him as knowledgeable, a good communicator with a high degree of integrity.\"\nOthers see a formidable partnership between Gonski \"as the statesman\" and Elliott \"as the executer\".\nBut while Elliott's grasp of numbers has won over many in the investment community, not everyone is enamoured with the choice of Elliott. Some analysts have doubted he has natural leadership abilities. One fund manager says Elliott is regarded as steady lieutenant rather than an inspired choice, who may not be proactive enough in the challenges facing the bank.\nWhen ANZ unveils its full-year profit result on October 29, Elliott will inevitably be peppered with questions on how he expects to generate returns in a capital-constrained environment, as the feeling lingers that Smith's at-times blunt resistance towards building even higher levels of equity put the bank on the back foot as the regulator moved to swiftly implement the financial system inquiry's call for lower bank leverage.\nAnalysts will also voice lingering concerns that ANZ does not punch strongly enough in Australia, and will need to show evidence of improved relative performance on range of measures. Others point to concerns that Elliott may not have enough retail experience at a time when the near-term economic outlook is clouded.\nBut Elliott retorts that while his CV is not dominated by retail-related roles, he does have experience running country operations that have had a retail focus. \"At the end of the day customers are customers and what they want is a terrific experience and good service, whether that's BHP or mums and dads.\"\n​Then there's the issue at AmBank, in which ANZ is a minority shareholder with Elliott on the board. The bank has been in the spotlight following a series of reports in the Wall Street Journal over recent months alleging payments of nearly $US700 million were made into two personal AmBank accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak ahead of a close election in 2013.\nElliott says the issues largely predate his time on the board. The experience of serving on the board has been a good one, he says, while acknowledging that in fulfilling his fiduciary duty, his directorship is taking up time and creating a potential distraction but he does not expect his duties to increase.\nPerhaps the most stinging criticism of both Elliott and Smith is they misread the capital-raising cycle after regulators forced banks to boost their equity ratios.\n\"We said we were caught off guard – and assumed wrongly there would be longer to comply,\" Elliott says. But he doesn't agree that they didn't read the regulatory tea leaves and mentions a piece he wrote two years ago for the board about the \"competitive advantage\" ANZ could unlock if it took a proactive approach to inevitably tighter regulation rather than drag its heels.\n\"Regulators are the way to express the social expectations of the community which is: we expect the banks to behave better and if things go bad we want to make sure you don't come to taxpayers.\n\"That's the social contract [we] want. And [we] should expect increasing demands from regulators in all sorts of way shape and form.\"\nWith Joyce Moullakis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:54:16.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
