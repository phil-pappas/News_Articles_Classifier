Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nInequality is being driven by a huge gap between firms in sectors that are thriving, such as information technology and healthcare, and those that aren't, and the disparity is filtering into a string of areas including house prices.\nThat is the view of Peter Orszag, a Citigroup vice-chairman and former Obama administration director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nHe sought to debunk a common view – including that of celebrity economist Thomas Piketty – that excessive returns on capital concentrated wealth and caused social and economic instability.\nSpeaking at the annual Citigroup investor conference in Sydney, Mr Orszag said the idea that inequality sprouted from within large companies as senior executives took home large pay packets was \"more false than true\".\nAdvertisement He cited several research reports and a recent study by him and Jason Furman, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr Orszag also cited data that compared the return on invested capital, excluding goodwill, at United States-listed companies that are not financial firms.\nTwo-thirds of firms that dominated the top returns were in the IT and healthcare or pharmaceuticals sectors.\nMr Orszag outlined that firms such as Google and Apple were benefiting from the process of globalisation, and strong returns at firms dubbed \"rocketships\" were spilling into wages.\n\"The rocketships are not just going up and crashing, they are going up and continuing to go up,\" he said, noting that the levels of inequality seen lately are harmful for economic growth.\nMr Orszag said because employees were increasingly seeking to work for firms that were making strong returns and able to remunerate more generously, house prices in surrounding areas were also being distorted.\n\"If the price of a house is extraordinarily expensive in the rocketship areas, because wages have been bid up there, it is very difficult for you to move into that local labour market and up your chances of being able to hop on to one of the rocketships,\" he said.\n\"There is a lot of underbrush in terms of regulations that impede housing-market flexibility and therefore, may also be feeding into the difficulties in jumping onto a rocketship\".\nMr Orszag said these underlying issues driving inequality could be improved through competition policy, reviewing regulations on intellectual property and reassessing government structures that create \"barriers to entry\".\nHe also cautioned restrictive policies in housing markets had the potential to exacerbate income inequality. On the question of solutions. Mr Orszag said large increases in taxes for those earning higher incomes or markedly boosting the number of university graduates would not solve the gap in inequality.\nAlso, quantitative easing in the US could not be blamed for the worsening of inequality, although cheaper financing costs and consolidation via mergers and acquisitions may have had some effect since the global financial crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:19:45.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
