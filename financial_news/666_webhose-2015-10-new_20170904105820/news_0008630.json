Revenue fell 6.4% to $23.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.37 on revenue of $23.7 billion. \nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) said Q4 EPS estimates seem \"too high.\" JPMorgan Chase is the first of the big U.S. lenders to report in the third quarter. AP  View Enlarged Image \n\nJPMorgan stock fell 1.3% late after closing down 0.3% at 61.55. \nTotal assets were $2.4 trillion as of Sept. 30, down 1% from a year earlier. Return on tangible common equity was 15%, up two percentage points from Q3 '14. Common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 11.4%. \nTrading revenue slipped 15% to $4.34 billion. Citigroup (NYSE: C ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) previously said they expected their Q3 trading revenue to decline 5%-6%. \nLoans grew 9% to $809.5 billion. JPMorgan hailed the \"exceptional\" credit quality of its loans. \nNet interest margin, the difference between what the bank earns in loans vs. what it pays deposits, rose seven basis points. But the spread remains relatively low with the Federal Reserve keeping rates near zero. \nCosts Fall, But Not Enough \nHeadcount fell 3% to 235,678 employees on Sept. 30. JPMorgan has begun to cut more than 5,000 jobs to trim expenses by $1.4 billion to $57 billion. \nTotal JPMorgan Chase bank branches fell 3% to 5,471 while ATMs slid 9% to 18,623. \nNon-interest expense rose 6% vs. Q2 to $15.4 billion, but it fell 3% from a year earlier. \nConsumer and business banking net income rose 3% to $954 million. Mortgage banking net income grew 29% to $602 million. The cards, commerce solutions and auto-loans unit's net income fell 6% to $1.1 billion. \nInvestment-banking revenue rose 5% to $1.6 billion, but JPMorgan reported a 35% fall in equity underwriting fees to $269 million. Advisory fees for mergers and acquisitions rose 22% to $503 million. Debt-underwriting fees grew 17% to $840 million. \nLegal expenses surged to $1.3 billion from $291 million in Q2 and $1.1 billion a year earlier. The bank reportedly is nearing a $150 million settlement with the SEC to resolve allegations that it didn't provide proper disclosures to its private-banking clients before steering them to its own investment products. \nWells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) and Bank of America report earnings Wednesday. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) report Thursday, and Morgan Stanley next Monday. \nBank Of The Ozarks Misses \nMeanwhile, Arkansas-based Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ: OZRK ) reported earnings 52 cents a share, up 30% from a year earlier but missing views by a penny. \nTotal assets rose 42% to $9.3 billion. While a sliver of JPMorgan's size, Bank of the Ozarks boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, meaning it tops 99% of stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. \nOzarks stock fell 2% after hours after losing 0.8%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:58:49.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
