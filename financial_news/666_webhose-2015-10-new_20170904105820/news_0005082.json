Written by: Mark Henricks 10/19/15 - 8:22 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Financially motivated matrimony is not a new idea. Perhaps our most famous cinematic depiction of the strategy comes from back in 1953's “ How to Marry A Millionaire ,” starring Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall in a post-war rom-com romp. \nBut funding a retirement by marrying rich receives surprisingly scant attention from financial planners. And opportunities to secure a financially comfortable at the altar do exist. Some 12% of federal tax returns with million-dollar annual incomes list the taxpayer as single, according to the Tax Foundation . In 2010, the latest year for which the organization analyzed IRS data, that came to 32,000 potential human 401(k)s. \nPerhaps unfortunately, the single million-dollar earners also tended to be older. About 80% of millionaires were older than 45 and close to half had passed 55, the Tax Foundation reported. There was no data on the gender distribution among millionaire filers.

Married couples today often have contrasting socioeconomic backgrounds, according to Jessi Streib, an assistant professor of sociology at Duke University and author of The Power of the Past: Understanding Cross-Class Marriages (Oxford University Press, 2015). “Those are becoming increasingly common and they’re not that unlikely anymore, assuming the people end up in same social class as adults,” Streib says. \nAlthough growing up poor may not be an obstacle to marrying rich, Streib cautions that the situation is different for people who inhabit opposite ends of the affluence spectrum as adults. “Marriages between somebody who is currently wealthy and somebody who is currently poor are very unlikely,” she says. “The chances they’ll meet in the first place are small. And the chances the wealthy person will be interested in the poor person as a romantic partner are also small.” \nThis is not to say that gold-plated knights don’t occasionally rescue impoverished princesses, and vice versa with gender roles reversed. Russell Luna , a Denver financial advisor who in his work as a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst , consults with couples dividing up the financial fruits of foundered partnerships, sees a fair number of partners who bring very different resources to a union. “There are a certain percentage of people that do look for someone to take care of them,” Luna says. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:31:40.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
