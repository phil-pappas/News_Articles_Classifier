Instead, the newspaper reported, the layoffs will take place at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, AR and are expected to include some executives ranking as high as vice president.\n\"After months of evaluation, we've concluded there is an opportunity to better position our Home Office teams to move with speed and purpose,\" CEO Doug McMillon wrote in a memo sent Friday to staff. The company is at \"an important time in our history,\" he added. \"This in part means pulling back in some areas and investing in others.\"\nWhy is Wal-Mart doing this?\nThe moves, according to the Journal , are designed to bring the home-office staff more in line with the retailer's shifting priorities. That means some of the cuts are being made to make way for hires with more experience in digital sales. The company also plans to focus more on the in-store experience for customers.\nWal-Mart has already begun making some changes, but in August, the retailer reported a 15% drop in net quarterly profit. The corporate layoffs were probably hastened by declining results.\nThis is not a small change\nLaying off top-level executives and corporate managers essentially puts all Wal-Mart employees on notice. It's a serious message that the company not only intends to make changes but also intends to make them quickly.\nThe world's largest retailer seems to be accepting that the status quo will no longer work -- a sign that top management understands that digital competitors threaten its core business and that meeting that challenge requires different thinking.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early-in-the-know investors!
