SSDs are used in cloud computing, data centres, smartphones and laptops.\nThe value of the transaction depends on the closing of an investment from Unisplendour Corp Ltd, a unit of China’s state-backed Tsinghua Holdings Co Ltd [TSHUAA.UL], in Western Digital.\nThe deal is expected to draw intense scrutiny from both U.S. and Chinese regulators as accusations of cyber snooping increase between the two countries.\nIf the Unisplendour investment closes before the SanDisk acquisition, Western Digital will pay $85.10 in cash and 0.0176 of its shares for each SanDisk share held, the companies said on Wednesday.\nHowever, if the Unisplendour investment does not close or is terminated, Western Digital will pay $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 of its shares for each SanDisk share held.\nSanDisk may also need Toshiba Corp’s <6502.T> approval to consummate the deal, as it uses the Japanese conglomerate’s foundries for making chips, apart from having an important intellectual property-sharing joint venture.\nThe JV with Toshiba will be ongoing, Sandisk and Western Digital said in a statement.\nThe deal is expected to add to Western Digital’s adjusted earnings within the first 12 months of its closing.\nThe company said it expected to enter into new debt facilities totalling $18.4 billion, including a $1.0 billion revolver, a portion of which will be used to fund the deal.\nWestern Digital’s shares were down 2 percent at $73.25 in premarket trading.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan are lead financial advisers and Credit Suisse is also advising Western Digital. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Baker & McKenzie are legal advisers to Western Digital.\nGoldman Sachs is the financial adviser to SanDisk. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is its legal adviser.\nPhoto Caption: FILE - Sandisk's new portable solid state drives are displayed at the Sandisk booth during the 2015 Computex exhibition at the TWTC Nangang exhibition hall in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2015.
