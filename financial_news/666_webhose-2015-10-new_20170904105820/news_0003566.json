Interestingly, the 6S is a teeny bit faster than the Plus. \nThe normal 6 and 6 Plus devices were next, followed by the 5S — and then things get weird. \nThe original iPhone booted up faster than the iPhone 5 and 5C, then the normal iPhone 5, followed by the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 5C, iPhone 4, iPhone 3G and, finally, the iPhone 4S. \nIn fairness: The iPhone 4S in this demonstration is running iOS 9, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system. That’s probably too much for the older phone to handle comfortably. (Though, the iPhone 4, also running iOS 9, still loaded faster.) \n“Every single device has been updated and restored to the latest firmware,” EverythingApplePro says in the video. “Of course, not all of these run the same firmware, so things are going to be a little different. Some of these don’t have the newest and greatest features to load.” \nIn other words, he tried his best to make everything equal across devices, but there are certain limitations. \nThe full video has plenty of other gems — the discovery that the iPhone 6S is “18 times more powerful” than the original iPhone, for example.
