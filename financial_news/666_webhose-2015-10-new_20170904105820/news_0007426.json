The SEC had said Hurtado placed the trades on Bilbao's behalf in an account of the British Virgin Islands entity, Somerton Resources Limited. He also personally made trades in his own brokerage account, the agency said.\nThe trading took place after Bilbao participated in a March 2014 meeting via telephone in which CFR's board considered a confidential proposal by Abbott to buy the company.\nThe announcement by Abbott days later of an agreement to buy CFR in a $2.9 billion deal enabled Bilbao and Hurtado to reap about $10.6 million in illicit profits, the SEC said.\nThe SEC filed its lawsuit in December against Bilbao, the president of banking and insurance company Consorcio Financiero SA, and Hurtado, who like Bilbao is a Chilean citizen living in Santiago.\nThe SEC subsequently obtained a court order freezing $42.8 million of Bilbao's and Somerton's assets.\nLawrence Spiegel, a lawyer for Bilbao at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said his client was \"seeking to put this matter behind him,\" adding he was thankful for the support he received from family and friends \"during this challenging time.\"\nHurtado's lawyers - Lewis Liman at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, and Chilean local law firm Claro & Cia - said the SEC's decision to dismiss charges against him reflected its conclusion the evidence did not support the claims he faces.\n\"Mr. Hurtado never acted improperly, nor committed any violation,\" Hurtado's lawyers said.\nThe case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Bilbao et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cv-10036.
