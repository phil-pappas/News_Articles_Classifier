But even then, he noted there was uncertainty about when and how fast the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates and the possible impact this might have on global growth and asset prices.\nEchoing themes from a speech by Australia's central bank deputy governor, Philip Lowe, on Tuesday, Wheeler also spoke about the limits of monetary policy in stimulating long-run economic growth.\nOn the domestic front, Wheeler said recent economic indicators had been more encouraging, but reiterated that further easing in the official cash rate seemed likely.\n The RBNZ lowered the cash rate to 2.75 per cent at its previous meeting in September, the third cut in as many policy reviews. Some analysts suspect it may pause at the October 29 meeting.\n\"We remain conscious of the impact that low interest rates can have on housing demand and its potential to feed into higher price inflation,\" Wheeler said.\n\"It is important also to consider whether borrowing costs are constraining investment, and the need to have sufficient capacity to cut interest rates if the global economy slows significantly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:03:13.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
