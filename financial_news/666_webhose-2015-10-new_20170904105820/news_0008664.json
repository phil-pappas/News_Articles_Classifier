The ad network, announced at an event for marketers and ad buyers in New York, will mean that a marketer can choose targets like men under 34, and Twitter would place ads before videos being watched by that demographic, the company said. BuzzFeed, Vox, Fox, MTV, Mashable and others have signed on so far. Publishers take 70% of the ad revenue generated, while Twitter takes a 30% cut, a smaller premium than Facebook and YouTube take.\nPRICE HIKE : Netflix is adding $1 to the price of its most popular plan as it continues to make big bets on original programming, CMO Today reports. The plan, which allows for two simultaneous streams, will cost $9.99 a month for new customers, up from $8.99 (its other $7.99 basic plan and $11.99 premium plan will remain unaffected). Existing Netflix members will maintain their current rate for a year, the company said. Netflix is ramping up its revenue intake to help cover increasingly heavy expenses for new shows and movies, not to mention the cost of licensing content from others.\nGONE FLAT : Diet Pepsi loyalists are not happy about the change in recipe , The Wall Street Journal reports. The soda recently ditched the artificial sweetener aspartame for sucralose (or Splenda), but some longtime connoisseurs are saying it has a “nasty aftertaste” and is “unpalatable.” PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said it would take a few cycles to see the effect of the change. Consumers have been eschewing diet soda amid health concerns about aspartame. As Pepsi ramps up advertising for the new soda, the early backlash may feel reminiscent of New Coke, which Coca-Cola quickly abandoned in 1985 after a customer uprising.\nDISLIKE : It’s not exactly a “dislike” button as some had hoped, but Facebook will let users do more than just “like” posts in their friends’ feeds, WSJ reports. The new “Reactions,” rendered in the form of emoji, offer seven different feelings: angry, sad, wow, yay, haha, love, and the regular like. Of course, with more differentiation comes better information. Businesses, publishers and Facebook at large will know more about what users think of their content, whether they like it or not.\nElsewhere How Snapchat stars helped sell a new Star Wars toy [ CMO Today ]\nApple removed ad blockers from its App Store that blocked in-app ads [ Business Insider ]\nHouse Speaker John Boehner canceled his “Tonight Show” appearance at the last minute [ Variety ]\nSteve Ballmer and Mark Penn’s new private-equity firm has made its first acquisition: PR firm SKDKnickerbocker [ New York Times ]\nGawker Media makes a third of its revenue from native ads and e-commerce [ Digiday ]\nWPP led the ad holding companies in digital media deals in the third quarter [ WSJ ]\nLeBron James and McDonald’s have parted ways [ Ad Age]\nA former employee takes a look inside the Chicago Sun-Times’ heavy content aggregation efforts [ The Awl ]\nEv Williams’ Medium is partnering with a bunch of publications to do something, though it’s unclear what exactly [ Nieman Lab ]\nHoliday season spending is expected to increase 3.7%, lower than last year’s gains [ WSJ ]\nWhat the new labor unions will look like at digital newsrooms [International Business Times ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/john-boehner-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon-cancel-1201613669/", "http://digiday.com/publishers/gawker-gets-one-third-revenue-native-e-commerce/", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/business/dealbook/stagwell-group-will-acquire-skdknickerbocker.html", "https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-removes-been-choice-and-other-ad-blockers-from-its-app-store-2015-10", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "http://www.ibtimes.com/unions-wage-turf-battle-millennial-newsrooms-what-will-new-labor-look-2132792", "http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/medium-partners-with-publications-like-the-awl-and-fusion-and-more-native-ads-are-on-the-way/", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "http://www.theawl.com/2015/10/the-chicago-end-times", "https://twitter.com/perlberg", "http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/lebron-james-mcdonald-s-end-endorsement-deal/300826/", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:38:45.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
