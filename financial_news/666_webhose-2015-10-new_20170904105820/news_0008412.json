Still, the data are not expected to be enough to trigger more stimulus when the bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. \nInstead, the BOJ may wait at least until its late October meeting, when economic forecasts are updated but more likely until early next year, when the impact of the Chinese slowdown is better gauged. \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia will also keep rates on hold on Tuesday and possibly for all of next year, satisfied that the currency's slide to its weakest level since mid-2009 has eased conditions enough to soften the impact of the bust following its once-in-a-century mining boom. \n\"The only scenario we could see the RBA thinking about another policy easing would be a sharp deterioration in the global growth outlook and an accompanying deterioration in the local economy and jobs market,\" Commonwealth Bank said in a note to clients. \n\"At this stage, the probability of this scenario developing appears small and probably would require an economic meltdown in China and other Asian economies,\" CBA added.
