Last week, Digicel Group Ltd., the mobile-services company owned by Irish billionaire Denis O’Brien, canceled its initial share sale, citing recent volatility in equity markets. Albertsons postponed its IPO Wednesday, citing the same, and First Data reduced its IPO by 17 percent, pricing the shares $2 less than the low end of the proposed range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:17:02.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
