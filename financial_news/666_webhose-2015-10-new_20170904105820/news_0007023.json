We have some other products that we have looked at particularly in Mali and we’ve learnt a lot about doing that and I’m certainly supportive of any replication here in Ghana, in principle.” \nHe added that Randgold has a company called Kankamusa in Mali which supplies gold to the gold trade - that is the traditional jewellers and the manufacturers of jewellery - saying “it is not a lot of gold but it makes sense to support that industry\". \nThe group is hoping to commence operation by April next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:08:00.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
