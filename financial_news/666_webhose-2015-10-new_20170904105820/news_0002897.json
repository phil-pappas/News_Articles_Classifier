He added that any fix could take \"one or two years\" to complete. \nVW acknowledged the deception to US regulators on 3 September. \nSince then, the company has suspended four members of staff over the affair, which is set to lead to a recall of 11 million vehicle worldwide .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:38:17.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
