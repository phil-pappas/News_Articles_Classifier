( apne.ws/1PxFilm )\nThe problem was discovered by an employee who owned one of the trucks and informed higher-ups. GM quickly moved to recall the trucks, keeping the number relatively small, a spokesman for GM told AP.\nGM was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.\nThe recall involves some 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups, 2015 heavy-duty pickups and 2015 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe SUVs, AP said.\nGM said it has had five reports of engines shutting off but no crashes or injuries were reported. Dealers will replace the ignition lock housing, AP reported.\nEarlier this month, the carmaker said it would recall 31,685 SUVs in North America to repair a manufacturing defect in the windshield wiper motor that may overheat.\nIn September, General Motors reached agreements to settle significant portions of civil litigation brought against it over faulty ignition switches that prompted the recall of millions of vehicles and was linked to 124 deaths. The deals were announced alongside GM's $900 million settlement with U.S. prosecutors to end a criminal probe into the switch problems.\n(Reporting by Shivam Srivastava in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": ["http://apne.ws/1PxFilm"], "published": "2015-10-17T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:52:52.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
