Its value fell by one-third in five days, to US$113.75 at midday (1600 GMT) Monday. \nOfficials said Valeant had nurtured Philidor in its infancy when it sold only two Valeant acne drugs by mail order. Last year when Philidor sought to add suppliers that would have cut into Valeant sales, Valeant signed a deal that effectively gave its drugs priority over competitors. \nThe arrangement -- which includes an option to buy Philidor -- accounted for 6.8 percent of Valeant's net revenues in the third quarter. Philidor also sells cheaper generic drugs but the bulk of its sales are Valeant products. \nThe deal also gave Valeant limited oversight over Philidor. \nValeant officials noted that other pharmaceutical companies including Allergan (NYSE: AGN - news ) , Galderma, and Novartis (LSE: 0QLR.L - news ) use specialty pharmacies to sell their wares. \nIn the meantime, Philidor expanded into new markets by acquiring pharmacies and partnering with others. \nIts partnership with R&O allowed Philidor to sell drugs in California where its permit application had been denied by the pharmacy board. \nLitigation between Valeant and R&O, according to Valeant director Robert Alexander, is at its core \"a collection action.\" \nValeant, he explained, cut off R&O after receiving only partial payment for approximately 75 shipments to R&O through Philidor between January and August of this year. \nLast month R&O major shareholder Isolani filed a lawsuit against R&O, which in turn filed against Valeant insisting it owes no arrears. Valeant, said Alexander, will counter-sue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:00:31.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
