The young industry has witnessed unmatched stellar growth over the last three decades. As pointed out by the Colorado-based consulting firm Wholers Associate’s report, the market had a compounded annual growth of 33.8% during 2012–2014. This phenomenal success of the 3D printing technique is no less than a renaissance.\nEncouragingly, according to the independent research firm Gartner, the 3D printing market, which was worth $4.1 billion in 2014, is projected to grow over 500% with a year-over-year growth rate of 45.7% in the next 5 years.\nFactors Fueling Growth \nNotably, the 3D printing market is inching toward a point of inflexion. Past the phase when it was considered just an over-hyped and unproven manufacturing process, it is now becoming a bankable technology capable of manufacturing innovative products for real.\nThe growing popularity of 3D printing is based on certain inherent benefits that it brings to the manufacturing process of business enterprises. It helps reduce time-lag in product development process, thereby lowering costs.\nPrototyping with the help of 3D printing not only saves money but also mitigates the risks involved in full-fledged manufacturing process. Moreover, it offers customization, and wastage is also kept under control.\nThese benefits offered by 3D printing are luring various industries, including automotive, aerospace, dental, high-tech and medical, who seek to improve their production process, toward this technology.\nOf late, the use of 3D Printing technology has moved beyond traditional industrial applications toward more customer-centric enterprises. This has led many 3D printing companies to venture into creative sectors like fashion and gaming.\nThe technology has even found application in sports industry for purposes like development of custom protective gear and spike plates for soccer shoes. Retail sector has also deployed the technology for manufacturing jewelry and home decor items, to name a few.\nMajor Players \n3D printing offers significant growth opportunity. According to Wholers’ 2014 report, this market, in terms of revenue, will likely reach $12.8 billion by 2018 and cross the $21-billion mark by 2020. The growing market size has attracted a number of players, thereby reducing the barriers of entry.\nAs new providers struggle to gain their ground, established players continue to explore newer territories to grab a greater market share. \nLet’s take a look at the key players in the 3D printing market:\nStratasys Ltd. SSYS: With total sales of $750.1 million in fiscal year 2014, the company is currently the top player in the 3D printing market.
