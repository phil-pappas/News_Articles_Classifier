MGI has renewed its agreement with Launch Federal Credit Union to provide official check services.\nPer the agreement, the money transfer, bill payment and check processing company will process the official checks of more than 62,000 Launch Federal Credit Union members.\nMoneyGram has a number of tie-ups with different corporations for its check processing services. In Jun 2015, the company agreed to process checks for the Founders Federal Credit Union. Other notable tie-ups include the Jul 2014 renewal of the company’s five-year agreement with PA-based Members 1st Federal Credit Union and the May 2015 extension of a long-standing agreement with Bremer Bank. In Sep 2013, MoneyGram fortified its association with Susquehanna Bancshares and Mountain America Credit Union, to provide official check services.\n\nMoneyGram is a leading funds transfer and payment services company that offers a complete official check outsourcing solution. This service provided by the company since 1979 consists of a full  package including inventory management, real-time updates and daily balancing and reconciliation, for less than the cost of most in-house programs. This service thus enables corporations to quickly maximize revenues and operational efficiencies.\nMoneyGram’s check processing services are facilitated through its high-tech online platform − MoneyGram PrimeLink Official Check. This advanced web-based service providing solution not only makes customers’ banking experience smooth, but also mitigates the risk of fraud by swiftly identifying any sham transaction.\n\nGiven the hike in losses in the financial services industry due to fraud and money laundering, we believe that MoneyGram’s PrimeLink Official Check has a huge potential for secure and reliable money management. Hence, this contract extension is expected to significantly boost the company’s financials.\n\nWhile MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), some outperformers in the financial sector are Fiserv Inc. FISV, Equifax Inc. EFX and JetPay Corporation JTPY. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
