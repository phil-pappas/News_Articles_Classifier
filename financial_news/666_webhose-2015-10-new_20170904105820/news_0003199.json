The ECB announces its measures at 1245 BST and is expected to maintain interest rates, the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 0.05%, -0.20% and 0.30%, respectively. \nThe ECB's press conference at 1330 BST, however, is the main event with investors looking for signals of further stimulus from president Mario Draghi. \nDraghi may provide clues on whether the ECB intends to expand its â‚¬60bn-a-month asset-purchase programme past September 2016 to address prolonged low inflation, a stagnant Eurozone recovery and risks from slowing emerging markets. \n\"While it would be understandable if the ECB pulled the trigger at today's meeting, the market is not expecting anything just yet so we will instead be looking for a clue as to when it will come,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda . \nThe Eurozone will also see the release of consumer confidence data at 1500 BST which is expected to show a decline in October to -7.4 from -7.1 the prior month. \nMeanwhile, a better-than-expected UK retail sales report from the Office for National Statistics failed to lift the market. Sales were up 6.5% year-on-year in September, well above analysts' expectations of 4.7%, boosted by promotions around the Rugby World Cup. \nIn the US, reports in the afternoon will include initial jobless claims, the house price index and existing home sales. \nOn the company front, Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) slumped after the housebuilder warned that full-year EBITA will now be at the lower end of market expectations due to recent sector weakness. \nPearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) was on the back foot for the second day in a row as JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'overweight' and slashed the price target to 1,080p from 1,365p following the company's interim management statement on Wednesday. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) declined after saying it was postponing major project decisions at its platinum unit until at least 2017 and had cut diamond production due to soft demand. \nFoxtons dropped after saying transactions in central London remained at a low level following recent strong price growth and stamp duty changes. \nDebenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) gained after posting growth in annual pre-tax profit thanks to solid progress made against its strategic targets. \nLadbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) raced higher as the bookmaker's third-quarter results met forecasts. \nMarket Movers FTSE 100 (UKX) 6,340.92 -0.12% FTSE 250 (MCX) 16,934.18 -0.60% techMARK (TASX) 3,032.64 0.03% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 113.90p 3.03% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 972.00p 2.32% Vodafone Group (NasdaqGS: VOD - news ) (VOD) 212.15p 1.97% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 555.50p 1.83% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,632.00p 1.49% BP (BP.) 386.20p 1.38% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 281.50p 1.30% BT Group (LSE: BT-A.L - news ) (BT.A) 439.80p 1.22% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,454.00p 1.15% BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (BLT) 1,108.50p 1.09% FTSE 100 - Fallers Travis Perkins (TPK) 1,840.00p -6.27% Pearson (Amsterdam: PR8.AS - news ) (PSON) 950.00p -4.86% Kingfisher (Amsterdam: KF6.AS - news ) (KGF) 351.80p -3.98% Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) (SMIN) 974.50p -3.61% Wolseley (EUREX: WLYH.EX - news ) (WOS) 3,685.00p -3.08% BAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) (BA.) 440.10p -2.87% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,003.00p -2.29% Anglo American (AAL) 591.90p -2.10% Merlin Entertainments (LSE: MERL.L - news ) (MERL) 381.90p -1.83% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,793.00p -1.81% FTSE 250 - Risers Ladbrokes (Amsterdam: LB6.AS - news ) (LAD) 107.60p 6.43% Zoopla Property Group (WI) (ZPLA) 245.80p 4.91% Debenhams (DEB) 84.85p 4.56% Evraz (EVR) 85.60p 3.32% Riverstone Energy Limited (RSE) 870.00p 3.20% Inchcape (INCH) 784.50p 2.62% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 120.20p 2.21% Tate & Lyle (LSE: TATE.L - news ) (TATE) 584.50p 2.10% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 93.50p 2.07% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 457.30p 1.78% FTSE 250 - Fallers SIG (Stuttgart: QIG.SG - news ) (SHI) 139.90p -21.62% Weir Group (Other OTC: WEIGF - news ) (WEIR) 1,003.00p -7.30% Senior (SNR) 243.60p -6.67% Foxtons Group (LSE: FOXT.L - news ) (FOXT) 206.80p -6.64% Home Retail Group (HOME) 118.70p -5.79% Howden Joinery Group (HWDN) 448.90p -4.51% Grafton Group Units (GFTU) 663.00p -3.98% Galliford Try (LSE: GFRD.L - news ) (GFRD) 1,504.00p -3.71% Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) (TLPR) 340.30p -3.68% Hays (HAS) 135.30p -3.43%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:09:31.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
