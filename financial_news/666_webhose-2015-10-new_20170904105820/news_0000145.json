Getty Images Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Confidence among financial planners about returns from Australian equities has plunged to levels worse than those seen during the 2008 global financial crisis, sparking an exodus to overseas assets to chase better gains.\nFinancial advisers believe Australian shares will deliver returns of about 6 per cent in the next year, down from 8 per cent this time last year. The survey of 700 advisers by Investment Trends found this expectation was 2 per cent lower than in 2008 during the depths of the GFC.\n\"This [2008 was] at a point where fear levels were extremely high because of the crash ...\", said Investment Trends head of research, wealth management, Recep Peker.\n\"So August 2015 – at 6 per cent – is even low for financial planners, who tend to have a longer term view on the sharemarket than investors.\"\nMany are turning to exchange traded funds and unlisted managed funds for domestic flows in a move away from traditional stock picking because of market volatility.\nThe funds under management of Australian exchange traded funds grew by 50 per cent during the year to September to $19.24 billion. The market grew by $500 million during the month of September alone, according to figures from the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\"This is a reflection of planners increasingly prioritising diversification and low cost when selecting investments for their clients,\" Mr Peker said.\nFinancial planners are also increasingly channelling their clients' funds into overseas assets including international equities and global real estate investment trusts as local sentiment turns sour.\n Planners' use of international assets hit a new high, with advisers looking to invest nearly 40 per cent of new client money into those assets over the next year.\nMark Draper, financial adviser with GEM Capital, said the company had been moving more of the group's client funds into international markets.\n\"We've been cautious in Australia for a while,\" he said. \"We put a lot of money into international markets when [the Australian dollar] was at parity. You should continue to get a bit of tailwind as the currency deteriorates.\"\nInvestment Trends found that index fund manager Vanguard, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Colonial First State, Magellan Financial Group and Platinum Asset Management were the managers that have been receiving most of planners' funds.\nVolatility and uncertainty meant the role of performance in fund manager selection was diminishing, while the adviser relationship was becoming much more important, Mr Peker said.\nThe data is in line with recent investor research that showed returns for domestic markets had fallen to their lowest levels since the financial crisis.\nThe typical investor expects capital gains of just 2 per cent in the next 12 months, the Investment Trends survey found.\nAbout 28 per cent of active investors are bracing for a fall in equities markets in the next year – the highest proportion since the inception of the study which surveyed more than 7000 investors.\n\"We're finding global economic concerns are dampening both investors' and professional advisers' sharemarket return expectations,\" Mr Peker said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-10-14T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:10:02.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
