Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock hurtled to an all-time high Friday after the e-commerce juggernaut's Q3 earnings late Thursday beat analyst views, with the bottom line swinging to an unexpected profit despite the company's continued heavy spending on growth. \nRevenue rose 23% year over year, matching the company's biggest growth in two years. It rose 30% on a constant-currency basis, the most in three years, says RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. \nAmazon's North American gross merchandise volume has captured 36% of all retail growth this year through September, estimates Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer, excluding vehicles, fuel and food/beverages. That's up from 29% in Q4 2014. Amazon's North American gross merchandise volume has captured 36% of retail growth this year through September, excluding vehicles, fuel and...

Historically, it's been 20%. \"Either they're growing faster, or retail is growing slower. And we know what (Amazon) is doing.\" \nAnd we know what retail overall is doing: This month, the U.S. Census Bureau pegged U.S. retail trade sales growth at 1.7% for September vs. a year earlier. \nSome of the largest conventional names are in trouble. No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) this month warned of flat sales in its fiscal year ending March 31 and said EPS next year would fall 6% to 12% — and its stock had its worst one-day drop in a quarter-century. Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ) has closed 235 locations and sold its half interest in another 31, while Macy's (NYSE: M )closed 14 stores this year and will close another 35 to 40 — more than 5% of its total — in early 2016. \nAmazon, meanwhile, posted its highest operating profit margins in five years, beating views, Mahaney said in a research note. \n\"Amazon's continued wallet-share gain, likely as a result of increasing Prime membership count,\" sparked the strong quarter, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos said in a research report. \nAbout 40% of Amazon.com customers, some 60-80 million, might be Prime members, said an RBC survey last month. In the survey, 75% of Prime members said they bought more from Amazon after joining Prime. About half the Prime members said that they spend $800 or more a year at Amazon, vs. 16% for non-Prime customers. \nPrime Day Boost \nPrime Day — a Black Friday-like \"holiday\" that the company held for the first time on July 15 and that offered deals and discount Prime membership — boosted revenue. Analysts estimated that Prime Day alone accounted for 2 percentage points of Amazon's Q3 revenue growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:19:16.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
