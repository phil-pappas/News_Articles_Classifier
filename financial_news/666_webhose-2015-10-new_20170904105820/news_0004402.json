In an article titled, \"New proposal to ban companies from using arbitration clauses as a free pass to avoid accountability,\" the CFPB didn't mince words. It's considering a ban on arbitration clauses that prevent consumers from participating in class action lawsuits.[caption id=\"attachment_c33902c6ff874640b39ea91068494394\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray speaks during a a hearing in Denver where he discussed his agency's proposal on arbitration, in Denver, Colo., Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015. If enacted, the plan would severely curtail a contentious practice called mandatory arbitration, which consumer advocates have long argued does a disservice to people who have disputes with banks, credit card issuers and other financial service providers. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley)[/caption]Arbitration clauses are the norm in consumer transactions. They give both parties the right to file claims against the other in arbitration, which is generally much less expensive and more efficient than civil litigation. The right to have claims decided in arbitration is protected by the Federal Arbitration Act and routinely upheld by the Supreme Court.Does an arbitration clause prohibit a class action lawsuit? It's an issue I've litigated, and the Supreme Court has weighed in on the issue. In short, an arbitration clause that prohibits class actions is enforceable. AT&T Mobility vs. Concepcion is instructive.The Concepcion's purchased a mobile phone from [entity display=\"AT&T\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"att\" ticker=\"T\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/354\"]AT&T[/entity] that was marketed as \"free.\" AT&T charged the Concepcion's sales tax of $30.22 as it was required to do under state law. The Concepcion's lawyer responded with a class action lawsuit alleging false advertising. AT&T sought to enforce the arbitration clause in the parties' contract.The arbitration clause provided the following:\nAT&T agreed to pay the entire cost of arbitration t The arbitration would occur in the city or county where the consumer lived t For claims of $10,000 or less, the consumer could decide whether the arbitration occurred in person, by telephone, or via document submission t AT&T provided on its website the arbitration forms consumers would need to initiate the arbitration t The arbitrator was not limited to the amount of damages he could award t If the arbitrator awarded more than AT&T's last offer, the award would be increased to $7,500 and the consumer would be entitled to double attorney's fees While praising the fairness of the arbitration clause, the federal district court in California nevertheless ruled the clause \"unconscionable\" because \"AT&T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions.\" The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, enforcing the arbitration clause and ending the class action.It's noteworthy that the Concepcion's entered into the contract with AT&T in 2002, didn't file their $30.22 lawsuit until 2006, and the Supreme Court's ruling was in 2011. As I've said, arbitration is more efficient than civil litigation. Enter the CFPB The CFPB doesn't mask its disdain for class action ending arbitration clauses. As the headline of its blog post makes clear, it views such arbitration clauses as giving financial institutions a \"free pass to avoid accountability\" and robbing consumers of their \"day in court.\"At first blush the CFPB's perspective seems compelling. After all, who is going to take the time and effort to bring a $30.22 lawsuit? Without class action lawsuits, the argument goes, small claims will go unaddressed while big corporations skate scot-free.Having worked in the trenches of class action lawsuits, however, I know there are several critical issues missing from the CFPB's recent announcement. 1. Cost Litigation is expensive. Forcing consumers and financial institutions to litigate class action lawsuits will impose enormous costs on what are relatively low-cost transactions. While promising consumers their \"day in court\" makes for a compelling soundbite, the costs of this \"protection\" will eventually make its way to the cost and benefits of the financial products being regulated.Estimating these costs is difficult. Because it's difficult, the costs are often ignored. Hopefully the CFPB will not ignore them here before issuing its proposal. The costs are particularly important for one key reason. The benefits of consumer class action lawsuits go primarily to lawyers, not consumers. 2. Lawyers I've sat across the table from class action plaintiffs. We negotiated a coupon for the members of the class and a cash windfall for the lawyers. The lawyers had a nice payday and most of the class members pitched the coupons into the trash.Judges, to their credit, are starting to reject class settlements that provide little value to the class of plaintiffs. But that doesn't change one inescapable fact. Consumer class actions are driven by lawyers and for lawyers. That's not to say that all class actions are of little value to the plaintiffs, but many consumer class actions are.Creating a regulation that lines the pockets of class action lawyers and increases the cost of financial products to consumers is the exact opposite of what the CFPB should be doing. 3. Regulations Any suggestion that arbitration enables financial institutions to avoid accountability is unfounded. Banks, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions are subject to unprecedented regulation. Dodd-Frank unleashed a tidal wave of regulation on the financial industry, including the CFPB itself.Today a consumer can file a complaint against a financial institution online with the CFPB. This database of complaints is available online, including how the financial institution responded to the complaint. In fact, the CFPB notes that one complaint can help millions: By submitting a complaint, consumers can be heard by financial companies, get help with their own issues, and help others avoid similar ones. Every complaint provides insight into problems that people are experiencing, helping us identify inappropriate practices and allowing us to stop them before they become major issues. The result: better outcomes for consumers, and a better financial marketplace for everyone. According to the CFPB there have been 463,840 financial institution responses to consumer complaints and that 98% of consumers receive timely responses from financial institutions.Financial institutions are not avoiding accountability, and it's ironic that the CFPB would even make such a suggestion.The CFPB's contemplated proposal on arbitration may be a boon for class action lawyers. It would be, however, a costly and unnecessary burden on financial transactions the brunt of which would be born by consumers.", "external_links": ["http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/", "http://www.insidearm.com/opinion/judge-rejects-all-for-the-lawyer-none-for-the-class-tcpa-case-settlement-agreement/", "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-893.pdf", "http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/new-proposal-to-ban-companies-from-using-arbitration-clauses-as-a-free-pass-to-avoid-accountability/", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/c33902c6ff874640b39ea91068494394/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:18:20.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
