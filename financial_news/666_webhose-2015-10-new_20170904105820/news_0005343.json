Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe biggest overhaul of Australia's financial system in almost 20 years is to occur after the government on Tuesday backed the majority of the recommendations of the financial system inquiry chaired by David Murray.\nThe key recommendations of the Murray inquiry to affect small business are those on unfair contracts, crowdfunding and excessive credit card fees.\nThe big end of town will still be fighting this tooth and nail.\nPeter Strong, chief executive of COSBOA Delivering the government's response, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Treasurer Scott Morrison and Assistant Treasurer and Small Business Minister Kelly O'Dwyer agreed with the Murray inquiry's recommendations in each of these areas.\nUnfair contracts\nAdvertisement The government agreed with the Murray inquiry's recommendation to provide small businesses with the same protections against unfair contract terms as those already applying to consumers.\nThis was already in motion as an election commitment of the Abbott government, with legislation passed in June.\nThe legislation passed the Senate this month, with amendments championed by the Greens increasing the thresholds for coverage from $100,000 to $300,000 for contracts up to 12 months long and $300,000 to $1 million for contracts greater than 12 months.\nIn approving the Murray inquiry's recommendations, the government also noted the corporations and financial services parliamentary joint committee inquiry into the impairment of customer loans. It will consider the use of non-monetary default covenants in the context of the findings of that inquiry.\nPeter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business of Australia, says the government's support for the increased thresholds is \"very encouraging\".\n\"It was a surprise given it was an amendment from the Greens supported by Labor,\" he says.\n\"The big end of town will still be fighting this tooth and nail but I'm not sure how they can win given all the political parties have agreed.\"\nExcessive credit card fees\nThe government also agreed to take action to improve interchange fee and surcharge arrangements on credit cards.\n\"We will phase in a legislated ban on surcharges that exceed the reasonable costs faced by merchants in accepting cards,\" the government said in its response to the Murray inquiry.\n\"We will also make the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission responsible for enforcing the ban on excessive surcharging.\"\nThis ban will hit retailers, cabs and other merchants but Strong says the majority of small businesses have nothing to worry about.\n\"Most small businesses don't charge extra money,\" he says.\n\"The good news is that they are going to do a study to show how much it costs. This will take away some of the fears that people have in terms of being ripped off.\"\nCrowdfunding\nThe government will also develop a framework to facilitate crowdfunding for start-ups, as recommended by the Murray inquiry.\nIn its response to the inquiry the government said it has already consulted widely on options for crowdsourced equity funding and it will consult on draft legislation to implement this framework by the end of 2015.\n\"The government will consult the community on crowdsourced debt funding in parallel with legislation to implement crowdsourced equity funding,\" the response says.\nTim Heasley, chief operating officer of equity-based crowdfunding platform VentureCrowd, says legislation on crowdfunding is long overdue.\n\"Bring it on,\" he says. \"It's good news but when is it going to happen? We have had a few false starts on this already.\"\nHeasley notes the government's response doesn't deal with property crowdfunding, which is a popular model overseas.\n\"This response is silent on property crowdfunding, which means it's either been left out or they haven't thought about it,\" he says.\n\"I will feel a lot happier when legislation is actually enacted. The most we can hope for here is to see some draft legislation by the end of the year.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/link.aspx?_id=194A2D59EB6F4F9A8B09ACC059978F47&_z=z"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:33:00.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
