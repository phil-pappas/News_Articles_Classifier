Ridgewood Savings Bank will be donating $10 for every save made by the Islanders’ goalies during the 2015-16 regular season. The campaign, called “Save with Ridgewood,” will tally up the number of saves made by the Islanders goalies over the course of their 82 regular season games. At the end of the season, the total amount will be shared between Gateway Youth Outreach and IMPACCT Brooklyn, two charities selected by Ridgewood to help in their missions. “We work with many worthy causes in the 35 communities we serve, however these particular charities were chosen specifically for their impact in each of the areas they serve in Nassau and Brooklyn,” said Christopher F. Smith, Ridgewood Savings Bank’s Vice President & CRA Officer.\nGateway Youth Outreach is based in Elmont, NY serving the needs of Nassau County communities that help young people and families with counseling, summer programs, and after school homework assistance programs. IMPACCT Brooklyn creates and preserves affordable housing, and prevents displacement to enhance the economic, racial and cultural diversity of Central Brooklyn. “Additionally each charity promotes financial literacy,” said Smith, “an endeavor that we promote in all our communities.”\nPat Boyle, GYO Executive Director, stated “We could not be more pleased with this opportunity to share and promote our cause of helping kids and families, as well as being associated with such a caring bank as Ridgewood Savings Bank and the New York Islanders.” “Having Ridgewood Savings Bank recognize the importance of housing in our communities says that what we are doing is meaningful. We are very excited to receive the support and recognition of Ridgewood Savings Bank as we work to advance our mission in the communities we serve.” said Deborah Howard, Executive Director, IMPACCT Brooklyn.\nThe Islanders website ( http://www.newyorkislanders.com/RSBsave ) will track the number of saves throughout the season and will display related content as well. Peter Boger, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Ridgewood Savings Bank, commented, “This is an exciting time for our bank — this program highlights our commitment to our communities, emphasizes that we want to help people save for their future and being associated with a great franchise like the Islanders makes it that much more fun for everyone.” Ridgewood Savings Bank will present the checks to the two charities during a game at the end of the season.\n“The New York Islanders are proud to partner with Ridgewood Savings Bank to champion such worthy causes,” said Michael Zavodsky, Executive Vice President of Global Partnerships for Barclays Center. “IMPACCT Brooklyn and Gateway Youth Outreach share our goal of strengthening our surrounding communities.”\nAbout Ridgewood Savings Bank\nFounded in in 1921, Ridgewood Savings Bank is the largest mutual savings bank in New York State, with over $5 billion dollars in assets.
