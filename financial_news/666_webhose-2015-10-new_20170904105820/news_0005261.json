Management believed in their product a lightweight thermoplastic called “Peek” and found backers to support a buy-out of the business during the early 90’s breakup of ICI. \nThe material, which is resistant to extreme temperatures and chemicals, is now being used to replace metal parts in aeroplanes such as the new Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) 787, brake-pads in cars, and components in smartphones and medical implants. Victrex (LSE: VCT.L - news ) also makes composite materials for use in repairing damaged spines. \nThe company has grown revenues from £104m in 2009 to £264m at the end of September this year. To satisfy growing demand, the group has this year completed a third £90m plant in the North West and recent investment has increased maximum capacity by 70pc to 7,000 tonnes a year. \nDavid Hummel, chief executive, expects spending to fall to more normal levels following the expansion programme \nThe company said yesterday that it had ended the year with a robust fourth quarter, and full-year production volumes were up 19pc to 4,217 tonnes. There was growing demand from the automotive, aerospace and consumer electronics markets, which helped offset a slowdown from the oil and gas sector customers. \nMarket expectations are for the company to make £105m in pre-tax profits over the full year, giving 97p in earnings per share. \nThe profits are up 3pc on last year having been held back by an £8m loss from foreign currency movements and revenues falling 5pc in the US spinal business. \nThe balance sheet is in a strong position and the company remains highly cash generative. The dividend payments have increased by more than 10pc every year for the past five years and now offer a prospective yield of 2.8pc. \nThe only problem is that the shares, trading on 19 times forecast earnings, already price in much of this good news. \nA British success story that we are happy to hold for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:08:09.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
