The memo was sent by CFO Tarek Robbiati. “We just want to make sure employees know what’s happening,” he said. Recommended for You \nRobbiati’s memo was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday night. \nSprint recently announced that it would not participate in an auction of low-frequency wireless spectrum. \n“We have plenty of spectrum, the most of any other U.S. company, and we don’t need to participate in the auction,” Tovar said. “We’re going full speed ahead on our network plan and the decision not to participate in the auction has nothing to do with what you’re hearing about cost reductions.” \nIn the last 12 months Sprint cut approximately $1.5 billion in expenses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:11:54.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
