Revenue fell 1% to $38.84 billion due to currency headwinds, but it topped the Wall Street consensus for $38.55 billion. \nOperating margin in the key North America region widened to 11.8% from 10.5% in Q2 and 9.5% a year earlier as cheap gasoline powered U.S. sales. North American deliveries climbed 5.2%, though China sales fell 4.2%.

Rival Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) was up 1.6%, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ) was down 4%. \nGM's earnings report came a day after it named LG Electronics as an official supplier of its upcoming 200-mile range Bolt electric vehicle, elevating its rivalry with luxury EV maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ). \nGM and LG originally began working together on EVs in August 2011, with LG supplying the batteries for the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid. \nLG will make the Bolt's electric drive motor using a GM design. It will make other Bolt hardware such as an onboard charger, battery cells and pack, instrument cluster and infotainment system. \nGM affirmed this week that it plans to begin production of the Bolt, which would be the first ever U.S.-made mass-market EV, in late 2016. It's projected to cost about $30,000 after government rebates. \nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that production of the lower-cost, mass-market Model 3 sedan — a direct rival to the Bolt — will start production in fall 2017. \nGM is also said to be working on autonomous self-driving car technology , which is also on the drawing board for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) -owned Google, Ford and others. \nMeanwhile, Italian luxury sports car maker Ferrari (NYSE: RACE ) was up about 10% Wednesday after raising $894.4 million with its initial public offering late Tuesday, pricing at high end of its estimated range. Ferrari remains majority owned by Fiat Chrysler. \nFollow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:00:41.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
