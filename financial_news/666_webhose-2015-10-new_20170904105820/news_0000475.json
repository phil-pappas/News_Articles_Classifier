PUBLISHED: 10:42, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:00, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 GETTY Tesco is selling off sites to make savings \nThe supermarket giant has sold the Spenhill development sites across London, the South East and Bath, which it said could be used for housing or commercial developments. \nThe land sales mark a drastic change of times and of strategy for the troubled grocer. Just a few years ago Tesco was snapping up new sites to expand its army of stores across Britain. But since then profits have plunged amid dwindling sales, as the supermarket has found retailers Aldi and Lidl eating into its market share. Now Tesco remains focused on reducing assets to pay down debt and focus on revitalising its ailing UK business.Amid a fierce supermarket price war with competitors, Tesco has slashed the cost of goods for customers and is now trying to cut costs and make savings in other areas of the business.
