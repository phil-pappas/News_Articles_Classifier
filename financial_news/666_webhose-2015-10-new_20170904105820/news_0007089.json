From now, markets will be looking to policy events later this months as well as corporate earnings,\" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nThe recovery in many share markets since last month has in fact been partly supported by hopes policymakers around the world may take steps to bolster their respective economies.\nOne such hope may be fulfilled in an event-packed period towards the end of month, starting with the European Central Bank holding its policy meeting later in the day.\nECB President Mario Draghi is widely expected to keep the door open for more monetary stimulus in the face of deflation risks, but is seen stopping short of taking new policy steps at Thursday's meeting.\nThe ECB meeting will be followed by central bank policy meetings in the U.S. and Japan, as well as four-day leadership meeting of China's Communist party, all planned for next week.\nThe Shanghai Composite stock index slumped 3 percent on Wednesday, its worst daily performance in five weeks after a relatively calm month, reminding investors that China's markets and economy are still far from stable.\nThat put fresh pressure on commodity-linked currencies and emerging market currencies.\nEmerging market currencies from the Malaysian ringgit to the Chilean peso stepped back from recent highs.\nAmong major currencies, the Australian dollar tumbled to $0.7202 on Wednesday, its lowest in a week. The Canadian dollar fell to C$1.3149 per U.S. dollar on Thursday, its lowest in 2 1/2 weeks, as the Canadian central bank lowered its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017.\nThe euro stood at $1.1342, barely moving this week ahead of the ECB's meeting. The yen was little changed at 119.88 to the dollar.\nOil prices fell to three-week lows as the U.S. government reported a bigger than expected build-up in crude oil stockpiles.\nBrent futures dropped to a three-week low of $47.50 per barrel on Wednesday and last stood at $48.01.\nU.S. crude futures fell to $44.86 a barrel, the lowest since Oct 2.\nU.S. natural gas futures fell to a three-year low on Wednesday on forecasts for warmer weather over the next two weeks.\n(Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:11:17.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
