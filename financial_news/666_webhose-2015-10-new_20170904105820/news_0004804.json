Harper said the approval of Keystone was a “no-brainer” and that he wouldn’t “take no for an answer” from Obama -- comments that intensified the controversy over a pipeline that faced opposition from Nebraska ranchers and environmentalists.\n‘Soft Support’ In contrast, Trudeau has signaled “a soft support for the oil industry and oil pipelines, but that support is very different from the support we’ve seen from the Canadian government over the past 10 years,” said Adam Scott, Climate and Energy Program Manager with Environmental Defence Canada. “It’s likely that Trudeau will take ‘No’ for an answer on Keystone.”\nThe Canadian oil industry has been lobbying for approval of new pipelines for the past five years as crude production surges after more than C$100 billion ($77 billion) in investment in oil-sands mines and steam operations in northern Alberta. Trudeau has vowed to take a more cooperative approach than Harper and work with the U.S. on energy and climate goals to help pave the way for approvals.\n“Calling people names and issuing ultimatums does nothing –- in practical, meaningful, measurable terms –- to advance the interests of Canada’s resource sector,” Trudeau told a crowd of oil executives in Calgary in February.\nA decision on Keystone won’t be affected by the new Canadian government, Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday in Washington.\n‘Appropriate Moment’ “The decision on Keystone is being based on the merits, on the countervailing balance of all the input that has come from the very exhaustive agency review,” Kerry said at a climate and clean energy panel. “It’ll get done in its appropriate moment, but I would like to see it done as fast as possible.”\nThere’s been speculation among Keystone watchers that Obama would reject the pipeline after Monday’s Canadian election. John Hoeven, the Republican North Dakota Senator and a supporter of the project, said last month the denial was “very likely” after the Oct. 19 vote and that the decision has been “embroiled in” Canada’s election.\nBut Trudeau’s victory may not affect the timing of a U.S. decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, according to Guy Caruso, senior adviser on energy issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\"It’s been clear for some time now that the Obama administration wants to keep kicking this thing down the road,\" Caruso said in a phone interview. \"He obviously doesn’t want to approve it, or he would have done it a long time ago.\"\nIndustry Downturn For the Canadian oil industry, Keystone and other pipelines remain a lifeline for companies that have been hit by the slump in commodity prices over the past year. The S&P/TSX Composite Index Energy Sector Index rose 1.8 percent at 11:05 a.m. in Toronto, paring this year’s 16 percent decline.\n“Pipelines are a very important part of it for oil and also for natural gas,” Tim McMillan, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Monday in a phone interview. “Our priorities are largely the same: market access and ensuring that we’re competitive and attracting investments.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:27:30.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
