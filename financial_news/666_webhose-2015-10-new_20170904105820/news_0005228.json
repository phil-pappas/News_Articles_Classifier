Advertising Print This Post \nThe Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX) has released its Q3 2015 financial metrics, orchestrating the group’s largest open interest (OI) recorded with 110,145 contracts, exploding 143% QoQ from Q2 2015, according to a DGCX statement. \nThe surge in volumes resulted from a confluence of growth headwinds in China, notwithstanding the lingering specter of rate hikes by the US’ Federal Reserve. Due in part to these factors, the exchange’s Q3 overall trading volumes climbed 36% QoQ from Q2 2015, which came in at 4,142,368 contracts. \nPerhaps the broadest growth trajectory at the DGCX was reserved for its OI however, as its figure of 110,145 contracts in Q3 2015 constituted a steadfast 143% growth QoQ. In particular, the exchange’s highest ever daily OI of 223,787 contacts was achieved on September 28, 2015, having surpassed a previous high of 125,066 contracts back on August 27, 2015. \nAccording to Gaurang Desai, CEO of DGCX, in a recent statement on the September volumes, “Open Interest (OI) is a key indicator of market confidence in trading DGCX products and we are happy to have achieved so many records in that area.” \nMoreover, “Global markets endured turbulent times last quarter which made investors realize the significance of using a regulated platform like DGCX to hedge and manage their price exposure, and this is evident from the volume growth witnessed in our gold, currency and energy products. DGCX is the only exchange in the Middle East to offer electronic trading across multiple asset classes. This is key as it facilitates capital efficiency and cross pollination amongst different products – equipping investors with various hedging and risk management instruments to thrive in uncertain times,” Mr. Gaurang added. \nLast month, the DGCX reported its metrics for the month ending August 2015 , having recorded a two-year high across is volumes, which was fueled in part by heightened market volatility. The outperforming figure represented the highest average monthly Open Interest (OI) recorded in 2015, with 91,797 contracts – this corresponded to a 17% jump from the previously recorded high set during the previous month when the exchange registered 78,391 contracts.
