Passage of these bills will improve governance not only in the petroleum sector but also in the other resource industries. \nThe (P-TRAC) Index The 2015 Petroleum Transparency and Accountability (P-TRAC) Index, which began in 2011 reports progress made to date in enhancing transparency and accountability in the governance of Ghana's petroleum resources. \nThe P-TRAC Index is based on tracking performance across four components of the management of the petroleum resources, namely Revenue Transparency, Expenditure Transparency, Contract Transparency and Transparency in the management of the Ghana Petroleum Funds. \nThe overall goals of the P-TRAC project are to promote transparency and accountability in the management of Ghana's petroleum resources and to enhance the level of responsibility on the part of the policy makers and implementers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:26:32.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
