It has pledged to fight in talks with lenders on what it calls \"open issues\", which include pension reforms, minimum wages, bad loans and debt relief.\n\"You will have a combative government which will provide a solution to the debt issue,\" Euclid Tsakalotos told lawmakers in a heated debate before a vote on a first set of reforms.\nThe omnibus bill cutting pensions, raising the retirement age, increasing punishments for tax evasion and liberalising the energy market was expected to be approved on Friday by the 155 lawmakers backing the government in the 300-seat parliament.\nAthens wants to wrap up its first bailout review and recapitalise its banks quickly, to start talks on debt relief. But it must first enact a long list of reforms in its 86-billion-euro ($98 billion) bailout.\nInspectors from the European Commission, European Central Bank, euro zone rescue fund and International Monetary Fund are expected in Athens at the end of October to assess progress on Greece's third international bailout.
