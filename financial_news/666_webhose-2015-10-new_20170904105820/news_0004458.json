AP Share on twitter by John Stensholt It is not only English pride that the Wallabies smashed when beating the home side in the Rugby World Cup 33-13 at Twickenham on Sunday morning Australian-time.\nThe United Kingdom economy could take a substantial nosedive too.\nEverything from spending on travel, food and drink, merchandise, corporate hospitality to the stockmarket may be hit by Australia's excellent win at Twickenham, which consigned the tournament hosts to an early exit and sent the Wallabies into the quarter-finals.\nIt marked the earliest departure for the host in tournament history, and unleashed a torrent of abuse for English coach Stuart Lancaster - who apologised for letting the nation down after the match.\nStar man: Bernard Foley celebrates Australia's victory. Getty Images It was a superb win for the Wallabies, led by five-eighth Bernard Foley. He was the centre of attention after scoring 28 of the team's points, including two tries, though the formerly maligned Australian forward pack deserved plenty of the glory.\nTwickenham has previously been the scene of many a Wallaby scrum disaster, but the scrummaging in particular has improved rapidly since the appointment of coach Michael Cheika a year ago and his scrum coach, the former Argentinian international Mario Ledesma.\nThe Wallabies won several scrum penalties and Cheika's decision to pick two openside flankers in Michael Hooper and David Pocock was vindicated with both playing excellent matches.\nAustralia now plays Wales next weekend to decide which team will finish first in their group, with England only having a consolation match against Uruguay to come.\nAussies force: The Wallabies' scrum set the platform for their win. Getty Images The Wallabies would likely play Scotland or Japan in a quarter-final should it beat Wales or South Africa if it loses.\nTickets for the tournament are mostly sold out and organisers claimed before the World Cup begun two weeks ago that income for the event would be about £650 million and direct economic impact about twice that figure.\nBut one academic told English newspapers last week that up to £3 billion could we wiped from the value of British shares when trading resumes on Monday, and there are fears no host nation matches will mean less spending at pubs and restaurants around the country.\nOne mitigating factor to that may be that England sports fans, still gloating from the home team winning cricket's Ashes earlier this year, are getting used to their side making early exits from World Cups.\nThe English football team left at a similar stage of the football World Cup in Brazil in mid-2014, as did the cricket team at that sport's tournament held in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:04:25.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
