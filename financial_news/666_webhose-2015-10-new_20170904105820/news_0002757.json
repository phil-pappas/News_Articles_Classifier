Amid the current market volatility and rising corporate debt levels, private equity-backed companies like Albertson are facing troubled waters if they want to go public.\nWe'll look at the reasons why Albertsons had no choice but to defer its offering.\nWhen Walmart  gave a weak earnings outlook last week and its stock plunged nearly 10%, the collateral damage was borne by Albertsons, which is controlled by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management .\n\nAt a rumored $23-$26 per share, the Albertsons IPO had been tightly priced. The Idaho-based grocery chain was scheduled to price its offering last Wednesday, the day Walmart revealed dismal earnings results and gave a tepid outlook as well.\n\nEven Albertsons' closest rival, Kroger Co. , saw it shares fall as sentiment soured. But Walmart's bad news also changed valuations for the entire retail sector, and that could really hurt Albertsons when it does try to go public.\nMust Read: 5 Stocks Set to Soar on Bullish Earnings \nWalmart now trades with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14, and unless Albertsons can provide faster growth at a reasonable price, it will have a tough time with its IPO. \nAlbertsons gave the official reason for delaying its IPO as \"market volatility,\" but haven't we heard this one before? It's true that Walmart's news upset the market and the retail sector, but another reason -- debt -- could prove to be an obstacle for Albertsons.\nPayment processing company First Data , backed by KKR & Co ., recently launched its IPO at $16 per share, raising $2.56 billion. The company had to price its IPO beneath the expected range of $18 to $20. Even at the IPO price, First Data came in several notches below its peers on P/E. First Data, has billions in debt, something that makes investors uncomfortable.\nAlbertsons' debt pile more than tripled in a year, primarily because of Albertsons' purchase of Safeway . Total debt increased to more than $12 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, from just under $4 billion a year earlier. Proceeds from the delayed IPO would have been used to repay more than $1 billion in debt.\n\n1 of 2 Check Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:49:50.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
