Releases 2015 Q3 Market Review A volitile third quarter could make way for upside surprises PORTLAND, OR, October 19,   The third quarter of 2015 was the worst three-month period for the markets in four years. From peak to trough the S&P 500 fell just more than 11%, giving us the first pullback greater than 10% since the third quarter of 2011. Although market volatility never feels good, please keep in mind that corrections are a natural function of a healthy market. Listed below are returns for five major indexes through September 30th: BarCap US Agg Bond + 1.13% S&P 500 - 5.29% MSCI EAFE (Europe) - 5.28% MSCI EM (Emerging Markets) - 15.47% The volatility in third quarter was driven primarily by two stories; fear of slowing global growth (especially in China) and the uncertainty of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve. However, we believe the recent pullback is simply a pause in the ongoing bull market run and that we'll very likely see a 20,000 DOW at some point in 2016. Expectations for third quarter corporate earnings have been lowered. So much so, that we believe there will be many upside surprises. The U.S. economy is doing better than people think, the European economy is improving, and the Emerging Markets (especially China) are still growing at a significantly greater pace than the developed world. The housing sector and car sales remain strong and we are seeing stabilization in the energy sector. We believe we still may still see a rate hike in December, which in our opinion would be positive for the financial markets. We continue to like the following sectors: Financials, Energy, Health, Technology, Europe and the Emerging Markets. October has begun with a nice bounce, but we anticipate that volatility may continue. By year-end, however, we believe the markets will very likely reflect a positive return. We want to be the first to wish you and your family a wonderful, happy and healthy holiday season. As always, please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. Sloy, Dahl & Holst, Inc.
