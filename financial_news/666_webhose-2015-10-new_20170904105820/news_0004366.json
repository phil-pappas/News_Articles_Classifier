Nick Moir Share on twitter by John Stensholt National Rugby League chief executive Dave Smith has quit suddenly, leaving delicate broadcast rights negotiations with News Corp to a team led by his chairman John Grant and another Australian Rugby League commissioner, Graeme Samuel.\nMr Smith stepped down on Tuesday morning after three years. He joined the NRL in 2012 after a stint as chief executive of financial group Lloyds International. Mr Grant, who is chief executive of Australian Securities Exchange-listed Data3 Limited, will assume Mr Smith's duties after November 30 until a permanent replacement is found.\nMr Smith and Mr Grant denied they had fallen out, and Mr Grant refused to criticise the outgoing chief executive's approach to recent broadcast rights negotiations.\nThe surprise move came about two months after the NRL signed a five-year $925 million television deal with Nine Entertainment Co that angered News Corp and its chairman Rupert Murdoch, given that the agreement meant News' Fox Sports would lose its exclusive rights to Saturday and Monday night matches.\nTalks then broke down between the NRL and News Corp over pay-television rights and Mr Smith copped heavy criticism in News Corp newspapers after Mr Murdoch intervened personally a week after the NRL and Nine deal and helped drive a record $2.508 billion six-year agreement with the AFL, also involving Seven West Media and Telstra.\nStreet Talk revealed recently NRL and News have since re-engaged , although Mr Samuel and Mr Grant are likely now to take bigger roles in discussions. Telstra has indicated it is still interested in at least some NRL digital rights, while its rival Optus has also expressed interest. Optus has renewed its push for sports content and is on the verge of signing a contract with Cricket Australia for some rights .\nMr Smith said on Tuesday he was comfortable with the strategy to sign the Nine deal before a pay-television component was agreed to, and that he was leaving rugby league in its best-ever financial state.\n\"I am a bit of a person that comes into an organisation to facilitate change, if you like,\" he said. \"We have made significant achievements in three years and because of those I felt this was the right time to hand over the baton to someone else.\"\n The league has convinced the NSW government to pay $1.6 billion to build or refurbish three new stadiums in Sydney and has a $50 million future fund after a series of large annual surpluses.\nSearch firm Signium International has been appointed to find a new chief executive, although Mr Grant would not be drawn as to whether an appointment would be made before the 2016 season begins.\nPossible internal contenders to succeed Mr Smith include Michael Brown, appointed recently to run the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, after overseeing the 2015 Asian Cup soccer tournament, and head of football Todd Greenberg.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-10-20T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:08:09.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
