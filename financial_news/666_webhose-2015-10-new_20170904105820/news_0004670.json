PUBLISHED: 14:18, Thu, Oct 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:29, Thu, Oct 22, 2015 GETTY Customers are not switching accounts for a better deal, according to the watchdog \nIn a market riddled with problems customers are reluctant to switch, with more than a third of people staying with the same bank for more than 20 years, and almost 60 per cent for more than 10 years, found the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). \nBanks fail to offer better value accounts because customers don't move from rip-off deals, even though a change could save customers a typical £70 a year. \nJust 3 per cent of customers switched accounts last year, showed initial findings after the CMA's investigation into the market. \nOverdraft users are the least likely to switch accounts and could save up to a huge £260 a year if they moved. \nAs a result of not enough customers switching, smaller or better banks find it hard to gain a foothold in the market, leaving the big five banks with the lion's share of the market. \nAlasdair Smith, chairman of the retail banking investigation, said: \"Banking is a sector of huge importance that affects every household and business in the country. \n\"We think customers need to be put in charge of their banking. \n\"We don’t think that customers will truly benefit from a more competitive marketplace until they can compare accounts more easily and feel confident that they can switch without risk, and that is why our provisional remedies are aimed at giving customers control. \n\"We are considering a series of measures that will have a far-reaching impact on how banks operate and will empower account-holders to search for and switch to the account that suits them.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:51:23.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
