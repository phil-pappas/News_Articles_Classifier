Jim Rice by James Dunn Not many industries have a regulatory crackdown imposed on them as forcefully as the financial industry in Australia. The government's Future of Financial Advice reforms and the financial systems inquiry constitute the most sweeping review of the nation's financial architecture in almost 20 years.\nIn short order, Australia's regulators have instituted a significant strengthening of the banking sector, a tightening of property investment rules for self-managed superannuation funds, greater oversight of the financial advice industry and an update to the nation's central payments clearing system, which will go live in 2016.\nThe regulators must also keep an eye on technology developments.\n\"There will always be an element of regulation needing to catch up to industry developments, and the reality is that the world is moving more quickly than ever,\" says Ian Pollari, head of banking in Australia at KPMG and global co-lead of KPMG fintech. \"The rate at which consumers adopt technology is accelerating, the rate at which new technology comes is accelerating and that dynamic will only continue in the future. Regulators have to be careful not to be too quick and heavy-handed in response to some of these emerging developments.\"\nBetter consumer or investor outcome One of the important messages to regulators coming out of technological change, Pollari says, is that at the core of business models of the \"fintech\" providers is the objective to deliver a better consumer or investor outcome, or to deliver access to finance to parts of the economy that are not well provided for today. \"Any change has to be balanced against the economic and social benefits that come through these business models succeeding and growing in the future.\n\"I think the regulators need to educate themselves, and make sure any regulatory response is appropriate and is not seen as 'killing-off' this innovation with heavy-handedness. In terms of fintech, I think regulators globally recognise this, and they're starting to comment publicly about the importance of fostering the development of the fintech sector, because they recognise the industry is at an inflection point.\"\nDigital, or robo-advice, is a good example of this, says Julie Coates, head of financial services at PwC. \"If there is a new service or offering that allows a particular demographic to be able for the first time to have access to advice, on the face of it that is a really good thing – as long as the customers aren't given inappropriate advice, or have accessed something that they don't understand. And that's the role of regulation.\"\n Australia's financial regulators are \"trying very hard\" to be on top of the pace of change, Coates says. \"I think they're making good efforts to connect into what else is happening globally. That connectivity is really important, particularly when we talk about things like global payment systems. I also think the government is on the front foot trying to move these things forward. For example, there's crowd-funding legislation with the government at the moment, and we're expecting the outcome of that imminently. I think Australia is as well placed as anyone to respond.\"\nImportant source of innovation Pollari says the \"innovation hub\" established by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in April to help new fintech businesses navigate ASIC's regulatory system is a case in point. \"All of ASIC's peers are increasingly looking to help foster the development of these fintech ecosystems, because they know it's a really important source of innovation and competition that will help consumers and investors,\" he says.\nIt is the same thinking as that behind the sweeping overhaul of the financial advice industry, says Associate Professor Mark Brimble, discipline head of finance and financial planning at Griffith University Business School. \"The broad thrust of that regulatory direction has been around improving the service to clients. To do that, the regulator had to focus on improving the general professionalism in the industry and the underpinning quality of advice that its clients receive. That is absolutely a good thing, because more Australians need advice, they need to be able to rely on that advice, they need to be able to have confidence when they're seeking advice and relying on it. If we can't get that in place, we can't really complain when people are not trusting of the advice they get.\"\nThe regulatory imposition has been \"disruptive\" to the advice industry, but many of the significant changes forced on the industry were justified, Brimble says. \"The journey still has a way to go. The reforms are in place – they're still, in a general sense, washing their way through the sector, and no doubt they will continue to evolve as some of those provisions kick in and move to full implementation phase over the next 12 to 18 months. But it's a broad framework, and if you put all of those pieces of the puzzle, all those building blocks, in place, you're building a system of advice that's more likely to protect the consumer, more likely to perform its role as it should.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:21:23.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
