(PRWEB) October 07, 2015\nSteve Suchil, Western region assistant vice president for state affairs for the American Insurance Association (AIA), issued the statement below following Governor Jerry Brown’s (D) signing of California Assembly Bill 1124. The legislation requires the Division of Workers’ Compensation (DWC) to adopt a drug formulary by July 1, 2017. AB 1124 passed on the final day of California’s 2015 legislative session.\nMr. Suchil’s statement follows:\n“We applaud Governor Brown for signing AB 1124 into law and the legislation’s author, Assemblyman Henry Perea, for his steadfast support on this issue. In a managed care setting, formularies have proven to be an effective tool in assisting with the recovery of patients. AIA supported the legislation and has long supported the adoption of formularies because they have proven crucial to combating the epidemic of opioid abuse in the workers’ compensation system. Formularies will help to ensure successful patient outcomes and proper treatment, and assist authorized users in preventing fraud and abuse.”\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010218.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13010218.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:53:39.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
