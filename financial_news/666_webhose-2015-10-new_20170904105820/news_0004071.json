Nic Walker Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The federal government will encourage the states to open up their delivery of health and education services to competition, arguing that should be their part of the bargain of benefiting from Canberra's push for economic reform.\nMr Morrison also argued that given the government is now prepared to put all tax concessions on the table, then it is only fair that the government also looks at all spending, including welfare, to ensure that too is \"fit for purpose\".\nFresh from Thursday's reform meeting in Canberra between government business, union and community sector groups, Treasurer Scott Morrison said the states could not expect to be passive players in the process.\n\"To be a beneficiary, you've got to be a participant,\" he told AFR Weekend .\n\"If the states and territories are passive beneficiaries in the reform process then the benefit of reform will be quickly swallowed up by service delivery agendas that aren't up to the mark.\"\nMr Morrison said at the next meeting of state and federal treasurers scheduled for later this month, he has put on the agenda recommendations from the Harper Review into competition policy concerning service delivery in health and education.\nReport author Professor Ian Harper said last year that health was a particular area of concern to the review given its growing role in economic activity as the population ages.\nHis panel investigated whether ­government-dominated sectors, such as health and education, could deliver more benefits to the public if there was greater competition with the private sector.\n Examples include looking at whether the supply of equipment and materials could be done cheaper if the private sector were allowed in, rather than being left to the state.\nIt recommended \"each Australian government should adopt choice and competition principles in the domain of human services\".\n\"A diversity of providers should be encouraged, while taking care not to crowd out community and volunteer services. Innovation in service provision should be stimulated, while ensuring minimum standards of quality and access in human services.\"\nMr Morrison said health and education were fast growing areas of the economy and pivotal to jobs and growth. He said he would not be pressuring the states to adopt change but encouraging them to do so.\nTax breaks greenlight Mr Morrison also confirmed that the government was prepared to look at all tax concessions, including superannuation tax rates and capital gains tax for investors, to ensure they were still \"fit for purpose\" and not being used, as in the case of super taxes, for wealth creation.\nHowever, he said it was only fair that the same principle be applied to spending, especially in welfare which is more than one third of government expenditure.\nMr Morrison said the pension cuts he recently ushered through the Senate with the support of the Greens, which undid a generous provision for self-funded retirees introduced by the Howard government, were an example of welfare spending being trimmed to ensure it was \"fit for purpose\" and that the system could remain sustainable.\n\"If we're prepared to consider not ruling things out in the tax system, we should do the same for the payment system,\" he said. ﻿\n\"The payment and tax system go together.\"\nAs social services minister over the past nine months, Mr Morrison led negotiations with Senate independents seeking support to pass abut $5 billion in cuts to Family Tax Benefit payments.\nWhen originally proposed in the 2014 budget, the proceeds were to be used for budget repair but they were subsequently earmarked to help fund a revamped child care system Mr Morrison designed.\nGiven negotiations were well advanced on the cuts, Mr Morrison said he would continue to lead the talks, helped by new Social Services Minister Christian Porter. But he said decision time was fast approaching.\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann asked for their views on spending, which is currently over 26 per cent of GDP. Senator Cormann noted Paul Keating reduced the ratio to less than 24 per cent while it averaged 24 per cent during the Howard years,\nMr Morrison was one of eight ministers who attended Thursday's meeting along with unions, business and industry groups and the community and welfare sector.\nHe said while the level of consensus \"deepened at the meeting\", it remained \"broad but not terribly deep\".\nThere was ready agreement on the challenges the nation faced and the need to stimulate growth and fix the budget, but disagreement on how to best do it.\n\"There's goodwill, but still clear points of difference,\" he said.\nAs well has health and education, the states will be pressured to become more active in the tax debate. Many of the tax issues, especially the GST, and whether to dump inefficient taxes such as stamp duties and replace them with land taxes, are of direct relevance to state governments.\nMr Morrison cautioned that the whole reform push was \"an academic exercise it we are unable to convince the public that this will leave them better off and more capable of dealing with the challenges coming towards us.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:06:19.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
