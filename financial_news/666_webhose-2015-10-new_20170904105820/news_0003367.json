The majority of these are done on paper and then stored in a filing cabinet or faxed. Managing this quantity of paper and updating the forms each year is a nightmare. Introduced on a trial basis last year, TrackW9 has earned wide praise for its ease of use and frictionless path to gathering W-9s, particularly for accounting teams supporting many clients.\n“Our goal is to reduce the use of paper and increase the accuracy of managing the myriad IRS forms that businesses are legally required to keep on file and up to date,” said Sharon Lindsey West, CEO of Track1099.\nJoe Faris, founder of Accountalent Management, started using TrackW9 last year. “It was like a breath of fresh air,” Faris said. “Gathering all of our W-9 and W-8BENs in one place where our team can manage them makes life so easy. Our clients and vendors love it.”\nRequesting a W-9, W-4 or W-8BEN is straightforward. Enter the company information, use the Request Form button to enter vendor names and emails, and click Request.\nThe vendor receives an email with a secure link to fill in their W-9 online, including an e-signature via mouse or finger using a touchscreen. Once that’s accomplished, their status in the TrackTeam dashboard changes from “requested” to “signed.”\nTrackW9 is mobile-friendly. Vendors may fill out the form on their phone, keep a copy for themselves and easily update as needed.\nTry a free 14-day trial at https://track1099.com/info/how-w9-works .
