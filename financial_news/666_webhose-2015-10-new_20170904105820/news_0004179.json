An R1.6 billion profit for the year under review, three airports among the top 30 in the world, and the ACSA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as deputy President of the Airports Council International, the Committee could only congratulate this entity,\" Chairperson Ms Dikeledi Magadzi said. She said this was a good story that needed to be told, and is a vindication that not all state entities are crumbling. ACSA presented its annual report to the Committee on Friday where it revealed that CEO, Mr Bongani Maseko, had been appointed Vice-President of the Airports Council International - an organisation responsible for world aviation. It was also revealed that ACSA had made returns amounting to more than R1.6 billion. The Deputy Minister of Transport Ms Sindy Chikunga told the Committee that three SA hotels based at the Airports had been recognised as among the top ten in the world; while six of South Africa's airports were ranked among the top ten in Africa, and three rated in the top 30 worldwide. Ms Magadzi said she was not surprised by the results, especially following the unannounced visits the Committee had undertaken to OR Tambo and Cape Town International Airports earlier in the year. \"The only aspect of work that ACSA still needs to improve on is the gantry gates at airport, especially during peak hours. But also the issue of standardising the service at the airports that are not operated by ACSA,\" she said.
