Hong Kong added 1.30 percent in the afternoon. Shanghai closed 1.30 percent higher. \n- 'Early Christmas present' - \n\"Mario Draghi and his elves at the ECB practically confirmed there will be an early Christmas present in order for the European economy on 3 December,\" Evan Lucas, a market strategist at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said in an email to clients. \n\"In short, all options are on the table for the ECB, also meaning the Bank of Japan and the Fed are now live events as well.\" \nSpeculation the Federal Reserve will put off an expected interest rate hike until next year has gained traction over the past month as bank policymakers fret over the weak global economic outlook. \nA growth slowdown in China and ongoing troubles in Japan's economy have also exacerbated talk that those countries will soon announce more measures, feeding a rally in financial markets. \nTraders are keeping an eye on China, where the country's leaders are preparing for a top-level policy meeting -- or plenum -- next week, with talk of measures to reform the sprawling state-owned sector to try to improve efficiency. \nGerry Alfonso, a sales trader at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, said: \"The market expectation is that the plenum will continue with its policies to support the economy, particularly in strategically important sectors. \n\"The authorities seem determined to support the economy and that's clearly giving confidence to investors.\" \nThe likelihood that monetary policy will remain more accommodative for borrowers supported high-yielding, riskier, assets, such as emerging market currencies. \nIn morning trade, the Malaysian ringgit soared 1.31 percent and Indonesia's rupiah gained 0.90 percent. The Australian dollar and Thai baht each put on 0.4 percent while the Taiwan dollar was up 0.33 percent. \nSouth Korea's won surged 1.15 percent, with news that the country's economy grew more than expected in July-September also providing strong support. \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this story --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:53:14.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
