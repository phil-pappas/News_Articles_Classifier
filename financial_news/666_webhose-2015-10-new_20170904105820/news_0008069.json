Photo: Getty-Images\nAmazon posts profit as North America sales jump Jeff Bezos just became America's third-richest person.\nThe 51-year-old founder of Amazon.com Inc has so far added almost $US5 billion to his fortune as the online retailer rose in after-hours trading and pushed his net worth above $US55 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos passes brothers Charles and David Koch, and ranks behind only Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in the US.\nBefore Thursday's surge, Bezos's fortune had jumped 77 per cent in 2015 as investors have cheered profits at Amazon and growth in its cloud segment . The $US22 billion year-to-date increase is the most of anyone on the index and more than the combined gains of Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Amazon shares rose 10 per cent from the close to $US621 at 4.47pm in New York. The increase will make him the fifth-richest person on earth, up from the No. 20 spot on January 1.\nAdvertisement The internet entrepreneur's soaring wealth contrasts with that of the Walton family who together control more than half of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer. Alice, Christy, Jim and Rob Walton are among the worst-performing billionaires this year, down a combined $US43 billion as the mass merchandiser invests in stores and e-commerce in an attempt to revitalise sales at the retailing giant.\n\"People don't aspire to shop at Wal-Mart,\" said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners, who has a buy rating on Amazon and is neutral on Wal-Mart. \"An improving economy is a negative for Wal-Mart. As incomes go up, people stop shopping there. Customers enjoy shopping at Amazon.\"\nAmazon shares represent about 95 per cent of Bezos' net worth. The closely held Koch family fortune is spread across a number of industrial companies, including paper producer Georgia-Pacific, oil businesses Flint Hill Resources and Koch Pipeline Company, as well as manufacturers of fertilisers, polymers and fibres. The asset values are calculated using revenue of $US115 billion that's reported on the website of holding company Koch Industries Inc.\nThe second-best performing billionaire this year is Spain's Amancio Ortega, founder of Inditex, the world's biggest clothing retailer, who's added $US15 billion, a 24 per cent gain. China's richest person, Wang Jianlin has added $US11 billion, a 44 per cent rise. Ortega is the world's second-richest person with $US76 billion and Wang is 12th with $US36 billion.\nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's richest people that's updated every business day. It uses prices at the market close in New York to derive the value of publicly traded assets. Thursday's list doesn't reflect after-hours trading.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:07:34.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
