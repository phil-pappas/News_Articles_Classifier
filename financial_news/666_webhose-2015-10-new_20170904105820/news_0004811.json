Simon Dawson Share on twitter by John McDuling One of Wall Street's most powerful investment banks, Morgan Stanley, reported quarterly results this morning. They weren't that spectacular: losses related to private equity investments in China and weak performance for the company's core fixed income business combined to drive earnings down by nearly 40 per cent compared to the same period a year ago.\nShares in the company fell by about 5 per cent in US trading.\nHere, via a Bloomberg transcript, is what the company's Australian born CEO James Gorman had to say about the wild quarter that just passed, and the outlook for the future.\nOn the company's key bond trading business, where revenue sank by 42 per cent.\n\"I think it probably is the worst quarter for FIC [fixed income and commodities] since the financial crisis\"\n\"Clearly, this quarter, it did not perform anywhere near where we want and expect and need it to.\"\n\"I don't think there's a day that you don't read in the newspaper about one of the large banks thinking through the new fixed income market, what it means in this very low rate environment, and what the outlook is. And, given the regulatory changes, how much balance sheet and what sort of risk weighted assets you can hold in the business.\"\nOn heightened market volatility\n \"It was a very unusual macro environment, the volatility in China was almost historic. July was – we were still dealing with, will Greece, won't Greece. September was will she, won't she, which was Yellen. And in the middle was China, which went up and down in a six-month period at an extraordinary rate with artificial intervention by the CSRC and other things that really threw the markets sideways.\n\"So, I would like to think that investors would see those things for what they were, and focus on the core business strategy for what it is\"\nOn the outlook for the rest of the year\n\"Our core long-term strategy remains in place, namely a balanced business model in which the consistency of Wealth Management offsets potential volatility in institutional securities.\n\"Watch this space. We're not complacent but, on the other hand, we don't have a knee-jerk reaction based upon a 13-week period and a very unusual 13-week period at that. But, on the other hand, we are focused on driving up returns for Morgan Stanley.\n\"We've been focused on that for many years. We have seen the results of it on the Wealth Management side. We had, clearly, an unusual hiccup in the Merchant Bank this quarter, which is highly unlikely to repeat itself. And the core banking and Equities businesses continue doing what they are doing\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:50.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
