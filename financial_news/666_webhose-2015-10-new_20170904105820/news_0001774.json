They are leased to Rob's Auto Electrics and Advantage Commercial Kitchens.\nThe site returns $700,000 in annual rental income. It is being marketed by CBRE and Colliers International, which are also selling Bridie O'Reilly's in conjunction with Gross Waddell.\nColliers' Guy Wells said the pub's ground-floor lounge, dining room/nightclub and outdoor courtyard would be sold with one year remaining on the lease and the option of a further five-year term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:13:19.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
