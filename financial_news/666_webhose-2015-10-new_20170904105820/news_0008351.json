Agyepong said a fast thriving company as Zoomlion is bound to face challenges of all sorts, but it is its acknowledgement and responses to such challenges will determine whether or not we will survive. \n“As Martin Luther King Jr once said, the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands in times of challenges and controversy. Our resolve to overcome the challenge is what has brought us this pleasant outcome”, he said. \nHe further said the Corporate Compliance Programme has brought a robust corporate code of ethics and integrity policies and procedures which now remain a hallmark of all our operations across Africa and further afield \nWe took the right steps and thankfully it has paid off, he said adding “I am eternally grateful to God, the selfless and dedicated management and staff of Zoomlion, the government and people of Ghana and all our well-wishers for their tremendous support during the challenging times”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:56:19.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
