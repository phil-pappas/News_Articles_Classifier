Shire (Amsterdam: QB8.AS - news ) declined to comment on the situation. \nTraders added that expectations of new stimulus measures from China, the world's second-biggest economy, were giving equity markets a further lift. \nSigns of a slowdown in China knocked back world stock markets in the third quarter, with the FTSE still down 4 percent since the start of 2015, and down around 10 percent from an April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) record high of 7,122.74 points. \n\"With half an eye on the possibility of more central bank stimulus, stocks have edged out a positive finish to the week,\" said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. \nBurberry was among the worst performing stocks on the FTSE, falling 1.9 percent to extend the previous session's slide, as a profit warning late on Thursday from Hugo Boss (Xetra: BOSA.DE - news ) hit luxury goods companies. \nHugo Boss cut its 2015 sales and profit outlook, while price target cuts from brokers on Burberry's shares on Friday added further pressure to the British company, whose shares had already slumped 8.3 percent on Thursday on weak sales growth. \nGKN and other engineering stocks also fell after brokerage Liberum cut estimates on the sector. \n(Additional reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Toby Chopra and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:56:35.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
