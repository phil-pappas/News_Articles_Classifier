Because some customers didn't update their accounts, they missed their payments, the company said Wednesday in a letter to shareholders. \nWhile not all of the new cards issued will necessarily come with changes that affect use, some will. The main culprit is the expiration date. \n\"There's a pretty good chance that your expiration date might have changed when you get the new card,\" said Matt Schulz, senior analyst at CreditCards.com. \"That could cause a problem when you have a subscriptions.\" \nRelated: Got a new credit card in the mail? Here's why \nBanks have been sending out new credit cards that have a small microchip on the front that make them more secure than magnetic-stripe only cards. \nAutomating payments can be a big time saver. Payments like a gym memberships, streaming accounts, utility bills and subscriptions tend to be attached to a credit card and need to be updated when a new card is issued. \n\"There are a number of things you subscribe to and don't pay on a regular basis that you set and forget that could be impacted,\" said Schulz. \nHere's what you need to do: \nCompare the account number, expiration date and security code against the old card. Any changes mean you have to update automatic payments attached to the card. \nTo find all the automated payments tied to a credit card, follow the digital paper trail. \n\"Look at your online credit card statements going back many months and you will be able to see which transactions are automated,\" said Beverly Harzog, author of Debt Escape Plan. \nYou might also hit a roadblock when checking out at your favorite online retailers: Any saved payment data information will also need to be updated with the new information. \nIf you've missed a payment due to a new card, Harzog recommended calling the creditor and explain what happened. \"I have a feeling they are going to get a lot of calls about this; it's an unusual situation.\" \nWhile one missed payment isn't likely to impact your credit if it's quickly remedied, an undiscovered long-term missed payment will do damage. \n\"The better your score the bigger your drop,\" Harzog said. \nWhile the new cards offer more protection, they aren't invincible to fraud . \"The new cards are going to cut down counterfeiting ... but online fraud is still going to occur so stay on your toes,\" Harzog said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:19:07.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
