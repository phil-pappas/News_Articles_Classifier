Analysts, on average, were looking for 49 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nIn its Financial & Risk segment, which provides news and analytics to financial services companies, revenue was $1.51 billion. The division's net sales were positive in all regions except for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, marking the sixth consecutive quarter the division has seen positive net sales.\nRevenues from ongoing businesses fell 4 percent to $2.98 billion, but rose 1 percent when factoring out currency. Analysts were expecting $3.04 billion.\nThomson Reuters, which is the parent of Reuters News, competes for financial customers with Bloomberg LP, as well as News Corp's Dow Jones unit.\n(Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:16:09.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
