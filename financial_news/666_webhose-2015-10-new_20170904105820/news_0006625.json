Analysts on average expected $1.79 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company bumped up the low end of its 2015 forecast range by 5 cents, helped by the acquisition of chemicals maker Alfa Aesar, and now expects to earn $7.33 to $7.41 per share.\nAnalysts on average are looking for $7.38. Thermo expects revenue of $16.81 billion to $16.91 billion, up from its prior view of $16.72 to $16.86.\n\"With a strong nine months behind us, we're on track to achieve our growth goals for the year,\" Thermo Chief Executive Marc Casper said in a statement.\nThird-quarter revenue of $4.12 billion was down a bit from the year-ago quarter, but slightly higher than Wall Street estimates of $4.10 billion.
