So landlords can consider setting up a company to take ownership of the property or, if they already have a company, moving homes into it. Steve Olejnik, sales director at buy-to-let broker Mortgages for Business, says more landlords will take this option, especially with the sweetener of Mr Osborne’s planned reduction in corporation tax to 18 per cent by 2020. \nHowever, since a transfer is treated for tax purposes like a market sale, it can incur capital gains tax and stamp duty land tax, a consideration that will weigh even more heavily in the south-east where values are high. \nAnother option for a higher rate taxpayer is to transfer ownership of a rental property to a spouse who does not work or has no or very little income in order to maximise their tax-free personal allowance, reducing the overall tax payable. Mr Fay adds a word of warning: “‘Basic rate taxpayers’ means those for whom, even with the full finance interest added back, their total ‘new income’ is within the £50,000 basic rate band as at tax year 2021.” Hassle factors \nThe good news for landlords, at least, is that they can take the time to make the changes necessary to keep their portfolios above water, since the new rules will not take full effect until 2020. \nOver the next few years, though, some amateur landlords with one or two properties are likely to drop out of the sector in favour of professional buyers. “These are the people who are looking to create portfolios and increase value,” says Mr Hooper. \nMr Lawrenson agrees. “It will make the amateur or accidental landlords, people on the margin, think twice about getting into it. They will just see increased taxes that are quite hard to get around. Those people will be more likely to think it’s just not worth it.” Regulators’ unfinished business \nBuy-to-let has been surging ahead in recent years, both by number and volume. Figures this week from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed a 40 per cent rise in the value of buy-to-let house purchases in August compared with the same month in 2014, to £1.4bn. Buy-to-let now accounts for 17 per cent of the total mortgage lending market, amounting to around £33bn a year. \nMr Osborne’s crackdown on the sector is driven partly by the increasing inability of first-time buyers to gain a toehold on the property ladder as prices have rocketed. In 1991, 36 per cent of 16-24 year olds owned a property: now the figure has fallen to 10 per cent. \nRestrictions on mortgage lending brought in last year have also brought more pain for lower-income buyers, by setting tighter controls on affordability. The average price paid for a house by a first-time buyer is now £215,000. \nLending rules may tighten in buy-to-let if the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England moves to impose new regulations on the sector. The FPC is already able to limit the loan-to-income ratios operating in the residential market; the Treasury is consulting later this year on giving it new powers to wield similar controls over buy-to-let lending. The FPC has warned it is “monitoring” an industry it believes could be “ disproportionately vulnerable ” to a crash in house prices and could amplify any problems in the broader housing market. \nThe changes will not stop there . Next March a European directive comes into force for “incidental” buy-to-let owners, who may rent out a property because they inherited it or used to live in it but bought a new home. \nThese will thenceforth be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, though landlords still await details of the exact criteria distinguishing “professional” from “incidental”. If providers are cautious about lending to the latter, says the CML, “one consequence may therefore be that ‘consumers’ wanting to take out buy-to-let loans will have a narrower choice in the market, particularly in the short term.” Seven ways to make buy-to-let pay \nIf George Osborne’s cuts to buy-to-let tax relief threaten to push a landlord into loss on a property, owners can take steps to regain the upper hand. \n1. Remortgage \nLenders are competing to offer attractive buy-to-let mortgage deals, such as a 1.84 per cent two-year fixed rate deal launched this week by Accord Mortgages. Landlords should consider locking in low rates before an eventual rise in Bank of England base rates. \n2. Pay down debt \nBringing down overall mortgage borrowing will help reduce the loss of the tax relief for higher rate taxpayers. Look to the properties with the highest interest charges. \n3. Raise rents \nThe obvious solution for many landlords is to pass on costs to tenants — but they will need to tread carefully in a competitive market. \n4. Sell up \nConsider selling the property with the highest mortgage charges and using the money to pay down debt on the rest of the portfolio. “Extreme circumstances require extreme decisions,” says Stephen Fay, an accountant at Fylde Tax Accountants. \n5. Go corporate \nWrap the property in a company structure or move homes into an existing company structure, since the new rules only apply to personal tax. But watch out for capital gains or stamp duty on transfer. \n6. Spousal transfer \nTransferring a property to a spouse who pays no or very little income tax may help reduce the overall tax payable. \n7. Repair and refurbish \nFor those at the upper end of the basic rate tax band, doing repairs (for which tax relief can be claimed) can prevent them being pushed into the higher rate. For higher-rate taxpayers, a big refurbishment can help justify a boost in rent to new tenants. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
