The index is a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies. \nGold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes up, gold futures will fall as gold, measured by the US dollar, becomes more expensive for investors. \nGold was put under further pressure as a report released by the National Association of Home Builders showed its Housing Market Index rising to 64 in October. Analysts noted this is the highest reading of this measure since 2005. This report may also raise expectations for the housing starts report due out on Tuesday. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:56:02.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
