Vorwerk Kobold has a lot of work to do though to mow down Dyson. Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans Dyson is a clear No.1 in the Australian vacuum cleaner market and often referred to by experts as the \"Apple\" of the category because of its consistent innovation and dominance. Struggling retailer Godfreys is poised to unleash a new brand made by the German firm Vorwerk, the maker of the Thermomix hi-tech kitchen appliance, which Godfreys chief executive Tom Krulis believes has the potential to shake things up in a big way in the $1.3 billion sector.\nHe says the Kobold range by Vorwerk which will begin appearing next week has the capacity to make serious inroads and help Godfreys out of a sales slowdown, and he points to the United States market as an indicator of how shifts in the marketplace can occur over time, with the Shark brand having overtaken Dyson in that market.\n\"Innovation is what's driving our industry and its happening every day,\" Mr Krulis says.\n\"Innovation is winning out\".\nHe says everyone in the vacuum cleaner industry respects what the British brand Dyson has been able to achieve over the years, and he says it is similar to Apple in phones and computing, and Tesla in the development of electric cars.\n\"Hats off in that regard to Dyson\".\nBut he says the Vorwerk Kobold range is a potential game-changer. It comes from the same firm behind the big-selling Thermomix kitchen appliance which has been popular around the world.\nMr Krulis says it will go on sale from next week in Australia through Godfreys stores and there are high hopes.\n Quality of cleaning matters Dyson has been at the forefront of design advances and fashion, but Mr Krulis says in the end it is the quality of the cleaning that matters most to householders.\n\"At the end of the day it is about efficacy\".\nMr Krulis is hoping the Verwork Kobold range will help deliver renewed momentum after the company told shareholders at its annual meeting on Wednesday that trading had been slightly weaker than expected and full-year profits would now only be in line with last year. Godfreys made a net profit of $12.9 million in 2014-15.\nA limited range of Dyson vacuum cleaners have been sold through Woolworths' Big W chain since mid-2013, while Dyson is also available through the Target chain owned by Wesfarmers, expanding its mass-market appeal.\nJames Fleet, the chief executive officer of Appliances Online, part of the broader Winning Group of retail and online stores, says both Dyson and Miele are very popular brands with the customer base.\n\"We have a high order value,\" Mr Fleets says, outlining that customers are generally looking for top of the range machines. Dyson in particular was highly sought after because of its clever design and aesthetic appeal, and its strong performance.\nMr Sweet also says that \"stick\" vacuums with a long thin handle are becoming increasingly popular, with Dyson leading the charge.\n\"There's definitely a trend toward that\".\nCredit Suisse analyst Matthew Nicholas says the Godfreys profit downgrade highlights the fragility of the market but that new products should support a stronger second half result. Godfreys floated on the ASX in December, 2014 with an issue price of $2.75, but the shares have fallen below that and Credit Suisse says they are now trading on a price-earnings multiple of 7.8 times, which is at a large 49 per cent discount to the small industrials index.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-10-22T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:12:27.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
