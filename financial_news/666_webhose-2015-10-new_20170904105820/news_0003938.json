Sepsis is a disease with a confirmed very high unmet medical need that may affect any person. It often starts with unspectacular, mostly bacterial but also viral, fungal or parasite infections. However, it then seizes the entire body with a very high rate of mortality of up to 30% - 80%, depending on the severity. Close to 20mio cases of sepsis are assumed worldwide per year. The average population mortality rate related to this devastating inflammation is about 60-80 per 100'000. Moreover, up to 50% of the survivors suffer from the post-sepsis syndrome (PSS). World-wide, sepsis is one of the most expensive diseases requiring intensive care unit and emergency room settings. Currently, there are no approved sepsis-specific drugs available. 1abtik now sets out to provide novel, potent antibody drugs required to lead such program to success. 1abtik is uniquely positioned for this purpose by planning to integrate unappreciated latest scientific data and disease target molecules with highest potency, tailor-made antibodies and in-depth know-how in the field. Past efforts to fight sepsis could neither profit from the recent scientific progress nor from the significant further development of high-end therapeutic antibodies.
