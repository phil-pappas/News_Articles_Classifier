Silver reached a low around $US14.13 an ounce on August 26, and a peak near $US15.50 in September – a mere 8.4 per cent rise, indicative of a moderate lift in demand. It's currently about$US15.67.\nThe reason is, said Perth Mint Group Manager Neil Vance, that most of the world's silver is used for manufacturing or jewellery. Minted silver is a fraction of the market, with its own market dynamics, and these have been coming into play recently.\n\"It's a small part of the market, no doubt,\" he said.\nThe Perth Mint is Australia's official bullion mint. Along with the Royal Australian Mint, it is also one of the only two mints producing coins for legal tender, such as the 20¢ coin. The Melbourne and Sydney mints closed decades ago.\nTo be sure, geopolitical events have played a role in the increased demand for coins and bullion, as with silver generally.\n\"It goes back to the first of July, when the Greek debt crisis raised its head again,\" he said. \"Then there were concerns about the Chinese stock market. What we've seen is certainly a boom in silver.\"\nBut demand for minted product has far outstripped that for silver generally, said Mr Vance.\nSpeculative buying of coins and bullion had also fuelled demand, he said. \"There's a lot of buyers out there who feel there's a silver shortage and they panic buy,\" he said. \"There isn't actually a silver shortage, it's just the manufacturing capabilities of getting the coins to market.\"\nAs well, the launch in September of a new line of Australian silver bullion coins \"certainly helped,\" he said. \"This takes us more into that high-volume silver coin trade the US Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint would be in.\"\nShortage of minted product Mr Vance said that with the extra demand there was actually a shortage of minted product not only in Australia but in the world generally. \"The US Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint are both on allocation. They've both had to increase capacity to deal with this,\" he said. \"We're all in the same situation of not being able to supply the market's demands.\"\nThe US Mint began setting weekly sales quotas for its flagship American Eagle silver coins in July because it can't meet demand, and the Canadian mint followed suit after record monthly sales in July.\nIt was too early to tell trends for this month, he said. \"October figures are too early to tell but we believe October and November will be very strong months.\"\nMr Vance said that although the mint charged a premium on top of the market's silver price for its minted product, that premium had not increased in recent months.\nSales of gold coins had also markedly increased, said Mr Vance, going from 33,390 ounces in August to 63,791 in September. \"But that's been a pattern for the last three years,\" he said.\nSilver tends to track the price of that other previous metal, gold, except with more volatility. Gold, at $1142 per ounce, is currently 76 times more expensive than silver – historically, quite a wide spread. In 2013, the ratio was only about 60.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:15:41.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
