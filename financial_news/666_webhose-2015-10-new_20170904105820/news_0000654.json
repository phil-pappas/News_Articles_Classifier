I could not sleep last night,\" said Yilin Jiang, 23, Brunel student from Guangxi province. \n- Rebuilding relations - \nCameron heralded the visit as \"a very important moment for British-Chinese relations,\" but promised to address the protesters' concerns. \nHis spokeswoman told reporters Monday that \"nothing is off the table\" and insisted that he would raise human rights with Xi. \n\"By developing a strong and engaged relationship with China based on an approach of constructive engagement, that means we are able to talk to them about issues where we might differ,\" she said. \nPrince Charles and wife Camilla officially kicked off the visit when they picked up the president at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel before taking tea. \nCharles, heir to the throne and a supporter of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, will not attend Tuesday night's state banquet. \nBritain says the visit will lead to commercial deals in a range of sectors including financial services and energy, open up export opportunities for British business and draw investment in infrastructure projects. \nFollowing criticism from Labour over the steel industry crisis, Cameron promised to take the issue up with Xi during their talks. \nBritain's courtship of China is being masterminded by finance minister George Osborne, Cameron's closest ally and a favourite to succeed him as prime minister, who spent five days in China last month. \nWhile Britain's economy is growing, Osborne is currently implementing a package of austerity measures as he seeks to reduce a record deficit. \nThe visit comes amid increasing evidence that China's economy, the world's second-largest, is slowing down. \nOfficial figures Monday showed it grew 6.9 percent in the third quarter of this year -- its slowest pace since 2009. \nBut Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at analysts IHS Global Insight, called the visit \"a very important strategic opportunity\" with China still forecast to become the world's largest economy by 2027. \nThe Chinese-British relationship has been rehabilitated since Cameron met the Dalai Lama in 2012, sparking an angry response from Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:17:14.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
