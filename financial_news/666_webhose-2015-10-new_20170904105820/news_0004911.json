But you must pay in £1,000 and set up two direct debits before the incentive is paid. The account also pays in-credit interest of 2pc on balances up to £3,000. \nHalifax also matches TSB's offer with a £125 bonus for customers who switch, who don't need to go through a third-party website. \nAnd you could be left worse-off by switching just for a cash bonus, warned Andrew Hagger from Moneycomms, the financial analyst. \n\"You'll get a quick cash hit but you could end up with a bank account that’s not suitable for your day-to-day needs,\" he said. \n• Should you ditch the Santander 123 account when its fee jumps to £60 per year? \nBut the TSB Classic Plus account is one of the best on the market. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) pays a high interest rate of 5pc on balances up to £2,000 - beating any easy-access savings account. \nBut high overdraft fees and debit card charges while abroad could cancel out these perks, Mr Hagger warned. \nHe added: \"It’s pretty much a rule of thumb for most accounts - good credit interest equals expensive agreed overdrafts.\" \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:53:48.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
