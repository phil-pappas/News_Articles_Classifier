I retired three years ago after 34 years as a finance manager in the computer industry. I’m turning 65 this month and live with three greyhounds (also retired). I do volunteer work for garden conservancies, feral cat trap-neuter-return, retired greyhounds, and in winter do tax prep for the elderly and disadvantaged.Having gone through a period of character building poverty in my twenties, I’ve always been mindful about spending, but five years before I retired I got serious about tracking the minutiae so that I’d understand exactly where my money was going, and what level of income I’d need to live comfortably in retirement.[tweet_Quote: display=\"Thanks to a detailed annual budget this retiree hasn’t had to deprive herself or her dogs of anything. #MyLast10Buys\"]Since retiring, I give myself an annual budget by expense category and track actual spending against it. This helps with my spending decisions throughout the year and my planning for the next year, and I haven’t had to deprive myself, or the dogs, of anything.[/tweet_Quote: ]\n [caption id=\"attachment_18456\" align=\"\" width=\"1763\"] Sarah Jane[/caption] Saturday 1. Emergency Vet Visit: $161.27 When a thin skinned greyhound comes in from the yard with a bloody round scrape on her side, you head off to the vet even if it's Saturday. (This retired person tries to get everything done during the week so that working folks can have the stores and vets on weekends. You’re welcome.) Three year old Birdie left the vet a little woozy with seven staples and antibiotics. The bill seems low, so I'm half expecting a call from the office manager to tell me what they forgot to charge me for. 2. Printer Cartridge: $16.98 What a great online price! It was over $40 the last time I ordered a replacement cartridge. That probably means something is about to go extinct, and I won't be able to find that size next time. That particular printer is ancient but great for light photocopying. It's tempting to stock up on ink now just in case something goes end-of-life, but if I do, that's pretty much a guarantee the device will die. So ok, just one for now. Sunday 3. Happy Critter Pet Food: $63.00 I’m vegetarian, but the dogs are carnivores with two freezers of their own. This month I stocked up on human grade chicken parts. The month before it was tripe and venison and chicken and I spent almost three times as much. Their annual food budget is close to mine, but there are three of them. 4. Keurig K-Cups: $83.94 The shame of disclosing this environmentally unfriendly purchase is enough to make me promise that I'll investigate and convert to other options for fast decaf coffee. Someday. Maybe. It's the only vice I've got left and that's a three-month supply. Does it help at all that I recycle everything else and gave up caffeine three years ago? Monday 5. Long Term Care Insurance: $3,636.85 I just scheduled this annual expense online for payment. Yes, it hurts! But paying annually instead of quarterly or monthly saves almost $300 (effective 8% interest) that I suppose I could donate to some environmental charity as penance for those K-Cups. (See above.) LTC is one of those investments I hope I never need to use, even as I multiply the annual payment by the estimated number of years remaining in my life and hope to get something back. It's a \"yikes\" moment either way. But the necessity of this type of insurance for a healthy and active -but nevertheless aging- person was driven home to me last year when I fractured the top of my femur in the yard (yes, the dogs were involved) and the surgeon threw in a hip replacement during the repair process. I was lucky to be back on my feet the day after surgery and driving in two weeks, but what if I hadn't recovered so quickly? LTC is peace of mind. 6. Trader Joe’s: $55.67 $44.57 for me - mostly to support my hoarding of seasonal products involving pumpkin or cranberries. $11.10 for three boxes of Pumpkin cookies for the dogs. I food hoard for them too. Tuesday [caption id=\"attachment_18455\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Sarah Jane, Birdie and Neffles[/caption] 7. Sam’s Club - Rotisserie Chicken: $5.29 After years spent training Neffles (seven year old greyhound) not to stick her nose in everything, she’s now going to night school to learn to stick her nose in everything. Little bits of cooked chicken give her the incentive to ignore me and run around in a big room sniffing things. Yes, this is a real class that I paid money for: Nosework 101. 8. Sam’s Club Pharmacy: $99.77 That’s my co-pay for 3 types of eye drops for upcoming cataract surgery. Since there was no one else in line at the pharmacy, I showed the pharmacist the manufacturer’s coupons from the ophthalmologist and asked if my net price with the coupons was better or worse than my net price using my brand new Medicare Advantage plan. This is something old people do, and I regret this. Let’s just say there’s a business opportunity for a price modeling tool in prescription drug land. I have no idea if he used the coupons, and don’t care since I got out of there while it was still daylight (it’s scary to drive at night with cataracts), for under $100. 9. Cat Rescue Donation: $100 I miss having a cat, but the life expectancy of a cat (20+) is longer than my own at this point. So I stopped at a local rescue to browse for a cat with a more limited long-term outlook –a teenager or an FIV+ kitty. I left empty handed, but since I got a good dose of cat therapy, and the volunteers didn’t even ask for a donation, I left a check. Wednesday 10. Farmers Market: $36.25 Eggs, tomatoes, broccoli, potatoes, melon. Not all for me. I share. In the winter, my neighbor is usually out plowing my driveway before I even know it’s snowing. If I don’t rush right out, my car will get cleaned off too, and the walks shoveled. So in the nice weather when I go to the farmers market, and my neighbors are locked up somewhere working, I pick up a few things that I know they like and leave a surprise bag at their backdoor. Favorite item? Cat rescue donation. I got the love without the litter-box. Any regrets? K-Cups. I’m going to have a cup of French Roast decaf while I think about this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:11:09.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
