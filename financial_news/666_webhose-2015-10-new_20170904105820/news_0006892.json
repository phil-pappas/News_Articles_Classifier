But its CrownBet wagering brand has continued to incur start-up losses, despite revenue growth.\n'Not without its challenges' Crown's newly installed chairman, Rob Rankin, told shareholders the company had challenges as it worked its way through a multibillion-dollar pipeline of projects spanning from Melbourne and Sydney through to Las Vegas and Macau.\n\"I am very positive about the future of this company, but it is not without its challenges, both locally and internationally,\" said Mr Rankin. \"In particular, we will need to execute very well on our development pipeline to deliver acceptable and attractive returns. In other words, we will be more focused on maximising Crown's net profit after tax for the benefit of all shareholders.\"\nCrown's net profit in 2015 fell 18 per cent to $525 million as an increase in corporate costs, a poor performance from Macau and moderate growth from its Perth casino weighed on revenues.\nThe Melbourne-based gaming giant said disappointing results from its Macau business have continued in the 2016 financial year, following declines in gross gaming revenue from the second half of 2015.\nThe Macau casino operator part-owned by Mr Packer's Crown Resorts will seek talks with lenders on the $US3.2 billion ($4.4 billion) Studio City casino after authorities approved just 250 gaming tables for the complex on Tuesday, dashing hopes it would meet a 400-table commitment.\nHowever, Mr Rankin said the casino player was content with the long-term growth picture for Macau.\n\"While a lot has been said recently about the significant trading slowdown in Macau, in my mind this is short-sighted,\" said Mr Rankin.\n\"Macau is a market that has been beneficial to Crown and we have great faith in its long-term development. We should always remember that the Macau gaming market is still around five times the size of the market in Las Vegas and that last year, Macau accommodated 31.5 million visitors, the vast majority from the mainland.\"\nMr Rankin said Crown remained confident in the strength of China's economy, despite a recent slowdown, noting the country became the world's largest tourism market last year.\n\"I am an optimist when it comes to China's long-term future,\" said Mr Rankin. \"Yes, there will be setbacks and this growth won't be linear, but we believe that the Chinese government will continue to support their economy, in order to lift more of its people out of poverty.\"\nOn Monday, Crown said it would use a $1.5 billion, 90-storey hotel and apartment complex in Melbourne's Southbank as a possible blueprint for a new luxury hotel brand to be rolled out among its other properties.\nCrown shares rose 2.33 per cent to $11.84 in early trading on the ASX on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:10:48.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
