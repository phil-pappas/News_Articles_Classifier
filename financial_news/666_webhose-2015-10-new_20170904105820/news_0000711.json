Greece cannot deal with debt just through reforms and adjustment,\" he said.\nThomsen said that the discussion on how to provide debt relief to Greece has shifted from a nominal haircut on the stock of its debt to capping gross financing needs.\nThe chairman of euro zone finance ministers told Reuters on Thursday that there was broad support for capping Greece's financing needs at 15 percent of GDP annually.\n\"What the exact targets should be, we will have to discuss, but there is no doubt in our mind that if Europe wants to go the route of providing relief by lengthening the grace period and lengthening the repayment period, we are looking at a significant lengthening of the grace period and significant lengthening of the repayment period,\" Thomsen said.
