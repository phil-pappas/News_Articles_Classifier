It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is our people who will suffer,\" he said. \n\"You all know that God is love and I appeal to all of you to do the best and leave the rest to God.\" \nKaunda, Zambia's founding president, meanwhile prayed that God would help Lungu solve the country's woes. \n\"God continue to help us solve the problems this young man may face in future,\" said Kaunda as he placed his hand on Lungu's head. \nThe Zambian football association postponed all of Sunday's games and the government had announced that bars should not open until 6:00 pm. \nCritics of the government have accused Lungu of failing to tackle the causes of country's economy troubles, saying that the prayer day was a distraction. \nDuring the session Bishop Peter Ndlobvu hit back at the critics. \n\"The Bible says gold and silver belong to God. If we pray, God will restore our economy\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:33:18.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
