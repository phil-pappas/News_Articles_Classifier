REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production declined in line with expectations in August, as the energy sector reversed gains made in July and only durable consumer goods output showing robust expansion.\nIndustrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.5 percent month-on-month for a 0.9 percent year-on-year gain, Eurostat said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent monthly decline and a 1.8 percent annual gain.\nEurostat also revised data for July to a 0.8 percent monthly fall from an increase of 0.6 percent and to a 1.7 percent year-on-year rise from the previously reported 1.9 percent.\nThe August monthly expansion was chiefly driven by a 2.3 percent increase in production on durable consumer goods. Intermediate good output expanded by 0.2 percent.\nBy contrast, energy production fell by 3.0 percent in the month after a 2.1 percent rise in July, which economists attributed to a heatwave early that month, with air conditioning on overdrive.\n\nFor details of Eurostat data click on: \nhttp://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/ \n\n(Reporting By Philip Blenkinsop)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:44:44.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
