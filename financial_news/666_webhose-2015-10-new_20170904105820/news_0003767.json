We own some of the most iconic tourism parks in NSW and will be keeping the tourism where it represents highest and best use of land,\" he said.\nIngenia sold 100 homes in its lifestyle villages last year and has forecast 120 sales this financial year. \"Over time we'd like to grow it to a significantly higher number,\" he said.\n﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:30.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
