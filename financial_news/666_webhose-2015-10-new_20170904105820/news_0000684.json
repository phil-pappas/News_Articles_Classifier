The report came a day after Mattel reported disappointing third-quarter results. Mattel was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $1.13 to $23.67. \nSURPASSED EXPECTATIONS: Industrial conglomerate General Electric reported a decline in third-quarter profit, but strong performances from its core units helped the company top Wall Street expectations.
