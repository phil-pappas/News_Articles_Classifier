David Rowe Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth For a few ghastly moments it appeared that Monday night's horror show might all be a terrible misunderstanding.\nThere was the regulation couple, embattled but resolute, framed in pastoral surrounds, interspersed with lingering views of tranquil bush settings, a leisurely introduction.\nIf there's a minor criticism, a few more bird calls from the marvellous Australian bush might have added to the timbre.\nHere is Prince Charming in his day job as Fair Work Commissioner Michael Lawler, plighting his eternal troth to his partner, former Health Services Union president Kathy Jackson, though with a sad dearth of bird songs.\nHere is Prince Charming plighting his eternal troth to his partner, though with a sad dearth of bird songs. David Rowe She wipes his brow ready for his close-up shot as he whispers, \"I love that girl.\"\nHarried, bewildered glances. How had it come to this? Where had they taken the wrong turn?\nIndeed, that's where the confusion arises. Lawler's and Jackson's performance seemed so misguided it raised the question whether they had actually intended to appear in the soft focus of Australian Story , but by mistake ended up on Four Corners . It's a mistake anyone could make.\nTo describe Monday night's program as car-crash television does not begin to do justice to the compulsive awfulness of the moment.\n It was like watching a car roll over. And over, and over, and over. It was impossible to look away, even as the viewer had to ask repeatedly: what on earth were they thinking?\nThis was Living With the Kardashians meets Silvania Waters. Reality television, always the home of narcissism and delusion, now has an impossible edge.\nThere seems nothing Lawler and Jackson were not prepared to share with Four Corners journalist Caro Meldrum-Hanna, or to label as Too Much Detail.\nIn July, Justice Richard Tracey in a civil case in the Federal Court found that Jackson had misappropriated $1.4 million of Health Services Union funds, which included $175,000 for travel over eight years.\nA balcony in Santorini And here are the home videos they shot on those trips, beginning with Jackson sitting on the balcony of the lovely apartment they stayed in at Santorini in the Aegean,with Lawler's ever-present voice-over.\n\"That's the front door. Pretty spectacular view. Hello Sweetheart.\"\nCut to Jackson in London. \"Picadilly Circus; there's Eros. What have you got to say for yourself, Sweetheart?\"\nAnother London street scene: \"Sweetheart? How are you? We're at Covent Garden.\"\n\"It turns out that I have been the beneficiary of, um, airfares and a small amount of accommodation that was paid for by the union,\" Lawler tells Four Corners. \"I didn't know that at the time.\"\nThere's the Acropolis in Athens, and Yosemite national park in the US.\nIt's tremendously reassuring that this money has been well spent. Seeing corrupt money wasted is so disappointing.\nBut that's the point of this uncomfortable candour. Lawler and Jackson don't believe it's corrupt money.\n\"If I thought that I was actually the recipient of stolen money, I'd be wanting to repay it myself,\" he says.\n\"No, I did not take anything from the HSU,\" says Jackson. \"Ever . . . that I wasn't entitled to. I do want to qualify it like that because they'll come out and say 'You spent money on this travel.' Yes I did; I was entitled to that.\"\nThen there are the 60 secret phone tapes Lawler has made dating back to 2012, which are of questionable legality. He says he was entitled to make them to defend himself.\nWe hear his conversations with his boss, Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross (and won't he be surprised, as Lawler points out), and angry conversations with Ian Rofe, QC, the barrister suffering from dementia, whose fortune Lawler was managing.\n'I've got a lot of ground to cover' If there is a logic to this, it lies in the five-hour video blog that Lawler made on July 24, also provided to Four Corners : \"I've got a lot of ground to cover and I do want to talk to ordinary Australians.\"\nTheir story has always been about power.\n\"It is a thing that is concerned with the way in which power is acquired and maintained within unions, and acquired and maintained within the ALP,\" Lawler says.\n\"It is a thing that is concerned with the relationship between the unions and the ALP and the manner in which the factional system in the ALP operates.\"\nLawler is referring to what he calls the Machine, which he says is a complex conspiracy involving senior Labor figures and corrupt union officials to discredit and destroy Jackson and himself.\nNo one is listening to them because \"no one has read the material, or they're too scared\", he says.\nThis is the nature of the bargain that Lawler and Jackson have struck. Once darlings of the media, the Liberal Party and the Dyson Heydon's royal commission, for the corrupt dealings Jackson exposed at the HSU, now no one is listening.\nThis is their attempt to go over everyone's heads, to appeal to \"most Australians\" who would regard what they are doing as \"an honourable and decent thing to do\", as Lawler put it.\nThey showed their most embarrassing sides and insisted, \"But there's nothing wrong with that.\"\nThey were entitled to it. Like former Labor member Craig Thomson. Liberal Peter Slipper, former HSU rival Michael Williamson: all of them were entitled to their time at the trough.\nThis is not an ethical question. Legal definitions overrule everything â€“ is there documentation to show the spending was approved?\nLawler ends the show seemingly lost in a hall of mirrors, voicing both sides of a dialogue with Jackson: \"But darling . . . now, is there anything you need to worry about?\"\n\"No, there's nothing I need to worry about.\"\n\"Well, it remains to be seen whether she's right about that or not,\" Lawler concludes. \"If it turns out that she's committed offences, well then so be it: the consequences will be what they are.\"\nAlan Bond would understand. He misappropriated a billion dollars, but it wasn't stealing, because the courts accepted that he intended to return it.\nBondy got it. If he was alive today he'd be on Four Corners too, with Swiss holiday footage of his delightful new friend Jurg Bollag.\nCristal champagne anyone?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:02:03.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
