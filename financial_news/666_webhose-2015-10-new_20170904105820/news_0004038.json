( SSRI ) ( SSO.TO ) (\"Silver Standard\") provides its third quarter 2015 operational results for its Marigold and Pirquitas mines.\nHighlights:\nDelivered gold production to schedule at Marigold: Produced approximately 41,300 ounces of gold, on track to achieve increased 2015 production guidance.\n\nContinued strong production at Pirquitas: Produced 2.6 million ounces of silver, 5% above our second quarter production and on track to deliver record annual silver production.\n\nIncreased ore tonnes at higher grade to leach pads at Marigold: Stacked ore increased to 7.2 million tonnes and gold grade increased to 0.43 g/t as the mine loaded approximately 70,000 recoverable ounces to the leach pads in the third quarter.\n\nIncreased throughput at Pirquitas: Milling rate increased by 18% to 410,000 tonnes milled in the third quarter. Paul Benson, President and CEO said, \"We delivered strong operating results at both mines in the third quarter of 2015 with increased quarter-on-quarter production at Pirquitas while Marigold stacked more ore tonnes, setting the mine up for a strong fourth quarter. Silver Standard is well-positioned to meet our increased annual production guidance at both sites through our relentless emphasis on operational excellence.\"\nPirquitas mine, Argentina\n\n\nQ3 2015 \nQ2 2015 \n% Change \nTotal material mined \nkt \n2,746 \n3,087 \n(11.0%) \nWaste removed \nkt \n2,219 \n2,320 \n(4.4%) \nStrip ratio \nw/o \n4.2 \n3.0 \n40.0% \nSilver mined grade \ng/t \n188 \n172 \n9.3% \nZinc mined grade \n% \n0.33% \n0.69% \n(52.2%) \nOre milled \nkt \n410 \n347 \n18.2% \nSilver mill feed grade \ng/t \n238 \n262 \n(9.2%) \nZinc mill feed grade \n% \n0.57% \n0.69% \n(17.4%) \nSilver recovery \n% \n82.0% \n83.7% \n(2.0%) \nZinc recovery (zinc concentrate) \n% \n40% \n51% \n(21.6%) \nSilver produced \n'000 oz \n2,576 \n2,443 \n5.4% \nZinc produced (zinc concentrate) \n'000 lbs \n2,076 \n2,674 \n(22.4%) \nSilver sold \n'000 oz \n2,819 \n2,623 \n7.5% \nZinc sold (zinc concentrate) \n'000 lbs \n2,352 \n4,936 \n(52.4%) \nNote : Percent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table. \nThe Pirquitas mine produced 2.6 million ounces of silver during the third quarter of 2015, higher than the 2.4 million ounces produced in the second quarter of 2015. The quarter-on-quarter increase in silver production is primarily due to the higher amount of ore milled, as silver mill feed grade and recovery remained relatively in line with the previous quarter. The mine also produced 2.1 million pounds of zinc in zinc concentrate during the third quarter. Pirquitas is on track to meet our increased 2015 silver production guidance of between 9.5 and 10.5 million ounces, which would result in a record annual silver production for the mine. We recognized sales of 2.8 million ounces of silver and 2.4 million pounds of zinc for the quarter.\nOre was milled at an average rate of 4,454 tonnes per day in the third quarter of 2015, 17% higher than the average milling rate of 3,815 tonnes per day in the second quarter as the planned mill rate increased after the second quarter maintenance shutdown. Ore milled contained an average silver grade of 238 g/t, 9% lower than the 262 g/t reported in the second quarter. The average recovery rate for silver was 82%, consistent with the average recovery rate in the previous quarter.\nMarigold mine, U.S.\n\n\nQ3 2015 \nQ2 2015 \n% Change \nTotal material mined \nkt \n18,425 \n19,051 \n(3.3%) \nWaste removed \nkt \n11,242 \n14,163 \n(20.6%) \nStrip ratio \nw/o \n1.6 \n2.9 \n(44.8%) \nOre to leach pad \nkt \n7,183 \n4,888 \n47.0% \nGold grade to leach pad \ng/t \n0.43 \n0.33 \n30.3% \nGold recovery \n% \n70% \n68% \n2.9% \nGold produced \noz \n41,262 \n48,685 \n(15.2%) \nGold sold \noz \n39,525 \n48,121 \n(17.9%) \nNote: Percent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table. \nThe Marigold mine produced 41,262 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2015, as expected and on track to meet our increased 2015 production guidance of between 195,000 and 205,000 ounces of gold. The increase in both tonnes and grade of ore stacked on the leach pads this quarter is expected to result in increased gold production in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the third quarter, we completed construction of the new leach pad and stacked sufficient ore to commence irrigation. We recognized sales of 39,525 ounces of gold for the quarter.\nA total of 18.4 million tonnes of material was mined in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 19.1 million tonnes mined in the second quarter. Approximately 7.2 million tonnes of ore were delivered to the heap leach pads at a grade of 0.43 g/t gold, which represents approximately 70,000 recoverable ounces of gold stacked during the quarter. The grade mined in the third quarter was 30% higher than the second quarter, as mining progressed deeper into the Mackay pit. The strip ratio decreased by 45% compared to the second quarter due to the continued positive reconciliation of ore tonnes. Gold recovery rate was 70% in the third quarter compared to 68% in the second quarter due to the higher grade mined.\nQualified Persons\nThe scientific and technical data contained in this news release relating to the Pirquitas mine has been reviewed and approved by Trevor J.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic U.S. reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. In addition, the SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning \"Measured Mineral Resources,\" \"Indicated Mineral Resources\" or \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute \"reserves\" by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. U.S. investors should understand that \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Moreover, the requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of \"reserves\" are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by us in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as \"reserves\" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nCommodity Markets Silver Standard Silver Standard Resources Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:57:02.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
