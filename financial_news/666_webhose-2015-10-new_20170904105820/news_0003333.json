A previous proposed contract was rejected by rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler in voting late last month.\nThe UAW Chrysler Council will meet in Detroit at 11 am/1600 GMT on Friday to discuss the agreement and vote on it, the union said.\nThe UAW had previously told the company that it would terminate the current labor contract if a new four-year contract deal was not reached by 11:59 pm EDT on Wednesday/0359 GMT on Thursday.\nThe company confirmed it had reached a tentative agreement but said it could not disclose details ahead of the UAW membership vote.\nA union spokesman gave no details of the talks including whether the company was willing to sweeten the deal it offered the UAW that was approved Sept. 18 by the union leaders but rejected last week by 65 percent of its rank-and-file Fiat Chrysler membership.\nWorkers have said they turned down the previous contract because many wanted a two-tier wage and benefit system eliminated. Short of that, they sought a cap on that lower-paid second tier at 25 percent of the total union workforce. Many workers also wish to undo some of the concessions they have given since 2007 to keep the company competitive.\nIf this agreement is ratified, the UAW will try to use the pact as a template for negotiations with the U.S. operations of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.
