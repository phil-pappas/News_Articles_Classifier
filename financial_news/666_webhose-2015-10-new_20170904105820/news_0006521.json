The company cited disappointing results from a well drilled in the Chukchi and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment. \nInterior Secretary Sally Jewell said the federal government is cancelling federal petroleum lease sales in U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Arctic waters that were scheduled for 2016 and 2017. \n\"In light of Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) 's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half,\" she said in a statement. \nJewell added the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast and the Beaufort Sea off the state's north coast will not be included in the agency's next five-year lease sale plan. And current leases held by Shell and other companies in Arctic waters will not be extended. \nBeaufort Sea leases are set to expire in 2017, and Chukchi Sea leases in 2020. \nCurrent market conditions and low industry interest made the leasing decision easier, Jewell said in a release. \nRoyal Dutch Shell PLC is the only company actively exploring off Alaska's northern costs. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) applied to extend leases in both the Chukchi and the Beaufort. Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) requested an extension for Chukchi leases. \nShell spokesman Curtis Smith said the company disagrees with the agency's decision not to extend current leases. \n\"When it comes to frontier exploration in Alaska, one size does not fit all,\" Smith said by email. \"We continue to believe the 10-year primary lease term needs to be extended.\" \nIn denying the extension, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's regional supervisor for field operations, Keven Pendergast, said Shell had not met the criteria to extend its leases, including providing the agency with a work schedule on them. Shell could apply again, he said. \nEnvironmental groups strongly oppose Arctic drilling . They say industrial activity will harm marine mammals already hurt by a loss of sea ice, and global warming would be accelerated by burning oil found in the Arctic Ocean. \nMiyoko Sakashita of the Center for Biological Diversity lauded the Interior (LSE: 0OIC.L - news ) Department's announcement. \n\"This is great for the Arctic and its polar bears,\" Miyoko Sakashita said. \"We need to keep all the Arctic oil in the ground.\" \nMike LeVine of oceans advocate Oceana added: \"Secretary Jewell's decisions today are consistent with the law as well as economic and environmental realities.\" \nGov. Bill Walker, however, said the decision will harm Alaska. He had personally lobbied Jewell to extend Shell's leases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:35:46.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
