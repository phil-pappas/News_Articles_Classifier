Prudential Ghana, which is part of the global financial services group Prudential plc, now has more than 750 agents and over 70 staff, and serves more than 1.3 million customers. \nPrudential Ghana’s agency model offers the company’s agents a clear career path and brings the expertise developed in the Group’s large and growing Asian markets into Ghana for the benefit of both agents and customers. The Ghanaian training team is in turn taking those skills and innovations to Prudential’s younger African businesses in Kenya and Uganda. \nAlan Yarrow, the Lord Mayor of The City of London, said at the event: “It is a pleasure to see such a vibrant example of a trusted UK brand collaborating with Ghana to build a sustainable and effective insurance industry. Innovative skills transfer of this nature is an important part of that story.” \nEmmanuel Mokobi Aryee, Chief Executive Officer of Prudential Life Insurance Ghana, said: “It is an honour to have as distinguished a guest as the Lord Mayor visiting our training event. We are strongly committed to developing the financial services industry in Ghana, and the Lord Mayor’s presence is a sign that our commitment is recognised at the highest levels.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:31:40.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
