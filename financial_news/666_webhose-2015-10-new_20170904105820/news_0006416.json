Sun was the first Chinese player to score in the Premier League. \n- 'Strongest partner in West' - \nThe British government is keen to promote its \"Northern Powerhouse\" project, in which councils in the post-industrial north of England are being given more powers in an attempt to stimulate their economies. \nXi had lunch with around 200 business and civic leaders at Manchester Town Hall, where hundreds of organised British-based Chinese greeted his arrival, waving Chinese flags handed out from cardboard boxes. \nA small number of protesters were grouped with a banner demanding \"Justice For Human Rights\". \n\"We see ourselves as China's strongest partner in the West,\" Britain's finance minister George Osborne said during Xi's tour of the city. \n\"A partnership is a relationship where we do things together, like build nuclear power stations, invest in modern science, regenerate cities like Manchester. \n\"A partnership is also where you can have frank discussions about issues like the future of steelmaking or cyber security or, indeed, human rights.\" \nA clutch of business contracts have been announced during Xi's four-day visit, as well as the launch of the first yuan-denominated bond in London as China seeks to internationalise its currency. \nAs part of a raft of partnership deals, Hainan Airlines announced its first direct flights from Manchester Airport to China, before Xi flew home from Britain's third-biggest air hub. \nMeanwhile British police arrested a survivor of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and raided his home after he stepped out in front of Xi's motorcade, police and campaigners said Friday. \nLondon police said Shao Jiang was arrested and later released on bail on suspicion of \"conspiracy to commit threatening behaviour\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:41:17.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
