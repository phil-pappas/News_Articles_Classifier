We recently bonded over our single motherhood, and she shared about her financial situation, which is largely subsidized by state benefits. My friend is an example of the middle class stuck in a grey zone-- earning a middle-class income, but unable to afford a modest existence without government help. The benefits are so valuable that she is not motivated to earn any more than she does, lest she lose her state benefits. A bit about my friend: A year ago she separated from her husband, and re-entered the workforce after 6 years as a stay-at-home mom. Today she works in admissions at a local college, earning $36,000 per year. Her kids' dad pays her $700 monthly in child support. She also receives about $40,000 in benefits from the state, in full-time day care for two of her children, free school lunches, winter heat assistance and health insurance for the four of them. Her children are ages 6, 4 and 1. She drives a 2000 Subaru station wagon, they don't take vacations and she shops for clothes at the Good Will. Any extra money is used for car repairs, holidays, weekend activities with her kids, and miscellaneous needs, like the recent vacuum cleaner she purchased.Even though my friend is excited to be working again, and grateful to have landed a professional job, she is careful keep her income below $44,868 per year -- the cut-off income for Wisconsin Shares child care subsidy program for a family of four. Between her job and child support, her income is about $44,400. While she enthusiastically takes advantage of overtime work at her job, she opts for comp time en lieu of extra income. \"The time is more valuable to me, especially since I want to make sure I don't earn over the limit for benefits,\" she says.Needless to say, she's not motivated to earn more, since even a few more thousand dollars would mean she would loose about $40,000 in benefits. In other words, she'd have to double her income. \"Maybe in a few years when my kids no longer need day care, I can afford to be more ambitious,\" she says. (Check out \" When Work Doesn't Pay for the Middle Class \")She and her ex-husband have talked about reuniting. But if that happens, she would argue for staying legally separated or divorcing, since reuniting legally would again mean loss of benefits. \"I have married friends who are way broker than I am because they don't qualify for benefits,\" my friend says.Here is her monthly budget:Take-home income: $2,500 Child support $700 Income: $3,200 Rent: $1,180Food $500Electric: $200Gas for car $90Car and renter's insurance: $100After-school care for eldest child: $480Internet $60Diapers, toilet paper and shampoo $75 House cleaner $160 Expenses: $2,845 \"I didn't major in economics in college so I could work harder to make less money,\" she says. \"[tweet_Quote: display=\"Why this educated woman can't get off welfare: &quot;The system punishes people for being poor.&quot; via @forbes\"]The system is broken and punishes people for being poor[/tweet_Quote: ] .
