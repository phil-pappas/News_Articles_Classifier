The eurozone region was in the depths of a debt saga, but the FTSE soared on this date, after the IMF confirmed it would raise new funds from Europe. \nBritain's benchmark index is now down 10pc since hitting a high in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) of 7,104 and only last week, it recorded its worst quarter in four years following a torrid summer, during which commodity prices were hammered amid concerns about China's slowing economy. \nMike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, said: “The positive opening call comes thanks to another positive US close, which spilled over into Asia extending recent gains as investors add to risky bets on expectations of prolonged easy monetary policy.” \nA dovish message from the US Fed FOMC minutes on Thursday suggested there would be no move in interest rates until 2016, reducing uncertainty about a move before the end of the year, Mr van Dulken said. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) became the biggest FTSE gainer in early trade after announcing it would cut 500,000 tonnes of zinc production , or around 4pc of global supply, in its latest attempt to overcome the weakness in commodity prices. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) leapt 6.4pc to 128.5p, as the news triggered a rally in zinc prices. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) advanced 4.7pc, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) rose 3pc and Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) was changing hands at 592.5p - a gain of 2.5pc. \nMike McCudden, of Interactive Investor, said: “Commodities are on the rise as confidence appears to be returning and investors have switched back to 'risk-on' mode. \n“However, the underlying story behind these moves is fear of more turmoil from the Asian markets and investors are taking the gamble that China's problems have dissipated.” \nMeanwhile, Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) became the biggest laggard after Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) downgraded the stock, following its announcement earlier in the week that it will take a majority stake in the Irish department store Heatons. \nHaving started covering the FTSE 100 stock only six months ago, the investment bank said it had made no discernible progress in Continental Europe. \n\"The only deal the company has announced, since the original Austrian and Baltics deals back in May 2013, is the potential acquisition of its remaining 50pc stake in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , rather than expanding its presence into a new market,\" analysts said. Shares in the retailer slid by almost 3pc in morning trade. \nEuropean shares continued to gain momentum, and are set to record their largest gain since January. The CAC in Paris is 0.86pc higher and the German DAX leapt 0.94pc in early morning trade. \nOvernight, Asian stocks rose, with the Shanghai Composite Index advancing 1.32pc and the Nikkei 1.6pc higher, boosted by the dovish message from the Federal Reserve and gains made by oil prices. \nUS equities on Wall Street closed at their highest level since August, with the Dow Jones Industrial Index 0.8 higher and the S&P 500 climbing 0.9pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:08:55.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
