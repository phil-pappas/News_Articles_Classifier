Today most of our distribution centres were obviously built for the purpose of serving stores. We are changing that to have a stronger [each] capability for moving individual items.” \nMcMillon said Wal-Mart will connect its various types of distribution centres and improve its inventory accuracy and efficiency. \n“Optimising the inventory in our system is a huge lever to serve customers better and to take a lot of cost out, not only through transportation and handling but also through markdown elimination,” he explained. \n“A dynamic connected supply-chain with improved forecasting leveraging predictive analytics can serve customers and reduce cost by merging truckload, pallet, case and each movement. Accurate inventory placement is a really good way to make money. Moving forward our supply chain will be an even more effective asset, if it is resilient and more sustainable. \n“We are actively engaged in reshaping the systems in which we work. We cannot only strengthen our business but use our scale and our capabilities to make a real difference in the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:27:59.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
