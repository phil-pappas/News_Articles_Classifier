Paul Jeffers by Fiona Carruthers You’ve come second three times since you first ran the Cup in 2011. Did someone say “bridesmaid”?\nLook, everyone knows it’s the toughest 3200 metres in the world. You try running it. (Loud snort). Just making the final field of 24 is pretty good – can I help it if some other horse always runs past me? What’s wrong with silver anyway? It’s still worth $900,000 to the boss.\nHow do you rate your chances on the first Tuesday in November?\nOn the plus side, I don’t have much weight this year: just 55 kilograms; that’s the lightest weight I’ve carried since 2011. I’ve also got the brilliant French jockey Gerald Mosse in the saddle again for our third Cup together. (Hey, maybe ask the Frenchman why we keep finishing second!) On the downside, there’s a lot of form this year, including Aidan O’Brien’s two runners; Michael Bell’s gelding Big Orange and the Japanese horses.\nKnown as “Red” and “Cads”, the nine-year-old English gelding Red Cadeaux is one of the world’s best-travelled horses. In 2014 he became the only international horse to run in four successive Melbourne Cups. Getty Images Your travel schedule is impressive. Regular destinations for work?\nAustralia six times, Hong Kong five times, three trips to Japan, Dubai twice and Singapore. I’ve raced all over England, plus a few cheeky side trips to Ireland. I love Australia, wouldn’t mind retiring here actually – the Australian horses are so laid‑back. Hong Kong is another favourite given my owner [a senior partner with King & Wood Mallesons] Ronnie Arculli is based there. He loves me; Ronnie calls me his personal ATM.\nFavourite way to relax at home in Le Grange stables in Newmarket?\nMy guilty pleasure is an all‑over body brush and curry comb. I’m generally pretty easygoing and my track rider Steve Nicholson loves to brush me. I’m just a bit ticklish around the flank.\n Top travel tips?\nStay hydrated on the plane with plenty of buckets of water. As soon as we land, I hit the sandpit – a good roll twice a day helps shift the jet lag. Last year, Rob was worried I was getting bored at Werribee, even though I have a five-star stable there with all mod cons. So he took me to Altona Beach. Rob looked a right goose standing there in his shorts. I pretended I wasn’t with him. There were a lot of paparazzi to catch me frolicking in the waves, but I love the spotlight, so that was OK. Hopefully we’ll get back to Altona this trip. A change of scene keeps a horse fresh.\nWhat would you never leave home without?\nA good jockey. No, seriously. Rob and my trainer Ed Dunlop are also essential. Rob has been with me since I was a yearling, so we’re a bit like the odd couple. He always packs my favourite exercise saddle (it’s Australian, made by Zilco), plus my head-to-tail rug for chilly Melbourne evenings.\nWhat’s next?\nLet’s see how I pull up after the Cup. If I’m good to go, we’ll head home via Hong Kong for the Group 1 Hong Kong Vase. I won it in 2012. Maybe I can repeat the magic.\nBiggest achievement?\nThey say I’ve won more than $10 million in prizemoney, but hey, who’s counting? Probably Ronnie now that I think about it.\nFavourite Seat 1A story?\nI only fly first-class cargo and my average long-haul flight costs $80,000 one way. (Sadly, horses don’t get frequent flyer points though.) On previous trips Down Under, I’ve been on the same flight as [Melbourne Cup winner] Dunaden a couple of times, but we don’t talk much. I haven’t forgiven him for beating me on the line by a whisker in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:02:56.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
