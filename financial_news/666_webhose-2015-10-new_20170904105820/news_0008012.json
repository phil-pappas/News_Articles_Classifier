Darrian Traynor by Agnes King Edmund Tadros PwC has proven itself the most productive accounting partnership in the country for the third year running with each partner generating an average of $3.5 million in fees in the year to June 30, 2015.\nBut it is no longer the only big four accountancy firm where ­partners generate in excess of ­$3 million revenue each.\nFor the first time, KPMG has also broken that barrier with each of its 402 partners generating an average of $3 million in fees during the 2014-15 fiscal year.\nPwC's 492 partners earned a total of $1.7 billion in fees in the year to June 30, eclipsing its nearest rival, KPMG, by more than half a billion dollars, according to The Australian Financial Review Accounting Partnership Survey.\nGary Wingrove CEO and Peter Nash Chairman of KPMG. Sasha Woolley The survey uses annual revenue divided by total number of partners as a benchmark for accountancy firms' productivity - how much each partner bills regardless of whether they are equity or salary partners. The metric doesn't take into account partner's seniority or how much equity they hold.\nInteractive: Accounting Partnership Survey The nature of private partnerships make them incredibly opaque, however, industry sources say PwC had its most profitable year on record in 2014-15.\nIt has thinned its senior management ranks and focused some leaders back into market facing roles.\nShow me major firms ranked by key 2014-15 data total partners over time financial year revenue over time revenue per partner over time\nGraphic An extreme focus on cost control does not always equate to a palatable organisational culture. But it is the mandate Luke Sayers was elected on when he became chief executive of the Australian practice three-and-a-half years ago.\nGary Wingrove also upped the ante on KPMG's high performance culture when he took the chief executive reins in 2013, tweaking the remuneration model by lowering base salaries and increasing stretch targets.\nThe results speaks for themselves. KPMG's 402 partners earned an average of $3 million each and $1.2 billion collectively.\n\"We're focusing on increasing the value of equity and bringing in new partners - it's quite achievable in this market to get both,\" KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash said.\nErnst &Young's 461 partners earned an average of $2.8 million each and aggregate billings of $1.3 billion. EY profits are said to have rebounded after suffering during its regional integration a few years ago. The regional integration is widely regarded as a strategically brilliant move that saw the Australian practice integrate more closely with fast-growing Asian markets.\nWhile ranked second on the basis of annual income, Deloitte ranked eighth in terms of revenue per partner due to its much larger partnership. Deloitte uses a different definition of partner to most accounting firms which inflates its partner group to 632, a significant jump on its closest rival PwC (which has 492 partners).\nDeloitte's revenue of $1.3 billion averaged out to $2.1 per partner, behind much smaller rivals including insolvency specialists KordaMentha, PPB Advisory and McGrathNicol.\nCounter to perceptions drawn by AFR's survey, Deloitte is \"an extremely profitable partnership\", according to chief operating officer David Hill.\n\"Our strong track record is evidence of that - we don't have an issue with being able to recruit people laterally or execute acquisitions based on remuneration,\" Mr Hill said.\nHe said if Deloitte ever was a laggard in the profit stakes - and he's not convinced that's the case - it's not an issue anymore.\nCrowe Horwath had the fastest growth in revenue per partner of any surveyed firm, up 17 per cent to $2.2 million for each of the firm's 221 partners. This was not altogether a glowing result, given it is in large part due to a steady exodus of senior staff as the group's performance floundered, culminating in a takeover by KKR-backed financial services firm Findex.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, revenue per partner at McGrathNicol fell by 16 per cent, to $2.3 million for each of the firm's 29 partners.\nOther partnerships to suffer a fall in revenue per partner were William Buck (down 7 per cent to $1.2 million per partner), HLB Mann Judd (down 2.5 per cent to $1.2 million per partner), Nexia Australia (down 0.8 per cent to $1.2 million per partner), BDO (down 0.5 per cent to $1.5 million per partner) and KordaMentha (down 0.4 per cent to $2.75 million per partner)\nThe drop in McGrathNicol and KordaMentha's are expected given the cyclical nature of insolvency and restructuring work. Big ticket engagements in this field peaked in 2013. The modest reduction is actually a testament to the extent these firms have diversified their offerings as a buffer against deep troughs.\nA changing of the guard are responsible for reductions at William Buck, Nexia and HLB. A number of senior partners retired throughout 2014-15 and it is normal for earnings to dip as junior partners enter the partnership.", "external_links": ["http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/survermenu/accounting_620.png", "http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/survermenu/accounting_550.png", "http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/iframeresizer/iframeResizer.min.js", "http://www.trans4mind.com/personal_development/HTMLGuide/iframes2.htm"], "published": "2015-10-20T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:12:03.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
