However, he is also concerned that 99% of the conversations and focus of the government is on infrastructure, whereas little or no mention is made of the economics of the sector. The economics, he insists, have to be right for the current investors to achieve desired returns, which is what will then attract the prospective investors currently on the sidelines. He intends to leverage on his professional journey of three decades that spans Accountancy, Consulting, Banking, Infrastructure Investment Advisory, Project Management and ICT, both locally and abroad, to achieve his heart's desire... \nHow do you view the impact of the new government in general and regarding your area of interest, Power, in particular? \nCompared to the past administration, the new government is a welcome change. However, if we benchmark with global standards, I would like to see more intensity and a sense of urgency in the current administration. It's just that Nigerians are very sentimental and we tend to celebrate too early, on the premise of complacency. I would say that the new government still has so much to cover and I prefer to reserve my celebration to much later. \nMy focus in public governance is in the Power or Energy sector. As you know, there is so much that needs to be done in the Sector, which also has reciprocal effects on all the other sectors. The Nigerian electricity market is in its teething stage since privatisation effectively took off on November 1, 2013. I am concerned that 99% of the conversations and focus is on infrastructure, whereas little or no mention is made of the economics of the sector. Meanwhile, the economics have to be right for the current investors to achieve desired returns, which is what will then attract the prospective investors currently on the sidelines. Let me give you an analogy, if 100 people are struggling to enter a \"land of opportunity\" and only 17 succeeded in making it in, but come out crying or come out disappointed, what do you think the attitude of the remaining 83 would be? I reckon most of them will turn elsewhere to look for greener pastures. The potential investors are watching and gauging the pulse of the buyers of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Successor Companies (i.e. the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) and the 6 Generation Companies (GenCos)) to determine whether or not they will stake their investments in the Nigerian electricity market or go to other climes. \nExplain what you mean by the Economics of the Electricity market. It is true Nigeria has about the lowestenergy per capita of any developing economy (4,500 MW for a population of 170 million with a 30% penetration to the hinterland). Please note that this is energy generated and not energy that reaches the consumers. By the time you discount the power lost through transmission, rejected power and other losses/wastes, we'll be lucky to achieve a throughput of 3,000 MW. Who pays for the balance? The DisCos? Certainly not!Ironically, the consumers are being made to pay for electricity they sparsely consume. We must account for every MegaWatt generated till it reaches the end-user. Let me give you a stunning statistics. At today's generation capacity of 4,500 MW, the cumulative amount billed by the DisCos is about N23 Billion monthly, whereas only about N13 Billion is channeled back for settlement to the market participants. Meaning that a monthly revenue shortfall of N10 Billion is being experienced - this is a colossal capital erosion! From November 1, 2013 to date, the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) cumulative revenue shortfall is about N230 Billion. If I were Mr. President, the day I hear of this huge shortfall, I will step into the matter forthwith and stop the bleeding. One would have expected this issue to be flagged by the Transition Committee and also latched on with urgency by the current Administration. We don't have to wait for a Minister to be appointed to do that! By the way, there was an Intervention Facility (bail-out) of N213 Billion by the Central Bank (CBN) towards the end of the last Administration; this was primarily a consequence of this accumulated shortfall I talked about. Tell me, for how long will the CBN continue to bail out the Power sector? \nPicture this scenario - if we turn on the 5,400 MW of the 10 National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) plants today to increase our overall capacity (assuming we have commensurate capacity for transmission, which I bet we don't have), then our generation capacity would hit approximately 10,000 MW. Great accomplishment you'll say, but wait till you hear this. Based on current trend, one could extrapolate that the monthly shortfall would riseto N22 Billion or N264 Billion per annum. That is what the late Fela Anikilapo-Kuti called Double wahala! This market will collapse in no time if this revenue shortfall trend continues. \nThis is why I reiterate that, while we look at progressive capacity expansion in Generation, Transmission and Distribution, we must first stop the bleeding of this monthly shortfall and solve that immediate problem. The higher the Generating capacity, the higher the magnitude of the revenue shortfall, if we continue without stopping the bleeding. \nHow can we solve such a problem? Who is losing this money as we speak? Who is responsible for solving the problem? \nThere are two critical operational roles that form the 'engine room' of the Electricity market - System Operator and Market Operator. Global best practices have the two roles combined as Independent System Operator (ISO). You may liken it to the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) in the financial market or the Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) for the Stock Market. The ISO is the clearing house for the electricity market - calibrates power flow across the value chain and funds settlement to market participants. These two roles ought to have been merged and licensed since the Transitional Electricity Market (TEM) was declared on February 1, 2015, in accordance with the Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act of 2005. At the time of privatization, these two roles were under the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and were grossly inefficient in closing the shortfall we are talking about. The gap during the era of the PHCN was subsidized by the Federal Government before it was stopped. But, the monthly shortfall accrued to N213 Billion before the CBN bailed out the sector with a NESI Facility in April 2015. \nDuring the twilight of the last Administration, they hurriedly appointed about 25 executive positions to run the ISO and Transmission Service Provider (TSP) establishments. However, I struggle to understand how the ISO can deliver with the lack of adequate competence in the structure and the excessive appointment of executives. To do what? As the saying goes, too many cooks spoil the soup. In the societies where electricity privatization has been successful, the roles of an ISO are to: Coordinate generation scheduling, commitment, dispatch and transmission outages; Schedule transmission and generation outage coordination; Perform demand forecasting and transmission congestion management; Ensure proper metering of all connection points across the network; Report of scheduled and planned actions and unexpected occurrences to network users and the Regulator; Procure and operate grid management and monitoring tools (i.e. SCADA, telecoms, IT); Supervise compliance withand enforce the Grid Code and Operational Procedures; Test and monitor Users' equipment to ensure their compliance with the Grid Code; Coordinate International transmission; Create a sustainable Energy Supply Mix and forecast Future Needs; Procure and schedule ancillary services and system planning for long term capacity; Administer the wholesale electricity market, including the activity of administration of settlement payments; Direct oversight responsibilities on performance monitoring of market participants and users of the grid; Execute and administer bilateral contracts between market participants; Supervise compliance with and enforce provisions of the market rules and procedures. \nFor an electricity market with an Annual Turnover of N276 Billion, shouldn't we have a formidable ISO in place for accountability, transparency and effective service delivery across the electricity value chain? Unless and until we have this function operating efficiently, we will continue to experience revenue shortfall and God forbid, this would be the bane of the privatisation programme! The shortfall is currently charged against the DisCos and the Market Operator isunable to fully settle the Market Participants for services rendered, hence the electricity market is in a deficit. This is partly why the Market Participants are unable to inject capital for expansion and refurbishment of the utilities they acquired. Unfortunately, there is a threshold at which the break-even point for profitability is not met, hence they complain and sometimes threaten force majure. \nIf you were given this responsibility, how would you tackle it? How would you stop the bleeding and make the Electricity Market whole? First, I would approach it with a consultant's helicopter view to restructure the organization. I will determine the current business process and proffer a LEAN management structure that is significantly automated. I will also determine the current electricity dispatch regime and metering at each node for effective billingto the respective DisCos. Simultaneously, I will carry-out a backward review, which I won't like to share now so as not to pre-empt issues based on consequences. My ultimate objective will be to know where the leakages are and immediately stop the bleeding. With my three decades of Systems Evaluation and Business Modeling, we will figure this out methodically within a period of 60 to 90 days. \nAs a Chartered Accountant, Banker and IT expert, how and when did you delve into Power (Energy)? \nGood question! I actually had my BSc. degree in Engineering-Physics from the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) and in 1985 was the best graduating student in Materials Science. Subsequently, I trained with Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) to become a Chartered Accountant and then joined the Banking industry. I rose to become a General Manager of eSolutions and Commercial Banking. After my executive MBA in 1999 at the IESE (Lagos) Business School, I relocated to the United States to upskill in IT and also gain some global exposure. While in the States, I worked for Oracle Corporation as a Business Solutions Expert, automating system processes for public sector institutions. Thereafter, I began to align my career towards nation building and was invited to serve as a Special Assistant to the last Minister of Power, Professor Chinedu Nebo. My purview was Investments, Finance & Donor Relations and my job was to mobilize Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to the privatized Power sector.This prompted me to understand the entire electricity value chain and identify what would be the bargaining chips for prospective investors. As an Investment Banker, you must be able to convince your client that their capital is secured and that they will reap a reasonable Return on Investment (ROI). So what I did was to gain an in depth understanding of the entire value chain, and also study successful and failed privatizations of various electricity sectors in different countries. I discovered that the key success factor was the efficiency of the Independent System Operators. We must get it right here in Nigeria! \nDuring your period of service, what can you point out as your accomplishments in your assigned role? \nI joined the Ministerial team in May 2013 with so much enthusiasm and high expectations. My first discovery was the manual and inaccurate data being generated by the dysfunctional Market Operation office in TCN. This was revamped and we now have a Power Collect platform, which is fulfilling some of the requirements of the function - there is still more enhancements to be done. During September 2013, the Minister charged me to arrange a forum for the prior President during the 2013 United Nations General Assembly. With 10 days' notice and without funding, I got 15 top United States Corporate Executives, with interests in the Nigerian Power Sector, to attend an exclusive dinner at the New York Waldof Astoria. However, the prior President was not able to attend and he was represented by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy & Minister of Finance. During the meeting, we got a commitment of $13 Billion, which however, was dependent on resolving the Energy Economic equation I talked about earlier. Following this in October 2013, we participated in a United States-Africa Investment Summit in Chicago, during which Nigeria's booth was the prime attention because of the international communities' anticipation of the Nigerian electricity market privatization. We had prime speakers led by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Power, Ambassador Godknows Igali, who reeled out the Federal Government's transformation agenda with utmost passion. The world witnessed the largest privatization initiative of this century less than a month later. The high level of interest and inquiries prompted us to convene a Nigeria Power Sector Investment Conference at the Presidential Villa in March 2014. We were able to invite over 1,000 participants, of which more than 300 were Corporate Executives from 56 countries, including all the major Infrastructure Development Financing Institutions and Agencies. We had myriads of Expressions of Interest in specific areas of the electricity market. This was the apt moment we could have established a one-stop shop for the Power Sector Project Office and an Energy Investment Fund, but we missed it due to indecision and bureaucracy. It was a devastating experience for me then because we couldn't deliver on our promise. Since then we've held several such fora locally and abroad, including the World Economic Forum, whereby we kept reiterating the abounding opportunities in the NESI, but because we do not have a firm structure on ground, we have not been able to harvest these prospects. The very last one was held in Washington DC during our current President's visit to President Barack Obama in July 2015. The Investors and Operators' enthusiasm is still high, but we need to put our house in order for them to be constructively engaged. \nHow do you envisage the ISO will impact the electricity market if properly structured and resourced with the right leadership and technology? \nThe Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry needs a phenomenal game-changer by establishing the Independent System Operation function to have a structured organization to serve as the Sector's engine room, responsible for very vital services that would foster the development of the sector. This is now a commercialised market, so things must be done differently than in the PHCN era. The ISO's functions are mostly, at best, currently being performed by ad-hoc committees, with no accountable arrow-head. Things can't work that way! Nigeria's electricity system is expected tobecome more participatory. The ISO must work to ensure that information is accessible and relevant and that its services provide the support needed for effective participation in the market or in its various programs and services. It would strive to work with all parties in the sector, to be impartial and transparent, recognizing the need for an increasing role for consumers in NESI. There is talk about establishing a Power Sector Infrastructure Fund and approaching the National Pension Commission (PenCom), etc. to invest in it. True! This is an imperative for the capacity generation and delivery to consumers in order to attain the desired level of 20,000 MW or more. We need capital injection upward of $20 Billion to achieve this capacity expansion and it would mostly come from international investors. However, investments are not done on sentiments or mere prospects of consumers' appetites. They are based on economic fundamentals, which would drill into ROI at the current level and efficiency of the market. All these parameters must be at the fingertips of the ISO. I have a model for this and if given the opportunity, I'll be glad to share with the new Administration. I have been privileged to meet with the Vice President, HE Professor Yemi Osinbajo, on this subject a few weeks ago and subsequently submitted an Advisory Report for his perusal. As a concerned citizen of our great nation, I'll be obliged to assist the Administration in any capacity to ensure the success of the Electricity market privatization programme. The world out there is waiting forus, however, we must package our Electricity market in such a way to attract FDIs. We have the right talent and expertise, and I am confident that South Africa's MW per capita will be child's play compared to where Nigeria could end up. Industrialization, real sector development and standard of living would be at the highest level in this country. However, we must first get our Energy Economics right! \nYou sound so optimistic and I'm impressed with your confidence. Can you share some tips on how you intend to make these happen? \nLet me break it down as follows: We need to operate the System in Real Time by ensuring that sufficient electricity isavailable whenever and wherever it's needed to meet demand in an ongoing and highly complex process, requiring the close coordination of all parts of the system. Every five minutes, ISO forecasts electricity demand throughout the network and directs the GenCosto provide the required amount of electricity to meet that demand. It can also reduce demand by calling on large volume users to cut back on consumption. This process of balancing supply and demand repeats itself 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We need to prepare for Future Energy Needs - The ISO also plans and prepares for the country's future electricity needs. It forecasts and assesses the country's current and short-term electricity requirements, as well as the adequacy and reliability of the integrated power system. For the longer term, it forecasts energy demand up to 20 years and identifies sustainable electricity solutions well into the future. The ISO is specifically charged with creating integrated regional plans that allow for more customized approaches to meet evolving electricity needs throughout the country. The ISO works with local stakeholders in each of the distribution territories to develop integrated solutions for maintaining a reliable supply of electricity. We need to create a Sustainable Energy Supply Mix - To meet the country's energyneeds, the ISO must secure new supply to meet future demand for energy, whether through contracts or market-based approaches. It does this by procuring new generation capabilities, identifying transmission needs, and developing conservation measures while working toward a clean energy supply mix. This could be achieved by conducting investors' fora and workshops (locally and overseas) to promote the opportunities available in NESI, reviewing Expressions of Interests and guiding the investors' entry into the market. The ISO establishes and manages thousands of contracts with a range of suppliers - from large grid-scale clean and renewable generators and distribution-connected producers to communities, small businesses and individuals developing small-scale projects. The ISO must develop a strategy in line with the President's Sector Transformation Agenda to grow power delivery from the current dismal level of 4,500 MW to 20,000 MW by the year 2020, with a diffused energy mix. We need to work in Consultation with Partners - The ISO and its stakeholders must work together on a new, shared vision for Nigeria's electricity sector - a vision that encompasses cleaner supply, smarter delivery systems and more involved consumers. Its outreach should be broad - extending beyond the traditional confines of the electricity sector, including individuals, businesses, NGOs, municipalities, States and Federal MDAs, consumers who are also GenCos, schools and hospitals. Engaging stakeholders and communities should be an integral part of the ISO decision-making process- helping transform the sector for the benefit of all. As a result, the ISO would develop an extensive stakeholder engagement program reaching out to communities, market participants, sector stakeholders and the public at large. We need to foster Conservation - Conservation is key to meeting the country's future electricity needs - providing the cleanest and most cost-effective alternative to building new generation capabilities. The ISO coordinates nation-wide conservation efforts as part of the new Conservation First Framework to be developed, working closely with local distribution companies and other partners to deliver innovative programs to businesses and residents to help them reduce energy usage. This will be in line with the Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Policy. The Conservation First Framework is designed to reduce electricity consumption significantly. The ISO would offer a suite of incentives and programs for residential and business customers. It also works to expand the conservation market by supporting the development of new technologies and services. We need to efficiently operate and settle the Wholesale Electricity Market - The ISO oversees the wholesale electricity market, where the price of energy is determined. It also administers the rules that govern the market and, through an arm's-length market monitoring function, ensures that it is operated fairly and efficiently. The current situation of revenue shortfall and periodic Intervention Facility or dependency of Sovereign guarantee is not sustainable and discouraging to the prospective investors as I mentioned earlier. Hence, the #1 priority would be to ensure that the market is made whole within 60 to 90 days and I can assure you that this is achievable! The market, however, can play a broader role in helping to address the country's changing energy and environmental needs. The ISO supports the development of market-based approaches to managing the nation's longer-term electricity system needs - such as a capacity auction. Further enhancements will strengthen the overall market, enhance reliability and provide Nigerians with greater access to information about their power system. \nYou touched on minimising dependence on Sovereign Guarantee, which by my understanding is the role Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) is playing to attract investors. Wouldn't there be conflicting role with NBET? \nThere would be no conflict if the mandates are clearly dimensioned. NBET's role is critical at this time because the market is volatile and just emerging, hence the guarantee they provide is meant to give the investors confidence that their fundsare secured. I give this analogy - when you start learning a bowling game (a game I love so much), you require rails at both sides so that your ball doesn't fall into the side gutters. By the time you become proficient, you don't need the rails any longer. Likewise, a toddler uses a walker to balance himself and strengthen the legs and gradually gets confident and starts to walk by himself. That is the role NBET is serving for this electricity market; it's not a company to remain in perpetuity. NBET is well structured to do this, however, because the ISO function is deficient, NBET is scope-creeping into the ISO's role, which would mean that as time effluxes, the ISO function would dis-integrate. Would Nigeria then perpetually be providing Sovereign guarantee even when our generation has hit 20,000 MW? That would be suicidal! My take is that the ISO function be strengthened, appropriately resourced and compelled to deliver on its functions so that this market can become more competitive and every market participant be duly settled promptly and fully. Then, we would say that we have succeeded in the privatisation of our electricity market. We can do it! \nI believe Nigerians would want to see that time come and hopefully, you will be pivotal to taking us into that Promise Land. Here I am . . . and it would be my privilege and honor to lead us to the Promise land! On a lighter note, my Christian name is Joshua and I believe you know the rest of the biblical story. Together, we can achieve the extra-ordinary for our great nation, Nigeria.
