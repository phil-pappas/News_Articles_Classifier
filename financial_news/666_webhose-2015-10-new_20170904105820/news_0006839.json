Its next household survey is due to be published in December. \nThe Bank has also highlighted the impact of rate rises on consumer spending, which drives around two thirds of UK growth. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) calculated that each percentage point rise in interest rates was likely to reduce total household spending by around 0.5pc. \nBorrowers are already taking action to shelter themselves from an increase in the base rate. Bank data show 79pc of new home loans taken out in the second quarter of this year were fixed rate mortgages. This is up from 38pc at the beginning of 2008. \nHowever, the data also showed more than half of all mortgages are still linked to the Bank of England base rate, although this has come down from a peak of 72pc in 2012. \nMr Carney also highlighted that real wages had \"not come back to their level before the crisis\". While record low inflation means real earnings, are growing at their fastest pace in close to a decade, they remain 6pc below their pre-crisis peak, according to official data .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:52:33.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
