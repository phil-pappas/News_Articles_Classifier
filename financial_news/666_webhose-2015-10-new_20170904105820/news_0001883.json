( 1.usa.gov/1LxpYU6 )\nTwitter poached Kordestani from Google Inc on Wednesday, the latest step in the company's turnaround efforts under Jack Dorsey, who last week was named permanent CEO.\nKordestani's appointment was a move by Twitter to allay concerns about Dorsey's dual role as head of mobile payments company Square Inc.\nOn Wednesday, Square filed for its long-expected initial public offering.\nKordestani, 51, joined Google as its 11th employee in 1999 and stayed for 10 years. After a few years away, he returned full-time in October 2014 as chief business officer.\nAt Google, Kordestani had an annual base salary of $237,500 and stock awards of about $123 million, according to the latest Google proxy filing.
