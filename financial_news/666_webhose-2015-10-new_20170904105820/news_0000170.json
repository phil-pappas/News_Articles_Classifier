( LRN ), a technology-based education company and leading provider of proprietary curriculum and online school programs for students in pre-K through high school, today announced guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 (\"FY 2016\") and the first fiscal quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2016 Outlook \nRevenues of $830 million to $865 million, compared to $948.3 million for the full fiscal year of 2015. The year over year decline is largely due to the Agora Cyber School shifting from a managed to non-managed program. The net impact of this transition is approximately $110 million for the year. Operating income of $17 million to $23 million, compared to $18.4 million for the full fiscal year of 2015. Capital expenditures, defined as curriculum development, software development, purchases of property and equipment and capitalized leases for student computers, of $70 million to $80 million, compared to $76.5 million for the full fiscal year of 2015. Effective income tax rate of 39% to 41%. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Outlook \nRevenues of $218 million to $222 million, compared to $236.7 million in the first quarter of FY 2015. The year over year decline is largely due to the Agora Cyber School shifting from a managed to non-managed program. The net impact of this transition for the first quarter is approximately $25 million. Operating loss of $20 million to $22 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.2 million in the first quarter of FY 2015. Operating losses in the first quarter relate to the seasonality of SG&A costs at the beginning of every school year, which includes enrollment center and promotional expenses. Capital expenditures, defined as curriculum development, software development, purchases of property and equipment and capitalized leases for student computers, of $15 million to $17 million, compared to $22.9 million in the first quarter of FY 2015. The following table provides detail on student enrollments in Public School Programs as of the October count date. Public School Programs include both virtual and blended schools where a district or independent board has contracted with K12 to provide a full-time program of educational products and services. Enrollments are classified into Managed Programs and Non-managed Programs. Managed Programs include schools where K12 provides substantially all of the management, technology and academic support services in addition to curriculum, learning systems and instructional services. Non-managed Programs include schools where K12 provides curriculum and technology, and the school can also contract for instruction or other educational services. Non-managed programs, however, do not offer primary administrative oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2015 / 2014 \n2015 2014 Change Change % \n\n\n\n\nManaged Public School Programs (1,2,3) 104,429 118,609 (14,180) -12.0% Non-managed Public School Programs (1,3) 27,754 20,630 7,124 34.5% (1) If a school changes from a Managed to a Non-managed program, the corresponding enrollment classification would change in the period in which the contract arrangement changed. \n(2) Public School Programs include enrollments for which K12 receives no public funding or revenue. \n(3) Public School Program enrollments are equal to the official count date number, which is the first Wednesday of October in a year, or October 7, 2015 for Q1 FY16 and October 1, 2014 for Q1 FY15.\nSpecial Note on Forward-Looking Statements \nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
