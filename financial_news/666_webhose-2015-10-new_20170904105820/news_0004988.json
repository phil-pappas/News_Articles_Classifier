But I know they will,\" he said. \"This is urgent for them because it's a public relations nightmare ... They're still in assessment mode.\" \nVolkswagen shares, which have lost more than $30 billion in value since the crisis began, dipped to a new 4-year low of 91.60 euros on Friday. \nTWO-SPEED RESPONSE \nThe scandal has thrown the spotlight on problems with the availability and quality of official emissions data that campaigners have complained about for years. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which announced Volkswagen's cheating in diesel emissions tests on Sept. 18, provides detailed information on vehicle performance in tests. Published data from German counterpart KBA, upon which some other national bodies rely for tests on Volkswagen (LSE: 0P6N.L - news ) vehicles, do not break down the test performance of individual vehicle models. \nAsked whether there was any way, other than asking the manufacturer, for the public to find out if a specific model complies with EU rules, a spokesman for the KBA said: \"I dont think so.\" \nU.S. authorities have generally been quicker to respond to the crisis too, leaving Europe open to the charge of letting down consumers and being too close to its struggling car industry -- a key source of jobs and export income. \nThe EPA, which said on Sept. 25 it would toughen tests for all carmakers, will scrutinise at least 28 diesel models made by BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) , Chrysler General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes (Xetra: 710000 - news ) -Benz, the Financial Times reported on Friday. \nA U.S. congressional oversight panel said on Thursday it had called Volkswagen's U.S. chief, Michael Horn to testify on Oct. 8, while more than 30 U.S. state attorneys general have banded together to conduct an investigation into Volkswagen, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday. \nEuropean authorities are seeking answers too. Germany's KBA has set Volkswagen an Oct. 7 deadline to present a plan to bring diesel emissions into line with the law. \nBut the response in much of Europe has been slower. \nFrench prosecutors only opened a preliminary inquiry into Volkswagen on Friday, whereas the U.S. Department of Justice was reported on Sept. 21 to have started a criminal investigation. \nEuropean carmakers are lobbying hard to limit the fallout from the scandal, which they fear could lead to costlier regulations and hit sales of diesel vehicles -- which account for almost a half of sales in Europe compared with a small fraction in the United States. \nIn a letter dated Sept. 29 to the European Union's council of ministers, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said manufacturers would need until 2019 to fully meet some new pollution limits. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also suggested U.S. authorities had an ulterior motive for their actions. \"We understand that the U.S. want to challenge the leadership role that the European manufacturers have taken globally in this technology,\" said the letter, seen by Reuters, referring to diesel cars. \nThe car industry is particularly important to Germany, Europe's largest economy, where the likes of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen employ more than 750,000 people. Berlin has in the past lobbied the EU against tougher regulations on carmakers. \nGerman Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who once sat on Volkswagen's board, said on Friday the investigations into the company should not turn in to a campaign against the industry as a whole. \nPhilippe Lamberts, co-chair of the Greens group in the European Parliament, said the auto industry had to change. \n\"They should shut up and put up with it. It's not a question of profits, it's about health, it's about the rule of law,\" he told Reuters. \nJos Dings, director of campaign group Transport & Environment, said the EU should set up a new Europe-wide vehicle inspection agency akin to the EPA, but was not optimistic. \n\"Member states will try their utmost to keep that power with their national type approval authorities -- despite the fact that it is clear they have not done much more than indeed approve vehicles,\" he said.
