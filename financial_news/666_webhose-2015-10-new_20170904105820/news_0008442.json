Proper understanding of sometimes complex rules can save thousands of tax dollars when a property is sold.\nFailure to understand or follow the rules can put you in hot water with the CRA.\nThe PRE allows the tax-free sale of a residential property that is \"ordinarily inhabited\" by the taxpayer, spouse (or former spouse), common-law partner or children of the taxpayer who is claiming the exemption. A trust or estate that owns such a property can also claim the PRE. However, the exemption does not apply to properties that are being rented out.\nIf you sell your cottage, can you claim that as your PR? Yes. Even a mobile home or houseboat can qualify, as long as you have slept there, basically. There is no time limit imposed on how often it was \"ordinarily inhabited.\" Foreign vacation property may also be claimed.\nRaw land does not qualify until a residence is constructed on it. Large properties and farmhouses require specific advice, as there are specific rules that apply.\nIf you own one residence only and sell it, you do not have to claim that sale on your tax return. The PRE claim is assumed.\nHowever, if for some reason you do NOT want to claim the exemption on a particular sale, you must file form T2091 (IND) to account for the capital gain. This would be the case, for example, if you sold a house with a small gain and wanted pay the tax on the 50 per cent of gains that are included in income, while retaining the PR exemption for your cottage, which had a much larger gain.\nBe sure to use this form in this situation or you will lose the right to make the claim for of the years you owned the property that is sold.\nYou would also use the T2091 if not all of your gain on a sale is covered by the PRE, because, for example, you had owned a second property for some of that time, sold it and claimed the PRE for the years of ownership of that other property.\nOnly one PRE is claimable by each married or common-law couple, with two exceptions. For years of ownership prior to 1982, there are two PREs allowed, because back then the tax rules allowed each spouse to claim a principal residence. The other exception is common-law spouses can claim two exemptions for years up to and including 1993. It was only after this CRA changed the definition of \"spouse\" to include common law.\nThanks to a slower change to the spouse definition, same-sex couples can claim two exemptions up to 2001, when they became \"spouses\" under the tax rules.\nPeople who used a portion of their house as a business can claim the PRE, as long as there is no separate area set aside for the business, and no capital cost allowance was claimed on previous tax returns.\nFor a duplex or triplex that is partly rented, the exemption can still be claimed on the residential (non-rental) portion, when sold.\nIf you move into a property you've been previously renting out, or you start to rent out your principal residence, then you have a \"change of use\" and a deemed disposition for tax purposes. In the first example, that would mean paying tax on half the gain at the time of change.\nHowever, an election can be filed to defer the deemed disposition and maintain the PR for another four years, if certain criteria are met. An advantage would be to defer paying tax until you actually sold the property, for example. The election \"form\" is simply a letter. As with any non-standard application of the PRE, be sure to get professional accounting advice.\nThe principal residence exemption makes the gain on most people's houses tax-free, whether soldwhile they are alive, or if sold by their executors after they pass away. If you own one property with none of the complications mentioned here, you have nothing to worry about.\nIf you own multiple properties, or have any of these other situations, then it's best to get good advice before selling any of them. At the very least, proper application of the PRE calculation formula (available at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ and search for form T2091) will net you an extra year of exemption. Your saving from proper planning may be much more substantial.\n \nDavid Christianson, BA, CFP, R.F.P., TEP, CIM is a financial planner and adviser with Christianson Wealth Advisors, a vice-president with National Bank Financial Wealth Management, and author of the book Managing the Bull, A No-Nonsense Guide to Personal Finance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:36:26.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
