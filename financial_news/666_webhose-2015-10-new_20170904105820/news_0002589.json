Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Origin Energy chairman Gordon Cairns looks to be getting himself in a pickle with succession planning at a company that has lost $14 billion in market value this year, partly because of poor risk management.\nThe sudden departure of talented executive Karen Moses , who has been executive director of finance and strategy for seven years, leaves a huge question mark hanging over chief executive Grant King .\nIt is hard to see King maintaining his job for too long when the reasons given for the retirement of Moses could also be applied to him. Having strengthened the Origin balance sheet with last month's $2.5 billion capital raising and shepherded through the Australia Pacific LNG project, Moses is headed to the world of non-executive directorships. Her job is done and it is time for the company to think about a different management for different times.\nThe company is slashing costs, focusing on operational excellence and pulling out of poorly performing and capital-intensive businesses.\nIt ought to be considering a range of options for rebuilding shareholder value. These should include the potential for demergers at a time when utility-style assets are highly valued.\nOrigin and its troubled peer in the Gladstone LNG capital investment explosion, Santos, are both downtrodden stocks which trade at almost half their book values. The market does not appear to have confidence in the capacity of both companies to revive their fortunes.\nIf King keeps his position for an extended period, he will be the ultimate survivor, considering Santos CEO David Knox resigned in August and the other company involved in the Gladstone LNG building spree, BG Group, was taken over by Shell.\nBoth Moses and King will make valuable additions to the boards of Australian companies because they have been put through the wringer.\n They must have learned valuable lessons in recent years, particularly in relation to the dangers of excessive leverage in an industry that has always been subject to big swings in the price of oil.\nOrigin shareholders, however, may not appreciate the price they had to pay for education of the management and board about the need for scenario planning which factors in significant negative movements in commodity markets.\nIt is notable that during the same time that prudential regulators were forcing the management and boards of banks to run stress tests which assumed depression-style economic conditions, the country's two biggest listed energy companies did not appear to think through the implications of a lower oil price.\nBoards of directors of banks are forced to think about worst-case scenarios because a banking licence means there is the potential for a government rescue in the event of a collapse.\nBut shareholders in other industries deserve governance that investigates future prospects without the need for legislation forcing them to do so.\nCairns is under tremendous pressure, because as well as trying to restore the lustre to Origin, he is trying to do the same at Woolworths.\nKing has nurtured sufficient internal talent to ensure the board will have choices when he eventually leaves. The two internal candidates are the head of energy markets, Frank Calabria, and the head of integrated gas, David Baldwin.\nThe huge loss of value at Origin does raise questions about the role played by the board of directors.\nClose watchers of the company have often wondered why former Commonwealth Bank of Australia CEO Ralph Norris only stayed on the board for one term. Norris explained the move by saying he wanted to reduce his board commitments.\nShades of '98 When Citi's respected foreign exchange strategist Tom Fitzpatrick hit Sydney for the bank's annual investment conference this week, he brought a message that will be music to the ears of Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens.\nFor most of this year, Stevens has talked about the need for the Australian dollar to adjust to the significant fall in commodity prices .\nFitzpatrick says that adjustment is going to pick up speed and take the Australian dollar to about US60¢ as the bull run in the US dollar resumes its course.\nThat level would take it about 17 per cent below where it is trading now. That sort of depreciation would deliver a kick to the earnings of Australian companies that sell products in US dollars.\nThe US dollar has been taking a breather lately in the wake of uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve board will lift official interest rates in the United States.\nFitzpatrick uses an expression by Mark Twain to describe what is happening in the global economy. Twain said that history does not repeat, but it does rhyme.\nFitzpatrick says the current conditions in the US, Europe and Asia rhyme with the turmoil that occurred in 1998. The 1998 crisis was preceded by a US housing crisis, a deep recession, easing by the Fed, a financial crisis in Europe and problems in Latin America.\nThe 1998 crisis included a default in Russia, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and, in September that year, a cut in the Fed funds rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent.\nFitzpatrick says the US economy was actually in good shape in 1998. The strength in the economy prompted the Fed to significantly tighten monetary policy over the next 12 months. A correction in the US dollar in 1998 was later followed by a resumption of a bull run in the currency.\n\"This time around is not the same, it is never the same,\" Fitzpatrick says. \"But it is never as different as people think.\"\nHe acknowledges that two years after the 1998 crisis Wall Street experienced a sharemarket crash. In the 15 years since then, the S&P 500 has risen from about 1500 to about 2030.\nFitzpatrick Quote: s those numbers in support of his view that there is nothing \"unhealthy\" about the valuation of US equities. But he does warn that the Fed's policies are stoking asset appreciation rather than helping the underlying real economy.\n\"I think if central banks continue to focus on stockmarkets … it's going to come back to haunt them,\" he says.\nTurning to the US dollar, Fitzpatrick said: \"I do think the dollar trade is alive and well, particularly when it comes to the G10.\"\nHis strong US dollar outlook is predicated on the belief that as long as the US remains the world's demand economy, its currency will strengthen. He says that is good for US consumers because it imports deflation.\nMedibank machinations Medibank says there is nothing unusual about its chief executive, George Savvides, announcing his retirement on the day the company's shareholders were being asked to award him $1.2 million in equity .\nThey dismiss the fact that this equity award scheme, which was withdrawn on Wednesday at the AGM, was put on the agenda a month ago when the notice of meeting was published.\nThe company also appears to put no store in the fact that the prospectus published last year said Savvides would be in the job until July 2017. So much for commitments made to investors in a critical legal document.\nSavvides will hang around until March next year, which is in keeping with the new market practice of encouraging lame duck CEOs. The delayed departure conveniently means no transparency on his payout for six months.\nBut chairman Elizabeth Alexander is well-regarded by shareholders.\nThat suggests she will be able to get away with poor governance in terms of CEO succession planning.\nAn international search will start soon to find people who can be matched up against the favoured internal candidates, David Koczkar and Andrew Wilson.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:07:52.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
