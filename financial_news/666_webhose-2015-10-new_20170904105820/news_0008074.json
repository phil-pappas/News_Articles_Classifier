Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull left open the door to further delays returning the budget to surplus – one of the biggest challenges facing his government – after the independent Budget Office warned slow economic growth would mean less money for government services.\nWith the Coalition swinging its focus towards preparations for the mid-year budget update, which is due within eight weeks, Mr Turnbull cautioned that delivering a budget surplus would be a \"very difficult … and long-term challenge\".\nThe remarks are a sign the government is eager to manage expectations about how quickly it can repair the budget, which is under pressure from falling commodity prices, lower sharemarket dividends and faltering wages growth.\nBy promising to pursue policies that boost economic growth, spur innovation and encourage infrastructure investment, Mr Turnbull has probably made it harder to balance the budget. The full-year 2015-16 budget deficit is forecast to be $35.1 billion. Gross government debt hit a record $402 billion on Friday.\nAt the same time, the government is under pressure to revisit its widely criticised projections that the economy will rebound to 3.5 per cent growth later this decade – an outlook that is at the heart of forecasts for a return to surpluses after 2020-21.\nParliamentary Budget Office head Phil Bowen cast further doubt on Monday over those projections, by pointing out that Australia faces slowing growth, weaker terms of trade and three years of falling per capita real income.\nUrgent need Mr Bowen, who provides independent budget advice to members of Parliament, said there was an urgent need for the community to face up to difficult trade-offs between the desire for low taxes and ever-burgeoning expectations about services.\n \"In many ways it comes down to how big the community wants government to become,\" Mr Bowen told a Senate committee hearing. \"If you are in Sweden, which is … a self-proclaimed welfare state, you may come to a different conclusion than if you are somewhere else.\n\"I think that there is a need for a serious discussion about those trade-offs before government takes a decision on what is the appropriate level of spending or the appropriate level of revenue.\"\nMr Bowen said even on the government's current projections of a return to surplus shortly after the normal four-year budget forecasts, the budget balance was likely to remain vulnerable.\n\"There is still an evident structural imbalance appearing beyond that period, because the surplus then continues to decline [in the projections],\" he said.\nThe comments echo warnings by a wide range of economists, as well as Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens, that the economy might not return to the rates of growth anticipated in the May budget.\nSeize control In question time on Monday, Mr Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison moved to seize control of the budget debate by pointing to the need for higher economic growth and attacking Labor for spending too much in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\"[They] have got to bear in mind their share of the responsibility for this,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"When Kevin Rudd was PM we begged him not to spend so much during the global financial crisis – we begged him not to.\n\"He drove our budget into deficit and did so for no benefit for the Australian people or our economy. And that is the mess we are cleaning up.\"\nOpposition finance spokesman Tony Burke accused Mr Turnbull of backing the same Abbott-era policies that hurt consumer and business sentiment.\n\"Malcolm Turnbull talks about wanting a better debate about the fiscal challenges facing Australia, but first he needs to recognise the damage caused by these policies,\" he said.\nThis year's budget deficit has blown out by $385 million to $13.1 billion because of lower-than-expected tax revenue, Finance Department figures released late on Friday show.\nLess than forecast Income tax revenue after just two months of the 2015-16 financial year are almost $600 million less than forecast, with revenue taxes on dividends coming in $867 million below par. Resource rent taxes have also fallen short, by $334 million.\nMr Turnbull challenged the opposition to unveil its plans to fund the cost of cuts it opposes, as well as its spending plans.\n\"The government cannot any longer be a spend-a-thon,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"It's the way to ruin.\"\nMr Morrison said the government was aware of its economic and budget forecasts, as well as the difficulties in expanding the economy.\n\"Those opposite had the best commodity prices in the history of our nation, the best trade in the history of our economy and they couldn't balance a budget with the best conditions of all time.\"\nThe mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, or MYEFO, is slated for release in mid-December.\nMr Bowen said there was little doubt community expectations had been raised over many years about what governments would provide.\nImproving efficiency However, following the end of the resources boom and falls in the terms of trade, he said the only real way to ensure economic growth over the longer term was by improving the efficiency of the economy.\n\"It is terribly important to do what we can to boost productivity,\" he said.\nProductivity growth was 1.2 per cent in 2014-15, falling short of the budget forecast for growth of 1.5 per cent.\n\"That's a very significant difference,\" he said.\nBased on the government's budget policy of capping tax revenue at 23.9 per cent of gross domestic product over the next decade, Mr Bowen said the budget would face a structural shortfall.\n\"Despite forecasts of a return to surplus shortly after the [four-year] forward estimates period, there is still an evident structural imbalance appearing beyond that period.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:08:01.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
