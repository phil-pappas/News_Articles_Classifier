But Mays told Arkansas Business that while he doesn't want to, he's prepared to go to court if necessary. \nMays contends that the park does not qualify as a \"public purpose,\" a status that would allow the board to use eminent domain. The board and its attorney, Scott Schallhorn of Mitchell Williams Selig Gates & Woodward, believe it does. The statute that created the Tech Park Authority Board establishes it as a quasi-public entity, similar to an improvement district, Schallhorn said. \n\"The specific statute that authorized the tech park said it was for public use and authorized eminent domain powers,\" he said. \nMore: View the legislation that created the park here (PDF). \nBut Mays told Arkansas Business on Thursday that public use has always been an issue for judicial determination. \nMays, who bought the property in 1984 for $500,000, said his preferred resolution would be to lease his property to the board, for 99 years if necessary, at a cheap price. \n\"I have no problem with a tech park,\" Mays said. \"I'm just not sure you can take private property to do it. I want to work with them. I'm approaching this from the standpoint of being a good citizen, even though I think there's a legitimate question about eminent domain.\" \nThe board is updating an appraisal of the property it had made in the summer of 2014. The property, three stories but just 25 feet wide, was valued then at $470,000 to $530,000, Tech Park Director Brent Birch said. Mays said he is awaiting the results of an appraisal he ordered two weeks ago. \nThe board voted in July to pay $11.6 million for property owned by Warren Stephens at 417 and 421 Main St., which would make up the bulk of the project's 3.25-acre and 39,000-SF first phase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:48:39.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
