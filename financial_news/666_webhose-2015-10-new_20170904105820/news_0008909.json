A current ratio below 1 indicates that the company may not be able to meet its obligations in the short run. However, it is not always a matter of worry if this ratio temporarily falls below 1 as many times companies squeeze out short term cash sources to achieve a capital intensive plan with a longer term outlook. Suzlon's current ratio for FY 2012 was 0.97 and its average current ratio over the last 4 financial years has been 1.08 times which indicates that the Company is reasonably placed to pay for its short term obligations. Long Term Debt to Equity Ratio Companies operating with high long term debt to equity on their balance sheets are vulnerable to economic cycles. In times of slowdown in economy, companies with high levels of debt find it increasingly difficult to service the interest on their borrowings as profit margins decline. We believe that long term debt to equity ratio higher than 0.6 - 0.8 could affect the business of a company and its results of operations. Suzlon's current long term debt to equity ratio for FY 2012 is 1.42 and its average long term debt to equity ratio over the last 4 financial years has been 1.64 times which indicates that the Company operates with very high level of debt and is not placed well to withstand economic slowdowns.Interest Coverage ratio Interest coverage ratio indicates the comfort with which the company may be able to service the interest expense (i.e. finance charges) on its outstanding debt. Higher interest coverage ratio indicates that the company can easily meet the interest expense pertaining to its debt obligations. In our view, interest coverage ratio of below 1.5 should raise doubts about the company's ability to meet the expenses on its borrowings. Interest coverage ratio below 1 indicates that the company is just not generating enough to service its debt obligations. Since Suzlon operates with very high level of debt, its current interest coverage ratio is 1.10 and its average interest coverage ratio over the last 4 financial years has been 1.30 times which indicates that the Company may find difficulty in meeting its debt obligations.ABSOLUTE RETURN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:53:41.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
