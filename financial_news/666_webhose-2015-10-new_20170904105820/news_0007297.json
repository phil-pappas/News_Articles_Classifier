Established 15 years ago, the group meets in person once a year in a country where mining is a key industry. \nThis is the third time that this global group has met in South Africa. \nMining companies now see digital technology as a key enabler in reinventing business processes that will support efficient operations and sustainable growth. \nThey look to it to support excellence in safety, health, environment, risk and quality (SHERQ); mutually beneficial relationships with local and national communities and ultimately surpass stakeholder expectations. \nA wide range of digital technology is being discussed, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data, enterprise mobility, autonomy, geo-sensing, analytics and 3D printing. The mining companies will share examples of digital transformation projects that use SAPÂ® software and services, which are increasing productivity, increasing satisfaction of customersâ€™ end users, enabling new business models and providing more ways to drive efficiency. \nAngloGold Ashanti, a global gold producer operating in four regions across ten countries and managing 20 gold mining operations, utilizes SAP SuccessFactors Learning and SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting Management solutions to satisfy its rigorous demands for agile global deployment. \n“In a global enterprise such as ours, the ability to standardize the employee lifecycle across various geographies is imperative,” said Pieter du Toit Ooshuizen, Vice president, Planning and Governance, AngloGold Ashanti. \nSAP SuccessFactors solutions enable us to not only manage compliance, ethics and process training in various locations and languages but also internationally to expedite the process of recruiting talent. In addition to the current benefits we are seeing, we will also be utilizing SAP SuccessFactors solutions to optimize and deploy other existing functionality over the next four years. \nCameco, one of the world’s largest uranium producers, is actively working with IoT and Industry 4.0 concepts for production loss management. The company uses the SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence application to address some key business issues with the integration of its enterprise resource planning (ERP) data and its control systems data. \n“SAP solutions for the IoT are enabling us to solve some big challenges in the area of production loss management at Cameco,” said Mark Leach, vice president, business technology services, Cameco. PanAust Limited, a copper and gold producer in Laos, has predevelopment opportunities in Laos, Papua New Guinea and Chile. \nIt needed a state-of-the-art business and technology platform in place to support process integration across the group while readying the company to fast-track the development of new mining projects and drive down overall costs. The company deployed SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA. \n– CAJ News \n\nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=9129 Posted by Admin on Oct 26 2015.
