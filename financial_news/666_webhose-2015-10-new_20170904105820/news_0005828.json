If you have 300 engineers on the payroll in Silicon Valley who are so bad you'd rather not employ them, they must really be bad; how'd they get hired by Twitter in the first place? \n• Should the people who hired these extra engineers also be fired and publicly named (at least by job function if not by name)? \n• Shouldn't folks on the board who sat around and let these non-productive engineers be hired on their watch also be shown the door? I don't think all the directors should go, but it doesn't sit well with me that all these engineers can be hired and then fired and the board just sat around and watched it all go down; there must be consequences that impact their reputations going forward. \n• Saying you will \"likely\" beat consensus is not a great quarter; there's still a lot of wood to chop at Twitter in order to get this thing growing again; it's not all sunshine and roses now that Dorsey was named full-time CEO. \n• Can we get more color on how much time a week Dorsey will spend at Square vs. Twitter? \n• How much time will Dorsey be able to seriously allocate to Twitter during Square's IPO roadshow? When will that roadshow start? How long will it last? What is his plan for Twitter during that period? \n• How many people will Twitter hire in the next 12 months to curate Moments? It seems like a skeleton crew. Couldn't some of the engineers be retrained to help do this? Or are they that hopeless? It sure would have been nice to save on the severance costs if you're going to hire a bunch of people anyway. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:46:32.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
