While there are brighter spots like the US and the UK, and some emerging economies like India, overall the latest news is, in our view, more concerning. \n\"With global economic risks rising, Britain can't be immune from what is happening in the global economy. We must expect that while our economy continues to grow faster than most, it will not grow as fast as last year.\" \nThe IMF expects the UK economy to grow by 2.5pc this year , following growth of 2.9pc in 2014. \nMr Osborne claimed that policies implemented by the Conservative government would ensure Britain, which currently has the second highest deficit in the G7, would have the second lowest by 2020. \n\"We'll go from second worse to second best in five years. It's the first time in 14 years that the IMF sees the UK balancing its books,\" said Mr Osborne. \nThe Chancellor also publicly backed Christine (HKSE: 1210-OL.HK - news ) Lagarde for a second term as the head of the International Monetary Fund. \n\"In my view she has skillfully steered the IMF through the big challenges of Greece and the Ukraine and recovery from the Great Recession. Given the risks to the global economy highlighted here, I can think of no one better to lead the IMF,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:32:01.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
