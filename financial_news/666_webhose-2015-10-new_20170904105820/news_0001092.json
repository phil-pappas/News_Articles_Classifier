And that could mean bad news for investors who like companies to be aggressive about stock buybacks and dividends. \nIn July, Clinton called out \" short-termism \" as a villain within the economy and encouraged companies to break free of the \"tyranny of today's earnings report.\" Her entreaties did not go unheard. \nLast month, the National Association of Corporate Directors, a trade group representing members of corporate boards, issued a report titled \"The Board and Long-Term Value Creation.\" It argues that \"boards can help management be short-term savvy while still operating with a long-term view.\" More Headlines Oct. 8 Premarket Briefing: 10 Things You Should Know \nWhether this kind of language comes across as defensive or conciliatory is, of course, up to the reader, but it's certainly a sign of some apprehension within management's upper echelons. Here's a rundown of what's behind the \"short-termism\" agenda and what it could mean for equity investors. \nFirst of all, slow GDP growth and a middling recovery from the crisis of 2008 are the elephants in the room when it comes to accusations of short-termism. Economists from Paul Krugman to Larry Summers have wondered why the growth curve hasn't yet caught up to its pre-2008 levels. Krugman even suggested that the economy may be facing a \"'secular stagnation' [that] many economists feared after World War II.\" \nConcerns about the slowdown have prompted Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush to make \" 4% GDP growth \" a catchphrase of his campaign. While GDP growth in Jeb's state of Florida surpassed 4% for most of his time as governor, most economists think that number is unattainable nationally, seeing the average 2.2% growth since the end of the recession as a much likelier benchmark. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:29:31.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
