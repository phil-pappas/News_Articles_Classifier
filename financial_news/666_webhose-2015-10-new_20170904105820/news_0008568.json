The company's net profit grew 41.7 per cent year-on-year to Rs 279 crore and was ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 260 crore. Continued traction in its consumer lending book which grew 42 per cent year-on-year to Rs 15,691 crore was the key driver of topline in the quarter. This business includes consumer durables financing, two wheeler/three wheeler financing, amongst others. The small and medium enterprises (SME) segment too grew at a healthy clip of 46.9 per cent to Rs 17,820 crore. Its assets under management (AUM) grew 36 per cent to Rs 37,964 crore. Expansion in rural areas and commercial lending, further acceleration in home loans segment will be other factors driving future growth of the company. Management remains confident of delivering healthy growth going forward as well. \"Our AUM growth should be 30-35 per cent if festive season is good\", said Rajeev Jain, CEO & MD, Bajaj Finance. Notably, the company has managed to grow its AUMs at 30 per cent plus levels every quarter over the past five years. Higher provisioning helped the company reduce its gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPA ratios in the quarter. Bajaj Finance's provisions surged 32 per cent sequentially and 71 per cent year-on-year as it made accelerated provisions to account for stress in one of its infra accounts and a few mortgage clients. Barring these few instances, management remains confident on asset quality. The company's Gross NPA as well as net NPA ratios remained largely stable at 1.7 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively. While the company does not share net interest margin figure, it remains confident of maintaining margins despite the falling interest rates. This is because half of its loans are on a fixed interest rate basis which helps in compensating for the fall in interest rates on its floating loan book. Apart from healthy topline growth, net profit was also aided by a 2 times year-on-year growth in other income to Rs 21 crore. Other income largely comprises of fee income and is witnessing good growth in-sync with overall AUM growth.\nThe Bajaj Finance scrip surged 5.8 per cent to Rs 5,306 on Tuesday - cheering the robust set of numbers. The S&P BSE Sensex, on the other hand, witnessed a fall of 0.21 per cent. Most analysts remain positive on Bajaj Finance given its leadership position in the consumer durables lending segment, good earnings visibility and stable asset quality. However, current valuation of 3.4 times FY17 estimated book value are at a premium to its own historical average one-year forward price/book value ratio of about 1.8 times. However, analysts believe the premium is likely to sustain in the foreseeable future on the back of consistent financial performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:29:35.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
