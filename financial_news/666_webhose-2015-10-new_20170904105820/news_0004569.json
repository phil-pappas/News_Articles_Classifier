Bargain hunters are right to be attracted by the cheap shares offering chunky dividends, but Questor would warn against getting back in too quickly as the outlook is still pretty grim. \n= Iron ore double dip = \nIron ore is the most important commodity for the UK-listed miners as it is responsible for the largest chunk of profits at each of the companies. The price of iron ore has staged something of a recovery during the past two months, rising more than 30pc from lows to around $55 per ton. However, there are good reasons why it could soon be heading back down towards $40 per ton. \nThe Roy Hill development, which is owned by Gina Rinehart and is one of the largest private mines in the world, has begun production and aims to hit 55m tonnes a year once it is at full capacity. This comes at a time when Chinese steel mills are slowing down and the market is already oversupplied. Analysts expect iron ore prices to remain rooted at around $40 for most of next year as well. \n= China housing downturn = \nThe biggest driver for the iron ore price during the past 10 years has been Chinese construction activity and in particular housebuilding. The Chinese housing sector saw prices begin falling sharply in January last year, and typically the impact on construction activity is delayed by 12 to 18 months as projects that are completed are not replaced. The signs are that housing construction in China is now also slowing sharply. \nA toxic mix of sharply lower demand for commodities and increasing supply is set to last well into next year. \n= Buying the rally = \nThe mining sector has enjoyed a strong share price rally during the past two weeks. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) has soared 50pc, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) is up 24pc, and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) have gained 17pc since the end of September. \nThe shares are certainly looking attractive to income investors with Rio Tinto offering a 5.8pc dividend yield and BHP Billiton offering 7pc dividend yield. Glencore offers rapid gains if commodity prices recover and Anglo American should bounce, too. \n= Patience is key = \nHowever, Questor would warn against buying into this rally. Commodity prices look like they have another leg down and until investors have a better picture of future earnings then it is difficult to work out which dividends are sustainable. \nRio Tinto and BHP Billiton have stronger balance sheets, but will still have to make dividend payments out of debt next year if iron ore prices remain where they are. Glencore is also highly exposed to a further slump in copper prices. \nBuying shares on the cheap is always attractive but the risks far outweigh any potential returns in the miners (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:12:51.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
