Carbon market schemes aim in part to encourage low-carbon investments.\nChina will also make \"green finance\" a top priority of the Group of 20 when it takes up the G20 chair next year, Yi said.\n\"If we don't have international cooperation, we will find that investment in the green sector will be underinvested,\" Yi said. \"The G20 platform is a good platform.\"\nA new green finance committee in China is writing a \"very important chapter\" on environmental protection and sustainable growth for the country's next five-year plan, Yi added.\nChina is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.
