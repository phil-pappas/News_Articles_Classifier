Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nContinuum, CQG’s enterprise API division, has launched a strategic partnership with MarketDelta to help bolster the group’s trading and order management application, MarketDelta Cloud, according to a Continuum statement. \nThe deal will extend CQG capabilities to the MarketDelta Cloud platform, which will stand to benefit from the provision of global market data and trade execution capabilities, via its flagship API, Continuum Connect. \nThis is also the second such partnership in as many months for Continuum, which teamed up with TradeSocio, a provider of marketing software for brokers across multiple asset classes, back in September. The nature of this accord helped tap into Continuum’s DirectFX connection, which relies on low-latency market data and order routing. \nAccording to Mike Glista, Vice President of Continuum in a recent statement on the partnership, “We are excited to be selected as the sole provider of market data and trade routing for MarketDelta Cloud. We continually look for ways to partner with innovative companies who are changing the trading environment.” \n“We are very proud to be launching the MarketDelta Cloud powered by CQG. The convenience and accessibility it will provide both traders and brokers is a breath of fresh air in an industry that is known for hard-to-use software. We are thankful for our longstanding relationship with CQG and the fantastic support they have provided us along the way,” added Trevor Harnett, CEO of MarketDelta.
