A report by the Boston College Center for Work & Family this summer found that two-thirds of dads gave an equal priority to caring for their children and meeting their financial needs.Dual-income families have become the norm, with 60 percent of married couples now sharing the breadwinning responsibilities (compared to just 25 percent in 1960), and as women have been working more out of the house, men have been doing more in it. Today’s fathers spend nearly triple the amount of time with children than dads did in the 1960s, according to Pew , although they’re still spending less time with kids than women are.To reflect this shift in priorities and roles, more companies are expanding their paternal leave policies and offering workers more options for flexible work schedules aimed at allowing parents of both genders to succeed at work while fulfilling family obligations. Policy shifts are a start Male-dominated, trend-setting Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of the shift, with a slew of companies grabbing headlines for this summer for new parental leave policies that are particularly generous for men.

A study released last week by McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org found that more than 90 percent of both men and women believe that taking extended family leave will hurt their position at work. Experts say that will change as more employees—especially men—begin not only seeking companies with generous parental benefits, but also start using those benefits.For those already working far more than 40 hours per week, it may be about finding ways to work more efficiently, both in the office and at home. That may be taking some cues from working moms who have made it work.“Go home at six, but then get back online after the kids go to sleep,” says Joan Williams of the Center for Worklife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law. “That’s something that mothers have done for decades, and it’s something that more and more fathers are going to do.”", "external_links": ["http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/18/5-facts-about-todays-fathers/", "http://womenintheworkplace.com/", "http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/centers/cwf/pdf/BCCWF%20The%20New%20Dad%202015.pdf", "http://blog.netflix.com/2015/08/starting-now-at-netflix-unlimited.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:30:04.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
