The views expressed are their own. \nLONDON, Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 26 (Reuters) - Poland's arch-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party claimed victory in Sunday's election but the lead initially indicated by exit polls does not now look quite so commanding. Latest projections suggest it could win 232 seats in the 460-seat parliament, a wafer-thin majority that could yet encourage it to bring in a junior coalition partner. Whether that would water down its policy goals much is open to question. PiS will be very much the senior partner in any government and is determined to impose its brand of Euroscepticism mixed with social conservativism and left-leaning economics. The zloty fell in early trade as it looked to have enough seats to govern alone, but there are signs the currency might be pulling back. \nEU and Balkan (LSE: 0IS4.L - news ) leaders agreed at a mini-summit on Sunday that a total 100,000 places in reception centres should be made available for migrants along the route from Greece toward Germany, half in Greece and half in countries to the north. EU officials were also adamant that countries should not simply wave migrants through to the next country en route to the north, which is precisely what Greece has been doing. We'll look at the consequences. \nECB Executive Board member Yves Mersch is speaking in Brussels, the first of many ECBers on the road this week. Mario Draghi's strong hint of a policy review in December has opened the door to more QE purchases, a cut in the deposit rate and possible other stimulus measures. We need to push for more details on what can be done and their take on the wider environment, with China cutting its rates ahead of the announcement of its latest five-year plan this week and the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Fed still apparently in wait-and-see mode. \nBritain's government faces a showdown in the House of Lords today over its plan to cut tax credits, seen increasingly as a step too far down the road of austerity. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may trigger a constitutional clash -- the house has so far stood by the convention that as an unelected body it is not supposed to block financial measures approved by the elected parliament. Osborne has stuck to his guns, arguing a higher minimum wage will balance things out. \nMARKETS (at 0645 GMT) \nThe monetary hoses are out again. The October bounce in world markets extended further today, with China's latest series of interest rate cuts on Friday coming just a day after the ECB signalled further easing by December and ahead of what some are already speculating could be another marginal expansion of the BOJ's QQE this Friday. With the exception of HK and KL, Asia bourses were up about 0.5 percent earlier after a 1 percent plus gain on Wall St on Friday night that brings it back into the black for 2015 and dragged the ViX volatility gauge to two-month lows. The FOMC will likely stand pat on Wednesday, but the net result late last week was a significantly higher dollar and the sort of renewed pressure on oil and commodity prices that have caused much of the growth fears to begin with. Brent hovered just under $48 earlier, but the CRB index lost 1 percent on Friday to return to its lows of early October. The dollar has eased back a touch so far today, however, with euro/dollar popping back above $1.10 after heavy losses last week and ahead of the German October Ifo business sentiment report later today. Eurostocks are expected to open flat ahead of one of the busiest earnings weeks of the current season, and with Peugeot (Other OTC: PUGOF - news ) 's 3.2 percent rise in quarterly revenue easing some fears about the European auto sector. Wall St futures are marginally lower and Bund futures opened slightly lower. Close eye on fallout from reports China's yuan will get the green light for inclusion in the IMF's SDR basket next year. \nEmerging stocks slipped a touch, dragged down by Russian and Middle Eastern bourses suffering from lower oil prices and failing to benefit from China mainland shares sailing to two-month highs following Friday's interest rate cut. Guatemala sees a change of government after former comedian and centre-right candidate Jimmy Morales swept to power. No results yet from Ivory Coast/Tanzania/Haiti but all seem to have gone relatively smoothly. \nEVENTS \nChina Communist Party begins meetings Monday to formulate its 13th 5-year economic plan \nEuropean corp events: Peugeot sales, Luxottica (Milan: LUX.MI - news ) earnings, Philips (Amsterdam: PHIA.AS - news ) earnings, AXA (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) sales \nGerman Oct Ifo sentiment, Bundesbank monthly report \nFrance Sept jobless", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:48:36.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
