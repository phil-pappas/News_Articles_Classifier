Today we are proud to welcome AR Rahman of India as our cultural ambassador.”\nMr Rahman received his appointment certificate from the country’s vice-president Danny Faure in a ceremony organised to celebrate the India Fest at the International Conference Centre in Victoria.\nAR Rahman was also presented with a token of honour by the chairperson of the Seychelles-India Day celebrations committee Ramu Pillay.
