Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell There were Post-its, buzzwords and diagrams galore at the first ever technology industry and government policy hack, and even the occasional \"but I love Australia\" protest as teams faced the many regulatory disadvantages to building a tech company in Australia.\nThe collaboration between federal Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy, accelerator program BlueChilli and peak lobby group StartupAUS brought almost 300 public servants, entrepreneurs, investors, scientists and educators together in Sydney.\nThey were split into 10 teams to debate and identify solutions for a challenge that holds back Australia from having a booming tech industry to rival Israel, Singapore, London and even the United States.\n\"Don't get caught up with describing the depth of the problem,\" an adviser for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet told a group that was working on resolving taxation and intellectual property issues.\n\"Instead, focus on what the government can do to fix it with you. That's how we'll get the change we need. And please think about ideas that don't require extra spending, we all know the budget environment.\"\nThe teams worked on a wide range of problems from how to attract more venture capital to developing the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, to work for high-growth tech businesses to boosting gender diversity in the notoriously male-dominated industry.\nEach group had five hours to negotiate the best solutions they could come up with before pitching to the whole group and a judging panel of industry experts and Mr Roy.\n\"This is very much an experiment in government,\" Mr Roy told Fairfax Media. \"And even with the fact there are many highly opinionated people here, I think few could argue it's been a bad one.\"\n However, as most government officials could be heard telling technologists through the productive clamour, government doesn't happen in a day.\nMr Wyatt said the StartupAUS board would prepare a summary and then he and his team would present each idea to the relevant departments and see what levers could be pulled to bring about solutions.\nThe government invests almost $10 billion each year in tax breaks alone to encourage innovation, such as the research and development tax concession.\nMost of the final pitches indicated the ideal role of the government could be as a facilitator or co-funder alongside industry, as well as removing significant barriers in regulations such as crowd-sourced equity funding.\n\"Let's be real here, there is little a government can do other than punitive things to alter a business's trajectory,\" entrepreneur, investor and Shark Tank judge Steve Baxter told a group in the first hour of discussions.\n\"So let's focus on removing the blocks so businesses can get stuff done.\"\nFellow entrepreneur turned investor and adviser Topaz Conway urged her group – focused on improving the successful commercialisation of university research and tertiary education – to think about the impact on Australia as a whole rather than individual projects or interests.\n\"There is huge economic potential in this country but we'll keep missing out on it if we don't take proactive steps to unlock it. That's our challenge today.\"\nA primary school initiative to encourage entrepreneurial thinking and education was voted the most promising of the pitches.\n\"This is just the start. The hackathon itself was never the end game,\" Mr Roy said.\n\"It is the beginning of a very serious engagement and we need [to] look at the reality of these changes. If we're spending taxpayer money, we need to value that properly, and if there are existing schemes that can be improved, we can start there as we move forward.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/116041942547218769712/posts"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:09:43.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
