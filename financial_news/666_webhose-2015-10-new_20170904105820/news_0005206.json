While the gain in employment beat economists' forecast for an increase of 10,000 jobs last month, it came on the back of more part-time jobs.\nThe unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent, contrary to expectations for a drop, and the highest level since February 2014. The participation rate held at 65.9 percent, while the size of the labor force edged up.\nThe pace of job growth slowed for the third quarter overall, with the economy adding 31,000 jobs, compared to 33,000 in the second quarter and 63,000 in the first three months of the year, the agency said. Canada was in a mild recession in the first half of 2015.\nThe information, culture and recreation sector saw the biggest increase in September with 32,500 new jobs. In educational services, employment dropped by 51,300 in the midst of recent provincial contract negotiations.\nIn the natural resources sector, which has seen layoffs due to the downturn in oil prices, jobs declined by just 2,600.\nEmployment rose in Alberta, where the country's oil sands are located, but an increase in the number of people looking for work boosted the provincial rate of unemployment.\n(Reporting by Leah Schnurr ; Editing by Bernadette Baum )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:46:49.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
