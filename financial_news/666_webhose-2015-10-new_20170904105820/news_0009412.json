( http://bbc.in/1WGRtOP ) \nFormer workers at the sporting goods retailer who were interviewed by BBC said some personnel were \"too scared\" to ask for leave because they feared losing their jobs, the report said. \nA document produced by one of the recruiting agencies for Sports Direct says, \"Any person who exceeds six strikes (unscheduled sick leave) within a rolling six-month period will have their assignment at Sports Direct ended\", and that the agency could end an assignment \"at any time without reason, notice or liability\", the BBC said. \nSports Direct could not be reached for comments outside regular business hours.
