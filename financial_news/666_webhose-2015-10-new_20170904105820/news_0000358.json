Trade and investment between our two nations is growing and our people-to-people links are strong,\" Cameron said in a statement. \nOne major deal under discussion is for China to take a key role in a £24.5-billion project to build Britain's first new nuclear power station in decades, Hinkley Point C in southwest England. \nFrench utility EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) has reached an agreement with Beijing's China General Nuclear Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation to take a 33.5-percent stake in the project, French daily Les Echos reported. \nThe agreement includes the possibility of a Chinese \"Hualong\" reactor in Bradwell, the site of a partially-decommissioned nuclear plant owned by EDF northeast of London. \nXi and Cameron are due to visit the northwestern English city of Manchester where more deals are expected to bolster the government's \"Northern Powerhouse\" project, a bid to balance Britain's London-led economy. \nThe trip follows a five-day visit by British finance minister George Osborne to China during which he opened bidding for contracts to build a high-speed rail link that will link London with northern cities. \nXi's visit comes a decade after that of his predecessor Hu Jintao. \nRelations between Britain and China cooled considerably in 2012, when Cameron received the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing. \nCampaign groups have cautioned that Britain's emphasis on investment opportunities could mean less emphasis on concerns over China's human rights record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:43:17.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
