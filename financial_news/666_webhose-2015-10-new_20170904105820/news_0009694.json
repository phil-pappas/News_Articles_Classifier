Absent any assistance, homeless children have a 60% chance of dropping out of education due to hunger and lack of stability.\n“Every child in our community has the right to a public education, and we’re working with HCEF to make sure none of our children fall through the cracks,” explains Megan Young, owner and manager of Young Asset Protection. “If we’re going to break the cycle of homelessness, it all starts with ensuring that all of our children receive proper education.”\nYoung and her team are actively contacting friends, neighbors, community members, and business associates to advocate for the importance of universal schooling and to raise funds that will go to the Homeless Children’s Education Fund. The team is also constructing an online social media portal in the hopes of gathering additional support from communities outside the Pittsburg area.\nAs well as assisting the Homeless Children’s Education Fund, Young Asset Protection has committed to assisting a new local cause or charity every 30-60 days as part of an ongoing community involvement program.\nThose who wish to assist Young and her team as they advocate and raise donations for the Homeless Children’s Education Fund are encouraged to visit the Young Asset Protection website and make a personal contribution to the cause from this page: http://www.youngassetprotection.com/Homeless-Shouldn’t-Mean-Hopeless_14_community_cause .
