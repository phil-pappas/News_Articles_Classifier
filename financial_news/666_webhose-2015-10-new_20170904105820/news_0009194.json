For it’s a comic irony of the times that, while robots are being developed to interpret the widest possible range of human expression, we are increasingly encouraged to corral our responses into a narrow, incomplete spectrum. \nAI machines engage with what Henry James’s father called a “sensuous education”, yet we are pleased to have our mobile devices stocked with the newest emojis. The Unicode Consortium, which standardises how text is encoded across multiple platforms and programmes, approves batches of these digital hieroglyphs. Only seven of the 67 emoji candidates for 2016 are in the “Faces” category but soon we may be able to signify drooling, and nausea. \nI’m not of the strangely puritanical school that objects to people garlanding their text with emojis. However, these little icons are, appropriately enough, symbolic of a more pervasive process by which online platforms invite us to divide our feelings into discrete categories. One consequence of our data-driven world is that aspects of emotional life take on the logic and limitations of a survey. \nMeanwhile, back in the lab, SoftBank corporation’s “emotional” robot, Pepper , is soon to be introduced to the US market after a successful launch in Japan. Pepper can recognise some emotions but, during a demonstration, the boyish, flirtatious machine requested that the Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern keep her facial expressions “simple”. Thus, while robotics companies are trading on the relative complexity of their products’ emotional intelligence, the same agenda urges us to simplify and exaggerate ours. Stern stooped in front of the diminutive robot and gave it an amplified frown, a Greek theatre mask of a feeling — or to use a contemporary metaphor, she contorted her face into an emoji. Robots such as Pepper are intended to help care for children and the elderly but, at this point in their sophistication, any emotional interactivity will arguably require pantomime performances from their human pals. \nUnlike the rigid online coding of human expression, popular imaginings of AI exploit the terror of emotional ambiguity. Speculative fictions of the near-future envision the eerie signs of an artificial life form’s emerging sentience: a lingering, knowing stare from their synthetic eyes, the merest smirk at the outer edge of their polymer lips. Recent programmes such as Channel 4’s Humans , as well as the films Her (2013) and Ex Machina (2015) explore artificial life, grappling with the subtlest shades of feeling, broadcast in an era in which Mark Zuckerberg has yet to trust us with a “Dislike” button . “What they really want is the ability to express empathy,” Zuckerberg recently said during a corporate event, speaking not of robots but of his billion Facebook users and their desire to do more than “Like”. \nIn this sense, the race is on for two sorts of functional empathy: the virtual and the artificial. Both humans and humanoid machines are currently embroiled in new questions of expressiveness, precisely at the moment when we are dematerialising into their networked world and they are trundling into ours. \nThere is a “Gift of the Magi” quality to these two trajectories. As the Christmas tale goes, a poor wife sells her prized hair to buy her poor husband a fob for his watch, only to discover that he has sold his watch to pay for some combs for her hair. In the digitised version, one set of programmers works on teaching robots the nuances of the Mona Lisa smile, while a second prepares the code for emoji U+1F195, otherwise known as “Face with Head Bandage”. \n‘ The Four-Dimensional Human ’ by Laurence Scott has been shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize 2015 Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
