Richard Drew Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Central banks have seized back control of global share markets and underwritten a surge in equity prices, just as the Reserve Bank of Australia comes under pressure to cut interest rates next month.\nStocks rallied strongly around the world on Friday, lifted by China's central bank cutting rates for the sixth time in under a year and lowering the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves .\nThe stimulatory action by the People's Bank of China, an attempt to kickstart that nation's cooling economy, came a day after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi signalled he would expand the bank's €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program in December.\nThe combined easy-money actions pumped up stock prices on Wall Street and beyond, with the US S&P 500 turning positive for the year.\nThe index is heading toward its best month since 2011. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.90 per cent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 gained 1.1 per cent to 2075.17 and tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 2.27 per cent to 5031.86 in response to impressive profits from technology firms.\nAcross the Atlantic, the Euro Stoxx 50 index surged 2.17 per cent to 3425.81 and the UK's FTSE 100 jumped 1.06 per cent to 6444.08. Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 2.11 per cent to 18,825.30 and China's Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index was up 1.30 per cent to 3412.43.\nRiverFront Investment Group chief investment officer Michael Jones said the central bank easing in China was a powerful reminder of the options policymakers in Beijing have.\n\"The market kind of forgot about that over the last 90 days,\" Mr Jones said. \"Today and yesterday with the ECB, was a big, big reminder they've got plenty of tools to apply.\"\nThe ASX 200 index rose 1.6 per cent to 5351.6 on Friday. The easy money policies of central banks have been a major driver of global stock prices since the global financial crisis struck seven years ago.\nIn Australia, the Reserve Bank may be forced to rejoin the rate-cutting club to offset the four major banks lifting mortgage rates this week and blaming the moves on the costs of new banking regulation.\nBefore the Reserve Bank board meets on November 3, the US Federal Reserve holds its interest rate meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.\nThe Fed is expected to hold rates steady at near zero in October. Fed chair Janet Yellen said last month she expects to raise rates by December. However, more central bank easing in China and Europe may make it harder for the Fed to lift borrowing costs.\nThe US dollar has leapt almost 3 per cent since Mr Draghi's comments on Thursday and commodities priced in US dollars including oil and iron ore have tumbled .\nA strong US dollar has been hurting US exports and imposing deflationary pressures on the economy, two factors that have stopped the Fed from raising rates earlier.\nGoldman Sachs said there was a 60 per cent chance of a Fed \"lift off\" in December.\nThe Australian dollar was trading at US72.17¢ at about 4pm New York time Friday, down from US72.55¢ at its local close on Friday.\nThe ASX 200 index rose 1.6 per cent to 5351.6 on Friday.\nIn the US, strong technology company results from Amazon, Microsoft and Google's new parent Alphabet also contributed to this week's US stock market rally.\nAbout 70 per cent of the companies to report September quarter earnings so far have beaten consensus estimates.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-24T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:07:26.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
