Louise Kennerley by Sally Rose The chairman of the financial system inquiry David Murray is pleased with the government's decision to start work immediately on a plan to dismantle the Fair Work Commission's role in overseeing the allocation of default superannuation funds.\nOn Tuesday the government said it would task the Productivity Commission with immediately developing and releasing criteria to assess the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system and to develop alternative models for a formal competitive process for allocating default fund members to products.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said the move, part of the government's response to the financial system inquiry, was about giving savers choice about their superannuation and it was \"not for that choice to be imposed upon them by ... employers or unions\".\nThe move is expected to be met by a backlash from the non-profit industry funds, which dominate the default superannuation sector that controls about $9 billion of Australia's $2 trillion super pool.\n\"On this point the government has actually gone a step further than our recommendation, which was to consider a review in the coming years if it was not clear that the 2013 Stronger Super reforms were proving effective in improving outcomes for super fund members,\" Mr Murray said.\n\"I think it is a very good thing that the government has brought forward action on that recommendation. It will put pressure on the industry fund system. At the moment the system is just too expensive.\"\nMore competition needed Mr Murray's report to government said more competition was needed in default super to help bring down fees.\n\"An average cost of 1.2 per cent across the system is absolutely exorbitant and that makes an enormous difference to the accumulated savings of individuals. We suggested that if that was not resolved the government should consider an auction system similar to what has been put in place in other countries around the world and resulted in a reduction in costs,\" he told a Whitlam Institute superannuation symposium in Sydney on Tuesday.\n Mr Murray, a former chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank and inaugural chairman of the government's Future Fund, said super was \"way too politicised\" and questioned the appropriateness of employer and employee groups continuing to make decisions about what funds should manage workers' compulsory retirement savings.\n\"It doesn't seem very clear to me what the third party – employer or union – interest is quite frankly. The question that hasn't been asked is why do unions and employers have this interest?\" he said.\n\"What was very evident to us [the inquiry panel members] was that there is an undeclared raging war between the industry and the retail funds, both of which hate the self-manged funds – a situation that is extraordinarily unhealthy.\"\nThe government said on Tuesday it would legislate that all individuals must have the right to chose their own fund. Some awards lock workers out of the ability to chose their own fund if they are not happy with their default fund.\n\"Ensuring all workers have choice of fund is very important,\" Mr Murray said.\nIndependent directors The inquiry also called for all super funds to be forced to appoint a majority of independent directors.\nThe government pre-empted Tuesday's formal response by introducing legislation earlier in 2015 to mandate a compromise to this recommendation.\nUnder the government's plan, all super funds will be required to have one-third of board seats filled by independent directors from July 2017, and a majority of independent directors on an \"if not why not\" basis by July 2019. The shake-up is designed to break the equal representation model of industry funds, whereby employer and employee groups each nominate 50 per cent of directors.\nThe plan has been opposed by the industry fund sector.\n\"We made our recommendations on governance arrangements looking at independence, where interests of the trustees are directed solely by the interests of the members for the members and not confused by anything else,\" Mr Murray said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:19:30.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
