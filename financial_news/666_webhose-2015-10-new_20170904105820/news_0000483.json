Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Malcolm Turnbull and cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos have brokered a peace deal in which Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce will be given control over water but will have limited powers to effect fundamental change to how water is used in the Murray-Darling Basin.\nMr Joyce demanded water be taken away from the Environment portfolio and be given back to him as a key term of the Coalition deal between the Nationals and the Liberal Party which was renegotiated after Mr Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.\nWhile he will be the key voice around the cabinet table, junior ministers Jamie Briggs and Anne Ruston, both of whom are from South Australia, will also have some leverage, sources said.\nWater is a red-hot political issue in SA where there is a deep distrust of eastern states Nationals such as Mr Joyce who are unsympathetic towards the environmental needs of the lower reaches of the river.\nUnder the control of the eastern states Nationals in the past, the river system was severely damaged by over-allocation and inefficient irrigation practices.\nSources said Mr Joyce would have control over the Murray-Darling Basin Plan which allocated water for environmental flows and agriculture. But because the plan has been legislated, any significant change would require the approval of Parliament and the Coalition party room.\nMr Joyce sought control of the funds used to buy out water licences. He wanted the discretion to spend the money instead on improved irrigation infrastructure.\nMr Briggs, whose portfolio comes under Environment, will have control of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, a statutory body which owns the water which has been bought back and can choose to send it down the river or reallocate licences on a temporary asis.\n One senior source said the government was mindful that it needed to win back the trust of SA which was hostile towards the Coalition following the Abbott government's decisions on Holden and submarines. SA Labor Senator Penny Wong said on Wednesday the thought of Mr Joyce having control of water would send \"a chill through all South Australians\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:27:59.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
