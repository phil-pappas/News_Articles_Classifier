Fu didn't comment on who might potentially buy the stakes up for sale.\nThe notices, dated last week but carried by domestic media earlier on Friday, listed the stakes for sale at prices ranging from as little as 1 yuan and up to 2.6 billion yuan. The stores were located from China's western Sichuan province to Beijing.\nWal-Mart has been trying to boost its online presence in China and reduce reliance on physical stores. The retailer took full ownership of local e-commerce firm Yihaodian.com in July, buying the 49 percent stake it did not already own.\nThe U.S. retailer has been struggling to shore up its profit margins globally, which have been weighed down by a $1 billion investment announced earlier this year to increase wages for half a million store-level workers, along with other cost pressures. The company's stock is down around 22 percent so far this year.\n($1 = 6.3484 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Adam Jourdan and SHANGHAI Newsroom; Editing by Kazunori Takada and Kenneth Maxwell)\nChina Resources Wal-Mart Stores Inc China", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:38:04.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
