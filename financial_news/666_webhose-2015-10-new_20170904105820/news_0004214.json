Falling output and rising demand have transformed the country from an oil and gas exporter to net importer. \nOver the past year it has agreed major deals to import LNG from European commodity traders as well as Russian and Algerian oil giants for its first-ever LNG import terminal. \nThe latest batch of cargoes will be delivered into the country's second floating import terminal, the BW Singapore, from October until December, 2016, according to the tender details. \nTrafigura is also supplying a cargo to help cool-down and commission the new terminal. LNG is normal natural gas chilled to -161 degrees Celsius into a liquid state.
