PUBLISHED: 17:45, Thu, Oct 8, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:11, Thu, Oct 8, 2015 GETTY \nThe FTSE 100 Grolsch and Peroni maker, which had already knocked back two approaches of £38 and £40 a share from its Belgium-based Budweiser and Stella rival, said the latest £42.15 offer “substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique footprint and its prospects”. \nAB InBev, which has until next Wednesday to make a firm bid, said a tie-up would build “the first truly global beer company” to include markets such as Africa, Asia and South America. Sports Direct scores Irish \nSPORTS DIRECT has struck a £35million deal to take control of Irish department store chain Heatons and cash in on the country’s fast-growing retail sector. \nThe chain already has a 50 per cent stake in Heatons, which has 44 stores in the Irish Republic and 10 in Northern Ireland, and is looking to buy out the remaining shares by April. \nMany Heatons already incorporate sportswear departments along with clothing and homewares. \nLast year, Irish clothing and footwear sales grew by nearly 13 per cent. \nSports Direct chief Dave Forsey said the deal was “exceptional”. GETTY Diageo in top spirits \nDIAGEO is toasting £440million profits after selling its stakes in beer businesses in Jamaica and South-east Asia to Heineken. \nThe asset swap will also mean Diageo buying out Heineken’s holding of 20 per cent in Guinness Ghana Breweries to increase its stake to 72.42 per cent. \nThe two companies have struck licensing agreements for their respective brands. \nDiageo will use proceeds from the disposals to reduce debt. \nDiageo chief executive Ivan Menezes said the deal “provides a strong ‘route to consumer’ for Guinness”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:54:17.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
