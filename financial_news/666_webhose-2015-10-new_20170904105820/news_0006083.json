The company has 6.3 million subscribers who can listen to a catalogue of 35 million songs for 9.99 euros a month.\nChief Operating Officer Simon Baldeyrou said the company aimed to raise 300 million euros and would adjust the number of shares sold according to where they were priced within a 36.40 euro to 49.24 euro range.\nThis would mean selling 8.242 million new shares at the lowest price, or 6.092 million at the highest.\nDeezer said it expected net proceeds of about 291 million euros. An over-allotment option to increase the number of shares sold by 15 percent could bring additional gross proceeds of 45 million.\nTrading of the shares on the Euronext Paris stock exchange is due to begin on Oct. 30. The offer price will be set on Oct. 27.\nDeezer's largest shareholder with 27 percent is tycoon Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, while Orange owns 11 percent. Three music labels, Warner Music, Sony Music and Universal Music, part of Vivendi, together own close to 15 percent of the shares.\nThe share sale will \"enable the group to develop and enlarge its subscriber base\", Deezer said, adding that it would invest in marketing and promotions, as well as campaigns with telecom operators and other partners.\nPresent in 180 countries but with the bulk of its clients in France, some 4.8 million of Deezer's paying customers get access because the service is bundled with their mobile service from telecom operators like Orange, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom.\nDeezer's biggest challenges will be competing with Spotify, with its huge lead in the United States, and Apple's new music streaming service.\nBNP Paribas and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO. Citigroup and Societe Generale are acting as joint bookrunners.
