If they address issues voters care most about, however, there will be a lot of discussion of jobs and the lackluster economy.\nHillary Clinton has staked out policy positions on more than a dozen economic issues , with her views generally falling in the same center-left band as those of President Obama . Her upstart challenger Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a “Democratic socialist,” is further to the left, calling for a wide range of tax increases on the wealthy and new spending programs that would remake the relationship between American taxpayers and their government. The other three candidates—Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee—generally fall between Clinton and Sanders in their economic views.\nSince Clinton and Sanders form the bookends for the range of economic policies likely to be touted in tonight’s debate, here’s where they stand on 8 top issues:\nMinimum wage. Sanders sides with fast-food protesters and others demanding a huge hike from the current federal floor of $7.25 to $15. Clinton favors something closer to $12, which is higher than Obama’s call for a $10.10 minimum wage. Even so, strong opposition from business interests in Washington makes a sizable hike in the federal minimum wage highly doubtful.\nReining in Wall Street . Clinton’s rivals are likely to hammer her for being too cozy with Wall Street, though Yahoo Finance pointed out recently that Clinton has so far nabbed very few rich donors from Big Finance . Still, she opposes a reinstatement of the old Glass-Steagall Act, which Sanders favors because it would put new limits on the risky investments banks are allowed to make. This, too, is mostly verbal jousting, because the odds of Congress reinstating a law dismantled during the Bill Clinton administration seem remote.\nWorsening income inequality. Every Democrat bemoans this, yet solutions are evasive. Clinton’s plan involves more government spending on infrastructure and traditional stimulus measures, targeted tax cuts for middle-class families, modest tax hikes on the wealthy, and enhanced profit-sharing plans that would allow workers to prosper more when their employers do. Sanders would go further in just about every regard, with one example being $1 trillion in new spending on roads, bridges and the like that the candidate says would create 13 million new jobs in 5 years.\nTax reform. Clinton’s plan includes closing loopholes that mainly benefit the wealthy, such as the carried-interest provision that helps the partners at private-equity firms and hedge funds boost their take-home pay. Sanders’ would go after the wealthy more aggressively, including a higher income-tax bracket for the highest earners, a new tax on inheritances above $3.5 million, and a new tax on “Wall Street speculators.”\nTrade. Sanders opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership, which President Obama is now trying to get Congress to approve. Sanders would also roll back other trade deals such as NAFTA, generally favoring a more protectionist economy. Clinton, more amenable to free-trade deals, used to back the TPP but now opposes it -- a flip-flop her Republican critics are eager to highlight, even if her Democratic challengers don’t.\nCollege costs. A hallmark of Sanders’ economic plan is free tuition at public universities , along with sharp cuts in interest rates on student loans needed to help pay room and board and other expenses. The unspecified new tax on Wall Street speculators would pay for this. Clinton wouldn’t go quite as far, but she does favor new government spending to lower tuition costs at public schools so that a typical student can pay for college without taking on debt .\nHealthcare. Forget private health insurance. Sanders would impose a national single-payer healthcare program he describes as “ Medicare for all .” Clinton would leave the current system intact, while improving on Obama’s healthcare reforms by lowering out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays, which have soared in recent years.\nImmigration. Sanders would establish a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, while loosening other immigration policies. Clinton is basically with Sanders on this one. She also favors a path to citizenship, and she’d expand other avenues for foreigners to obtain U.S. citizenship . That way, important votes lie.\nRick Newman’s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.
