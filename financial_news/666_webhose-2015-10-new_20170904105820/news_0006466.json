The government owns almost 80 percent of the companies’ shares and private investors have been pressing the administration to unwind a controversial 2012 decision to sweep their profits to the Treasury Department.\nWhile White House officials might regard Stegman’s Monday remarks at a mortgage industry conference as restating the status quo, the comments could counter expectations that President Barack Obama will try to cut government ties with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before he leaves office in 2017.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares both jumped more than 8 percent Oct. 6 after a Washington political intelligence firm published a report that said the White House was in the “very early stages” of weighing its options to end federal control, known as conservatorship. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is among those who’ve mentioned the report, saying at a Bloomberg News conference that it’s clear Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are here to stay so it makes sense that the government needs a plan to deal with them going forward.\nTaxpayer Rescue “The administration does not support Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac exiting the conservatorship in the absence of comprehensive housing-finance reform,” Treasury said in an emailed statement. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on what Stegman plans to say next week at the Mortgage Bankers Association conference in San Diego.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are pivotal to the housing market because they buy about half of new mortgages and then package the loans into bonds on which payments of principal and interest have implied guarantees.\nHedge funds that own Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock, including Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, have sued the government over the decision to hoard earnings, rather than allowing the companies to build up capital reserves or pay dividends to outside shareholders.\nObama administration officials have argued the sweep was done to compensate taxpayers who had to save the companies from collapse as the mortgage market tanked in 2008. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were rescued with a $187.5 billion bailout at the height of the financial crisis, they’ve since sent almost $240 billion to the Treasury.\nThe White House’s reassessment of what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is being driven by concerns over what might happen if a Republican administration gets to decide the companies’ fates, Political Alpha, the political intelligence firm, wrote in its Oct. 5 report.\nEnding Sweep The Obama administration is particularly worried that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac policies intended to support affordable housing will be abandoned should a Republican win the White House, according to the report. The Obama administration is also discussing pumping fresh capital into the companies, a decision that would end the profit sweep, Political Alpha said.\nAmong those trying to dispel speculation that the Obama administration wants to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is U.S. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has proposed legislation that would overhaul housing finance.\n“There is no factual background to the rumor that the administration is actively pursuing efforts to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship,” Corker said in an emailed statement Friday. “It is time to put the issue of recap and release to bed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:28:02.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
