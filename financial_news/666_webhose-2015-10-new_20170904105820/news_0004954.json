Daniel Munoz In its global banking annual review, published this week, McKinsey predicts that as digitalisation gathers pace, attackers are likely to focus on five key areas – consumer finance (products such as credit cards and car loans), mortgages, lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, retail payments and wealth management.\n\"Attackers will likely capture only a small portion of these businesses; most of the banks' losses will come from margin compression as attackers force prices lower,\" the report says.\nThese losses from disruption are likely to prove hefty. McKinsey estimates that the profits that banks earn from consumer lending could decline by 60 per cent over the next decade.\nSimilarly, banks are likely to face dwindling profits from payments (down 35 per cent by 2025), SME lending (down 35 per cent), wealth management (down 30 per cent) and mortgage lending (down 20 per cent).\n Disrupters attract interest These banking disrupters are already piquing investor interest. Last December, LendingClub, the world's largest online peer-to-peer lender, raised $US870 million from an IPO.\nThe event received widespread publicity because it highlighted the way technology was being used to change the way consumers and businesses access credit.\nAs McKinsey notes, the banks have the big advantage because they are entering the fight from a position of strength.\nWorldwide, banking profits reached a record $US1 trillion in 2014. The lion's share was claimed by the world's top 500 banks, which together notched up profits of $US613 billion, while the remainder was shared between smaller banks and other financial institutions.\nBut as McKinsey notes: \"These vast and highly dispersed profits are a magnet for attackers and their investors.\"\nSo how should banks protect themselves against this inevitable competitive onslaught from technology-based competitors?\nMcKinsey argues that banks cannot simply rely on buying successful digital firms and integrating them into their existing values.\nInstead, the banks, which have already been through a draining cycle of crisis and reform, have little choice but to undergo yet more transformation.\nBut there will be rewards for those banks that can manage this latest challenge.\n\"The good news is that, in a period of upheaval when considerable market share will be up for grabs, ambitious banks can outdo both traditional and new rivals,\" the report says.\nAs a result, \"incumbent banks could wind up with bigger businesses than today, even after attackers claim some share, as some digital-first banks are already proving.\"\n﻿ A stark choice McKinsey says that the senior management at banks face a stark choice.\n\"They can take the battle for the consumer – the defining dynamic of the next 10 years – to the upstarts, by mastering the customer relationship, creating an emotional connection and leveraging their data treasure to deliver a superior customer experience.\" (McKinsey argues that the banks are sitting on a huge trove of information about their customers, but only realise about 10 per cent to 20 per cent of its potential value).\nThe alternative option is for them to \"retreat, excelling at the basic business of financing and providing their balance sheet to others for resale\".\nNot surprisingly, the big four Australian banks are giving every indication that they're gearing up for a gruelling battle with the new entrants.\nANZ chairman David Gonski this week noted that banks were about to enter a more challenging period as a result of the threat from technology-based rivals.\n\"In my opinion, we are entering a period where basically there's not only great opportunities but also great things that, if you get wrong, will be difficult for banks,\" he told analysts.\nGonski argued that the challenge for Shayne Elliott , who will take over at the helm of ANZ Bank when Smith steps down at the end of the year, \"will be to take what we've got and basically turn it to advantage, with maybe tougher times ahead generally in the economy, and people who are wanting to take the more profitable bits of our business streams.\"\nCommonwealth Bank chief Ian Narev points out that although the new digital rivals are delivering major benefits for customers, it is important to look at the potential risks they pose, both to customers and to the broader financial system.\nSpecifically, he questioned whether some of these new players would be able to withstand a \"liquidity event\", such as a sudden withdrawal of deposits.\n\"Many, many new models that we can see are providing exceptional benefits for consumers and businesses. We must embrace them, but we have to understand also that they need to be built to withstand liquidity events\", he said earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:04:57.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
