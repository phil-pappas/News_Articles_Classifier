Imagine logging in to an online account to check your taxes. Imagine apps that silently pass on your information to the government. \nHM Revenue & Customs can. SNP commits to halving tax on flights \nThe authority’s digital strategy is not just about hauling the organisation into the modern era. It is about bringing hard cash into the exchequer’s coffers. \nMinimising the amount of tax lost each year through individuals failing to pay what they owe — the so-called “tax gap” — is a key objective of the digital push, which promises to bring about no less than the end of the annual self-assessment return . \nThe authority hopes it will usher in an era of seamless interaction with its “customers” (or taxpayers to the rest of us), for whom personal online tax accounts will bring an unprecedented level of visibility to their affairs. \nBut the journey towards what George Osborne, the chancellor, called “a revolutionary simplification of tax collection” is unlikely to be plain sailing. Not only are there public concerns about access and security, but the technical challenge of bringing together taxes in one place must be navigated. \nAgainst the backdrop of austerity which has forced the authority to shed two in five of its staff , and criticisms of the support taxpayers are receiving, HMRC must walk the tightrope of becoming a digital organisation without undermining public confidence in the tax system. The digital vision \nHMRC has said that at the heart of its changes is the “recognition that customer service and compliance are two sides of the same coin”. By making it easier for taxpayers to report their affairs correctly, the scope for error and evasion will be reduced. \nThe ultimate goal of a drive to simplify the system is personalised online tax accounts for all individuals and companies. Like an online bank account, people would be able to log in and check their up-to-date liabilities and payments. Information would already be filled in, with data relating to different taxes inserted automatically. \nWhile at this stage an ambition, tax professionals agree it is promising. “If it’s done well, it should be really quite advantageous for taxpayers as well as HMRC,” says Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. \nProgress towards digital taxpayer accounts is already under way, with limited filling in — or “pre-population” — of online self-assessment returns starting this year . Podcast \nDownload here \nAt first this will only extend to information included in a P60, the end-of-tax-year summary of PAYE (pay as you earn) income and tax deductions, but further fields will be incrementally pre-populated towards 2020, when 12m or so self-assessment taxpayers have been promised an end to the annual ritual of filling in a return. \n“The idea of more pre-population is very welcome, and a very good use of technology,” says Paul Aplin, chair of the technical committee at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales, which scrutinises tax policy. “I am a great fan of technology taking away drudgery.” \nAndrew Hubbard, a partner at accountants Baker Tilly, welcomes the greater transparency that online tax accounts — which will be available to all taxpayers — promise by showing how tax liabilities are calculated and by sharing their information. Since 2013, HMRC has collected PAYE data from employers in “real-time” each time they pay their workers. \n“Personal tax is now moving into a real-time system of reporting and paying,” says Mr Hubbard. Opening their account \nThe main challenge for HMRC, according to Mr Roy-Chowdhury, is to ensure that pre-populated information is correct. “Where it is PAYE information this is not going to be difficult, but it’s where people are changing jobs, or have multiple employment, that errors can easily creep in.” \nJames Hender, head of private wealth at accountants Saffery Champness, says the tax authority’s propensity to commit errors is a concern given that it will be soon collating data from multiple sources in a more automated fashion. “The Revenue somehow already gets its wires crossed. I’ve had clients for example who have received queries about properties that don’t even belong to them.” \nThere is the added challenge of ensuring that information HMRC gathers is compatible with its software. To this end, it has committed to releasing improved “application programming interfaces” which allow third parties to develop software that use the same logic as its own, and can therefore be used for pre-populating tax returns. \nIn time, this could allow apps to capture taxable gains and report them automatically to HMRC. \nA dedicated app could, for example, track the capital gains of an investment portfolio and pass on the relevant information, mitigating the need for the taxpayer to declare their gains themselves. Others could track the distance driven on work-related journeys or rental income from a property portfolio. \nTransferring information in this manner promises time savings for taxpayers — and improved compliance for HMRC — with the rise of buy-to-let landlords and the so-called “ sharing economy ”, where people earn money from renting their assets such as spare rooms through the likes of Airbnb. \nMr Hubbard says excitement about the potential for apps to make tax easier is justified, but the prospect of fully automated data collection remains distant. “It’s such a change from what we’re currently doing that it’s going to be a challenge.” Connectivity problems \nIf and when the technical challenges are overcome, Mr Aplin says it is unlikely that many taxpayers, particularly those with complex affairs, will fully trust automatic systems to manage their relationship with HMRC in lieu of their accountant. \n“However easy they make it to interact, there’s still the underlying complexity of the tax system and, importantly, it’s the responsibility of individuals to get it right,” says Robin Williamson, technical director at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which represents taxpayers who cannot afford professional advisers. \n“There is a danger that many will assume that because [pre-populated returns] are from the government, they must be right, like anything that comes out of a brown envelope today,” says Mr Williamson. \nMr Aplin says it is unclear what degree of checking taxpayers will be expected to undertake when the era of digital tax accounts is ushered in. “HMRC may need to change its thinking on what constitutes ‘acceptable’ errors.” \nPublic reluctance to make the digital transition could also stem from security concerns, says Gary Richards, a tax partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. \nIn 2007, HMRC was guilty of the largest government data leak to date, when it lost details of 25m child benefit recipients — including names, addresses, dates of birth, bank account details and national insurance numbers. Although the loss of physical discs remains a risk, cyber security threats have since moved on. \nThe most common threat is decidedly low-tech. So-called “phishing” emails by criminals posing as HMRC look to extract personal details and money from their recipients. The tax authority, which has issued warnings on these attacks, says it never asks for information in this way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:04:17.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
