However, they can also produce higher levels of nitrous oxides (NOx), which are harmful to human health.\nHendricks said diesel engines could only have a future if the industry could prove that it could \"make them really clean\".\nShe called for Europe-wide tests under real conditions and said these needed to ensure that vehicles are built in such a way that they stick to low emissions on the streets.\nThe costs for the system of checks would have to be borne by the manufacturers, she said.\nHendricks also said that municipalities should, in future, be able to prevent vehicles from going on the road if the level of nitrous oxides they emitted were too high.\n(Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:19:18.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
