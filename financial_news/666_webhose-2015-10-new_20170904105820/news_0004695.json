These include the prospect of higher fuel costs in the future, which tends to negatively impact store traffic trends.\n\nDeflationary trends Food price declines in the United States are a concern. Grocery is Walmart’s largest product category, accounting for almost 56% of sales in Walmart US and Sam’s Club. Food price deflation has already figured as a drag on Walmart’s recent results .\nIndustry consolidation Higher competition is also a concern. Several of Walmart’s competitors such as Dollar Tree (DLTR), Albertsons, and Kroger (KR) have grown larger through the inorganic route. Some such as Koninklijke Ahold (AHONY) and Delhaize (DEG) are seeking to consolidate. These factors will likely give rise to pockets of competition. Walmart is likely to find itself fighting simultaneous battles in different product categories, market segments, and geographies.\nThe entry of German discount chains Aldi and Lidl into the US market is expected to further lower prices in the industry.

The above-mentioned factors are likely to pressure Walmart to slash prices in a bid to keep up with rivals. It already has Everyday Low Prices and Savings Catcher programs that aim to match prices with competitors.\nWalmart has already asked suppliers to spend less on advertising and displays and focus on lowering costs, according to a Business Insider report citing the Wall Street Journal .\nWalmart’s considerable dominance of the US grocery market has given the company significant leeway to exert pressure on suppliers in order to lower costs. For more analysis on the deflationary impact, read our earlier article The Wal-Mart Impact on Food Price Deflation . \nOmni-channel thrust Walmart also believes its omni-channel offering may be a great equalizer. Technology and an expanded product assortment would be a major driver to attract consumers from across the income spectrum.\nWalmart makes up 2.4% of the portfolio holdings in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA).\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Walmart Stock Suffers as the Company Slashes Earnings Outlook Part 2 - Can Walmart Achieve Its Three-Year Revenue Growth Target?
