On Monday, they fell 1 basis point to 0.60 percent.\nMarket moves have been erratic. At times, signals of more stimulus, which would come in the form of bond buying, pushed yields lower. On other days, similar signals prompted investors to switch from bonds into stocks and yields rose.\n\"An umpteenth increase in monetary stimulus, especially in the euro zone or Japan, is likely and could restore investors' confidence temporarily,\" said Didier Saint-Georges, managing director and member of the investment committee at Carmignac.\n\"This global economic slowdown would be less of an issue if it was not being made worse by deflationary pressures and did not occur at a time when confidence in central banks' ability to provide an effective solution is starting to be questionable.\"\nBond yields in Spain and Italy inched lower to 1.84 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively. Both were near five-month lows.\n\"We are content to retain relatively elevated levels of risk, having added exposure in September,\" said Mark Dowding, co-head of investment grade at BlueBay Asset Management.\n\"We see value in spreads against the backdrop of ongoing growth and relaxed monetary policy conditions.\"\nSEMI-PERMANENT\nA report by the Group of Thirty, an international body led by former ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet, warned on Saturday that zero rates and money printing were not sufficient to revive growth and risked becoming \"semi-permanent\".\nMost policymakers at the semi-annual International Monetary Fund meeting last week had relatively upbeat forecasts for the world economy and said risks have been largely contained. The G30, however, warned that the 40 percent decline in commodity prices could presage weaker growth and \"debt deflation\".\nTop international financiers told the IMF meeting that central banks have little room for error in a low-growth world in which over-leveraged and commodity-dependent emerging economies and a slowing China are major risks.\nViews over the path of monetary policies and the global growth outlook are diverging in financial markets as well.\nHSBC slashed its 2016 Bund yield forecast to 0.2 percent from 0.95 percent last week, citing challenging economic conditions and looser-for-longer monetary policies.\nUBS strategists, however, say Bund yields might hit 2.0 percent next year as European growth picks up.\nFor others, what's key for yields is inflation, rather than growth. Even in faster growing economies like the United States inflation is far off target. In Europe, markets expect it to remain below the ECB's goal for a decade at least.\n\"Bond markets have little need to worry whether we see recession or not,\" Citi strategists said in a note. \"A far greater risk of higher inflation is needed to unsettle rates markets,\" they said, adding this was not on the horizon.
