Its growth, praised even by the usually skeptical international financial institutions, has brought a rare momentum of change in economic, social and political spheres. The age old Westernised inclination of associating Ethiopia with drought and impoverishment is, slowly but surely, fading away. A rather new image, associated with huge public investment push and construction boom, is replacing the dismaying historical legacy. Ethiopia's growth story is not a black and white one, though. Things are not as embellished as proponents of the incumbent would like others believe, and not as hopeless as their opponents paint. Much as growth is happening, structural transformation is not taking root fast. Ethiopia's, therefore, is a story of growth minus comparable structural transformation. There is consensus, both in political and economic spheres, that industrialisation is the key for structural transformation. Not only is there a general level political interest to push industrial take off, but much is being done to put in the cornerstones in place. Aggressive efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), restructuring of the education system towards science and technology, establishment of sectoral industrial support systems, such as the Textile Industry Development Institute (TIDI) and Leather Industry Development Institute (LIDI), streamlined Small and Micro Enterprise Development (SMED) policy, and tailored industrial development financing are just some of the systemic elements put forward to facilitate industrialisation. Complementing these efforts is the policy affinity towards optimising linkages. Despite the changing structure and prevalence of linkages, there is a strong policy interest in leveraging all possible forward and backward linkages in the industrial sector. As a recent book by Arkebe Oqubay (PhD), a seasoned politician and policy insider, titled, Made in Africa: Industrial Policy in Ethiopia, clearly shows, optimising linkages and arranging policy around them is one crucial policy approach followed by the incumbents. Nonetheless, industrial development is still in its infancy. Industry contributes only 14.2pc of the gross domestic product (GDP). Industrial value added is also low at 3pc. The total employment contribution of the sector is also very low, at 0.7pc of the total employment in the economy. At 7.2pc, the industrial exports of Ethiopia, as a ratio of GDP, is also lower than the Sub-Saharan average. Ethiopia takes an insignificant share in the global industrial trade. If there is any time that Ethiopian policymakers ought to take a rabbit out of their hats to push industrialisation forward, then, it is now. There are multiple factors for this. The youth population of the nation is bulging so fast as to pose a huge risk to the economy. Unemployment is so rampant that one in six Ethiopians of working age is unemployed. Small land holding size, extreme land fragmentation, declining soil fertility, large family size and climate change are making a large proportion of the rural youth landless and jobless. The resulting urban-rural migration is burdening cities, mainly Addis Abeba. No doubt that many of these factors entail political liability, if left unattended. Politicians, especially those in the ruling party, seem to have the right understanding of the magnitude of the tide. No single day passes without hearing a statement about the importance of industrialisation and oftentimes, the rhetoric has to do with the role of the state in the industrialisation. According to the dominant line within both the public and the political space, the state is the key force for industrialisation. Not only is the state considered a facilitator of technology accumulation, it is also perceived as the force behind accumulation of social capital that enable markets to operate smoothly. Unlike the market-based industrialisation approach, taken in British and American industrialisation of late 1990s, the statist (or developmental) industrialisation unfolding in Ethiopia, presumably copied from the East Asian tigers, heavily relies on the indispensability of the state. In the words of the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, this is an approach that abhors the traditional \"neoliberal night watchman state.\" The phenomenon is not as such surprising. The Ethiopian society, both historically and culturally, has strong affinity to the state. The small and effective state approach, which was popular in the 1980s and 1990s, has faced a serious theoretical and practical setback since the financial crisis of 2008. This, of course, is not to mention the serious structural challenge state capitalism in China, often considered a driving force for statist revival around the world, is currently facing. An oil price decline has also sent shockwaves through the spine of the hegemonic Russian state, as much as the welfare state of Brazil is suffering from a low commodity supercycle, corruption and investor flight. In any case, the adoption of a statist approach to industrialisation in Ethiopia is not unexpected. There is enough political, economic, social, cultural and historical background for its happening. What seems to be puzzling, though, is a rather monotonous depiction of the role of the state in industrialisation. This hides essential systemic faults and hence demands crucial scrutiny. Certainly, the state has a key role to play in Ethiopia's industrialisation. But the state is not a faultless entity. It has inherent and realistic limitations. The unguarded involvement of the state could also hinder industrialisation, instead of facilitating it. In short, state intervention in industrialisation has its own good, bad and ugly faces. To start with the good, the state has huge regulatory, policy and resource leverages to dispense in the industrialisation process. From creating a strong and functioning property rights regime to legislating in favour of industrial investment, the state has immense capabilities to put into industrialisation. Cognizant that the Ethiopian state is constitutionally entrusted to control key factors of production, such as land, it can play an exceptional role in realising industrial development. By historical coincidence, the Ethiopian state owns huge capital, both financial and physical. It can, therefore, use this resource base to facilitate industrial development. This can happen in the form of infrastructure investment, investing in key pulling industries, filling market gaps, partnering with the private sector and guaranteeing foreign investment. Honestly speaking, much good is taking place. Development of industrial parks; investing in key economic infrastructures, such as roads, railways and hydropower; creating partnerships with foreign investors in capital intensive sectors, such as large textile factories; and filling market (investment) gaps, such as investment in fertiliser factories, are some of the very good steps the Ethiopian state is taking to realise industrialisation. In the upside, the Ethiopian state is also learning much from its engagements. As Arkebe illustrates in his exceptionally detailed book, the Ethiopian state is stretching itself, left and right, to actively learn by doing. Surely, the learning is not even in all sectors. But it is slowly sinking in within the different tiers of the state. The hope is this learning could end up in some form of endogenous industriousness. It is not only the good that is happening, though. There is also enough bad around. In its effort to bring a holistic industrial push in the economy, the Ethiopian state is throwing out negative externalities, both to the economy and to the industrialisation effort. Massive public investment in infrastructure has brought a huge debt buildup, including issuance of a two billion dollar Eurobond debut. The absence of a prioritised public investment portfolio means that public investment is occurring without tailored policy guidance, resulting in knee jerk effects, such as inflation, and long run structural challenges, such as productive loss. As the state is ingesting more than it can chew, the quality of investment is being compromised for amount and urgency. This certainly means a shorter productive cycle of investments, such as infrastructure, and higher future overheads, such as maintenance. Due to the dominant role of politics in investment decisions, the spatial portfolio of public investment is not following the efficiency dividend (return on investment). This means that huge current returns are forgone for uneconomic reasons. In view of industrialisation, this all means that the policy environment is far from favourable. The policy and macroeconomic context for industrialisation is tainted with structural weaknesses, inefficiency, postponed and embedded costs and uncertainty. And these factors extend to the monetary realm, furthering the disruptive impact on industrialisation. But the ugly face sits in the role of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Supposedly, the SOEs were meant to be instruments of industrial take off. But, in reality, they are playing against this objective. Instead of pulling industrial development up the ladder, most of the SOEs, including those under the Metal & Engineering Corporation (METEC), are seen playing at the lower end, competing with the private sector. Their linkage with the local private sector, whether with established manufacturing companies, or with SMEs, is minimal. Some are even seen serving as agents, instead of actual manufacturers. It also has become customary to see the SOEs extending their wings to the lower ends of market dealings, such as retailing. Relying on observation, for lack of detailed study, one could see SOEs settling for low-input, low-technology, capital-intensive and low-functionality engagements. Even then, by virtue of their ownership structure, the SOEs get direct contracts from the state. This means the private sector has been sidelined outright from certain engagements. In a way, the essential culture of industriousness, founded on competition and innovation, is not being hatched here. What instead prevails is passivity, ordinariness and lethargy. This last face of state intervention embraces huge risk for both the economy as well as the industrialisation effort. It can be a recipe for a culture of having inefficient beasts with marginal contribution to industrialisation and posing huge burden for the economy. One needs no better evidence that the huge indebtedness of Chinese SOE to see the end point. True, Ethiopian industrialisation is just starting. This, however, does not mean it necessarily has to make the same mistakes that other nations have entertained. If there is any benefit industrial catch-up gives to nations, it is the opportunity to avoid the mistakes of pioneers and do better than them. In light of this, I would argue that Ethiopia can better industrialise by strengthening the good of the state, reducing the bad externalities of improper policy guidance and avoiding the ugly side of SOEs. However, I concur with Arkebe that the learning has to be by doing. Getachew T. Alemu Getachew T. Alemu Is Op-Ed Editor of Fortune. He Can Be Contacted At Getachew@addisfortune.com.
