Cotton seed meal supplements nitrogen while ammonium nitrate and urea are added at the beginning to provide a ready source of nitrogen. The by-products of composting is ammonia and heat, so you should expect the temperatures to rise. The compost is ready when the straws become easy to bend, have a high water-holding capacity, the colour changes and becomes darker, and has a strong smell of ammonia. The compost should then be packed into clear bags to enable the farmer to see the changes going on and to identify diseases and infections easily. The bags should then be taken to the mushroom house/building and placed on \"shelves\". (ii) Spawning This is the actual process of planting the mushrooms. The spawn is spread on the surface of the compost, but it slightly penetrates the surface. You can do this by making a small hole using your finger and planting the spawn. The temperature of the room should be maintained at around 25 degrees Celsius. A humidifier should be used to make the room humid and if the gadget is not available, water can be manually sprayed on the walls and floor of the room. (iii) Casing Once the spawn has attached to the wheat straws and looks like a white substance, soil is added to the surface of the compost. A layer of soil is needed and forest soil is preferred. However, the soil has to be treated to rid insects. Formalin solution can be used to sterilise the soil before casing is done (iv) Growth and harvesting Mushroom is harvested several times throughout its lifetime. What are harvested are called flushes. The first flush comes 15-20 days after soil casing and 35-40 days after spawning. Mushrooms should be harvested at the right size, otherwise they will become too big and rapture. Each bag should produce at least a kilo throughout its lifetime. The harvests can go up to the fifth flush. It takes approximately 15 weeks from composting to end of harvesting. A mushroom house should not be close to a cattle shed because the flies from the cattle can contaminate the mushrooms. One of the biggest challenges in mushroom production is getting quality spawn. Besides several private farms, farmers can get spawn from Egerton University, Biological Sciences Department.
