President Jacob Zuma announced government was looking at starting the process to expedite all claims arising from the Marikana massacre. He said a judge, assisted by experts, would lead the process. At the time, the presidency said government was still considering the recommendations made by the Farlam Commission of Inquiry, which investigated the deaths of 44 people - 34 of whom were killed by police - during strike-related violence at Marikana in August 2012. The final report was handed to Zuma on March 31, who then released it to the public on June 25. In the meantime, a board of inquiry, chaired by Judge Cornelis Johannes Claasen, was appointed to look into allegations of misconduct against national police commissioner Riah Phiyega. Advocates Bernard Sakhile Khuzwayo and Anusha Rawjee would join Claassen on the board of inquiry. It was still not clear if Phiyega would be suspended while the commission sits. Zuma asked her to provide reasons why he should not suspend her pending the inquiry. Phiyega then requested more time to respond and Zuma gave her until September 28. She met that deadline.
