These costs mainly related to an exploration well drilled offshore Norway during 3Q 2015 on the Zeppelin prospect in Norwegian production license PL734. This well was reported as a dry hole . \nLundin also said that it will recognize a net foreign exchange loss of approximately $201 million in its income statement for the third quarter of 2015. The FX loss mainly relates to the revaluation of loan balances at the prevailing exchange rates at the end of the reporting period, with the Norwegian krone weakening by eight percent against the euro and the US dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:14:44.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
