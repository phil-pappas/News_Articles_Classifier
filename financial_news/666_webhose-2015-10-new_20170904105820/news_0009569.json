The company is being sued by ex-CEO Charney, who was fired in December following allegations that he had violated its sexual harassment policy. Charney denies those charges.\nCharney has also filed a $30 million lawsuit against Standard General, one of the company's biggest shareholders, for defamation.\nThe Los Angeles company said that its U.S. retail stores - as well as wholesale and U.S. manufacturing - will continue to operate. International stores are not affected. American Apparel had approximately 227 retail stores in 19 countries as of Sept. 30.\nJohn Brooks, a former business development manager for American Apparel, said Monday that while it's not a surprise that the company is seeking protection, it will be interesting to see who will benefit from the bankruptcy filing and what the business will look like after.\nThe chain also said that it will pay all of its suppliers in full under normal terms for goods and services provided on or after bankruptcy filing on Monday.\nThe plan will wipe out more than $200 million in bonds held by the retailer in exchange for equity interests. Lenders will provide about $90 million in debtor-in-possession financing.\nAmerican Apparel's board has approved the restructuring plan, which is expected to be completed in about six months. It still needs approvals from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\nShares of American Apparel Inc. plunged more than 24 percent before the opening bell Monday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
