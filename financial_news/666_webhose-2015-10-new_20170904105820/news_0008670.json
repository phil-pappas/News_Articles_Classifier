The answer quite possibly is no.\nAustralia's new Treasurer, Scott Morrison, also might be wondering what it means for the early signs of life in non-mining business investment. It certainly won't have accelerated what looks like a very slow process.\nAs Standard & Poor's put it, the prospect of rising interest rates in the United States, slowing growth in China, and financial deleveraging has created a \"much darker outlook\" for emerging market economies.\nUS Federal Reserve boss, Janet Yellen, must wonder if there will be a good time to raise rates this year. Jacquelyn Martin That makes the outlook challenging for the commodity-exporting countries that have boomed on back of the emerging markets economies' commodity-intensive growth.\nMost of these countries also are emerging market economies, but a few are advanced economies, like Canada and Australia.\nIt also will mean many sleepless nights for western investors and mining company executives.\nObject of panic The Anglo-Swiss resource giant, Glencore, became the object of panic among investors who live in fear of the next Lehman Brothers .\nFaced with zero interest rates in the major advanced economies, western investors have poured money into the emerging market economies. Now they are focussing on the downside risks.\nThe International Monetary Fund's analysis of commodity exporters added econometric fuel to the week's fire with its prediction of annual growth taking a 1 percentage point cut. This raises the spectre of all the unpleasant surprises that come with the unwinding of credit bubbles.\nThe IMF's warning about the potential for the amplification of a powerful commodity price cycle also applies to many of the credit-fuelled asset price cycles that have accompanied it.\nIt says overly optimistic expectations about the persistence of the boom are likely to increase both the perceptions of wealth and spending during the upswing, and the correction in spending in the downswing.\nThe cycle also will have been exaggerated by \"financial frictions\" that reduce the cost of finance in the upswing but increase it in the downswing, and by pro-cyclical government spending. A potentially troublesome twist to the financial story is the growth of low-interest US dollar debt in the emerging market economies – debt that now has to be serviced and repaid with the weaker emerging market economy currencies.\nThis is the world in which a good many western investors now find themselves.\nAustralia, of course, is not a typical commodity exporter. It is a developed economy with a freely floating exchange rate and a strong macroeconomic policy framework.\nNon-mining investment With the Reserve Bank of Australia's official cash rate at a record low 2 per cent and the Australian dollar's 25 per cent depreciation over the past two and a half years, the deputy governor, Philip Lowe, last month told the House of Representatives' economics committee that non-mining business investment should soon start to accelerate.\n\"My sense is we are getting closer to the point where at least a few more businesses are going to be prepared to step forward, because you see them now hiring workers at a rate that they had not done for quite a while.\n\"As Glenn [Stevens, the RBA governor] has said a couple of times, the current conditions are quite positive, at least from the business surveys. Interest rates are as low as they have ever been. And banks want to lend. If we just get a little decline in uncertainty, I think we are quite close to the point where we will see business investment start picking up.\"\nWhat he is talking about is a new phase in the economy's adjustment to accommodate the mining boom. First, the non-mining economy's growth slowed to make room for the expansion of the mining sector. Now, as mining investment declines, there is scope for these industries to expand.\nBut it may be a longer process than some of us had thought.\nRBA economists Adam Gorajek and Daniel Rees have mapped the impact of falling commodity prices on the economy.\n\"After commodity prices start to fall, the model suggests that it takes several years for the non-mining tradeable sector to start to recover, much as has been observed over recent years,\" they say.\n\"This protracted nature of the recovery may reflect the fact that the commodity price boom coincided with a sustained period of relatively low investment in this sector, which lowers its productive capacity.\n\"Moreover, even though the exchange rate depreciates after the boom, it is estimated to remain above pre-boom levels in line with the assumption about commodity prices.\"\nThe model, they say, suggests that falling commodity prices typically lead to a period of below-average economic growth but not a sharp contraction – which is a relief, but still a warning that we may have a long haul ahead of us.", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2015/sep/pdf/bu-0915.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:05:13.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
