Anastasopoulos became a South African internet phenomenon in May 2014.\n\"I was just doing DIY on my own,\" said Suzelle, in Johannesburg on Thursday promoting the book, \"when my next-door neighbour, Hennie — he’s very good at computers — told me about YouTube. Believe it or not, the 10th video we did went viral.\"\nThe book, said Suzelle, was \"a dream come true\", and her favourite DIY feature in it was the braai pie.\n\"It’s so easy, anyone can do it and everyone loves it and you can use the meat from the braai you were invited to yesterday. It is in the book and there is a video, so no excuses.\"\nSuzelle said making the book was \"lots of fun, so maybe I can make a book again someday; and there’s photos by an amazing photographer, Adriaan Oosthizen.\"\nDetails\nTITLE: Suzelle DIY: The Book AUTHOR: Julia Anastasopolous and Ari Kruger PUBLISHER: Human and Roussea\nNow that the book was done, Suzelle said she was \"busy making more videos\", including some that involve Christmas tips. \"And then, next year maybe there will be a Suzelle DIY live show, but I still have to find a producer. It will include my best friend, Marianne.\"\nSuzelle DIY was also looking at doing some travelling in the new year. The documentation of her adventures would include more DIY tips such as how to pack a suitcase and how to travel light. \"I’m very excited, I haven’t travelled a lot,\" she said.\nSince she became an internet phenomenon, Suzelle has met with some of SA’s celebrities such as sports scientist Tim Noakes, entertainer Nathaniël, and television chef Justin Bonello.\n\"Tim Noakes was very interesting,\" she said. \"It was so nice to talk to him.\n\"To be honest, I tried (the low-carbohydrate high-fat diet Noakes advocates) for about five minutes, but I love sweeties and chocolate and some condensed milk in my rooibos tea. So, no, it’s not for me.\"\nNathaniël le Roux (known in SA by his first name) is also known for his public DIY and decorating tips.\n\"He’s really a nice guy\", said Suzelle. \"And he’s really good at DIY so I love him even more. He’s very sharp, and he makes jokes all the time. At first I was very nervous to meet him, but he was laughing a lot at me too, we were laughing together.\"\nSuzelle said she really did believe that anyone could do DIY effectively. \"Ja, young or old, big or small, girl or boy, you can use your creativity. Even if it (ends up looking) a bit rustic, give it a try. Sometimes people just need a little bit of inspiration.\"\nAt the back of the book are a series of QR-codes (square \"quick response\" barcodes easily read by a scanner, such as in a smart phone) that link to some of Suzelle’s two-minute YouTube videos. There is even one on how to fold a fitted sheet.\n\"You know, a lot of people don’t know how to fold a fitted sheet and they get so frustrated. It can get into a ball in the cupboard,\" she said.\n* Watch Suzelle DIY’s latest video, How to Make Boerewors Bagel Dogs\npic", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-YkXfqpR5k"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:23:09.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
