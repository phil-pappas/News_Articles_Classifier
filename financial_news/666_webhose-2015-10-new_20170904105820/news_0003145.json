The Advocate General himself said that Facebook has done nothing wrong. \n\"What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law provides to enable essential transatlantic data flows. \n\"Facebook, like many thousands of European companies, relies on a number of the methods prescribed by EU law to legally transfer data to the US from Europe, aside from Safe Harbour. \n\"It is imperative that EU and US governments ensure that they continue to provide reliable methods for lawful data transfers and resolve any issues relating to national security.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:03:46.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
