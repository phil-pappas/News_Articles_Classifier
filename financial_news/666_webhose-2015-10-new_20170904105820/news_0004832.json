Under GAAP we are only allowed to include revenue beginning July 25,\" AT&T spokesman Brad Burns told Reuters. \"This is a one-time variance as analysts sort through some of the normal modeling of an acquisition,\" Burns added.\nAT&T said in September that it would change the methodology DirecTV used to count its commercial subscribers to conform to its practices, which would reduce DirecTV's total subscriber count by 918,600 at the close of the deal.
