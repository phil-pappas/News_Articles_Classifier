One of these tools is the new simplified JD Edwards upgrade process. This approach allows clients to spend less time retrofitting modifications, testing and training.\nThe simplified JD Edwards upgrade gives users more time to focus on business process continuity for processes that do not change during the upgrade, and more importantly use the upgrade time to address other business challenges with new features or functionality. In short, the new simplified upgrade process will help JD Edwards EnterpriseOne clients stay current and potentially receive a better return on their investment.\nTerillium was among a select group of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) members to receive the beta version of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 9.2. During the beta testing, Terillium upgraded their JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 9.1 lab system using the simplified upgrade process tools to upgrade to the recently released JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 9.2 . This beta program validated the new tools and also educated Terillium’s technology team on the options available to make upgrades predictable, faster and more reliable.\n\"The Oracle JD Edwards team continues to build great software. With the release of EnterpriseOne 9.2 we wanted to place an emphasis on a simpler upgrade process so users can capitalize on the new enhancements as quickly as possible. Terillium has been very supportive during the beta testing phase and is one of the most experienced upgrade partners in the JD Edwards community,\" said Lyle Ekdahl, senior vice president general manager, Oracle’s JD Edwards.\n\"Being able to take advantage of new features and functionalities soon after they are released is a big challenge for Oracle’s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne clients. With the new simplified upgrade tools available, once a client gets current, it will be easier for them to stay current. This way clients will be able to deploy new applications and functionality that best fits the needs of their business,\" said Dave Woodworth, president at Terillium.\nIn an effort to help showcase the new upgrade tools and strategies, Terillium is offering a complimentary JD Edwards upgrade workshop in Chicago on November 12.
