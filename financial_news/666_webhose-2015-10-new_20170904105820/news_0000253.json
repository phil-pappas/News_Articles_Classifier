The withdrawal of overdraft facilities is a significant problem for SMEs Conrad Ford, Funding Options \n“Overall access to overdrafts has stabilised over the last year, but still around 25pc feel that access to finance is a barrier,” said the FPB’s Thomas Parry. “This makes other issues such as late payment and the rising cost of doing business far more important as businesses feel that they have less leeway. \n“In helping our members we have found some banks are more likely to offer overdrafts than others and we will wait to see if the recent recommendations from the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) encourage firms to switch banks to one that is more in tune with their needs.” \nThe initial findings of the CMA’s investigation into the nation’s leading banks were published earlier this month. \nThe big banks are culling overdrafts \nIt revealed that overdrafts were sought by two-thirds of SME respondents; 83pc agreed that overdrafts are the best solution for dealing with late payments , unexpected expenses and cash flow shortages; and yet 62pc were not offered an overdraft by their bank. \n“The problem of reduced overdrafts is unlikely to abate,” said Mr Ford. \nBanks have been systematically decreasing the number of overdrafts on their books since stricter capital controls were imposed in 2009 . \nThey are required to keep reserves equal to the entire amount in overdrafts that could be drawn down at any time rather than the actual amount that businesses are overdrawn. \n“FSB research consistently shows that access to finance remains a challenging area for small businesses, with 32pc of those surveyed telling us their applications for credit were turned down,” said John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. \n“While a bank overdraft is just one of many financing options available to small firms, it’s currently still a traditional and well-known route for raising capital.” \nJeff Longhurst, chief executive of Asset Based Finance Association, the finance body, said that more businesses are using working capital solutions like invoice finance and asset based lending, evidence that overdrafts were proving harder to come by. \n“There is no doubt that capital requirements and technology are changing the funding landscape for SMEs,” he said. \nFunding Options’ analysis of 160,000 Companies House records showed that UK SMEs, unable to access capital from the banks, are now using £76bn worth of alternative finance. Banks are helping smaller businesses do what they do best – drive economic growth and create jobs British Bankers Association \nIt found that alternative lending to SMEs is now equivalent to 46pc of the value of traditional term loans and overdrafts, which have fallen to £163bn, down 5pc from £172bn a year ago, and 17pc from £197bn four years ago. \n“Borrowers should feel confident about applying to their bank for finance,” a spokesman for the British Bankers Association said. “Nearly eight out of 10 businesses that applied for finance in the past 18 months were given the green light. \n\"Banks are helping smaller businesses do what they do best – drive economic growth and create jobs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:20:08.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
