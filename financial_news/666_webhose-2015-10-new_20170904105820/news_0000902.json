Photo: Louise Kennerley\nCommonwealth Bank raises variable home loan rates Australian dollar loses half a cent as Commonwealth Bank raises mortgage rates Westpac hiked interest rates on home loans last week and on Thursday afternoon the Commonwealth Bank followed the lead . Just see how quickly the other two major lenders, the National Australia Bank and ANZ join the party.\nShareholders will always win in a tussle with customers\nLike Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank justified the move citing the additional cost of regulatory capital. But CBA put its rates up by a little less - 15 basis points compared with Westpac's 20 basis points.\nThe reality is the other two banks can now not afford to be left behind. They are also feeling the pinch of the prudential regulator demanding that more capital must be set aside against their mortgage lending.\nAdvertisement For banks having more capital comes at a cost.\nFor ANZ and NAB to do nothing would disadvantage relative to CBA and Westpac.\nHow much in enough? Whether Westpac and CBA have lifted rates by more than was necessary to compensate for higher capital needs is a matter for debate.\nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, certainly thinks Westpac overstepped the mark.\nRegardless of who you believe, at this point in time our two largest home lenders have moved to shore up their profits by passing the regulatory costs onto their home loan borrowers.\nDoubtless the move will open the debate about whether borrowers should have to bear these costs while shareholders are protected.\nBut history has demonstrated all too clearly that in the world of banking - shareholders will always win in a tussle with customers.\n\"Any decision to change interest rates is carefully considered. The cost of the new capital required to make the Australian banking system more secure needs to balance the interests of our customers, as well as the nearly 800,000 households who are direct shareholders and the millions more who are invested through their superannuation funds,\" CBA said in a statement.\nAnd Tuesday's release of the government's response to the Financial System Inquiry - which backed up its findings that our banks should be unquestionably strong - provided CBA with the perfect opportunity andexcuse to move in the its wake.\nCBA could have waited until early November to see whether the Reserve Bank would move to reduce rates. If the central bank had done so the banks would have reduced their home loans by a lesser amount. It would have been the equivalent of defacto interest rate rise.\nOne can only assume the CBA was of the view the RBA would leave rates on hold in November - a view supported by most economists - at least until Thursday afternoon.\nIf all the major banks move to raise rates before the November 3 RBA meeting it make feel it needs to act.\nIt will certainly make the next rates decision something of a cliffhanger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:14:51.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
