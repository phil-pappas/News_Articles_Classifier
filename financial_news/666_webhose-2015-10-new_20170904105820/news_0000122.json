Official results are due on Tuesday.\n\"If it turned out that we are a few seats short (of a majority) I would prefer a stable cooperation and the first natural partner is Mr Kukiz,\" said Jaroslaw Gowin, who leads one of the smaller allied groupings with which PiS fought the election.\n\"If Kukiz decides otherwise, then we'd have to bet on a scenario of a minority government,\" Gowin, who PiS officials have said will likely be the country's new defence minister, told Polsat News TV.\nWhile Kukiz has claimed a protest vote from younger Poles dissatisfied with politics, his views on social issues chime with the socially conservative and traditional Catholicism of PiS.\nEarlier on Monday, Kukiz told Radio Zet he did not plan to enter a coalition but Polish political commentators assume that Law and Justice will be able to count on at least some of the group's MPs in parliament.
