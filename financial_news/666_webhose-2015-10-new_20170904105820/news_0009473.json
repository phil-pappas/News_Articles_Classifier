Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nThe Moscow Exchange (MOEX) has reported its trading volumes for the month ending September 2015, which were characterized by strong growth across its foreign exchange (FX) market turnover, according to a MOEX statement. \nDuring September 2015, the total FX market turnover at MOEX swelled to RUB 34.6 trillion, up 9.1% MoM from RUB 31.7 trillion in August 2015 – this includes spot trades of RUB 10.5 trillion and swap trades coming in at RUB 24.0 trillion in September 2015. Across a yearly timetable, this growth was even more profound, with September 2015 rising 85.0% YoY from RUB 18.7 trillion in September 2014. \nIn addition, MOEX’s FX market’s average daily turnover in September 2015 was 1,570.6 billion ($23.5 billion), which rose by 4.1% MoM from RUB 1,508.3 billion ($23 billion) in August 2015. Compared with last year, September 2015’s FX market turnover surged 94.4% YoY from RUB 850.3 billion in September 2014. \nDerivatives market volumes were unable to capture the same growth trajectory as FX volumes in September 2015, which came in at just RUB 10.7 trillion – this was reflective of a fall of -8.5% MoM from RUB 11.7 trillion in August 2015. Despite the lackluster monthly performance, September 2015’s turnover is still vastly higher than the same period in 2014, having exploded 101.9% YoY from just 5.3 trillion in September 2014. \nLast month, MOEX experienced several notable disruptions , including two episodes of an outright suspension of trading following routine software errors.
