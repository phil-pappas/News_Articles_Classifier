Those taxes are subject to annual appropriation by the legislature.\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office issued a statement urging state officials to pass a budget.\n\"Until then, the city will continue to responsibly fund our infrastructure maintenance with general operating funds for the safety of our residents with the expectation that the state budget impasse will eventually be resolved and the city will be reimbursed,\" the statement said.\nUnspent tax revenue was used by Chicago to make August and September payments on the bonds and is expected to be tapped for October and November payments as well, the rating agency reported. Chicago projects that available motor fuel tax cash could be exhausted by January, but intends to use other revenue to avert a default on the bonds.\nS&P's downgrade also affects Chicago's $101 million drawdown loan under the federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act that also relies on motor fuel tax revenue.\nFitch Ratings, which rates Chicago's motor fuel tax bonds BBB-plus with a negative outlook, also raised concerns last month about the state budget battle's impact on the bonds.
