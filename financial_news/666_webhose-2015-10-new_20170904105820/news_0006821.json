Thursday's equity rally was the biggest after any European Central Bank meeting since July 2013, surpassing even January's, when the ECB president first announced quantitative easing. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 2.2 per cent on Friday, posting its longest streak of weekly gains since March.\nThis is not the first time Draghi's words have spurred a market rally. His QE announcement in January prompted the gauge's best first quarter since 1998, while his pledge in July 2012 to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro helped fuel the biggest annual gain since 2009. In July 2013, Draghi sparked an even bigger stock jump than yesterday by vowing to keep interest rates low for as long as necessary. This year, the Euro Stoxx 50 has gained at least 0.5 per cent on every ECB day.\nFor Lampe Asset Management's Michael Woischneck, Draghi's straight talking was exactly what investors needed, after the swings triggered by mixed messages from the Fed. The money manager is buying up more European equities, saying clarity from the ECB will provide support. \"After all the confusion the Fed has caused, it was very important for Draghi to deliver an unambiguous message,\" said Woischneck, who oversees the equivalent of $US161 million at Lampe Asset Management in Dusseldorf, Germany. \"It really differentiates the ECB from the Fed, in every way. Markets love certainty.\"\nWhat happened Friday\nAustralian shares roared higher on Friday following strong hints by the European Central Bank of further monetary stimulus, with a broad-based rally driving the benchmark index to a two-month high.
