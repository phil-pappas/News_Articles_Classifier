Bloomberg by Lisa Murray Activity across China's manufacturing sector contracted for the second straight month in September, adding to concerns about the slowing economy as the government rolled out more measures to boost property and car sales.\nChina's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.8 last month, improving only slightly from its three-year low of 49.7 in August. While the result beat expectations of another reading of 49.7, a level below 50 suggests activity contracted from the previous month.\nOne bright spot in the survey was an increase in the sub-index for new orders, which rose for the first time in three months and could mark the start of a turnaround for some factories in the last quarter of the year.\nReaction to the survey will be limited in China as markets are closed on the mainland and in Hong Kong for the National Day holiday.\nChina's economy has been rocked by a sharper-than expected slow-down in its construction and manufacturing sectors. That has overshadowed some positive signs for consumer goods and services firms, which are benefiting from rising incomes and the country's growing middle-class.\nChina's official services PMI stayed steady at 53.4 in September as accommodation, logistics and internet companies all did well in the lead up to the country's \"Golden Week\" holiday, which starts Thursday.\n\"This shows the non-manufacturing industry is growing steadily and confidence has stabilised,\" said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics\nHowever, the mixed outlook for China's economy has roiled global markets and forced the government to roll out a series of stimulus measures in a bid to lift spending and business activity. The People's Bank of China announced late on Wednesday it would reduce down-payment requirements for first home buyers in most major cities.\n The government also halved its sales tax on small cars in an effort to boost the automobile sector, which is one of the country's biggest employers. Car sales in China were flat in the first eight months of the year and some analysts expect they may even fall for 2015, which would be the first drop since the 1990s.\nA final reading for the Caixin purchasing managers' index, a private survey which reflects the health of China's small to medium sized manufacturers, showed activity is at its worst level since March 2009. The index for September was 47.2, higher than a preliminary reading of 47 but still down on August's result of 47.3.\nThe health of the sector has now deteriorated for seven months in a row, according to Caixin, affected by a sharp contraction in output and weak customer demand. That prompted those firms surveyed to cut staff numbers again in September.\nCaixin's survey also showed the services sector lost some momentum during the month with the headline business activity index dropping to 50.5 from 51.5 in August. However, a strong employment trend continued with services firms adding new jobs for each of the past 25 months.\nSome panelists told Caixin the recent military parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war had impacted business activity.\n\"Looking ahead, we expect sentiment to begin to improve gradually over the coming months as the stock market stabilises and recent policy support measures continue to feed through into stronger economic activity,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:54:55.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
