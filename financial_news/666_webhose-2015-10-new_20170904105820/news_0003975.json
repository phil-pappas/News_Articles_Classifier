It has been expanding in Mexico after the recent purchase of the third and fourth largest wireless carriers in that country.\nAT&T's net income, excluding DirecTV, fell to $3 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $3.13 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings of 74 cents per share beat the average analyst estimate of 69 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal operating revenue rose 18.6 percent to $39.1 billion, short of the average estimate of $40.4 billion.\nLike its rivals, AT&T is now making customers pay for their phones while charging them lower service fees. Previously, carriers favored two-year contracts that included heavily subsidized phones.\nAT&T has also simplified its plans and billing system, leading to fewer customer service calls and more savings, executives said on a conference call after its earnings report.\nAmong wireless consumers, AT&T reported 89,000 postpaid or monthly phone net new subscribers and 622,000 tablet net additions. It added 466,000 prepaid subscribers in the quarter.\nDirecTV, whose pay-TV subscriber numbers fell in the second quarter, had 26,000 net additions in the latest period, AT&T said. However, it lost 91,000 AT&T U-verse video customers.\nAT&T's rate of churn, or customer defections of monthly wireless users, was 1.16 percent in the quarter, higher than expected, of Jefferies said.
