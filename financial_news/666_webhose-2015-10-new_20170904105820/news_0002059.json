That is good news for the Greek debt.\nThe ECB has declined to comment on this information published by the Greek media, citing an ECB source. The final ECB report is expected to be published on October 31 st .\nRecapitalizing the four Greek systemic banks is necessary as their portfolio is deteriorating as a result of under-performing loans, tax hikes, and new austerity measures. Since the beginning of the crisis, under-performing loans are estimated to amount to 45% of total banking system assets, that is, a whopping € 100 bn, leading to successive bailout agreements.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:11:40.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
