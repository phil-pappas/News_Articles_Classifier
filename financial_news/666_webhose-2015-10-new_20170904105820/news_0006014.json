The consultation focuses on: what kind of financial advice consumers want; whether there are gaps between the financial advice that consumers want and the financial advice that they can access and afford; how these gaps can be closed; and what role technology, such as “robo-advice”, could play in improving access to financial advice.As a related exercise, Treasury is seeking input on the demand for public financial guidance. It asks: how much demand there is for the public provision of debt, pensions and general money guidance; how the provision of public financial guidance should be structured and funded; and how the government can make the provision of public financial guidance more effective for consumers. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Dentons …\" ee, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy.
