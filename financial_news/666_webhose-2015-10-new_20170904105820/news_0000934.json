Advertising Print This Post \nFIX Trading Community, a non-profit industry-wide initiative, has produced specific guidelines on Execution Venue Analysis for the Europe, Middle East, and African (EMEA) region. \nThe group’s latest round of revisions shifts focus onto the augmented clarity of Last Capacity and Liquidity flag definitions, in conjunction with the mandate of executing venues. This includes the important topics of broker crossing and alternative trading systems, namely in supply of valid Market Identifier Codes (MICs) on their respective executions. \nThe guidelines put forward by FIX have undergone an extensive process of review, following the group’s Global Buy-Side Committee analysis. Consequently, FIX’s community has monitored for any inconsistencies in an attempt to usher in the highest possible level of transparency. \nThese guidelines were supplemented by the newly forged EMEA Business Practices Subcommittee, which produced a revised set of guidelines to highlight EMEA-specific trade scenarios. \nAccording to Irina Sonich-Bright, Director, AES Business Development, Credit Suisse, in a recent statement on the guidelines: “The importance of the work being done by the FIX Trading Community is immense. The buy-side has voiced their needs and concerns and the importance of agreeing on the uniform standards that can be adopted by the broker community. By collaborating with the buy-side, consensus has been achieved in a very practical way.” \nLast month, FIX unveiled a targeted focus on MiFID II, culminating in the creation of six new subgroups to specifically address the regulation. In order to better grapple with a period of regulatory change and upheaval, FIX devoted six new specialized subgroups to MiFID II regulation, following a recent meeting with European regulatory authorities. The six subgroups included Clock Synchronisation, Reference Data, Transparency, Best Execution, Microstructure, and Order Data and Record Keeping. Got a news tip?
