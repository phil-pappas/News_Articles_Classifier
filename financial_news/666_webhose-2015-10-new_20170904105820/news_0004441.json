Though there are hundreds of special trains announced, to overcome the rush and meet the scarcity of tickets, only about 30% of them are launched in the regular pricing category. “Hundreds of special trains have been announced this year to meet the rush in certain busy routes. But the irony in these announcements is that only about 30% of these trains will charge the normal fares. 35% of the special trains belong to the dynamic pricing category and the rest 35% are superfast trains,” says Manish Rathi of RailYatri.in. \nIn a special survey conducted by RailYatri at New Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai railway stations, more than 2,000 passengers were interviewed. Some of the key findings include: (a) About 90% travellers didn’t know that Special Trains run with a delay and were stranded at the railway station; (b) Over 97% railyatris were not aware that they paid extra to book their tickets on Special Trains; and (c) 95% Special Trains will be delayed this festival season. The irony is that these Special Trains launched for the benefit of travellers not only charge more money than a normal train but are also delayed. “Although a hefty number of Special Trains is announced each year, there is still a major lack in the infrastructure to tackle the increased traffic of trains. Delays are common for Special Trains, and so are the pitiful services for passengers while travelling,” feels Rathi of RailYatri.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:47:50.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
