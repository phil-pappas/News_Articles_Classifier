After losing 4% in August the all share ended September marginally up by 0.23%.\nThe local market was supported by a positive opening on the Dow, which had gained 1.51% at the JSE’s close, with the FTSE 100 having firmed 2.34% and the Paris CAC 40 gaining 2.78%. The DAX was up 2.47%.\nAsian markets also had a positive day with the Nikkei adding 2.7% and the Hang Seng gaining 1.41%. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.48%.\n\"Global equities are closing in on their worst quarter since 2011,\" Barclays Research said in a note.\nThe equity market relief rally continued during the European session, despite jittery market sentiment owing to weak global growth concerns. Risk assets were generally supported with European equities broadly higher, Barclays said.\nEuropean markets were supported by euro area inflation falling back into negative territory in September (-0.1% year on year). Weak underlying inflation is weighing on inflation expectations, reinforcing additional policy stimulus by the European Central Bank (ECB), Barclays said.\nAt 5pm the all share had closed 1.43% higher at 50,088.90 and the blue-chip top 40 had gained 1.63%. Industrials were up 1.65% and financials gained 1.29%. Banks added 0.94% and resources ended the day 0.73% up. Platinums were 0.29% higher and the gold index ended the day flat (-0.08%).\nNedbank Private Wealth portfolio manager Warren Jeffrey said the market experienced a bit of a bounce on the day after some hard selling of resource stocks.\n\"But it may be too early to call a bottom in the mining sector.\"\nStar performers on the day include Glencore and SABMiller.\n\"AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller is expected to proceed, but it could still face many hurdles resulting in the deal possibly only (being) concluded within a year,\" Mr Jeffrey said.\nGlobal factors are dominating sentiment, with the market expected to remain under pressure and volatile until the US Fed actually starts to hike rates, he said.\n\"Equity valuations are expensive with the crucial question being by how much the Fed will hike,\" Mr Jeffrey said.\nGlobal mining group Glencore continued its recovery after being sold off heavily on Monday, gaining 15.56% to R19.16. BHP Billiton was 1.19% higher at R210.\nSABMiller ended the day 2.63% up at R780.\nNaspers was 3.02% firmer at R1,730.66.\nIn the platinum sector Lonmin bounced back, ending the day up 12.18% at R3.50, after suffering a terrible quarter of losses.\nCapitec had another good day, gaining 2.4% to R501 after delivering sterling interim results earlier in the week. Standard Bank was up 0.93% to R135 and FirstRand firmed 0.84% to R49.15.\nAmong financials, Discovery gained 3.75% to R137.66 and Liberty Holdings closed 3.7% higher at R126.25.\nIn the property sector Resilient firmed 0.81% to R116.01.\nIT company Datatec ended the day 15.76% lower at R62 after releasing a relatively weak trading update. Datatec expects headline earnings per share in the six months to August to drop by 25% from the year-earlier period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:19:09.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
