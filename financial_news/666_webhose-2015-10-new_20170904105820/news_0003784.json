Photo: Philip Gostelow\nSouth32 is set to make good on its promise to take significant costs out of the business, revealing on Thursday that it will shave 25 per cent of its group costs this financial year.\nThe pledge comes after fresh cuts to capital spending were announced by BHP Billiton on Wednesday, and are part of South32's plan to reduce costs by $US350 million ($483 million) by the end of financial year 2018.\nThe 25 per cent cuts were announced in the young company's September-quarter results, which included very strong performance from the company's Australian assets but continued problems in South Africa.\nClosure is looking increasingly possible for South32's South African manganese assets.\nAdvertisement The company has also suspended 3 per cent of aluminium production in South Africa on the back of weak market conditions and problems with electricity supply.\nBy contrast, production of alumina at Worsley in Western Australia rose 11 per cent as the division bounced back from maintenance.\nSilver production from the Cannington mine in Queensland has been forecast to slide for the next two years, but the September quarter proved an exception with production of silver rising 20 per cent compared to the previous quarter.\nThe 6.28 million ounces of silver produced in the quarter puts South32 well ahead of the pace required to achieve full year guidance of 21.65 million ounces, but South32 cautioned that the strong performance was likely to be temporary.\nLead and zinc production from Cannington was steady, but sales of Zinc surged 19 per cent higher than the previous quarter and 27 per higher than the same time last year.\nSouth32 gave scarse explanation for the rise, only saying that port outages slowed sales in the June quarter.\nZinc and lead sales will be increasingly watched during the December quarter in the wake of Glencore's decision to cut zinc production, and the fact that MMG's Century mine has reached the end of its working life.\nA similar story played out on Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory, where manganese production was much better than expected. But the looming wet season and plans for maintenance have stopped South32 from improving guidance.\nThe Illawarra Coking Coal business produced 5 per cent more than in the June quarter, despite a week-long strike at the Dendrobium mine during August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:14:15.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
