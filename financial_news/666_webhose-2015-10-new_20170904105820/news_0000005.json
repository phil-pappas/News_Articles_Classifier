Some of the film’s most heated scenes show the men feuding over Apple’s advertising and Jobs’ ouster.\nThe scenes were embellished, but the filmmakers made an effort to capture Sculley’s experiences, inviting him on set to learn his mannerisms, Sculley said. Sorkin has said he created an “impressionistic” portrait of Jobs, and his depiction of the dynamic between Sculley and Jobs largely rings true, Sculley said.\n“People loved working for Steve,” Sculley said. “He had a vision that excited all of us.”\nDecades after leaving Apple, Sculley’s path has converged with his old company’s. Among his many ventures, he co-founded Obi Worldphone, which makes smartphones featuring Silicon Valley design at a lower price point for emerging markets. The company addresses a hole in the market, much as Jobs’ Mac delivered a computer for everyday consumers, Sculley said.\n“I’ve always looked for opportunities to fill design gaps,” he said.\n 13, 2015 9:58 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:55:56.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
