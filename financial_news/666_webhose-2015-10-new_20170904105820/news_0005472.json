Robert Shakespeare by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Japanese trading and investment house Marubeni Corporation is believed to be seeking a stake in the Santos and Oil Search-backed PNG LNG gas project.\nAs Santos and its advisers at Deutsche Bank and Lazard juggle a fistful of proposals stemming from the wide-ranging strategic review, Street Talk understands one option under serious consideration for Santos is to sell a 3.6 per cent stake in PNG LNG to Marubeni in a deal that could be worth as much as $2 billion.\nSantos has a 13.5 per cent stake in the PNG LNG project, which it owns alongside ExxonMobil (33.2 per cent and operator), Oil Search (29 per cent), National Petroleum Company of PNG (16.8 per cent), JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration Company (4.7%) and Mineral Resources Development Company (2.8 per cent).\nThe asset's strategic value was underscored by Woodside Petroleum's bid for Oil Search in September and Santos executive chairman Peter Coates has already called PNG LNG his company's \"jewel in the crown\". But Santos' stake would be worth less than Oil Search's because it does not own as much of the gas that would be used for an expansion.\nThat said, everything is on the table at Santos and there are plenty of balls in the air.\nOther sources reckon Santos' preferred deal is the sale of assets in Western Australia and Victoria, along with an equity raising. [Bids for assets were due on October 20, however it's understood they were pushed back by one week.] However, hiving off a 3.6 per cent stake could allow Santos to achieve twin goals of paying down debt and maintaining a material interest in the project.\nIt comes as Santos rejected a $6.88 a share cash proposal from Middle East-backed Scepter Partners, saying it was an \"opportunistic\" approach . Scepter's team, headed by former Blackstone Advisory Partners banker Anthony Steains, is understood to have sought meetings with Santos, along with no-talk no-shop conditions and four-to-six weeks due diligence. Highbury Partnership and Gilbert + Tobin are advising the bidder.\nFund managers and analysts were also left wondering on Thursday night how Santos could price an equity raising given the 16 per cent share price jump on Thursday and the $6.88 a share line in the sand.\n They were also left guessing at the strength of Scepter's bid. It's a new entity and listed equities investors are yet to see exactly how the bidder funds its deals.\nThere is a theory that Steains and co made the bid without pitching the deal to the underlying equity sponsors [i.e. sovereign wealth funds and Brunei royalty]. It's also understood Scepter needed due diligence to line up debt funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:05:11.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
