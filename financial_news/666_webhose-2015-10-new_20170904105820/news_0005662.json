I was walking from the tram through Princes Park in Carlton, Melbourne, when l heard excited male voices. It was training night for the Carlton Football Club.\nI looked in and so began a love affair with the mighty \"Blues\" that has been through the best of times and the worst of times. Footy is like that.\nWe all need to worry when our long-standing and valued businesses start to underperform and fail.\nThis weekend's AFL grand final also takes me back to that year – 1961 – when Hawthorn won its first premiership and commenced its domination of the modern era, which may well be extended this weekend.\nLuke Hodge with the club's past two premiership cups, a testament to a positive culture at Hawthorn.

Both still going.\n\"Thank God for that,\" says Louise.\nFormer Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn stepped down as a result of the emissions scandal.

It pains me to tell you that our last premiership was 20 years ago.\nSo what happened to Carlton to cause such a prolonged fall from grace and what can we learn from football that helps us in business and life? It seems simple.\nCarlton lost its way under the control of John Elliott. Photo: Mario Borg\nSadly Carlton lost its way under the direction of the then titan of business John Elliot, who had proclaimed the greatness of the team that was widely acknowledged at the time as \"the best in the business\". But Tony Debolfo's book Out of the Blue revealed that Carlton was about to self-combust.\nIt started to secretly break the AFL salary cap rules, and instead of operating for the good of the game it started to believe its own hubris. Put simply, it had no guidelines, compromised values and no discipline.\nContrast that with the Hawthorn Football Club, the most successful AFL team of the modern era. Former Victorian premier and president of the Hawthorn club Jeff Kennett told me this week the strength of this year's team is a direct result of good long-term governance that has seen the club win one in every four grand finals over the last 44 years.\nIt has a deeply imbedded culture of doing the right thing for the game and an inviolable commitment to family values, of looking after one another with no exceptions – from boot studder to the highest paid player.\nAnd they have been led by some of the greatest and toughest coaches and administrators the game has seen – Ron Cook, Alan Jeans, the legendary John Kennedy, and Jeffery Gibb Kennett amongst many others.\nCarlton on the other hand let governance go out the window, although it is on its way back under new president Mark LoGiudice.\n\"Interesting how it equates to business,\" says Charlie.\nLook at the worldwide VW scandal with its deliberate systemic cheating on emission regulations. The latest issue of The Economist gives business a wake-up call with a story from VW about dirty corporate secrets, misdemeanours and so-called victimless crime.\n\"That's terrible,\" says Louise.\nAnd we have had our problems in Australia. Coles had real issues to sort out, and right now Woolworths is fighting its way through a difficult recent past but with Gordon Cairns at the helm I suspect it will do quite well again.\nBut 7-Eleven seems to have insurmountable governance and operational problems, with the legendary, super-wealthy Withers family in trouble.\n\"Looks to me like what soccer would call an own goal,\" says Charlie.\nWe all need to worry when our long-standing and valued businesses start to underperform and fail. And while sport is in our DNA and committed supporters get despairing, even hostile, when their teams don't live up to expectations, we need to remind ourselves that the highest standards of governance are required in all areas of life for enduring success.\nAnd that the common good is our greatest self-interest.\nLouise thinks what I'm really saying is \"don't cheat\".", "external_links": ["http://media.theage.com.au/video-sport/video-afl-real-footy/grand-final-day-begins-6898013.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:20:11.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
