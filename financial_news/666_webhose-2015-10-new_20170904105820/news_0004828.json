Strategize a plan to defeat student loans now. One of the best ways to save for college is perhaps the least advertised. States offer 529 college savings plans, which allow you to accumulate money tax-deferred for the colleges of your choice. You can invest in any state's plan, but it's hard to know which one is the best.Every state plan has mutual funds within their program that can be assembled into managed portfolios that reduce risk the closer a child gets to college (age-based), which I prefer, to take some of the guesswork out of investing. You can also buy individually managed mutual funds within the plan.When my daughter recently started college, we had saved money through a 529 plan. When we got our first bill, we had the money sent directly to the college's bursar office. It was a painless transaction.As you can imagine, there's a lot of variation from plan to plan. Some may feature well-managed funds that do well over time while others don't. Generally, I like plans that offer passively managed index funds in an age-based format. They are low cost and I don't worry about taking too much market risk.[entity display=\"Morningstar\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"morningstar\" ticker=\"MORN\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/9942\"]Morningstar[/entity], the Chicago-based financial information company, regularly does comprehensive ratings on 529 plans . Not only are they looking at returns within the funds, but the quality of management and \"best practices.\" They want to know if a plan is managed prudently and rate plans based on \"gold, silver and bronze\" status. (Disclosure: I contribute a monthly column for Morningstar.com).The more precious the metal, the higher the quality. A \"neutral\" rating indicates that a plan is \"not likely to deliver standout returns.\" The company also measures risk-adjusted performance and its \"value proposition,\" meaning if you're getting the most bang for your buck in terms of returns relative to expenses.This year, based on Morningstar's most recent 529 report , which came out yesterday, only four plans earned gold status. Seven were rated silver, 18 bronze and 32 neutral. There were two negative rated-funds out of the 63 programs evaluated. The following are the gold-rated plans:Plan State Manager1. Maryland College Investment Maryland T. Rowe Price2. T. Rowe Price College Savings Alaska T. Rowe Price3. Vanguard 529 College Savings Nevada Ascensus4. Utah Educational Savings Utah Utah Educational SavingsWhat do these plans have in common? They are direct-sold, that is, you don't have to go through a broker or adviser to buy them. That means you don't have to pay a commission, which I suggest you avoid in buying any 529 plan. These programs are also relatively low cost and have a variety of well-managed investment options.If you're looking for the one of the lowest-cost plans in the business, Morningstar found that the Nevada plan fits the bill, which has more than $11 billion under management. But as I said before, you can choose a plan from any state.When choosing a plan, also consider if your state offers special incentives such as tax breaks or scholarships. That could tip the decision towards your home state, but do the math to see if those benefits add up. If you pick the right plan, it should provide a means of saving for college while taking a lower-risk approach as your child approaches college age. The earlier you start, the more you can save.", "external_links": ["https://investor.vanguard.com/529-plan/vanguard-529-plan", "http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=718259", "http://www.collegesavingsmd.org/college-investment-plan-overview.aspx", "http://www.morningstar.com/articles/author/1524-john-f-wasik.aspx", "http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/asp/subject.aspx?xmlfile=174.xml&filter=PR5513", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015NLA8BQ", "http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Products-&-Services/College-Savings-Plans/T.-Rowe-Price-College-Savings-Plan", "https://www.uesp.org/"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:07:58.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
