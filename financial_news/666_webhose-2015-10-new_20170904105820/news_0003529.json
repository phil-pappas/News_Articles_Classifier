But BHP says mine closures aren't the answer. Peter Braig Share on twitter by James Chessell A senior BHP Billiton executive has played down the impact of production cuts by miners such as Glencore, arguing that commodity prices will not be affected because most of the mines being shutdown are unprofitable.\nAsked if prices of key commodities such as copper would benefit from higher-cost \"marginal\" producers cutting back production, BHP marketing president Arnoud Balhuizen said it would not make a significant difference.\n\"I am quite intrigued by all the conversation about cutting down production because I haven't seen any production being shut which is making cash,\" Mr Balhuizen told journalists in London on Wednesday.\n\"So for me it is just a normal rational economic decision. If you have a cash negative operation you shut it but it doesn't do anything for price. You should have done it anyway.\"\nThe price of iron ore isn't expected to rebound anytime soon. Mr Balhuizen did not explicitly mention any rivals but it seems clear he was referring to Swiss miner and trading house Glencore, which has reduced production of three of its key commodities in recent months in a bid to stabilise prices battered by weaker Chinese demand.\nGlencore announced this week it would suspend operations at one Australian mine and reduce output at another two as part of broader plans to cut global zinc production by 30 per cent or 100,000 tonnes. Last month, Glencore said it would suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper production at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The copper price responded by jumping more than 5 per cent although the rally was temporary. And in November and again in February, the London-listed group announced cuts at its Newcastle coal operations to avoid pumping tonnes into a heavily over supplied market at depressed prices. Company executives claim the decision has helped stabilise prices. Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg last week effectively conceded many of these operations were not making money. \"If you're not making money I believe you should take production out and reduce supply,\" he said. \"Don't create oversupply in the market for no reason.\"\nHowever, he has argued that temporary mine closures and cutbacks \"should have an affect on the price\".\n Mr Balhuizen said that shutting down unprofitable production does not affect overall prices because \"it doesn't do anything to the cost curve that sets the price\".\nHe said BHP's view was that if a mine did not generate positive cashflows, it had \"not earned the right\" to operate. BHP's mines are generally low-cost operations which allows the Melbourne-based company to operate profitably for longer than most of its competitors during a commodities downturn.\nMr Balhuizen also took a swipe at some companies such as Glencore that have blamed hedge funds for volatility in commodity prices.\nMr Glansenberg has argued the fundamentals of supply and demand are positive for commodities such as zinc and copper but blame speculative hedge funds for artificially pushing down the prices.\n\"Can a copper market or an oil market be disturbed for one or two weeks because people are [speculating]? - absolutely\", Mr Balhuizen said. \"But that's happened for the past 25 years and some people complaining about it now have probably been players in that game.\n\"So let's be realistic about this. Ultimately it will come back to fundamentals. Am I overly concerned about financial players in the market? The answer is no.\"\nMr Balhuizen said China's \"transformation\" to a developed economy would result in a relatively orderly slowdown in the country's economic growth rates over 15 years. He remained positive about the outlook for copper but warned a rebound in iron ore prices was unlikely this year.\n\"By the end of this year, there will be additional iron ore coming from Australia, from Brazil,\" he said.\n\"Our expectation is that the iron ore market cost curve will continue to flatten and continue to come under pressure.\"\nAdditional supply from the likes of BHP and Rio Tinto as well as falling Chinese steel demand have led to iron ore prices of $US60 a tonne compared with a high of nearly $US200 a tonne in 2011.\n\"Our belief [is] China will transition from a very heavy industry/infrastructure-led economy to a much more consumer driven economy and this transition will take time and will be volatile,\" he said.\n\"What's important for us is, are our commodities flowing? Are our products flowing? Are our customers paying? Are our customers honouring their contracts? And in all our commodities we have continued to see over the last couple of months, our commodities are flowing.\"\n\"So while prices are lower in a lot of the commodities, it hasn't stopped business. And in some business we have seen increased flows going into some markets.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/glencore-shuts-down-coal-mines-for-three-weeks-20141113-11mhp2.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:04:15.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
