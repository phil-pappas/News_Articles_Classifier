We regard this matter seriously and will be laying a complaint with the police,\" he said. \n\"The postie concerned worked for New Zealand Post for a matter of weeks and has since been dismissed.\" \nThe recovered mail has now been sent to its owners with a letter explaining the delay. \nMr Lewis said customers that had received any bills due to delayed mail should explain the circumstances using the letter. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:40:01.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
