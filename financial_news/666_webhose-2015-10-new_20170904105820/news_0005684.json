Some analysts have thought it unlikely central bankers would start lifting the benchmark short-term rate from near zero—a major move after holding it there for nearly seven years—at the October meeting, because Yellen doesn’t have a news conference scheduled that day, at which she could explain the action in great detail.\nBut the Fed has said it could schedule an impromptu news conference any time it likes, and Mr. Williams’s comments echo her statements that policy makers could act at any meeting.\nWilliams’s views are closely monitored as he is seen as a centrist on the Fed’s policy-making committee.\nAn extended version of this story can be found at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/janet-yellen-ally-sees-possible-fed-interest-rate-move-soon-1443754863"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:54:25.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
