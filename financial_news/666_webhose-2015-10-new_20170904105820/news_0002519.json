McDonald ‘for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.’”At first glance, to the untrained eye, the citation seems to make some sort of sense. The gentlemen discovered something—neutrino oscillations—that helped us pin down a fact—the mass of neutrinos.\nBut why do we need to know the mass of neutrinos? What are neutrino oscillations? How did the discovery of the latter lead to the realization of the former? And how does all this change our understanding of our universe, our world and ourselves? Not to forget that much more fundamental question: What is a neutrino in the first place?\nAnswering these questions requires engagement with scientific concepts that are not only very new but also complex. The neutrino was first postulated, in purely theoretical terms, in 1930. The existence of this subatomic particle was proven in 1956.\nIt was in 1998 and then in 2001 that teams led by Kajita and then McDonald, respectively, made the discovery that neutrinos “switch identities”. This is the discovery that would later win them the Nobel.\nEngaging with these ideas is not instinctive or intuitive for most lay readers even if they have undergone an extensive school education in science. To understand why, let us look at the citations for the Nobel Physics Prize from a century ago.\nIn 1904, Lord Rayleigh won the prize “for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies”.\nIn 1903, Antoine Henri Becquerel won the prize “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity”.\nAnd the citation for the prize shared by Guglielmo Marconi in 1909: “in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy”.\nEven if most readers don’t understand the scientific minutiae of these discoveries, we instantly recognize the broad concepts behind them and their relevance to the past, present and future of humanity.\nWhy is this so? Much of this is down to our school textbooks. As British physicist and professor Jonathan Butterworth, a collaborator on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), mentions in his very enjoyable book Smashing Physics , many people still have an outdated sense of the atom and its constituents that have been embedded in them by school textbooks. Textbooks can change far more slowly than the science they talk about. And because most of us have little incentive to update our scientific knowledge after school, these ideas remain embedded in our minds. The latest CBSE textbook for class XII physics has four brief references to neutrino. Nothing that remotely suggests that neutrino mass is poised to become a major disruptor to how physics is understood to work.\nAlso, modern scientific discoveries can be a little hard to visualize. Some years ago, I spent a pleasant afternoon at the visitor centre in CERN, home of the LHC, in Switzerland. I went through all the exhibits and read all the plaques and viewed all the videos. And still felt that I was no closer to understanding what was happening under my feet in that massive LHC doughnut.\nBridging our knowledge gap, however, is not difficult. A good book to start with is Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction by the renowned physics professor Frank Close. A slim volume, it is an invigorating introduction to this area of modern science. The book desperately needs a post-Higgs boson update. But it is an ideal stepping stone to a more detailed book. Such as Manjit Kumar’s critically acclaimed Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, And The Great Debate About The Nature Of Reality . Quantum weaves together the story of the science and scientists behind some of the foundations of modern physics.\nIn the spirit of this year’s Nobel, we could pick up a book recommended by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Neutrino Hunters: The Thrilling Chase For A Ghostly Particle To Unlock The Secrets Of The Universe by R. Jayawardhana. He makes a sound, readable case for why the neutrino, and perhaps not the Higgs boson, is the particle that could unlock many secrets in the years ahead.\nButterworth’s Smashing Physics is an amusing look at not just the science but also the politics and people involved in realizing and running a multi-billion-dollar experiment such as the LHC. Skip all the science that can sometimes confuse, and the book is still great fun.\nFinally, read The Chameleons Of Space , an excellent six-page “popular science background” to this year’s prize published online by the Swedish Academy. That should make you the resident “intellectual” for many a forthcoming office party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:27:17.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
