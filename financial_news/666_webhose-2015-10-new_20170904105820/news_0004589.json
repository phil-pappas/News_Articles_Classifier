START SPENDING POCKET MONEY\n“Make the children responsible for some purchases themselves, so they learn how to spend as well as how to save ,” Churcher says. “A child that saves 100 per cent of their pocket money isn’t really learning anything.”\nWeekends and school holidays can be a good time to earn some extra pocket money, and then learn how to budget and spend it on a holiday or excursion.\nMONEYSAVERHQ&apos;S GUIDE TO SAVING MONEY\nPocket money should be paid by direct debit rather than cash from age 11.

Write a list of things the child is responsible for buying, and put a percentage aside for a savings goal,” Churcher says.\n“Don’t make the goals too big — make it easy for the child to feel a sense of achievement when they reach it. Children have short attention spans.”\n3. THINK BEYOND SAVINGS\nAshenden suggests using money to help children think about others. “Get your kids thinking about how money can make social change and how they may want to contribute to a cause or interest.”\nA mini fundraiser among family and friends might be a valuable holiday activity, with the proceeds to go to a charity that the children research.\n4. PAY THEM ELECTRONICALLY\nWe’re quickly heading to a cashless society, so it’s wise to get children used to it.\n“The challenge we have is that money in the online world is not real to us,” Churcher says. She says pocket money should be paid by direct debit from about age 11.\n How to teach kids about money", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d40dd8680022bac1135acce0c1a9f4ba", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/1e9ebbf6b73e555e40f8cc7b3ea596ec?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FRuazl0dzpr01PPECjbxq_PTMQJhYhJV4%2Fpromo267758309&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=teach-kids-about-money", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5bffe943a4716993c3826cd39de674ad", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/guide/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=teach-kids-money"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:48:29.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
