IMF Chief Christine Lagarde on Thursday repeated her plea to Fed Chair Janet Yellen to stay her hand. \nThe Bank of England left borrowing costs at a record low 0.5 percent this week, saying the outlook for British inflation in coming months looked weaker than it previously thought. Official figures on Tuesday will likely say it remained at zero last month. \nOther central banks meeting next week include those of Peru, Chile, Indonesia, and South Korea but no policy change is expected from any of them. \nIt had been hoped emerging countries would be the driver behind the global recovery but many of those economies are now in turmoil and Lagarde told policymakers gathered in Peru for the IMF's annual meeting the world was stuck in a \"new mediocre\" growth pattern. \nRate setters have little room for error in a low-growth world in which over-leveraged and commodity-dependent emerging economies and a slowing China are major risks, top international financiers said at the IMF meeting on Thursday. \n(Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:08:10.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
