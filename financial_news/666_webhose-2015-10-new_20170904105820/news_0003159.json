NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The S&P 500 index had its worst quarterly performance in four years as a result of August's market selloff, slumping 6.9% for the three-months ending Sept. 30, despite Wednesday's market rally. The index is down 6.7% for the year, fueled by the extreme market volatility seen in August over fears of slowing growth in China. \"U.S. stocks fell into correction territory in the [third quarter], but we believe this had more to do about fear and overreaction to the same old Emerging Market, commodity and Fed worries as opposed to any real deterioration in U.S. stock fundamentals, which we believe remain in good shape,\" BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in an Oct. 1 note. BMO Capital Markets is a division of Bank of Montreal . \n\"Our secular bull market call for U.S. stocks remains intact as bear market ingredients are not present. Corrections tend to occur in August, September and October and this one was long overdue,\" the note said. The macro economy is expected to \"hum along at the current pace of 3% or better\" in the fourth quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase analysts, \"largely to high consumer confidence and low price of oil and other commodities.\" \nWith oil prices down by 50% from a year earlier, it shouldn't come as any surprise that energy stocks dominated a list of worst-performing stocks in the third quarter. More Headlines The 10 Best Industrials Stocks in the Third Quarter \nHere are the 10 worst-performing stocks for the quarter, paired with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy or sell these stocks, despite their dour performance in the third quarter. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nMarket Cap: $39.6 billion Third-Quarter Return: -40.7% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates MYLAN NV as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate MYLAN NV (MYL) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, reasonable valuation levels, compelling growth in net income, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 6.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 29.1%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displaying stagnant earnings per share. The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Pharmaceuticals industry. The net income increased by 34.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $125.20 million to $167.80 million. MYLAN NV reported flat earnings per share in the most recent quarter. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, MYLAN NV increased its bottom line by earning $2.34 versus $1.58 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.22 versus $2.34). The gross profit margin for MYLAN NV is rather high; currently it is at 54.81%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 7.07% trails the industry average.
