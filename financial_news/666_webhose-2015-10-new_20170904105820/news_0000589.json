But their withdrawal from the $12.9 trillion market is less severe than would be indicated by their balance-sheet declines, or by their volumes on central platforms like ICAP Plc’s BrokerTec and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s eSpeed.\nRather than slashing their Treasury dealing businesses, banks are keeping more of it within their own walls, according to interest-rate executives at banks, high-speed trading firms and trading platforms. They’re matching client orders with transactions from other customers and with their own internal desks that use Treasuries to hedge -- a process that’s making an already opaque market even less transparent.\nDespite the global financial crisis and the slew of new regulations that followed, dealers have been able to maintain their grip on most of the Treasury bond market. Rate-trading revenue at the 10 biggest banks climbed in the first half of the year, according to data from financial research firm Coalition Ltd. That marks a contrast with the proceeds from their corporate bond businesses, which continued to drop.\nInternalization Trend One reason is that nearly all money managers only trade Treasuries through Wall Street dealers. Of 103 investors interviewed by Greenwich Associates in a report released Tuesday, only nine said they trade with any firms besides Wall Street banks. Greenwich didn’t specify what volume of trading was being done through non-bank firms.\nIn fact, the ability of Wall Street biggest banks to attract a high volume of interest-rate trading has become a boon. More client business allows them to keep a greater number of trades behind closed doors -- a trend Greenwich Associates called \"internalization.\"\n\"Large global banks that have tremendous scale are increasingly internalizing, and becoming liquidity takers instead of liquidity providers,\" said Anthony Perrotta, a partner at financial research firm Tabb Group LLC.\nCitigroup, JPMorgan\nCitigroup Inc., for one, has made a multi-year push to bring more of its Treasuries trading in-house, according to a person familiar with its moves. Another person with knowledge of the bank’s operations said that Citigroup was doing at least half of its volume internally by the end of last year.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is another firm that’s brought more of its trading in-house, according to a person familiar with the bank’s effort.\nPress officials at both banks declined to comment on the matter.\nPrimary dealers’ trading on interdealer platforms last year was down 7.1 percent from a decade before, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But their total trading volume was up 1.5 percent.\nThe shift in trading means more of the action in the market is happening without accessible data detailing which Treasury securities are trading, and at what price. It also means the data that five government agencies spent months collecting in an effort to figure out what happened on Oct. 15, 2014 -- when Treasuries suddenly went haywire in the bond market’s version of the “flash crash” -- was missing part of the picture. They were only able to obtain records from the interdealer platforms like BrokerTec and eSpeed, and missed the roughly $300 billion that is traded elsewhere each day, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s own measure.\n‘Stunning Opacity’ \"The level of opacity that still exists in the market for the debt issued by the largest economy in the world is stunning,\" Greenwich Associates analyst Kevin McPartland wrote in Tuesday’s report.\nOne place dealers are stepping back is in the primary market, where the U.S. government conducts debt auctions. Dealers have taken down a record low 36 percent of issuance from the Treasury this year through September, compared with 42 percent a year earlier, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAt least one firm is challenging the dealers’ hold. Citadel Securities LLC has begun trading one-on-one with investors, and is \"going head-to-head with traditional dealers,” according to Greenwich Associates. There are also at least seven electronic Treasury-trading platforms in the works, according to the report, though most haven’t yet started up.\nEven so, no one expects the dealers to give up much market share any time soon.\n\"To the extent that you can maintain some anonymity for clients, it makes sense\" for banks to keep trades in-house, said Jeff Harte, an analyst covering large banks with Chicago-based Sandler O’Neill. \"The ability to match trades internally saves you cost and helps you maintain a relationship.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf\\", "http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/gsds/search.html#\\"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:05:18.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
