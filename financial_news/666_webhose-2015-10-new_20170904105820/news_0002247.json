According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly a quarter of U.S. workers with employer health benefits are now enrolled in high-deductible plans. FSFE expects this trend to continue over the next decade. \"The shift to high deductible health plans is happening and won't slow down any time soon,\" predicts Travis Freeman, the president of FSFE. \"Employees at our client companies are often confused about how to use their HSA and benefits brokers are under pressure to provide more HSA education,\" says Freeman. \"Now we have a solution that helps everyone.\"\nThe new education program is part of the full lineup of topics within FSFE's financial wellness programs. The HSA program in particular focuses on how HSAs can be used as a company perk, including potential tax benefits and retirement strategies. This new program is meant to be used during conversions to high-deductible health plans, but can be used at anytime after an employees is enrolled. Benefits brokers or employers interested in such a program can contact FSFE via their website, http://www.FSFE.com , for further details.\nAbout Four Seasons Financial Education\nFour Seasons Financial Education provides workplace financial wellness and education services to companies throughout the US to help them improve their bottom line.
