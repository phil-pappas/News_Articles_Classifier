Every startup is a small business by definition and needs capital to get going. When founding Measurabl and raising capital, I was surprised by the bias against companies not from Silicon Valley.\nIn San Francisco, there is an ecosystem that allows entrepreneurs to start a company on Monday, get funding on Friday and either succeed or fail in rapid succession.\nIt’s crazy what the SF ‘shine’ will do for a company. Competing with them for cash, engineers and press—the lifeblood of startups—is extremely hard for startups outside this environment.\nThe problem is, Silicon Valley is one small pinpoint on the globe, but innovation and fantastic entrepreneurs are all around the world.\nFor small businesses to succeed, and startups in particular, we need to build the ecosystem of venture capital, angel investors, university and municipal incubators in other parts of the world. Being in San Diego, Ohio or Paris shouldn’t put innovation and entrepreneurship at a disadvantage.\nWe’ve played for scale more than for revenues, and that’s left us reliant on venture capital far more than we [would] have been had I followed a more traditional approach to company-building.\nThe venture model is so alluring it can be difficult to remember it’s OK to just build a normal, cash-flow positive business from the early days.”\n—Barbara Haislip", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:07:42.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
