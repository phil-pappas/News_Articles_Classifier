These are our legitimate concerns that we want all of you to think of if we want maximum impact. We want transparency in the fair utilization of the oil revenue for all the projects in the country especially the western region. When oil was first found in commercial quantities in the western region, we thought it was going to create jobs, contribute to the rise of industries and promote economic growth and standards of living. What we have seen so far is the opposite and concerns are rising”, he said. \n“People all over the country are migrating here, thereby increasing the population, cost of living are rising and the locals are beginning to question if the revenue gained so far from oil is helping to transform the region? You now see the wisdom from the 10% Nananom \nrequested from the oil revenue to develop the region. The essence of the ten percent is to help us remedy the situation” he added. \nThe Chiefs first made this request and several other proposals on Wednesday November 17, in Parliament as their inputs into the Petroleum Production and Petroleum Revenue Management Bills at the time . \nAmong other things, the Chiefs, led by Awulae Attibrukusu III, were also concerned about the membership of committees that will be managing the oil proceeds and other activities. \nAwulae Attibrukusu III, who is also the President of the Western Regional House of Chiefs, said although the Western Region contributes a huge chunk of the country’s resources, it is yet to enjoy a fair share of the national cake, hence the need for Government to dedicate ten percent of the oil revenue for the Region’s infrastructural development \nAccording to him, the ten percent would make up for the unfair treatment meted out to the Region in the past in terms of development. \n“We are ten Regions so even if we are dividing it Region by Region, its ten percent to each Region but we want exclusively that because of the neglect we have been subjected to by various Governments to be exclusively for the development of the Western Region.” \nAwulae Attibrukusu III said that “if the request is approved, the monies will be managed by indigenes of the Region once it is put in the Consolidated Fund”. \nGhana discovered oil in commercial quantities in 2007 in the Cape Three Points area off the coast of Western Region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:07:57.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
