In the wake of the emission scandal, Volkswagen’s board has decided to take several steps to reposition the company. Volkswagen will reduce its investment by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) per year and accelerate its efficiency program. The company will also change its diesel strategy and use only diesel drives with SCR and AdBlue technology in Europe and North America. Further, Volkswagen will develop an MEB electric toolkit for use in the compact segment vehicles and redefine the Phaeton to make it a pure electric car.\n2. Tesla released the Version 7.0 software in North America, thus adding several autopilot features to the Model S vehicles fitted with necessary hardware. This will allow the vehicle to steer within a lane; change lanes by tapping a turn signal; manage speed by using traffic-aware cruise control; and digitally control motors, brakes, and steering to avoid collision from the front and sides. Additionally, the software will prevent the car from drifting off the road. The vehicle will also be able to scan for a parking space and parallel park on command.\n3. Unfazed by the recent weakness in the Chinese market, Ford is planning to augment its investment in the nation to secure a higher market share. The company will invest nearly 11.4 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) for research and development in China over the next five years. Ford will also expand its portfolio of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in the nation over the next few years. Next year, it will launch the C-MAX Energi, a plug-in hybrid, and the Mondeo conventional hybrid in China (read more: Ford to Increase Investment in China to Gain Market Share).\n4. By 2050, Toyota plans to reduce average emission from its vehicles by 90% from the 2010 level. The automaker is targeting annual sales of 30,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2020. Further, Toyota expects most of its vehicles to be electric cars, fuel cell-powered cars and other alternative vehicles by 2050.\n5. Honda announced that it has replaced over 3.5 million defective Takata inflators as of Oct 5.
