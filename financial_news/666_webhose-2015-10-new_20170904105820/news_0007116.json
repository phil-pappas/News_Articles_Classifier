However, no financial details of the transaction were given. The deal could be announced in the coming days.\n\nHypermarcas has hired Citigroup , Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Banco Bradesco to find alternatives for its diaper unit. The Sao Paulo-based company is looking to exit the diaper market due to a lack of scale, brand recognition and the increasing cost of imported material for the product amid a decline in Brazil's currency, Reuters added.\nKimberly Clark is an Irving, TX-based manufacturer and marketer of products made from natural or synthetic fibers. The company operates in three segments including Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP (KMB) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its notable return on equity, expanding profit margins and solid stock price performance. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including generally higher debt management risk, weak operating cash flow and feeble growth in the company's earnings per share.\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Household Products industry and the overall market, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. 39.93% is the gross profit margin for KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 10.95% is above that of the industry average. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 10.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 6.7%. The declining revenue appears to have seeped down to the company's bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $849.00 million or 13.01% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite a decrease in cash flow of 13.01%, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP is in line with the industry average cash flow growth rate of -13.33%. The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 140.46 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Along with this, the company manages to maintain a quick ratio of 0.47, which clearly demonstrates the inability to cover short-term cash needs.
