Sea ice abrupt changes were particularly common in the climate simulations.\nHowever, various models also predict abrupt changes in Earth system elements such as the Amazon forest, tundra permafrost and snow on the Tibetan plateau.\n“Interestingly, abrupt events could come out as a cascade of different phenomena,” said Victor Brovkin, a co-author from Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M).\n“For example, a collapse of permafrost in Arctic is followed by a rapid increase in forest area there. This kind of domino effect should have implications not only for natural systems, but also for society,” said Brovkin.\n“The majority of the detected abrupt shifts are distant from the major population centres of the planet, but their occurrence could have implications over large distances,” said Martin Claussen, director of the MPI-M and one of the co-authors.\n“Our work is only a starting point. Now we need to look deeper into mechanisms of tipping points and design an approach to diagnose them during the next round of climate model simulations for IPCC,” Claussen said.\nThe study was published in the journal PNAS.\nFirst Published on October 17, 2015 8:52 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:14:53.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
