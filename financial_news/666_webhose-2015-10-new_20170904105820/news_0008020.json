Star Wars is back.\nPT1M47S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Tickets for Star Wars: The Force Awakens will go on sale Monday in the US, two months before the movie hits theatres.\nSales will start after a new trailer for the seventh instalment of the Star Wars saga airs during the Monday Night Football broadcast on ESPN, Walt Disney said in an e-mailed statement Sunday. The movie is set to open in the US and Canada on December 18.\nThe Force Awakens is the first in the series since Disney acquired franchise-owner Lucasfilm for $US4 billion in 2012. The film is expected to be one of the top-grossing pictures of the year, if not all time.\nStar Wars has released it's new look.\n\"Fans have been super excited ever since the first Force Awakens teaser trailer dropped,\" said Dave Karger, chief correspondent at the online ticket seller site Fandango.\nAdvertisement \"It's been over 10 years since a 'Star Wars' movie was introduced in theaters.\"\nMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said in June that the movie could be the third highest-grossing film in history. He estimated The Force Awakens will take in $US1.95 billion in ticket sales worldwide. That would place it behind Avatar at $US2.8 billion and Titanic at $US2.2 billion, according to data from Boxofficemojo.com.\nSelling tickets two months before a film's debut is a strategy Hollywood has deployed in the past for its most highly-anticipated releases.\nThe Force Awakens , directed by J.J. Abrams, has revealed itself in two earlier trailers to be very much an homage to the 1977 original, even to the point of including most of its cast.\nDisney has been seeding the market for a new generation of fans, showing Star Wars Rebels , a cartoon on its Disney XD network, and releasing toys globally last month in a promotion it dubbed 'Force Friday.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:28:11.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
