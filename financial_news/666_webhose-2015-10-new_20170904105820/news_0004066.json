Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , TV set-top boxes are becoming smarter. \nEver got that feeling you were being followed on the internet ? Click a dress on a shopping website, and the same one will pop up as you browse Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) . Look up flights to Berlin, and flight prices will tempt you while you read the news. \nThese aren’t coincidences they are the bedrock of digital advertising . Websites can anonymously profile you via your browser digital tags known as “cookies” track what you search for, buy, fill into forms and sell that information to advertisers who want to target people exactly like you. So pet food will only pop up for pet owners and nappies for expectant/new mothers. \nWhile this sort of razor-sharp targeting is taken for granted on the web, TV advertising still lives in the relative Middle Ages. Most television channels can only target an audience based on guesswork how old they are or what gender, based on the type of program they are broadcasting. So, a sitcom like Girls or the Mindy Project would have advertisements roughly targeted at women in their twenties and thirties. \nBut when direct competitors like Facebook video or YouTube can drill down to the level of your eating habits or how much you spend on cleaning products, the vagaries of television advertising are simply not going to cut it for big brands. \nAnd now, as advertisers have started funnelling spending increasingly towards the web, the TV industry is fighting back by getting to know you better. \nThe threat is not just looming, it’s already bearing down on the television industry. In August, several media companies including Disney, 21st Century Fox, Viacom (NasdaqGS: VIAB - news ) and CBS, all reported being hit by a sharp decline in revenue. \nAccording to Forrester Research (NasdaqGS: FORR - news ) , advertising on cable and broadcast television is expected to crawl up at 1 pc annually. Others paint a bleaker picture. According to Magna Global, television ad revenue in the US is estimated to drop 3.5 pc to $63.3 billion this year. \nMeanwhile the analysts are predicting that digital ad revenue will grow at 17 percent a year. Advertisers will spend more on digital advertising than on TV advertising by 2017, Magna Global said. \nIn particular, there’s been a surge in digital video advertising on YouTube, Facebook and streaming services like Hulu. In the past week, Facebook last week introduced a new feature in partnership with Nielsen (Frankfurt: NSLF.F - news ) that dances dangerously close to TV territory by letting marketers buy online video ads similar to how they purchase commercials on TV. \nThose online video ads are only a tenth of the television ad market of $70 billion a year, but they are projected to grow 21 pc a year, according to Forrester Research. \nThe reason for this increase is that the way we watch TV is now platform agnostic and for many internet-first. Whether it’s Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) , YouTube or other on-demand TV, these services bypass the traditional set-top boxes and instead run via the internet, leveraging all the personal data that comes as a bonus. \nBut here’s the good news if you work in TV: digital set top boxes put TV on a somewhat-level playing field. \nSky Media became the first in the UK to attempt targeted ads via data from its set-top box in early 2014. The platform lets brands target specific households, based on their post code and 90 unique attributes (like whether the household consists of just adults, or if there are children, and a rough income level) from third-party data brokers such as Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) who sell this sort of personalised information. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) also has custom segments for more precise targeting, including attributes like pet ownership, profession and number of cars in a household that can be bought from data brokers. \nSimilarly, NBCUniversal rolled out its program in the US this year, where it uses cable set-top box data, along with credit card data, car data and other sources, to tell advertisers which network, and even which program on that network, is more likely to include their target audience. \nNBC is giving advertisers “very targeted and unique capabilities that are much more like what advertisers get when they go to Facebook”, according to the company’s chief executive, Stephen B. Burke. \nWith advanced data-mining technology, the potential for tailoring ads can be quite sophisticated. So, for example, you and your neighbour could both be watching “Downton Abbey,” and see different ads. If you’re an environmentally conscious consumer with no kids, you could be shown an electric car. Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) door, the couple with young kids might be shown a people carrier advert. \nSome US networks were even able to target people based on their public voting record as political parties attempted to sway swing voters during election seasons. \nAnd apparently it’s working. Sky claimed an ad for a music album, shown only to houses with kids aged 5 to 11, meant parents were twice as likely to discuss buying the album with their children. \nThe next step is to get more granular, become more intimate with your life so the ads actually apply to you , rather than just what your home or neighbourhood say about you. \nSo for instance a supermarket like Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) with a loyalty-card database could cross-reference that data with a TV network’s data on you (address and phone number, say) and promote foods similar to what you already purchase. Been trying to be healthier by buying fruit recently? Well, here’s an advert for low-fat yoghurts. \nCompanies like Massachusetts-based Clypd are working on automated tools that can swap in the right ad with minimal human intervention similar to programmatic ads being bought and sold on the web in milliseconds, like a digital stock market. \nThe firehose behind this entire industry are data brokers, including Acxiom, Experian and Dunnhumby, and just as they fuel all the personalised data on the Internet, they are also suppliers to the emerging industry of digital TV advertising. \nAcxiom, for example, has an average of 1500 points of demographic, shopping and lifestyle information on every American household. Similarly Experian the credit-rating agency has data on most UK households. For them, television is a whole new world in which to trade data points. \nThe business model behind television won’t survive if it doesn’t play the game and the currency is your data. Sky’s targeting software, for instance, makes use of numerous data sets, which will give advertisers an incredibly granular view of your life. Both Sky and the advertisers win big. Ultimately, you are the product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:47:03.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
