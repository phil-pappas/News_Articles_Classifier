But Nestle faces specific problems in Asia's largest markets, China and India. \nIn India a recall of its Maggi noodles is hampering sales, while in China, Nestle's second-biggest market after the United States, the group conceded its product plans had yet to bear fruit. \n\"There are things that we need to do better (in China), even if you set aside the macroeconomic situation,\" said Wan Ling Martello, recently named head of the AOA having previously been chief financial officer. \"We are a little behind in terms of innovation.\" \nAs an example of its planned product innovations, Martello said Nestle was repositioning Yinlu peanut milk for a relaunch in the first quarter of 2016, having last February discussed updating the brand to satisfy consumers who want fewer additives and alternative ingredients. \nDRAMATIC IMPACT \nIn India, Nestle is suffering in the aftermath of a recall of its Maggi noodles, a package of which was found to contain an excessive amount of lead. CEO Paul Bulcke said this had had a dramatic impact. \"We had no Maggi noodles on the shelves for five, six months now,\" he said. \nThe recall contributed 30 of the basis points in the Swiss food group's headline 2.1 percent sales drop in the nine months through September. At 64.9 billion Swiss francs ($68 billion), nine-month sales missed analysts' average 65.9 billion forecast. \nNestle's Indian unit said a court-mandated test on the noodles found them to be safe with the levels of lead present well below permissible limits. [ID: nL3N12G2Y3] \nNestle's underlying sales growth, adjusted for currency swings, acquisitions and divestitures, slowed to 4.2 percent in the first nine months, sliding further behind its earlier 5 percent target for 2015. \nThat implies third-quarter growth around 3.5 percent, said Jefferies analysts, down from 4.5 percent in the first half. \nThe results came a day after rival Unilever (LSE: 0NXN.L - news ) posted third-quarter underlying sales up 5.7 percent. Excluding one-time items, such as last year's squeeze on earnings in China, Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) said sales growth would have been in the 3.5 to 4 percent range.
