Photo: Wolter Peeters\nNews that the recently formed Fels Wage Fairness Panel has paid out $1.1 million to 50 7-Eleven victims of wage fraud ratchets up the debate on the myriad of \"independent\" corporate compensation schemes recently set up for wrongdoing.\nThe various schemes include Commonwealth Bank's Open Advice Review Program , Macquarie's compensation scheme and more lately National Australia Bank's financial advice scheme, which was set up in the wake of a Fairfax Media investigation earlier this year .\nAll have had varying degrees of success, and all have varying degrees of imperfections.\nBased on the current payout, the final wages fraud bill could reach $300 million. Photo: Arsineh Houspian\nIn the case of 7-Eleven, its compensation scheme was set up in September in response to a joint Four Corners and Fairfax Media investigation which exposed systemic wage abuse and falsification of payroll records across the 620 7-Eleven stores.\nAdvertisement The decision to appoint former ACCC chairman Allan Fels , who was a strident critic of 7-Eleven's business model, immediately gave the panel credibility. Fels agreed to take the post after declaring the only way 7-Eleven franchisees could make money was ripping off their workers.\nIt was a smart move on 7-Eleven's part given the outpouring of contempt for the brand since the story broke. It echoes Coles' appointment of Jeff Kennett to oversee a refund of more than $12 million to suppliers. (Kennett reported Coles to the ACCC over false \"baked fresh\" bread claims two years ago.)\nIllustration: Kerrie Leishman.\nLike Kennett, Fels has a big reputation that he has built up over the years. To join the panel, known as the Fels Wage Fairness Panel, 7-Eleven agreed to have no staff involvement in the panel, or the panel's assessments. In addition, all panel assessments could not be contested by head office.\nThe panel has received 400 applications from exploited workers and has assessed a quarter of them. Head office has given access to all payroll records and a number of other documents, enabling the panel to write to 15,000 former and current staff inviting them to apply for compensation.\nBased on the current payout, the final wages fraud bill could reach $300 million.\nOnce paid, 7-Eleven head office will use its discretion about which franchisees to chase for repayment. The franchisees that generated small amounts of gross profit will likely be left alone but those who earned enough money to pay proper wages, will ultimately pay the piper.\nCBA's scheme was launched in July 2014 in response to calls for a royal commission into the bank's scandal-ridden financial planning arm. Fifteen months later it has paid 19 victims a total of $488,815, or an average $21,376 each.\nUnlike the Coles or 7-Eleven compensation panel, the CBA scheme is faceless. Given many CBA victims lost their life savings, the number and size of the payout is alarmingly low. The success rate of claims also raises questions about the process, the KPIs of the assessors and the complex layers that victims have to wade through to get a result.\nNot surprisingly, CBA has become the butt of many jokes relating to the glacial speed of its so-called \"independent\" compensation scheme. But to CBA whistleblower Jeff Morris, who exposed wrongdoing inside CBA's financial planning arm, it is little surprise.\n\"CBA was at pains to exclude people like me, who know where the bodies are buried,\" he said.\nBesides not having an individual who has put their reputation on the line, it seems the biggest problems are CBA does the initial assessments of victims and those victims are not free to select their own advocates to represent them but are forced to use three law firms selected and remunerated by CBA.\nSenator John Williams who triggered a senate inquiry into the bank, said CBA should have listened to him when he advised it to get Morris to be part of the compensation scheme process. Perhaps things might have been different.\nMacquarie's compensation scheme, set up as part of an enforceable undertaking, has had similar low ball results, with a small number of victims paid compensation. It has attracted much criticism due to its lack of transparency. Like CBA, it also lacks a high profile person to put their reputation on the line to ensure the panel is doing its job.\nEarlier this week the corporate regulator issued a press release \"National Australia Bank to implement a large scale Financial Advice Remediation program\". It said NAB would contact customers who may have received inappropriate advice.\nIt said NAB would provide affected customers with financial assistance to seek professional independent advice, where appropriate, and the panel would face independent scrutiny which would report its findings to ASIC.\nSince February, when Fairfax Media exposed wrongdoing , NAB has paid out $1.7 million in payments to 87 customers who proactively contacted the bank to review their files.\nIn the past year or so a number of companies have been caught with their pants down and forced to right the wrongs by rolling out \"independent\" compo schemes. At first blush it seems 7-Eleven went on the front foot and is on the right track. It is early days but they are putting most of the other schemes to shame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:09:42.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
