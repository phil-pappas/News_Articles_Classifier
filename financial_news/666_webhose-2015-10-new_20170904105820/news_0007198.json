If elected, Clinton will be America’s first female president but has also been an advocate for woman around the world.\n“Hillary Clinton understood in her heart how important it was for girls to get an opportunity, but she also understood in her head that if we want to build peaceful, economically prosperous nations, then we have to educate girls,” Gillard said.\n“She was determined to see that women take their place as economic partners in their community, and take their place as political leaders in their community.”\nAccording to Guardian Australia , the Clinton camp is understood to have approached Gillard to be part of the video.\nGillard also praises Clinton’s approach building a new strategy in Asia when she was secretary of state.\n“It fell to secretary Clinton to build a new the relationship with Japan, with Australia, with South Korea,” Gillard said.\n“Through her engagement with so many leaders, but also the calibre of her intellect, she was a shaper of conversations and that’s going to be remembered for many, many long years to come as a diplomatic breakthrough for the US.”\nGillard concludes with a brief statement supporting the Democratic nominee: “People would look at the election of a president Clinton and say I know that I’m going to get someone who understands our part of the world and will help us shape the best future”.\nBut perhaps the most ringing endorsement comes from another woman, Madeline Albright, who says: “I don’t think I have ever met a person more prepared to be president and she would be capable of making hard decisions, and representing this country and our democracy”.\n\"I don't think I have ever met someone more prepared to be president.\" — @Madeleine Albright https://t.co/D6nCGEDC6v\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 19, 2015\nOriginally published as Gillard appears in Clinton video", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/madeleine", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCcLW33ZAmA", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/656199705169268736", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/julia-gillard-backs-hillary-clinton-us-presidential-campaign-video", "https://t.co/D6nCGEDC6v", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/julia-gillard-appears-in-video-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president/story-fn5tas5k-1227575462882"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:29:14.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
