More Equitable Life compensation deadline looms \nOther “highly suspicious” activity included funds being transferred from pension schemes to trustee personal bank accounts and third-party companies mostly connected to controlling parties. Savers were offered transfer incentives such as cash lump sums. \nHowever, the regulator said that the pension scheme members were not provided with adequate scheme documentation at the point of transfer and, once entered into a scheme, were unable easily to contact the administrator. \nFollowing a probe, the regulator suspected that a scam had taken place involving funds of about £13.7m belonging to 242 members which had all but “disappeared” — including through the payment of exorbitant fees and commission payments. Some £400,000 was recovered. \n“This complex case bears many of the hallmarks of a pension scam and should be seen as another reminder of why savers must remain vigilant against the threat of scams, which have a devastating impact on people’s lives,” said Andrew Warwick-Thompson, an executive director at the Pensions Regulator. \nPension scam losses treble month after Osborne launches reforms \nPension scam losses more than trebled in the month after George Osborne launched his landmark reforms giving over-55s the freedom to cash in their retirement pots, according to official figures, fuelling fears that more savers could be targeted by criminals. The leap comes after consumer groups and MPs warned that greater safeguards were needed to protect people from losing their life savings to swindlers after the biggest shake-up of the pensions industry in nearly a century came into force in April. \nRead more \n“Our appointment of an independent trustee has helped secure approximately £400,000 from the schemes, however for many hundreds members, hard-earned savings have most likely been lost.” \n“Our message is clear: if you’re cold-called or texted by people claiming they can help you to get early access to the cash in your pension or unusually high investment returns, stop, don’t be tempted, and put the phone down. You’re likely to lose all your money and may face a considerable tax charge.” \nIn details of the case published on Monday, three trustees were deemed by the regulator to have “misappropriated scheme funds and exercised poor trustee governance”. \nThe regulator disrupted the suspected scam by appointing an independent trustee to oversee 17 pension schemes involved in the case. \nWhen asked if any individuals were facing criminal action in relation to the case, the regulator said it could not comment on individuals or on the details of its investigations. \nThe case comes after the HMRC tightened its registration procedure in 2013 to prevent pension schemes being set up to facilitate scams. It has the power to deregister schemes that break the rules. \nThe Pensions Regulator said schemes cannot register without having their registration approved by HMRC.
