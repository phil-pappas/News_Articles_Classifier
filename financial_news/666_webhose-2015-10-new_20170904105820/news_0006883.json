Or it could mean carrying a big workload but having a very flexible schedule in which to get it done. \nThe results are based on employee ratings of work-life balance for the same position across at least 81 different employers. \nMany of the top 25 jobs on Glassdoor's list are in technology, recruiting, marketing or engineering. \nData scientists and search-engine optimization (SEO) managers came in as No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. They also happen to be in high-demand these days since companies of all stripes -- including brick-and-mortar retailers -- run online sites, said Glassdoor spokesman Scott Dobroski. \nThere is, however, no correlation between pay and work-life balance. Some positions on the list are 6-figure jobs, while others have salaries that rank low among 5-figure jobs. \nHere's the full list: \n1. Data scientist: $114,808 a year \n2.
