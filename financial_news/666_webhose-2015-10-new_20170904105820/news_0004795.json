Millions of dollars flowed into the pockets of companies all down the line, from the tax preparation software companies to the banks where the illegally gained money was deposited.”\nWillis predicts, “Big money means a big problem with little hope for any kind of solution in the near future. Brace yourself, taxpayers, for more tax fraud to come.”\nThe entire article can be read at: http://www.irsallstar.com/articles/alabama-deputy-tax-commissioner-victim-of-tax-fraud.php\nABOUT JOHN WILLIS\nMr. Willis believes strongly in supporting and representing the “underdog” and has devoted his entire professional life to protecting and defending those who need it most.
