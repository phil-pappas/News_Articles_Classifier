There's a lot of people in the market who will want to fade any euro strength up here and Nowotny's comments provide a good opportunity.\"\nBy 1135 GMT, the euro was down a third of a percent on the day at $1.1433, having risen as high as $1.1495, its strongest since Aug. 26.\nWhile the euro move gave the dollar some respite, there is a broad feeling that the strong dollar environment that has dominated the past 18 months is fading.\nStrategists from Dutch bank ABN Amro were the latest to close a pro-dollar recommendation that dates back to November 2013.\n\"It is likely that EUR/USD in the near-term will continue to move higher in wake of the pricing out of a possible Fed rate hike this year,\" ABN strategist Georgette Boele said.\n\"Moreover, the recovery in the US dollar we expect for the coming months is relatively modest.\"\nThe dollar index was last trading 0.2 percent stronger at 94.082, just above seven-week lows hit overnight.\nThe yen gained around half a percent to an eight-week high of 118.10 yen per dollar. The New Zealand dollar gained as much as 1.5 percent to a 3-1/2 month high of $0.6897.\n\"Generally the theme is still dollar weakness across the board, because the market is pricing out a rate hike this year,\" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency analyst with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \"I don't see anything that will change that in the next couple of weeks.\" (Editing by Andrew Roche )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:02:23.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
