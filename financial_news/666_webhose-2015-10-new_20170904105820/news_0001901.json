Credit Suisse Group AG ( CS - Get Report ) has them. The bank recently published a list containing contrarian views from its own analysts on a number of stocks. \n\"We screened our current U.S. coverage universe to identify companies where our analysts' views diverged from that of the Street, focusing on both rating as well as earnings projections,\" the note said. \nFor example, L-3 Communications ( LLL - Get Report ) is expected to outperform consensus because L-3 stock \"trades at a 30% discount on FCF [free cash flow] yield relative to its peers\" in the defense industry. On the other hand, AON plc ( AON - Get Report ) , an insurance giant, is expected to underperform, according to Credit Suisse, because \"we see the consensus estimates as overly optimistic on margin improvement and free cash flow development over the next few years.\" \nWhat does TheStreet's stock-rating algorithm say about these stocks? \nMust Read: 9 Oil and Energy Stocks to Buy Right Now \nSome 17 U.S. stocks made Credit Suisse's list, and we paired each of these tickers with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy, sell, or hold these stocks. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 16.56% return in 2014, beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nCheck out which stocks made the list. And when you're done, be sure to read about which safe, A+ rated stocks you should buy now. Year-to-date returns are based on October 13, 2015 prices as of 10:27am. \n17. Weatherford International plc ( WFT - Get Report ) Rating: Sell, D+ Market Cap: $7.9 billion Year-to-date return: -11.35% \nWeatherford International plc provides equipment and services used in the drilling, evaluation, completion, production, and intervention of oil and natural gas wells worldwide. \n\nTheStreet Ratings team rates WEATHERFORD INTL PLC as a Sell with a ratings score of D+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate WEATHERFORD INTL PLC (WFT) a SELL. This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, poor profit margins, weak operating cash flow and generally high debt management risk. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Energy Equipment & Services industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 237.2% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$145.00 million to -$489.00 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Energy Equipment & Services industry and the overall market, WEATHERFORD INTL PLC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. The gross profit margin for WEATHERFORD INTL PLC is currently lower than what is desirable, coming in at 28.66%. It has decreased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of -20.46% is significantly below that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $291.00 million or 33.10% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the industry average, the firm's growth is significantly lower. Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.27, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Energy Equipment & Services industry. Despite the fact that WFT's debt-to-equity ratio is mixed in its results, the company's quick ratio of 0.69 is low and demonstrates weak liquidity.

( SEAS - Get Report ) Rating: Hold, C- Year-to-date return: 3.85% \nSeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. operates as a theme park and entertainment company in the United States. \nTheStreet Ratings team rates SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT INC (SEAS) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its expanding profit margins and increase in stock price during the past year. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income, generally higher debt management risk and disappointing return on equity. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 3.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 3.3%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. 43.23% is the gross profit margin for SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT INC which we consider to be strong. Regardless of SEAS's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, SEAS's net profit margin of 1.48% is significantly lower than the industry average. After a year of stock price fluctuations, the net result is that SEAS's price has not changed very much. Although its weak earnings growth may have played a role in this flat result, don't lose sight of the fact that the performance of the overall market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, was essentially similar. We feel that the combination of its price rise over the last year and its current price-to-earnings ratio relative to its industry tend to reduce its upside potential. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. In comparison to the other companies in the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry and the overall market, SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT INC's return on equity is significantly below that of the industry average and is below that of the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $104.40 million or 13.35% when compared to the same quarter last year. In conjunction, when comparing current results to the industry average, SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT INC has marginally lower results.
