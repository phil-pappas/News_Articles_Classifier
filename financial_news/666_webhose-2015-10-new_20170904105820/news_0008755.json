The portal is a buying house for all second hand mobile phones and aims to sell refurbished handsets. GoZunk seeks to fill the gap between the buyer and seller by providing Assured Buying and Warranted Selling for all second hand mobiles. Taking a step ahead from the regular C2C companies where the user has to wait for a buyer and vice versa, GoZunk is the direct buyer and seller for second hand mobiles. So the customer doesn’t have to wait to sell his mobile, he has an assured buyer in the website itself. Similarly, the buyer doesn’t have to wait for the listing of a second hand mobile phone in the market; the website has hundreds of second hand mobiles with warranty listed already. The mobile phone marketplace is a huge expanding industry with more than a billion mobile phone users in the country. In 2014 alone, more than 200 million mobile phones were sold in India out of which more than 25% are smartphones. But can everyone afford these smart mobile phones, most of which are expensive. Especially people in smaller towns and cities where smartphones are in demand but purchasing power is low. This is where GoZunk.com helps the end-user. With the help of gozunk, users can buy second hand/refurbished and good as new mobile phones at less than half the prices. They not only have the flexibility of price but also get warranty from the company. The website is trying to tap into the maturing second hand goods market with an entry into the electronics realm through a pilot with mobiles. With a huge inflow of only top quality used handsets, Gozunk.com is looking to provide smartphones to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and towns where the user has only cheaper and low quality Chinese models as options. But with this second hand mobile phone market opening up, they can now explore buying a second hand warranted iPhone 5 or a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for just as much as any cheaper unreliable model. Gozunk helps you get the best value out of your money for your mobiles. Mohit Bansal, Founder and IIM-A Alumnus, “India currently ranks second in the world in terms of mobile phones bought and sold yearly. We are a big country with huge income disparity and few options for those in remote locations. We at GoZunk will provide those with limited purchasing power an opportunity to get value for their money. Mobile users can now spend smartly on second hand mobile phone which is as good as new. People can purchase a second hand iPhone 5 for the same price as a new Asus Zenphone, so why wouldn’t anyone go for the superior model. The maths is simple! We are making your money go a longer way by ensuring second hand doesn’t mean Junk or Discarded. Instead it means pre-loved, tested, refurbished and ready for use by someone else.” Anubhav Adlakha, ex Investment Banker and Co-Founder of Gozunk echoed the thoughts, “The Second hand electronics market is already a billion dollar opportnity. Gozunk aims to be the leading player in this space within the necxt few years. We will be at the forefront of launching innovative products and schemes to attract customers in Metros as well as Tier 2&3 towns. Our aim is to provide a smart phone in the hands of each Indian.” With the simple mantra of ‘not Junking’ but ‘GoZunking’ your mobiles, the company has also invested in R&D and is looking to further enhance its refurbishing capabilities. With the second hand goods market opening up, Gozunk is surely a player to watch out for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:24:40.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
