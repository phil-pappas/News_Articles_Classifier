On Wednesday, we read through the episode’s script; Thursday and Friday we rehearse; over the weekend, we’re off to learn our lines; Monday we pretape scenes involving special effects, green screens or tricky makeup; Tuesday evenings, we film before the proverbial live studio audience.\nMayim Bialik It’s Wednesday—table-read day. Producers, executives, writers and actors sit around a big rectangular table with name cards for the cast. The jokes always sound their funniest today. We laugh a lot—and I blush a little at a few jokes too naughty to make it to network TV.\nAround noon, the writers retreat to what they call “The Room” to fix lines that didn’t work. I’m on the losing end of a migraine. I head home and take a walk, which makes my head feel better, and accelerate to something between a trot and a run.\nI take my sons, 7 and 10, to taekwondo. (My youngest had wanted an activity that was “awesome” and helpful to his plans to become a secret agent someday.) I like the discipline they’re learning; I did Brazilian jujitsu during college at UCLA. I watch them practice carefully: I’ve vowed to shun my phone and practice a bit of present-mindedness when I’m with my boys.\nRelated Reading\n‘The Big Bang Theory’ Has Hidden Jokes Down to a Science (10/2/15) Mayim Bialik of ‘The Big Bang Theory’ on Bob Dylan\n(4/24/14) A Reassessment of the Film ‘Beaches’ (6/14/13) After I drop the boys at their dad’s place for the night, I go to synagogue to say the Kaddish prayer; I’m in Judaism’s ritual year of mourning for my father. My very own “women’s section” at the Orthodox synagogue closest to my house has become a safe, private space. Usually, I’m the only woman there; tonight, two other women share it with me.\nThursday, my migraine is better but still persistent. I go to the gym at Warner Bros.—it’s a block from our stage, so I really have no excuse not to use it. Sometimes, I see other actors there, and we do the “celebrity nod” to acknowledge some odd level of connectedness. It’s kind of true, I guess.\nBetween rehearsing scenes, I multitask in my dressing room. It isn’t fancy: a lumpy couch, fuzzy white pillows on it, a big floor pillow shaped like an avocado-cucumber sushi roll. (Vegan, of course.) I’ve decorated with tchotchkes and memorabilia—above all, drawings by my sons and adorable pictures of them, but also an impressively accurate Amy Farrah Fowler doll that a fan crocheted for me; pictures of three of my inspirations, Camus, Sartre and Bob Dylan; a copy of a pro-veganism poster I once did for PETA, dressed as a 1950s housewife throwing out a steak; and a photo of me at age 18 being directed by Woody Allen —I played his daughter in a CBS CBS.A -0.04 % TV movie.\nOver lunch, I do a phone interview to encourage more science, technology, engineering and math education. I don’t just play a scientist on TV; I am one, and I hope our show will inspire young people—especially young women—to pursue careers in science. My high-school biology tutor changed my life, and I’d love to help another budding scientist.\nAfter work, I schlep across town for psychotherapy—can’t live without it.\nFriday, the migraine is gone! I return to the gym, feeling both energetic and virtuous.\nAfter work, my sons watch as I have my first dress fitting for an awards show. The dress is custom-made for me—I’m not the standard actress size 0. The dress needs some work but mostly fits. I’ve never been terribly at home on the red carpet, and this fashion stuff just isn’t my thing.\nMy sons and I go to our favorite hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for kung pao tofu and vegetable egg rolls, then to synagogue for Shabbat evening services—two deeply American Jewish experiences.\nOn Saturday night, I join some supporters of UCLA’s Hillel, the Jewish student group, for services at a wealthy donor’s home. He owns amazing artwork, including a David Hockney mural of a pool, painted on a wall alongside the pool. So neat. My dad was a huge Hockney fan—I wish I could tell him about it.\n—Dr. Bialik plays neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler on CBS’s “The Big Bang Theory.” She holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GS546_Bialik_BV_20140423121516.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:22:03.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
