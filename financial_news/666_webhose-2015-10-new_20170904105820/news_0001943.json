Share on twitter by Robert Harley The Sydney property market is trending down but that didn't stop one house in Chatswood selling for a record $6.055 million.\nAfter an auction duel that lasted well over an hour, with the last $1 million ground out in $5000 bids, the results surprised the agent, Kerrie Robertson from LJ Hooker Lane Cove.\n\"The market is plateauing, and vendors have to adjust their thinking, but this vendor did not have to adjust his thinking,\" she said.\nIn a north shore suburb that has drawn much Asian interest, the 6 Chatswood Avenue property offered an oversized five-bedroom 1990s home, on a big 815 square metre block, close to the Chatswood Chase shopping centre.\nOn a record October weekend for auctions the clearance rate in Sydney was marginally lower than that of a year ago but in Melbourne it was actually higher.\n\"Melbourne is the best performing capital city market at the moment,\". said Andrew Wilson, senior economist at Fairfax Media's Domain. \"The city is maintaining its energy at all price levels. \"\nIn Melbourne more than 900 properties went to auction, 38 per cent more than a year ago, but the preliminary clearance rate, 74 per cent, was better than the comparable weekend last year.\nBuyer advocate, Mal James, wrote that in the inner Melbourne and Bayside auctions covered by his team the market continued \"to rock along\" with his key indicator, the number of bidders of Bidderman index, actually rising to 2.8.\n \"Bidderman is defying gravity, by actually rising in a stock-increasing market,\" he wrote but noted that Melbourne faced \"two huge weekends of action\" before slowing for the Melbourne Cup carnival.\nOne of the highest prices sales in Melbourne was of a four-bedroom 1930s home in the Crossakiel Court cul-de-sac in Hawthorn, ripe for renovation or complete rebuilding on the 721 square metre block that sold for Jellis Craig Hawthorn for $3,560,000.\nIn Sydney, the preliminary clearance rate was 70 per cent, which is well short of the feverish clearances earlier this year, and also less than the 73 per cent on the same weekend last year. But over 1020 auctions were held this Saturday, 37 per cent more than a year ago.\nSydney market holds line Domain's Dr Wilson said the Sydney market had \"held the line\" on what was a record auction weekend for October.\n\"Clearly the trend is down, but it is finding a level, perhaps, in part, because sellers are more circumspect about their reserves,\" he said.\nMcgrath Real Estate, chief auctioneer, Scott Kennedy-Green, had eight auctions booked for the day but six sold prior and the other two sold under the hammer.\n\"Around 32 per cent of property listed for sale yesterday was sold prior, which tells you that vendors are starting to listen to the feedback and, if there is a standout buyer, they are willing to sell beforehand,\" he said.\nBoth Mr Kennedy-Green and Dr Wilson noted a \"two-speed market.\" Clearance rates in the western, north-western and south- western suburbs of the city, affected by tightening investor lending, have dipped into the 50 per cent range, and in favour of buyers.\nIn the inner west, north shore, northern beaches and eastern suburbs, it is still a sellers market with clearance rates in some cases over 80 per cent.\nAuction clearance rates have also dipped under the 50 per cent mark on the Central Coast, according to CoreLogic RP Data.\nOne leading agent in the region, the principal of Raine&Horne Charmhaven, Andrew Sorenson, said the market had settled perhaps 5 per cent as Sydney investors became more cautious, investment lending tightened, and the number of properties on the market rose.\nNevertheless, on Saturday he sold typical three-bedroom brick home on a 386 square metre block in Storm Crescent at Bluehaven, for more than $100,000 on what it might have brought a year ago.\n\"If owners are prepared to listen to experience they can get sold,\" he said.\nâ€‹", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-10-11T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:12:49.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
