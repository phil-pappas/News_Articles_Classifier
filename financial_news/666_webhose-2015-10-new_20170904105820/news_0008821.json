There will also be daily group presentations and Q&A sessions at the booth.\n“We’re looking forward to showing the new Version 28 and Mill Turn software at SOUTH-TEC,” said Sean Owen, COO of BobCAD-CAM. “We’ve continued to work closely with our clients to make some major upgrades and additions to the core software. We’ve also debuted our completely new software module for CNC mill turn machines. We’ve got a lot of new and exciting things happening this year and it’s great to be able to bring all of this to the SOUTH-TEC crowd.”\nThe latest CAD-CAM software is one of the company’s most significant releases in company history. BobCAD-CAM added a wide variety of improvements and additions to the new Version 28 software that allow for quicker and easier part designing and CNC programming. The new features include:\n Drilling Multiple Depths in a Single Feature New Drilling Options (Standard Drilling, Multiaxis Drilling, Cross Drilling) Advanced Retract Options Use Cylindrical Surfaces to Automatically Set Drilling Parameters Ability to Use Custom Tool Shapes Perpendicular Stepover for Advanced Planar Round Corners for Advanced Planar Side & Bottom Allowance Wrapped Toolpath Improvements Trim to Stock for 4 Axis Rotary Snap Increments for Dynamic Drawing Workpiece Selection for Simulation Set Default Stock Transparency New Simulation Interface Learn More\nAdditionally, the release offers all-new Mill Turn CAD-CAM software that supports CNC mill turn / multitasking machines. The Mill Turn module allows for programming of multiple turrets, multiple spindles, steady rests and supports live C axis milling, Y axis milling, and B axis (5 axis) milling heads. With the addition of Mill Turn capabilities, the company’s software now works with nearly every type and configuration of CNC machine in use today.\nDemonstrations will cover all of the new functionality in addition to the core features that have established BobCAD-CAM as one of the easiest and most efficient CAD-CAM software on the market today, including:\n Dynamic Machining Strategies High Speed Adaptive Machining Wizard Driven Interface Advanced Machine Simulations Surfaced Based Toolpaths Dynamic Drawing And More\nSOUTH-TEC begins Tuesday, October 27, 2015 and runs through Thursday, October 29.
