The first quarter for fiscal 2016 ended on September 30. P&G’s earnings were ahead of Wall Street analysts’ consensus expectations in 4Q15. The quarter ended June 30, 2015. However, revenue just missed the analysts’ estimates for 4Q15.\nProcter & Gamble’s net revenue fell by 9% to $17.8 billion in 4Q15, compared to $19.6 billion in 4Q14. The reported revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange and saw a 9% fall. The volume saw a 3% fall. This was offset by a 3% average increase in the prices of products across the globe.\n\nWall Street analysts’ expectations For 1Q16 ending on September 30, 2015, Wall Street analysts’ consensus revenue estimate is $17.5 billion. This is a 15.9% fall from the revenue in the same quarter last year.\nP&G’s organic sales for 4Q15 didn’t change. However, both Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Kimberly-Clark’s (KMB) 2Q15 organic sales grew ~4% each. For fiscal 2015, P&G’s organic sales grew for all five segments except for the Beauty, Hair, and Personal Care segment. Overall, the organic sales grew by 1% for fiscal 2015.\nWill reshaping increase the revenue? P&G aims to reshape the company and refocus on ten product categories and 65 brands. This could be the best way to leverage its core competencies. It would result in leading global positions. It would also impact P&G’s top line.
