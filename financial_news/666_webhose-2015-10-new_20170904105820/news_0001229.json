Fed officials have said their decision on when to start tightening will depend on U.S. economic data.\n“What we’re saying is inflation numbers have to be solid,\" Lagarde said, adding that the fund respects the independence of central banks. “For the moment, there’s not much on that horizon, neither on inflation nor on wages.”\nIn a speech last week in Washington, Lagarde said the world may be destined for a long stretch of mediocre growth unless policy makers ramp up spending and guard against turbulence in emerging markets.\nA slowdown in emerging markets driven by weak commodity prices forced the Washington-based fund cut its outlook this week for global growth in 2015 to 3.1 percent from a July forecast of 3.3 percent.\nThe IMF warned this week that over-borrowing by companies has left emerging economies vulnerable to financial stress and capital outflows.\nIn 2015, emerging markets will see their first year of negative capital flows since 1988, as investors pull $541 billion from countries such as China and Brazil, the Institute of International Finance said in a report last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:11:10.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
