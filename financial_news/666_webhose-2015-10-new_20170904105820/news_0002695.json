(This is similar to the repayment problems with its rural equivalent, the District Development Fund, FDD, set up in 2005, except that, with the FDD, the repayment levels are even lower). \n“Some beneficiaries don't repay the money, because they say they want to re-use the funds for other activities, while others don't repay out of negligence”, said Rodrigues. “But there are also those who don't repay for reasons of force majeure - because they have suffered some kind of disaster. Imagine someone has gone into poultry breeding and a disease comes along and wipes out the chickens. Obviously he can't repay the money, or if he does, it won't be in good time”. \nRodrigues said that of the 560 million meticais (about 14 million US dollars) allocated to PERPU in March 2011, so far the beneficiaries have only repaid 102 million - or just 18.2 per cent. He cited the central cities of Beira and Quelimane as facing particularly serious repayment problems. \nAs for the FDD, since it was created around four billion meticais have been allocated to the districts. Rodrigues said that only 43 million meticais has been repaid. \nAs for what the government could do about this, Rodrigues admitted that, since the creation of these programmes, no clear measures had been established for dealing with beneficiaries who did not repay the money or made late repayments. \nHowever, the Coordinating Council had now considered a proposal to monitor the beneficiaries whose repayments are in arrears. But it is not yet clear how this would work, apart from asking the municipal authorities to persuade the beneficiaries to pay up. \n“The problem of the low levels of repayment is indeed worrying”, Rodrigues said. “As you know, the idea of these programmes is that the repayments will be used to finance other beneficiaries. \nSo if we're not recouping the money to lend it to others, that's worrying but it doesn't mean we're going to stop”.
