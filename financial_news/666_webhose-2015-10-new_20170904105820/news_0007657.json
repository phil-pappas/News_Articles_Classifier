With an average balance of $1 million in SMSFs, they are actually very conservative by nature.\nMost trustees' unwritten investment strategies include wanting to maintain their account balance while drawing the pension. If they achieve that, they're happy. Fifteen years of anecdotal evidence and advising clients tells me this.\nBut the one thing the ATO detests most is early access to superannuation and this is evidenced by its $10,200 new speeding ticket. The sole purpose test is defined in Section 62 of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act, as your fund needs to be maintained for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to its members, or beneficiaries in the event of early death. The simple test is that if you receive a personal benefit from your superannuation before you've reached a condition of release, you may well be in contravention of the sole purpose test.\nYou cannot run a business, pay for personal expenses, fund a lifestyle or buy a holiday house in the super fund and receive a personal benefit. Your SMSF must be seen as a separate entity to you personally. It is, in fact, a trust structure and by its very nature has very distinctively different attributes to assets held in your own names because the government wants you to be self funded so it doesn't have to foot the bill for your retirement.\nThe government spends about 10 per cent of the $440 billion it receives from tax receipts on the pension. It also concedes large tax revenues because they allow you to save money into the superannuation system under a concessionally taxed regime with the hope that you'll stash a few extra dollars into your retirement savings. So if you try to exploit those opportunities beyond the already generous realms, there's a fairly strong motivation for the government, or its agency the ATO, to chase you down and make an example of you.\nHow do they find out? Well, if you've had a contravention throughout the tax year, your auditor will need to tick a little box to suggest that there has been one. This may trigger further enquiry from the ATO depending on the extremity of the circumstances. If you've remedied the situation by acknowledging and repaying funds \"accidentally\" used elsewhere then you might be just fine. If you've been really naughty, you could be penalised by receiving an education direction at your cost, losing half your super fund, having your fund wound up, being fined, disqualified as a trustee, or suffer civil or criminal penalties such as being jailed.\nThe introduction of the \"speeding fine\" penalty regime was greatly feared by all of us administrators, accountants and advisors last year. We are yet to see a full year of returns and audits flow through the system and how the ATO applies its ability to slap fines upon all and sundry for seemingly mild contraventions. It should be an interesting tax season this financial year for that reason and by the time all returns are due by mid-May 2016, we should have a clear idea of how it's going to play out for trustees.\nLet me quantify the size of the opportunity for the government just to put the fear of God into you as we enter another year of huge budget deficits. Each year around 2 per cent of SMSFs or 20,000 funds have their auditors list contraventions on their audit reports. The potential revenue for the government could well be north of $150 million. It's clearly a revenue opportunity similar to speeding fines for state governments on our roads. Hopefully (for trustees) it won't be as successful.\n The fines will be based on a points system with each point worth $180. Fines will range from 5 points, or $900 (for example, for not documenting the appointment of an investment manager), to 60 points, or $10,800 (for example, for a contravention of the sole purpose test or other similarly serious contraventions).\nThe fines must be paid personally, which means each member of the fund may receive a fine if you have individual trustees or the corporate entity will wear the cost in the event that you have a corporate trustee. This may well be another good argument for having a corporate trustee for your fund.\nIn the event that a contravention has taken place, I'd suggest you stay on the front foot and own up to the mishap. Talk to your accountant and auditor to establish their process. You should rectify the problem as soon as possible and write a letter to the ATO describing how the contravention has been rectified.\nIdeally, this should happen in the financial year in which the contravention has taken place, so as a matter of practice you should always do a check with your accountant before the end of each financial year to minimise damage. Most accountants don't do this and contraventions are often not recognised until well into the next financial year.
