Andrew Meares by Ben Potter Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has summoned university and research agency chiefs to a private roundtable in western Sydney on Friday aimed at finding ways to drive more industry collaboration and \"innovation\".\nThe roundtable at Western Sydney University in Penrith is the latest evidence of Mr Turnbull's intense focus on innovation as a source of future jobs and prosperity.\nIt marks a return to \"industry policy\" more typically associated with Labor governments, but with less emphasis on \"picking winners\" and more emphasis on pushing researchers to see if they can turn their ideas into businesses.\nThe shift in emphasis under Mr Turnbull contrasts sharply with the hands-off approach under his predecessor Tony Abbott. It has been welcomed by those advocating a more determined effort to create new sources of prosperity after the collapse of the mining boom and basic manufacturing.\nChief among the goals of the roundtable on Friday will be to turn around Australia's dismally weak record in \"commercialising\" - or creating a business out of - the world-class research that comes out of our universities and publicly funded research agencies.\nRoy Green, dean of business at University of Technology, Sydney will be among the attendees. Professor Green is a longtime adviser to governments on innovation, most recently to the Digital Transformation Office, which aims to bring government into the digital age.\nChristopher Pyne, Mr Turnbull's handpicked industry, science and innovation minister, and Fiona Scott, member for Lindsay and a champion of collaboration between researchers and industry in the \"Western Sydney Innovation Corridor\", will attend.\nLarry Marshall, chief executive of the CSIRO, and commonwealth chief scientist Ian Chubb are also among the invitees, along with representatives of Melbourne University, other universities and the venture capital sector.\n Mr Pyne said last week Mr Turnbull had ordered him to release his \"inner revolutionary\" to come up with bolder policies to drive innovation and to let the Prime Minister worry about the money.\n'We can obviously do a lot better' The big problem the roundtable will confront is that Australia's $9.7 billion annual public spending on research yields a research output that ranks in the top eight in the world, according to the 2015 World Economic Forum competitiveness rankings.\nYet Australia ranks a poor 25th in its capacity for innovation - turning those ideas into businesses - according to the WEF, and a miserable last out of 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for collaboration between publicly funded researchers and industry.\nThe government has already taken steps to push researchers in co-operative research centres to focus more on commercial outcomes through the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre chaired by former IBM Australia chief executive Andrew Stevens.\nBut Mr Pyne signalled last week that the push would be stepped up a gear under Mr Turnbull, who was attacked by Labor in parliament on Wednesday for investing part of the profits from successful investments in technology companies made before he entered parliament in Cayman Islands-based hedge funds.\nHe said at the launch of a new carbon fibre vehicle wheel manufacturing plant in Geelong that Australian researchers had failed to make the \"cultural shift\" from \"believing that once your research is done your job is done\" to exploring the commercial possibilities.\n\"To me the research is the first part of the job,\" Mr Pyne said at the Carbon Revolution plant on Deakin University's Waurn Ponds campus.\n\"The second part of the job is commercialising that research, finding the commercial investors, getting industry and business interested.\"\nMr Pyne said Australia and Britain shared a 70:30 split between researchers in public universities and public bodies and their counterparts in the private sector.\n\"And yet only 4 per cent of our researchers in public institutions are involved in business. In Britain that figure is 40 per cent. We can obviously do a lot better.\"\nThe Turnbull government is looking to Britain and other countries seen to have made greater strides in innovation such as Singapore for policies such as allowing crowdfunding for start-ups and generous tax breaks for \"angel investors\" into start-ups.\nThose invited to Friday's innovation roundtable have been told little about the agenda, which is expected to be open and informal.\nOne invitee told The Australian Financial Review : \"We'll turn up - about 20 of us - and we'll be taken through the gameplan.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:03:00.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
