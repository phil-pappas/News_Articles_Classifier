On Wednesday AB InBev made public a string of offers it had made for its UK-rival. \nThe title for the largest deal in history still belongs to Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann AG in 1999 for $202.8 billion. \nThis year has set a number of other milestones for dealmaking. Oil major Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) 's acquisition of British rival BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) for $70 billion, announced in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , is the largest deal in the energy sector in over a decade, while Warren Buffett's $37.2 billion purchase of Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP - news ) in August is the biggest by the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . investor's fund, Berkshire Hathaway (Sao Paolo: BERK34F.SA - news ) . \nBut it is still to be seen whether AB Inbev will bring SAB to a deal, while Shell's takeover of BG has been roiled by regulatory fears and a weak oil price that could still derail the transaction. \n[ http://tinyurl.com/oyhv5rx] (Reporting by Emiliano Mellino; editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:04:32.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
