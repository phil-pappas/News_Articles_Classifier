The students stormed De la Rey's office and demanded she come out to accept their memorandum, in which they demanded, among other things, free education, no fee increment across the board, no registration fee and a seat on the university council. De La Rey accepted the memorandum, but students claimed they could not hear her over the loud-hailer when she attempted to address them. They demanded she follow them to the student centre where they had set up a stage with a sound system. She failed to pitch and students took to the streets in anger, causing havoc around Hatfield. They marched around the university, then headed to the institution's biggest residence, Tuks Residence. When they arrived, they went straight to the dining hall and kiosk where they demanded food and water. They caused major traffic jams as they sang and danced through the streets. De la Rey then agreed to address students just before 15:30 at the amphitheatre. \"I indicated to you that we would seriously look at every single demand indicated to us. I have already indicated that we are prepared to engage. \"I am also very conscious that you have made sacrifices and that your families have made sacrifices... And many of you are already well prepared for your exams. We don't want to compromise your academics,\" she said. The hostile crowd then started heckling her, chanting \"Fees! Fees! Fees!\" After her departure, students vowed to continue with their protest, starting with a night vigil planned from 18:00 and protesting to resume on Thursday. Others said they would sleep on the campus and continue protesting throughout the night.
