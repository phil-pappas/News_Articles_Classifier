[ID: nL5N11V398]\n\"My intention is to have the general election in the spring of 2016 and I see no reason to change that,\" Kenny said in an interview with state broadcaster RTE. Asked whether he might change my mind, he repeated that he saw no reason to do so.\nCalling a quick election would allow Kenny to capitalise on increasingly positive economic news, with Ireland's economy expected to be the best performing in Europe again this year, and would minimise the risk of any unforeseen events damaging his often mistake-prone government.\nBut his coalition partner, Labour, has indicated a preference for a 2016 election and an early vote would also probably scupper the work of a long-running parliamentary inquiry into Ireland's banking crisis.\nThe government's election campaign will effectively begin with Tuesday's budget for 2016, outlining its fiscal plans for the next few years. Kenny said that if elected, he would phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC), an unpopular additional tax levied on income introduced during the financial crisis.
