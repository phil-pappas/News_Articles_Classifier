Pat Scala Share on twitter by Matthew Drummond Take technology used to mould resin into surfboards in Queensland, marry it with carbon fibres tubes used for camera tripods developed in Finland and the progeny is a ethereal-looking structure that has just been erected in Melbourne's Queen Victoria Gardens.\nThe canopy of thin black tubes supporting a transparent roof is the second MPavilion – a temporary structure that for four months will house 200 art events. It's designed by renowned British architect Amanda Levete who works with composite materials that stretch architectural limits.\n\"We wanted to create a canopy of impossibly fragile petals supported on very, very slender columns,\" says Levete, known by most Australians for her spaceship-like Media Centre at Lords Cricket Ground in London.\n\"We knew that we had to use materials that are not completely common in the construction industry,\" she adds.\nIt's a comment with considerable British understatement. In reality the roof is an entirely new type of building material, a resign that can stretch up to five metres yet is just three millimetres thick.\nThe project has been funded by Naomi Milgrom, who is on a mission to use her philanthropy to cement Melbourne as a world capital for ground-breaking design. Milgrom, the owner and executive chairman of Sussan Group, first came across Levete via the Selfridges department store in Birmingham that she designed.\n\"Inside it's a beautifully fluid space with a lot of curves and lot of ways to discover the journey of fashion,\" Milgrom says of that building. \"I was overwhelmed.\"\nThe MPavilion project has made London-based Levete a frequent visitor to Melbourne – at one stage she lived in the iconic house designed by mid-century modernist architect Robin Boyd in South Yarra. Both London and Melbourne have seen property booms with new apartment buildings criticised for failing to serve the local population – in London it's luxury boltholes for rich Russians, in Melbourne it's poky apartments for Chinese investors. Levete is a fan of neither.\n \"Real estate is being used as a currency and it's really bad. It means death for cities because investors are buying all these apartments and not living there. It sucks the life out of a city.\"\nWhile not a big fan of rules that can crimp the design process, she does think there's a role for interventionist statutory bodies, which can set minimum standards. Such standards are part of the answer, she says. Rewarding groundbreaking architecture is another.\nPerformance venue The thin carbon fibres tubes in her MPavilion encase cabling for LED lights and amplifiers that help serve the building's purpose as a performance venue. A key event at last year's MPavilion was a daily reading at noon of parts of Robin Boyd's 1960 book, The Australian Ugliness .\nSo what would Robin Boyd make of the Levete structure, surrounded by one of Melbourne's most stately gardens and opposite the handsome bluestone National Gallery of Victoria?\n\"He would love it, it's the total antithesis of what he talked about in that book,\" Milgrom says with a big smile. \"I think he'd love it.\"\nEvents at MPavilion are free and staged from 6 October 2015 until 7 February 2016.
