Charlotte, N.C., United States Bank of America Corporation today reported net income of $4.5 billion, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $232 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. \"We saw solid results this quarter by continuing to execute our long-term strategy,\" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan. “The key drivers of our business -- deposit taking and lending to both our consumer and corporate clients -- moved in the right direction this quarter and our trading results on behalf of clients remained fairly stable in challenging capital markets conditions. Our balanced approach to serving customers and clients is on track as the economy continues to move forward.\" \"Our results this quarter reflect our ongoing efforts to improve operating leverage while continuing to invest in our business,\" said Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio. \"We built capital and liquidity to record levels and grew total loans for the second consecutive quarter while continuing to operate within our risk framework.\" (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net interest income, FTE basis 1 Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis 1 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share (0.04 ) 1 Fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis for the corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, see endnote G. Net interest income on a GAAP basis was $9.5 billion, $10.5 billion and $10.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Total revenue, net of interest expense, on a GAAP basis was $20.7 billion, $22.1 billion and $21.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. 2 Noninterest expense includes litigation expense of $231 million, $175 million and $6.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, was $20.9 billion (G) , down $521 million from the third quarter of 2014. This was largely driven by higher negative market-related adjustments on the company's debt securities portfolio due to lower long-term interest rates, partially offset by higher positive net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), compared to the year-ago quarter. The current quarter included $597 million in negative market-related adjustments and $313 million in positive net DVA. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $9.7 billion in the third quarter of 2015, down 7 percent, or $702 million, from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of market-related adjustments, net interest income was $10.3 billion in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $10.0 billion in the prior quarter and $10.5 billion in the year-ago quarter (G) . The decline from the third quarter of 2014 was driven by lower consumer loan balances and lower yields, partially offset by commercial loan growth and lower long-term debt balances. Noninterest income was up 2 percent, or $181 million, from the year-ago quarter to $11.2 billion. Results for the most recent quarter reflected year-over-year increases in mortgage banking and card income, higher asset management fees and other income, partially offset by lower capital markets revenue and lower equity investment income. The provision for credit losses increased $170 million from the third quarter of 2014 to $806 million. Net charge-offs were $932 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2014. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.42 percent in the third quarter of 2015 from 0.46 percent in the year-ago quarter. The decline in net charge-offs was driven primarily by an improvement in consumer portfolio trends, partially offset by higher commercial charge-offs. The net reserve release was $126 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to a net reserve release of $407 million in the third quarter of 2014. Noninterest expense declined $6.3 billion, or 31 percent, from the third quarter of 2014 to $13.8 billion. Excluding litigation expense of $231 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $6.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, noninterest expense decreased 4 percent from the year-ago quarter to $13.6 billion, reflecting lower Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS) expense (A) . Continued cost management efforts allowed the company to continue to invest in growth opportunities while keeping expenses relatively flat from the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was 26 percent, which included benefits related to the restructuring of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Business Segment Results The company reports results through five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets, and Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis Return on average allocated capital 1 108,533 1 Return on average allocated capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the segments. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. Business Highlights Average deposit balances increased $34.3 billion, or 7 percent, from the year-ago quarter to $548.9 billion. The company originated $13.7 billion in first-lien residential mortgage loans and $3.1 billion in home equity loans in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $11.7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Client brokerage assets increased $8.7 billion, or 8 percent, from the year-ago quarter to $117.2 billion, driven primarily by strong account flows, partially offset by lower market valuations. The company issued 1.3 million new consumer credit cards in the third quarter of 2015, up from 1.2 million cards issued in the year-ago quarter. Financial Overview Consumer Banking reported net income of $1.8 billion, up 5 percent from the year-ago quarter. The business saw increased customer activity during the quarter with year-over-year increases in deposits, mortgage originations, credit card issuance and brokerage assets. In addition, the number of mobile banking users increased 14 percent from the year-ago quarter to 18.4 million users. Revenue was up 1 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to $7.8 billion, as higher noninterest income was largely offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income declined as the benefit from higher deposits was more than offset by the impact of the company's allocation of asset liability management (ALM) activities and lower card yields. Noninterest income was up 6 percent to $2.8 billion, driven by gains on divestitures and higher card income, partially offset by lower service charges. The provision for credit losses decreased $20 million from the year-ago quarter to $648 million, driven by continued improvement in credit quality, primarily related to the small business and credit card portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to $4.4 billion, as the company continued to optimize its delivery network and invest some of the savings from these initiatives back into the business by adding sales specialists. Over the last 12 months, the company has added more than 300 mortgage loan officers, financial solutions advisors and small business bankers to help serve customers and deepen relationships. Driven by the continued growth in mobile banking and other self-service customer touchpoints, the company closed or divested 244 locations and added 38 locations since the third quarter of 2014, resulting in a total of 4,741 financial centers at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Return on average allocated capital was 24 percent in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 22 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis Return on average allocated capital 1 At period-end (dollars in billions) 2,462 1 Return on average allocated capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the segments. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. 2 Total client balances are defined as assets under management, client brokerage assets, assets in custody, client deposits and loans (including margin receivables). Business Highlights The number of wealth advisors increased by 998 advisors from the year-ago quarter to 18,037, due to continued investment within the Advisor Development program, improved competitive recruiting and near historically low advisor attrition levels. This increase includes 174 advisors in Consumer Banking as the company continues to expand its specialist network to broaden and deepen client relationships. Third-quarter 2015 long-term assets under management (AUM) flows of $4.4 billion were the 25 th consecutive quarter of positive flows. Average deposit balances increased 2 percent, or $4.6 billion, from the year-ago quarter to $244.0 billion, and average loan balances increased 10 percent from the year-ago quarter to $133.2 billion, marking the 22 nd consecutive quarter of loan balance growth. Asset management fees increased 2 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to $2.1 billion. Financial Overview Global Wealth and Investment Management reported net income of $656 million, compared to $812 million in the third quarter of 2014. Revenue was down $198 million to $4.5 billion, as higher asset management fees were more than offset by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the company's allocation of ALM activities on net interest income. This is the continuation of a trend in transactional revenue as clients continue to migrate from brokerage to managed relationships, compounded by lower markets and muted new issue activity. The third-quarter 2015 pretax margin was 23 percent, down from 27 percent in the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense increased slightly from the year-ago quarter to $3.4 billion, as litigation-related costs were higher and the number of wealth advisors grew by 6 percent from the year-ago quarter. The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $13 million from the year-ago quarter to a benefit of $2 million, driven by higher recoveries recorded in the year-ago quarter. Return on average allocated capital was 22 percent in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 27 percent in the year-ago quarter. Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis Return on average allocated capital 1 291,927 1 Return on average allocated capital is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Business Highlights Bank of America Merrill Lynch generated firmwide investment banking fees of $1.3 billion, excluding self-led deals, in the third quarter of 2015, maintaining its No. 3 global ranking (H) . Bank of America Merrill Lynch was ranked among the top three global financial institutions in high-yield corporate debt, leveraged loans, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, convertible debt, investment grade corporate debt, syndicated loans, and debt capital markets during the third quarter of 2015 (H) . Firmwide advisory fees of $391 million were the second-highest results since the Merrill Lynch merger. Average loan and lease balances increased $26.8 billion, or 9 percent, from the year-ago quarter, to $310 billion, largely due to growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio and in the commercial real estate portfolio. Financial Overview Global Banking reported net incomeof $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2014, as strong loan and deposit growth and higher advisory fees were offset by lower net interest income and lower underwriting fees in line with lower industry volumes. Net interest income was down $105 million, reflecting the impact of the company's allocation of ALM activities and liquidity costs, as well as compression in loan spreads. This was offset in part by loan growth. Firmwide investment banking fees, excluding self-led deals, decreased to $1.3 billion in the third quarter from the year-ago quarter of $1.4 billion, with higher advisory fees more than offset by a decline in equity issuance fees. The return on average allocated capital was 14 percent in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 18 percent in the year-ago quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $243 million from the year-ago quarter to $179 million, associated with higher loan balances and higher reserve releases in the prior year. Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged from the year-ago quarter at $2.0 billion. Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis, excluding net DVA 1 Return on average allocated capital 2 599,977 1 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Net DVA gains were $313 million, $102 million and $205 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. 2 Return on average allocated capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the segments. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. Business Highlights Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased 12 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion, driven by a strong performance in derivatives, reflecting favorable market conditions (I) . Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Equity Research Team was ranked No. 1 in the 2015 All-America Institutional Investor survey. Financial Overview Global Markets reported net income of $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $371 million in the year-ago quarter, as lower noninterest expense, principally litigation, was partially offset by lower Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) sales and trading revenues. Revenue decreased $90 million, or 2 percent, from the year-ago quarter to $4.1 billion. Excluding net DVA, revenue decreased $198 million, or 5 percent, to $3.8 billion (J) . Net DVA gains were $313 million, compared to $205 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales and trading revenue was relatively unchanged from the year-ago quarter at $3.5 billion. Excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue was down 4 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to $3.2 billion as higher equities sales and trading revenue was more than offset by lower FICC sales and trading revenue (I) . Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased 11 percent from the year-ago quarter, due to declines in credit-related businesses, offset in part by improvement in rates products (I) . Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased 12 percent from the year-ago quarter, led by a strong performance in derivatives, reflecting favorable market conditions (I) . Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion decreased $674 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by lower litigation expense. The year-ago quarter included approximately $600 million in litigation expense, the majority of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense declined 4 percent, driven by lower revenue-related expenses (K) . Return on average allocated capital was 11 percent in the third quarter of 2015. Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS) Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis 34,484 1 Noninterest expense includes litigation expense of $228 million, $59 million and $5.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014. Business Highlights The number of 60+ days delinquent first-mortgage loans serviced by LAS declined to 114,000 loans at the end of the third quarter of 2015, down 18,000 loans, or 14 percent, from the prior quarter and down 107,000 loans, or 48 percent, from the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense, excluding litigation, was approximately $0.9 billion in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $0.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014 (B) . Financial Overview Legacy Assets and Servicing reported a net loss of $196 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $5.1 billion for the same period in 2014, driven by lower litigation expense. Revenue increased in the third quarter of 2015 as mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net-of-hedge performance improved and the representations and warranties provision declined, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing fees. Mortgage servicing fees were down 27 percent from the year-ago quarter to $345 million as the number of first-lien and second-lien loans serviced by LAS declined from the third quarter of 2014. The provision for credit losses decreased $261 million from the third quarter of 2014 to $6 million, driven primarily by costs related to the consumer relief portion of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) settlement in the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense decreased $5.5 billion from the year-ago quarter to $1.1 billion primarily due to a decrease in litigation expense of $5.1 billion and lower default-related servicing expenses. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense was $0.9 billion in the third quarter of 2015, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter and down $430 million, or 32 percent, from the third quarter of 2014 as the number of 60+ days delinquent first-mortgage loans serviced by LAS declined 48 percent to 114,000 loans (B) . Total revenue, net of interest expense, FTE basis 199,404 1 All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. Beginning with new originations in 2014, we retain certain residential mortgages in Consumer Banking, consistent with where the overall relationship is managed; previously such mortgages were in All Other. Additionally, certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by Legacy Assets and Servicing are held in All Other. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. All Other reported net income of $4 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $509 million for the same period a year ago. Net interest income decreased $570 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by the negative impact of the market-related adjustments on the company's debt securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Noninterest income rose $123 million from the year-ago quarter to $12 million, driven primarily by approximately $400 million in gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, compared to approximately $230 million in gains in the year-ago quarter. Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2015 also included a charge of $303 million for the payment protection insurance provision (PPI) in the U.K. card business and $385 million in gains of the sale of debt securities. This compares with a PPI charge of $298 million and gains on debt securities of $410 million in the third quarter of 2014. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $67 million, compared to a benefit of $265 million in the third quarter of 2014, as the company released reserves at a slower pace compared to the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense declined $174 million, reflecting improved litigation and lower personnel and infrastructure costs, partially offset by higher professional fees. The third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $507 million, compared with tax benefits of $541 million in the third quarter of 2014. Net charge-off ratio, including PCI write-offs 2 Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties ratio 3 Allowance for loan and lease losses Allowance for loan and lease losses ratio 4 1.71 % 1 Excludes write-offs of PCI loans of $148 million, $290 million and $246 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. 2 Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases during the period. 3 Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties ratios are calculated as nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties divided by outstanding loans, leases and foreclosed properties at the end of the period. 4 Allowance for loan and lease losses ratio is calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses divided by loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period. Note: Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Credit quality remained strong in the third quarter of 2015 with net charge-offs declining across most major portfolios when compared to the year-ago quarter. The balance of 30+ days performing delinquent loans, excluding fully insured loans, declined across most consumer portfolios from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were down 27 percent from the year-ago period. Net charge-offs were $932 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2014. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.42 percent in the third quarter of 2015 from 0.46 percent in the year-ago quarter. The decline in net charge-offs was driven by an improvement primarily in consumer portfolio trends, partially offset by higher commercial charge-offs. The provision for credit losses increased $170 million from the third quarter of 2014 to $806 million. In the third quarter of 2015, the net reserve release was $126 million compared to a net reserve release of $407 million in the third quarter of 2014. The allowance for loan and lease losses to annualized net charge-off coverage ratio was 3.42 times in the third quarter of 2015, compared with 3.65 times in the third quarter of 2014. Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were $10.3 billion at September 30, 2015, a decrease from $11.6 billion at June 30, 2015 and $14.2 billion at September 30, 2014. Within the commercial loan portfolio, reservable criticized loans increased 15 percent from the year-ago quarter due to certain downgrades in the company's oil and gas portfolio. However, the reservable criticized rate is still below pre-financial crisis levels.

Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets (RWA), CET1 ratio and supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) as shown on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information, refer to Endnote (C) on page 13. For a reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 18 of this press release. 2 Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which will increase our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. Including these modifications, the estimated pro-forma CET1 ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis would be 9.7 percent and 9.3 percent at September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively. For more information, refer to Endnote (C) on page 13. 3 Basel 3 Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of September 30, 2015, BAC had not received IMM approval. 4 Tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. The Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized Transition approach was 11.6 percent at September 30, 2015 and 11.2 percent at June 30, 2015. While the Basel 3 fully phased-in Standardized and fully phased-in Advanced approaches do not go into effect until 2018, the company is providing the following estimates for comparative purposes. The estimated Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized approach on a fully phased-in basis was 10.8 percent at September 30, 2015 and 10.3 percent at June 30, 2015 (C) . The estimated Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis was 11.0 percent at September 30, 2015 and 10.4 percent at June 30, 2015 (C) . On September 3, 2015 the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which increased risk-weighted assets as of October 1, 2015. If the modifications to these models were included, the estimated CET1 ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis would be approximately 9.7 percent and 9.3 percent, at September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively (C) . At September 30, 2015, the estimated fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) (L) for the Bank Holding Company was approximately 6.4 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum for bank holding companies, and the estimated fully phased-in SLR for the company's primary banking entity was approximately 7.0 percent at September 30, 2015, which exceeds the 6.0 percent \"well capitalized\" level. At September 30, 2015, Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $499 billion, compared to $484 billion at June 30, 2015 and $429 billion at September 30, 2014 (D) . Time-to-required funding was 42 months at September 30, 2015, compared to 40 months at June 30, 2015 and 38 months at September 30, 2014 (D) . The U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio estimate at September 30, 2015 exceeds the fully phased-in 2017 minimum requirement (M) . Period-end common shares issued and outstanding were 10.43 billion at September 30, 2015, 10.47 billion at June 30, 2015 and 10.52 billion at September 30, 2014. The company repurchased approximately $800 million in common stock during the third quarter. Tangible book value per share (E) was $15.50 at September 30, 2015, compared to $15.02 at June 30, 2015 and $14.09 at September 30, 2014. Book value per share was $22.41 at September 30, 2015, compared to $21.91 at June 30, 2015 and $20.99 at September 30, 2014. End Notes (A) Noninterest expense, excluding litigation expense, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Noninterest expense on a GAAP basis was $13.8 billion, $13.8 billion and $20.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Litigation expense was $231 million, $175 million and $6.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. (B) Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS) noninterest expense, excluding litigation, is a non-GAAP financial measure. LAS noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, $961 million and $6.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. LAS litigation expense was $228 million, $59 million and $5.3 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. (C) Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 18 of this press release. On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and Tier 1 capital. Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models which will increase our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. Including these modifications, the estimated pro-forma CET1 ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches on a fully phased-in basis would be 9.7 percent and 9.3 percent at September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Basel 3 Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of September 30, 2015, BAC had not received IMM approval. (D) Global Excess Liquidity Sources include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity from the bank or other regulated entities are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Time-to-required funding is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the parent company’s Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. We have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the $8.6 billion liability, including estimated costs, for settlements, primarily for the previously announced BNY Mellon private-label securitization settlement. (E) Tangible book value per share of common stock is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. (F) Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. (G) Fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis for the corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 22-24 of this press release. Net interest income on a GAAP basis was $9.5 billion, $10.5 billion and $10.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Net interest income on an FTE basis, excluding market-related adjustments, represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Market-related adjustments of premium amortization expense and hedge ineffectiveness were ($0.6) billion, $0.7 billion and ($0.1) billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Total revenue, net of interest expense, on a GAAP basis was $20.7 billion, $22.1 billion and $21.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. Net DVA gains were $313 million, $102 million and $205 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. (H) Rankings per Dealogic as of October 5, 2015 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. (I) Sales and Trading revenue, excluding DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Sales and trading net DVA gains were $313 million and $205 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Equities net DVA gains were $35 million and $72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. FICC net DVA gains were $278 million and $133 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively. (J) Global Markets revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net DVA gains were $313 million and $205 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (K) Global Markets noninterest expense, excluding litigation expense, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Global Markets noninterest expense was $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Global Markets litigation expense was $32 million and $601 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (L) The estimated supplementary leverage ratio is measured using quarter-end Tier 1 capital as the numerator, calculated under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is supplementary leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures include lending commitments, letters of credit, OTC derivatives, repo-style transactions and margin loan commitments. At September 30, 2015, the estimated SLR for the Bank Holding Company on a transition basis was 6.5 percent. Differences between fully phased-in and transitional supplementary leverage exposures are immaterial. (M) The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) estimates are based on our current understanding of the final U.S. LCR rules which were issued on September 3, 2014.
