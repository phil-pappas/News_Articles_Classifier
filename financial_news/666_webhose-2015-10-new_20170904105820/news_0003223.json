Dallas Kilponen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten Union-backed superannuation funds have thrown down the gauntlet to Malcolm Turnbull, urging the prime minister to scrap the super governance legislation as a sign that he is prepared to run a consultative government.\nAs the Senate prepares to debate the governance legislation on Thursday , Industry Super Australia chairman Peter Collins called on Mr Turnbull to make a break from the style of government operated by his predecessor Tony Abbott and uphold a system that had delivered superior returns to members.\nThe government is proposing to force super funds to ensure that one third of directors, including the chairman, are independent . A separate amendment to the Corporations Act will require funds to have a majority of independent trustees on an \"if not, why not\" basis by July 2019. The latter change in particular has angered industry super funds.\nThe Association of Superannuation of Australia also opposes the move towards having a majority of independent directors on the grounds that it is unnecessary red tape and amounts to \"regulation by stealth\".\nHowever the changes are strongly supported by the Financial Services Council, which represents the banks and listed wealth companies.\n\"The 'new' government has the opportunity to change the settings around the current governance debate. The government should abandon this legacy legislation from Tony Abbott's administration as part of rejuvenation efforts to present a more considered, moderate and consultative face,\" Mr Collins said.\nMr Collins, a trustee of super fund Hostplus and a former NSW state treasurer, said the proposal for funds to have a majority of independent trustees on an \"if not, why not\" basis, which resembles the requirements for listed company boards, \"totally changes the game\".\nLegislation not flagged\n \"The current legislation was never flagged in the previous term of the parliament and represents a very significant departure from what they did propose,\" adding that the proposals were designed to damage the current industry super fund model \"for no good reason\".\nHe said: \"There is no evidence to support that having a majority of independent directors will give rise to better performance or better governance.\"\nThe current system, requires equal representation on trustee boards between union and employer group representatives.\nIn September 2013, shortly before the federal election, the then Opposition said that one of its key super platforms was to align corporate governance in super more closely with governance principles applicable to companies listed on the ASX.\nThe Coalition's governance proposal is arguably one of its two most contentious super policies, the other being a move to crack open the distribution of default retirement products by removing super from industrial awards.\nThe industry funds' opposition to the planned governance arrangements has been galvanised by a raft of financial planning scandals at banks including Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Macquarie Group.\nSupporters of the move towards having a majority of independent super fund directors argue that it will bring a greater mix of skills and experience to boardrooms and will align more closely the governance principles in the retirement savings and corporate sectors.\nBefore the Senate debate on Thursday, the industry has until Wednesday to send submissions to a Senate Economics Legislation Committee review into the same issue. ISA said it would be seeking meetings with all the relevant ministers to discuss its views on the draft legislation.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:09:49.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
