What is happening in Syria, Libya, Iran and Yemen, they all tell us that oil security, energy security is a major preoccupation for all of us.\" \nRebalancing oil supplies and demand will depend on a pick-up in China's economic growth and on the timing and volume of Iranian crude returning to the market after western sanctions are lifted under a deal to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, he said. \nBirol said Iran could boost production by 400,000-600,000 barrels of per day within a year after sanctions are lifted from its existing fields, and more could come from the country's floating storage platforms (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:00:51.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
