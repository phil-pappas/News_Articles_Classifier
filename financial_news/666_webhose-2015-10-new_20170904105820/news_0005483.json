Domestic FMCG companies have, over the years, grown from single-product companies to multi-product, multi-category firms,” said the AnandRathi Institutional Research report.\n“Their margins and return ratios have improved. They have used steady cash-flows to invest in products and distribution to drive growth,” it said.\nDomestic FMCG companies’ revenues have registered a 21 per cent CAGR over 10 year from fiscal 2005-06 to 2014-15, while their profits have come at a 24 per cent CAGR.\nThe listed FMCG MNCs have, during that period, registered a lower 13 per cent CAGR in revenue, while their profits have come at a 14 per cent CAGR, it added.\nIt further said: “Domestic FMCG players have grown their product portfolios, from niche offerings such as chyawanprash to more mainstream offerings such as skincare products and beverages.”\nIdentifying reasons for better growth reported by domestic FMCG companies, the report said four ‘I’s driving growth for domestic companies.\n“Better India-consumer connect, innovation, inorganic growth and international forays have been the prime growth drivers for domestic firms.

We expect the margin gains to persist, especially for small and midcap FMCG operators, which have yet to gain from the scaled-up benefits,” it added.\n 19, 2015 6:34 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:27:00.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
