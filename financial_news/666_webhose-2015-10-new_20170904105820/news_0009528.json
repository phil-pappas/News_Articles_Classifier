The summit is designed to bring these firms and their portfolio companies together to promote the sharing of best practices, identify gaps and opportunities in veteran hiring processes, and energize leaders across private equity firms and portfolio companies as they continue to focus on these important issues. \nIn addition to human resources executives from across the partner firms’ collective 200+ U.S.-based portfolio companies representing more than 1.2 million domestic employees, the summit will feature dynamic and informative speakers including First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator John McCain, Joining Forces Executive Director Colonel Nicole Malachowski, Carry The Load Co-Founder Clint Bruce, Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Curtis Coy, Army Vice Chief of Staff General Daniel B. Allyn, President of Hiring Our Heroes and Vice President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Eric Eversole, President and CEO of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation Sheryl Palmer, Director of the Military Service Initiative at The Bush Institute Colonel Miguel Howe, and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense at the U.S. Department of Defense Stephanie Barna. \nSessions at the summit will cover a wide range of topics, including an overview of government initiatives that complement this effort, the role of mentorship in ensuring a positive transition to civilian life, and other challenges and opportunities that impact this initiative. Additionally, the summit will feature small break-out discussions that offer hiring executives the opportunity to leverage the collective knowledge of leaders across the firms’ portfolios of investments to tackle issues and share best practices. \n“We could not be more proud to partner with firms from across the industry on this truly remarkable effort. We all have a responsibility to do right by our nation’s veterans – by working together, our industry can make an important contribution,” said Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone’s Chairman, CEO, and Co-Founder. “Across our portfolio companies we have found that veterans make outstanding employees, and we are thrilled to continue this effort to ensure that those who have so bravely served our country can develop meaningful and successful careers when they transition to civilian life.” \n“Veterans can face significant challenges entering the civilian workforce. The private equity industry, and the diversity of jobs represented by our many companies can help be part of the solution,” said Henry Kravis, Co-Chairman and Co-CEO of KKR. “Today, we are proud not only of our firm’s progress in hiring and retaining veterans across our portfolio, but also of the spirit of partnership this summit has fostered across our industry.” \nDaniel A. D’Aniello, Chairman of The Carlyle Group and a U.S. Navy veteran, said, “We are grateful for our veterans’ service and sacrifice. Through this summit we hope to draw attention to the needs of our military service members and their families as they transition to the private sector. Private equity portfolio companies can be an effective part of the solution in supporting veteran career development.” \n“Hiring our nation's veterans is the right thing to do – for them and for our portfolio companies,\" said David Bonderman, co-founder of TPG. \"Veterans have invaluable skills, a strong sense of commitment and a positive work ethic that can surely benefit any business.” \nThe summit brings together 150 veterans hiring leaders from the firms’ portfolio companies to learn from each other and from more than 20 panelists and speakers. Following the summit, the firms will continue to collaborate to provide support to help portfolio companies as they hire veterans and promote veteran career development and integration in the broader economy. \nThe event is OPEN PRESS.
