The index reading of 118.2 shows the number of optimists far outweighs the number of pessimists.\n“In contrast to the global barrage of negativity surrounding China’s economic fortunes, ordinary Chinese consumers have become increasingly upbeat,” Westpac said.\nChina’s economic slowdown and share market turmoil has been making headlines since July, when the Shanghai stockmarket plunged in a $US4 trillion wipeout over a month.\nEconomic indicators pointing to China’s faltering industrial profitability and output have caused financial market anxiety, and were one of the reasons cited by US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen for not hiking US interest rates in September.\n“The Chinese economy remains a key source of concern for global investors. Once again though, the surveyed opinions of China’s consumers are showing a steady improvement,” Westpac senior economic Matthew Hassan said.\n“Our cross-section of urban Chinese consumers seems oblivious to the tirade of negativity that surrounds China at the moment,\" MNI indicators chief economist Philip Uglow said.\n“Instead, consumer sentiment is at the highest in almost one and a half years, which is a boon for an already firm retail sector.”\nChinese consumer confidence was boosted by Beijing attempts to stimulate the economy, including a rate cut in late August, the depreciation of the yuan and the country’s proposed reform of its state-owned enterprises, Westpac said.\nThe proportion of Chinese who nominated stocks as the wisest place for savings increased, despite a rise in the proportion who reported a loss on their stockmarket investment in September.\nWhile the drop in the Shanghai share market has caused panic in financial markets, the composite index still shows a gain of around 40 per cent over the past 15 months.\n“While China’s traditional industrial growth engine is slowing, the growing consumer and service sector should help to underpin growth in the months and years ahead,” Mr Uglow said.\nChinese consumer sentiment is now only 1.7 per cent below its long-term average.\n China consumers unfazed by turmoil", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/china-consumers-unfazed-by-turmoil-westpac-mni-survey-finds/story-fni0dcne-1227550735623"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:08:02.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
