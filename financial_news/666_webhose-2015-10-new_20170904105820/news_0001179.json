Although Baxalta rejected the offer, Shire has said it remained committed to the deal. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch warned the FDA's decision on Lifitegrast \"could extend the Baxalta overhang\", given that a revised all-share offer by Shire could be difficult ahead of a major event for its stock, such as the clinical trial. \nOnly last week, shares in Shire rallied amid rumours it was preparing a bid for US drugs developer Radius Health (Xetra: 1R8.DE - news ) . \nOn Friday, peer AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) fell when its diabetes drug was not approved by the FDA, which requested more clinical data. \nShares in Shire hit a high in August, but the stock has slipped 23pc since and is now changing hands at £44.32.
