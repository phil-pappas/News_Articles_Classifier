JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been top beneficiaries, pocketing $97 million and $84 million respectively in the last three years.\nMorgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and RBC Capital Markets each earned roughly $50 million, according to the data.\nThe handsome fee payments have come even though Valeant has closed a number of its largest deals without hiring a mergers and acquisitions adviser, including its largest acquisition, the $15.8 billion takeover of Salix Pharmaceuticals in April.\nIn going alone in some deals, Valeant relied on the deal-making expertise of its top executives. Its Chief Executive Michael Pearson, previously led the pharmaceutical practice at McKinsey & Co., and Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller, who left the company in June, was a top investment banker at Goldman Sachs. Valeant still paid fees for the financing of the deals.\nValeant's capital raising, mostly in the form of debt, has been by far the most lucrative source of deal-making fees, accounting for nearly $450 million of the total, according to the data.\nFor Valeant, the legacy of those capital raises is more than $40 billion in debt, which currently exceeds its market capitalization of around $39 billion.\nSeveral other drug companies that have followed similar strategies of aggressive acquisitions, cuts in research and development budgets and price increases, have also come under pressure amid concerns about tougher drug pricing scrutiny.\nSeveral Valeant peers, including Endo International Plc , Mallinckrodt Plc and Horizon Pharma Plc , have also seen their shares fall, potentially limiting their ability to make acquisitions in the future.
