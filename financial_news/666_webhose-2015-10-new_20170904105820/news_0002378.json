FBR raised its price target to 126 from 120.

Cutting back on labor needs would take some pressure off the company's gross margin, he said. \nIn an upgrade from traditional cut-and-sew manufacturing, Nike said its budding 3D digital design system with DreamWorks will be capable of \"nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultra-rapid prototyping.\" \nHopes are high for 3D printers from companies like ExOne (NASDAQ: XONE ), Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS ) and 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD ) to make a splash in the consumer market. \nStratasys and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) announced a partnership last week to allow Photoshop Creative Cloud users to use Stratasys' self-service site to receive 3D-printed items within days. And 3D Systems makes a 3D photo booth, where users can make their own figurines. \nNike shares finished up 2.3% in the stock market today , hitting a record intraday high of 129.17. Shares of 3D Systems rose 3%, ExOne climbed 7.5% and Stratasys notched up 0.9%. \nSaving $1 Billion In Costs \nAside from sounding very cool and futuristic, all of that 3D printing and automation technology has an additional purpose: to help save Nike money in leftover materials that don't wind up in the final product. The company said Wednesday that reducing waste alone could produce $1 billion in cost savings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:13:40.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
