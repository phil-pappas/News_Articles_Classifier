The three-year old RIDA fund already oversees $5.5 billion in assets and has returned an average 8 percent a year since its launch. In September it gained 9.1 percent, leaving it up 11.48 percent for the year to date.\nThe firm's third fund that is available to outsiders is the 10-year-old $10.5 Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, which trades only in U.S. listed stocks. This year it has gained 11.2 percent after rising 7.61 percent in September.\nSince its launch in 2005, it has returned an annualized 9.8 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has climbed an average 6.7 percent per year during the same time.\nRenaissance's most famous portfolio, the $10 billion Medallion fund, is available only to insiders at the East Setauket, New York-based firm.\nMathematician James Simons founded Renaissance in 1982 and has long ranked among the hedge fund industry's best paid investors. Peter Brown and Robert Mercer now run the firm.\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Paul Simao)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:19:53.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
