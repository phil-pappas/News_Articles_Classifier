They can end up costing you a lot of money if you rack up large balances and don’t pay them off quickly. The average card charges about 15% per year in interest, which means a person who pays just the minimum on his balance can easily end up paying twice as much for every item purchased with the card.That means you’d end up paying $8 for that $4 latte you swiped for back in 2011. And $60 for that $30 tank of gas. The high interest rates are terrible for the finances of those who carry credit card balances from one month to the next. [tweet_Quote: display=\"About 1 in 3 U.S. adults carry a credit card balance month to month; more than $2,500 for a third of them.\"]About one in three U.S. adults carry a credit card balance from month to month; a third of these people roll over $2,500 or more[/tweet_Quote: ] , according to a 2015 financial literacy survey conducted by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.Thankfully, the percentage of cardholders carrying balances has been going down in recent years. That means more families are using credit cards in a way that can improve their bottom line. Earn By Spending If this sounds suspiciously similar to the bargain-hunter who brags about how much she saved by buying items on sale, let me explain.It’s hard to earn any money on your money these days. Even the best savings accounts and CDs out there are only paying a bit more than 1% per year in interest. These super-low interest rates have created a situation where you might actually earn more money on your funds by spending rather than saving them.Doing so is a two-step process. First, only spend what you should. You need to create a budget ( here's one way to do it ) and stick to it. It’s something that only about 40% of U.S. adults currently do, according to the survey mentioned above. Second, whenever you can, pay for things with a credit card that offers rewards. If you don’t have one, check online reviews like these (by my company) to find the one that fits best with your lifestyle.Unfortunately, you can’t use a credit card for many big ticket and recurring items—like taxes or your mortgage (even when you can, the fees would wipe out any benefit to you). But you can usually use credit cards for travel, food, gas, clothes and some smaller recurring expenses like a cable bill or subscription fees.Imagine the average U.S. household, which earns about $67,000 per year according to the latest Consumer Expenditure Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This family could feasibly spend about $24,000, or $2,000 per month, on necessities they can pay for with a credit card. With a 1% cash back card, they’d end up getting $240 back, and that’s tax-free since it’s considered a rebate on purchases you made. A 2%-back card would yield $480. Compare those amounts to what you’re earning on the money you can save.Let’s say you keep about 10% of your annual income, or $6,700, in an emergency fund that earns 1% per year. At the end of the year, you’d have $67, and that’s taxable, leaving you with some smaller portion of it.Of course, if you never spent the money, you’d still have it and it could earn 1% this year, but most people have to spend a certain amount of money each year just to get by. Why not siphon a little bit of that back into your own bank account? Don’t Get Trapped Here’s where people get tripped up: You go about your normal spending in say, April, and then in May, when the bills are due, you lose your job. Or face an unexpected home, car or health bill. Suddenly, you can’t pay off your credit card balance, and that 15% interest rate kicks in. It wipes out your annual rewards in less than a month, and now you’re stuck making minimum payments, and getting charged a lot of interest, until your financial situation improves.One way to guard against this is to know your monthly credit card expenses—and stage the entire payoff amount in an accessible checking or savings account. Keeping it in an emergency fund can save you a lot of financial pain.While some personal finance experts suggest using cash instead of cards, I think that’s unrealistic for many of us in today’s world. How would you buy a plane ticket or place an online order (debit cards have their drawbacks too)? Instead, think of credit cards the way you think about fire. Handled correctly, they can serve some very useful purposes. But if they get out of control, they can burn you.
