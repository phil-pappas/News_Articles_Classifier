Sometimes lenders cite applicants’ ages we have reported cases of fortysomethings being declined as “too old” but more often they refer in a non-specific way to the mortgage being “unaffordable”. \nPerversely, these “unaffordable” deals are often far cheaper than the mortgages the borrowers already quite comfortably pay. Lenders end up discriminating against cautious borrowers who wish to reduce their debts more quickly. \nAkbar de Medici and his wife, Anna Bridgens, want to remortgage their current loan with their lender, Halifax. The high-earning couple want to cut their loan term so that the debt is paid off by the time they retire. Doing this, and moving to one of Halifax’s best two-year fixed rates, would reduce their monthly repayments by £300 a month. \nHalifax has refused their application, saying the couple “can’t afford” the cheaper deal. \nMortgage experts have denounced the decision as “entirely nonsensical”. \n'I've made £500,000 by building a third storey on my home' \n'I have 150 buy-to-let properties: here's how I choose tenants' \nThe pair earn more than £120,000 a year between them, have never missed a payment and have excellent credit ratings. They also have significant cash savings and other assets. \nThe couple suspect as do most commentators that the rejection is more about Halifax’s wish to keep them paying a higher rate. \nTelegraph Money has written extensively about this issue and the Financial Conduct Authority has repeatedly expressed its concern about the way lenders are using new rules, introduced in 2014, as reasons to bar customers from cheaper deals. \nThe Mortgage Market Review, which came into force 18 months ago, required lenders to assess borrowers’ incomes and spending habits in great detail to ensure they can afford a loan, both now and when interest rates rise. \nThe changes were made to end some of the irresponsible lending practices of the past not to make life harder for existing borrowers. The regulator introduced “transitional rules” for those borrowers who simply wanted to remortgage to get a better rate, without borrowing more, but were unable to meet the new affordability requirements. But many lenders are ignoring these provisions. \nThis is clearly the case with Mr de Medici and Mrs Bridgens. \nThe couple, aged 41 and 38 respectively, took out a £500,000 mortgage with Halifax in 2013 and, because they had a small deposit, they took a two-year fix with a high rate of just over 5pc. Their repayments were nearly £2,900 a month. \nThey came to the end of their fixed deal in May, and Halifax switched them on to a variable deal which saw their repayments fall to £2,400 a month. \nKeen to lock in a fixed deal before interest rates rise, they have been trying to remortgage for the past four months. \nThey do not want to borrow more money and sensibly want to reduce the term of their mortgage from 27 years to 25, so that the loan is paid off by the time they retire. \nMr de Medici initially spoke to a Halifax underwriter who said the lender’s best deal would cut their mortgage payments to £2,100, even when the shorter loan term is factored in. \nBut the couple are now being told that they don’t qualify for the lower rate because they don’t meet Halifax’s new affordability criteria. \n“I think my case is almost laughable,” Mr de Medici said. “We have good credit scores, are not looking to borrow extra money and want to reduce the mortgage term so we avoid paying anything into retirement. \n“We have £60,000 in cash savings and our home has gone up in value by over £200,000 since we bought it, according to Halifax’s own conservative estimate. I have been speaking to Halifax two to three times a week for the last four months and still have not managed to find anyone sensible who can see how ridiculous the situation is.” \nHalifax told Telegraph Money it had not technically rejected their application. In a statement it said: “We have not declined Dr de Medici and Dr Bridgen’s application. On receipt of further information to help us understand their future commitments around affordability, we will be able to continue with their application. Our aim is always to do our best for our customers and we have confirmed to them that we will refund the difference in their monthly mortgage payments, if their application is successfully completed. \n“We have now given them £100 as our way of saying sorry when the service they received did not meet their expectations.” \nnicole.blackmore@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:12:54.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
