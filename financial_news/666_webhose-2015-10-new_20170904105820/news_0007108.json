Bezos passes brothers Charles and David Koch, and ranks behind only Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in the U.S.\nBefore Thursday’s surge, Bezos’s fortune had jumped 77 percent in 2015 as investors have cheered profits at Amazon and growth in its cloud segment. The $22 billion year-to-date increase is the most of anyone on the index and more than the combined gains of Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Amazon shares rose 10 percent from the close to $621 at 4:47 p.m. in New York. The increase will make him the fifth-richest person on Earth, up from the No. 20 spot on Jan. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:28:25.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
