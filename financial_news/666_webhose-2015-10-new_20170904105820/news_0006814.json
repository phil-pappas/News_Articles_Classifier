US crude futures fell 43 cents, or about 1%, to $44.17.\nULSD futures in the US and gas oil in London were also down about 1%. Both crude benchmarks have lost about 10% over the past two weeks combined.\nGoldman it would take 50 fewer heating degree days (HDDs) than normal in Europe for storage there to hit tank tops.\nHDDs are measured by the difference between the average temperature outside and the 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) level, which is deemed to be neutral indoors for heating. The lower the reading, the less energy products such as heating oil and natural gas are expected to be required for heating.\n\"While our distillate balances suggest that stocks will fall short of capacity, the margins of error are small and the risks high, leaving risks to current crude oil prices and timespreads as skewed to the downside through next spring,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote.\nInvestments in oil are likely to decline further in 2016 after sliding this year by more than a fifth, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said.\n\"If it comes true, this will be the first time in two decades we will see oil investments declining for two consecutive years and may be an indication for future oil markets,\" Birol said at Singapore International Energy Week.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:28:24.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
