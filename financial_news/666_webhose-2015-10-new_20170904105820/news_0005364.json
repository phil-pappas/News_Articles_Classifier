It sent an engineer from AA Home Emergency Services. He reported that it was not possible to replace the tank (which the insurer was prepared to pay for) without removing part of a stud wall. The engineer suggested that it would be preferable to replace everything with a sealed system, which would remove the need for a cold water tank. Although this would cost £1,200 I am prepared to pay for it myself but expect Saga or the AA to contribute £250 for replacing the old tank. I have spoken to 12 different people between Saga and AA, encountering nothing but smoke and mirrors. All I am asking for is a fair and just settlement but I am not getting it. A principle is at stake here. RO, Surrey Eighteen months ago Saga and the AA separated but Saga still uses the AA’s home emergency service for its policyholders. Saga now conceded that, while the existing cold water tank had not been replaced through the AA home emergency cover, you had saved the insurer money. • Saga fails to pay claim after violent burglary On this occasion it is paying £250 towards the new system. It is also giving £100 compensation to apologise for any inconvenience caused. You say you think that otherwise you would still be chasing shadows. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here dailytelegraphmoney Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:42:42.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
