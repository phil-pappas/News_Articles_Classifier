Fidelity expects the targeted gold delivery threshold of 15 tonnes for this year to be achieved, regardless of the power supply crisis that has disrupted mining activities and spurred profit warnings among big mining firms. The gold deliveries achieved so far are a tiny fraction shy of the 13 899 tonnes delivered in 2014. Buoyed by this development, Fidelity is now even forecasting gold deliveries to exceed the targeted figure, reaching 17 tonnes by year-end. The increase in gold deliveries has been achieved against the backdrop of competitive bullion prices offered to producers of the yellow metal. Government has put in place measures to ensure that gold prices offered by Fidelity are competitive and allow miners, both small-scale and large scale, to remain operational. The new price is pegged at 94 percent of the London Bullion Market Association's daily gold prices. What this has done is to avert smuggling of gold outside the country through a once-thriving black market, which had previously capitalised on poor prices offered by Fidelity for the metal. The 94 percent price is achieved after taking into account the various charges and taxes or levies on gold sellers by Fidelity. Even under situations where mining houses have suffered from tumbling international gold prices, the fact that our prices have been competitive means that the losses incurred by the local miners have been mitigated. This is indeed very encouraging, and if there is a lesson that we can learn from this development, it is that with sound and well-grounded economic policies, it is possible for Zimbabwe's battered economy to turn around. The development vindicates critics who have argued that the country is in its current economic crisis because of bad government policies, which have created a poor environment for businesses to flourish. It is time for government to reflect on this positive story probably one of the few, if not the only one in the past 15 years or so. That the country is in serious distress is not a secret. Unemployment is at over 90 percent, according to unofficial statistics, and company closures have become the norm rather than the exception. While we have witnessed new companies opening, these have been too few to be consequential in the national economy. It is time we learn from our mistakes and start doing the right things to save our economy from an escalating crisis by adopting policies that do not harm but repair our battered economy. The ball is in the government's court.
