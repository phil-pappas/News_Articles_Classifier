BKE tumbled roughly 6.5% following the company’s disappointing September comparable-store sales (comps) performance. Comps for the five-week period ended Oct 3, 2015, decreased 6.7% year over year, following a 3.3% decline registered in August, and also fell short of analysts’ expectations.

Comps for the 35-week period were down 2.8%, while net sales over the same time frame dipped 1.1% to $706.2 million from $714.2 million recorded in the year-ago period.
