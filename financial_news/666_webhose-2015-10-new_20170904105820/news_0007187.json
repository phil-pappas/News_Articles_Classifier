The knock-on effect could harm the broader television industry, including ITV, Britain’s biggest commercial broadcaster fears. \nThe ITV source said: “We have no strong views on whether Channel 4 should be privatised, but we would be concerned if any change in C4’s ownership were to have a negative impact on the independent production sector, which is such an important part of the wider UK creative industries.” \nThe intervention comes as the Government actively considers whether Channel 4 should be privatised. \nThe discussions were confirmed last month when a civil servant was photographed walking into Downing Street with official documents that said ministers would “examine options for extracting greater public value from the Channel 4 Corporation, focusing on privatisation options in particular”. \nThe broadcaster is believed to be worth more than £1bn, although its value would depend on what restrictions and production quotas a private owner would face. \nUnder its current remit, Channel 4 must rely on third-party producers for all its programming. Last year £430m of its total £600m budget went to British independent producers, representing more than the combined spending of ITV and Channel 5. \nITV fears a private owner could seek to reduce that investment, potentially by making its own programmes, in line with global trends in the broadcasting industry. ITV has itself invested heavily in its in-house production unit in recent years, seeking higher profit margins and more predictable income from owning the rights to programmes \nPrivate buyers could look to combine Channel 4 with their existing assets. Discovery, for instance, is now a joint owner of All3Media, formerly Britain’s biggest independent producer, which makes Channel 4 shows including Gogglebox and Embarrassing Bodies. \nChannel 4 declined to comment on ITV’s fears. The Government has not yet consulted other broadcasters on a potential privatisation and has said it is looking at a range of options, including a non-profit mutual structure proposed by Channel 4’s leadership. \nAt a select committee hearing last week, David Abraham, the broadcaster’s chief executive, said: “We think one of the strengths of Channel 4 is that it is symbiotically related to the independent sector in Britain” \nHe has claimed that a private owner would be likely to cut spending on programming by as much as £200m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:41:07.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
