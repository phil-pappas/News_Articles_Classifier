Securing Credit \nThe relatively few lending cuts also underscore the steps taken by energy companies to keep their credit lines secure. \nThe decision by many of these firms to snap up hedges in June during a brief price rally has made lending to them far less risky, while a sale of non-core assets and deep cuts to costs have reassured lenders. \nAlso, after nearly a decade of uninterrupted growth, the energy sector may be short of workout bankers - who deal with troubled loans and negotiate with borrowers - helping energy companies hold on to their loans longer, said Robert Gray, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown LLP. \n\"They all left, so it's partially a management issue.\" \nSeveral companies have been able to hold their oil and gas reserves steady because they are mostly completing existing wells rather than drilling new ones. \n(Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Sneha Banerjee and Anet Josline Pinto; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Anil D'Silva)   SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:12:57.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
