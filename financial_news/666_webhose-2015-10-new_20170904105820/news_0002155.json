The group has more than 700 franchise offices and 8000 people across Australia and in New Zealand, the Pacific and Asia, along with international partnerships. Beyond the ubiquitous real estate shops the group has a commercial real estate franchise network and, in LJ Hooker Home Loans, a significant mortgage broking operation.\nInterestingly, fund managers have been asked to compare LJ Hooker to Realogy Franchise Group, the $US5.5 billion parent company of CENTURY 21, ERA, Coldwell Banker, and Sotheby's International Realty which trades on a forward profit multiple of about 26 times.\nLJ Hooker's cash call comes after rival, McGrath Estate Agents, agreed to buy its largest franchisee, the 10 Sydney offices controlled by Shane Smollen. Correctly structured, the purchase should boost McGrath's income, from a fixed franchise fee to a much more substantial company income.\nâ€‹", "external_links": ["http://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=cCUjAS_ECr5iWLacwqm_6l&u=financialreview"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:04:44.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
