John White could not immediately be reached for comment.\nDoty is eligible for another four-year term but the SEC has also been considering two replacements, current PCAOB board member Lewis Ferguson and William Duhnke, Republican staff director and general counsel for the Senate Banking Committee.\nThursday's letter said John White's position on the PCAOB's standing advisory group has helped his role as a lawyer with Cravath, where he heads the corporate governance and board advisory practice. He was director of the SEC's division of corporation finance from 2006 to 2008, prior to his wife's appointment as commissioner in 2013.\nMembers of the PCAOB advisory group are not paid, but the letter said the position could affect the Whites' family income because Cravath benefits from access to the audit regulator. The firm referred to John White's PCAOB position in its marketing materials, and its clients could include businesses that want Doty pushed aside, the letter said.\nA spokesman for Cravath could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the PCAOB declined comment.
