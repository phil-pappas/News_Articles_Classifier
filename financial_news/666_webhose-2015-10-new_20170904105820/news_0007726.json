Marketing experts say Ms. Winfrey is in a league of her own when it comes to celebrity endorsements and investors are hoping she can work her magic on Weight Watchers, which has been struggling to recruit new members in recent years.\nMs. Winfrey’s endorsement of the Weight Watchers’ brand “in one swoosh brings the brand out of the woods,” said Allen Adamson, a branding expert and former chairman, North America of WPP WPPGY 0.53 % ’s Landor Associates. “It is a brand that has been around for a long time in a category that’s enamored with the new.” Ms. Winfrey has been open about her struggles with weight loss in the past, giving her endorsement of Weight Watchers even more heft, Mr. Adamson said.\nMs. Winfrey is among the most powerful celebrities for influencing consumers’ purchase behavior, according to data from the Marketing Arm, an Omnicom Group OMC 0.21 % -owned firm that ranks celebrity perception based on online polls. Ms. Winfrey ranks No. 4 out of 3,786 celebrities for influence, behind Kate Middleton, Bill Gates and Taylor Swift, the Marketing Arm’s data shows.\n“No brand is going to do something with a celebrity if their bottom line isn’t impacted in a certain way,” said Matt Delzell, managing director of the Marketing Arm’s celebrity talent acquisition group. “She’s one of the very few that drives the needle for brands.”\nOn top of that, Ms. Winfrey has extensive reach. According to the Marketing Arm, more than 97% of consumers recognize Ms. Winfrey. She also ranks No. 18 among celebrities for “endorsement,” a measure of celebrities’ credibility.\nWeight Watchers’ share price more than doubled on Monday following the announcement of Ms. Winfrey’s deal with Weight Watchers.\n“I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution,” Ms. Winfrey said in a statement.\nWeight Watchers in recent years has lost ground to new apps and devices that help consumers count calories and has had difficulty gaining traction among younger consumers who prefer healthy eating and regular exercise to weight-loss programs. According to data from Y&R’s BrandAsset Valuator, which measures consumer perception of brands, Weight Watchers’ brand strength has slipped from a 54th percentile ranking in 2010 to a 21st percentile ranking in 2015. Y&R is a division of WPP.\nOne question that remains is whether Ms. Winfrey’s star power will help Weight Watchers win over millennials.\n“To some extent, what’s most important is to get the brand back on the radar,” Mr. Adamson said, noting that Ms. Winfrey’s appeal is strongest among women over the age of 40 in non-urban markets. “If they can win Oprah’s core following that would be a good situation and then tomorrow they can figure out how to go for younger consumers.”\nAs part of her investment with Weight Watchers, Ms. Winfrey will join the company’s board and appear in its advertising. In recent years, Weight Watchers has shifted its advertising away from celebrity spokespeople – the brand has previously worked with singers Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Hudson— to focus more on making healthy everyday choices.\nWeight Watchers has switched up its agencies a fair amount lately. Last week, Weight Watchers “engaged Havas Worldwide in the U.S. to develop work for a winter 2016 advertising campaign aimed at driving member recruitment and bringing to life our new program innovation,” Maurice Herrera, the company’s SVP of Marketing said in a statement. Weight Watchers ended its relationship with Wieden+Kennedy, which worked on the company’s “Help with the Hard Part” campaign and created the company’s first-ever Super Bowl spot , earlier this year. Prior to Wieden+Kennedy, Weight Watchers worked with McCann for seven years.\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:23:25.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
