Josh Robenstone It is backed by taxi networks in Australia – including Yellow Cabs, Silver Top Taxi Service, Black and White Cabs, Suburban Taxis – and listed group Cabcharge, which owns competing taxi networks. Together they own most of the taxi networks in Australia.\nOther shareholders include US-based Taxi Services Inc. and Minneapolis and Mobile Tracking and Data, which provides the taxi dispatch booking system for the Cabcharge networks.\nOn May 26, the networks asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to grant an interim authorisation to the app, which will allow people to book a taxi from any of the affiliated networks. The joint venture also plans to add more networks.\nMr Simms said if it did it would \"guarantee that from its launch, the ihail app would have a larger fleet of taxis, in a broader range of locations, than any existing taxi booking apps. Depending on the rate of take up of the ihail app amongst other taxi networks, it could potentially grow to include all taxi networks in any area\".\n He told the Financial Review the ACCC understands the inroads Uber, goCatch and Ingogo, among others, are making into Cabcharge and the network's market share. But he said combined this still only amounts to 10 to 15 per cent.\n\"Do we want the two main taxi networks to combine? As apps become more important [in taxi bookings], it could be that we have blessed the two main operators getting together,\" he said.\n\"The growth in [new] apps is being driven by competition to attract drivers and customers. ihail will achieve a potentially dominant position from launch – not through competition, but because of the larger fleet of taxis its ownership structure delivers.\"\nHe said ihail would also only use the Cabcharge payment system, which effectively reversed a recent agreement the ACCC approved to allow competitors to process Cabcharge cards .\n\"Here we have a system where what we have achieved in a taxi cab gets locked out of this arrangement with ihail,\" he said.\n\"Cabcharge have had an entrenched position for a long time. We took them to court five years ago, and we were just about to take them to court again. Now we find this comes along.\"\nThe draft decision is open to consultation now, with a final decision likely at the end of November. It would be a major a blow to Cabcharge in its fight against Uber and other new rivals if approved. But Cabcharge has said ihail is separate to the new national booking app it is developing that will be offered alongside its network owners' state based apps.\nLike existing new apps, including Uber, goCatch and Ingogo, passengers would pay for the fare via the app on Cabcharge's payment network, with no money exchanged with the taxi driver.\nihail would also allow passengers to pay an extra amount to encourage taxi drivers to pick up their fare first. But the ACCC said this could disadvantage poorer people\ngoCatch co-cheif Ned Moorfield said the ACCC had made the right decision. \"The difference between them and us is that ihail is grouping networks together and they can have quite a bit of influence over their taxi operators,\" he said.\n\"They could say to the operators that your drivers can't use any other apps.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/accc-confirms-cabcharge-agrees-terms-for-rivals-access-20150629-gi0jed.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:08:00.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
