James Davies by Jeremy Chunn ​The model portfolios picked apart in this dark corner of the personal finance landscape usually include every asset class: shares, fixed income, cash and property … and every so often someone slips in a toll booth in Kansas or a computerised trading system run from an empty office in Tobago.\nThis week, however, our attention is drawn to listed income securities. Most of us own them but very few can claim to know them inside out. Here's what a professional has to say about them.\nJBWere executive director of fixed income strategy Laurie Conheady runs a portfolio (offered as a separately managed account) which can include government and corporate bonds, hybrids, preference shares, convertible bonds and fixed income ETFs, but he's currently focused on preference shares (45 per cent allocation), subordinated corporate bonds (30 per cent) and hybrids (25 per cent).\nChasing 'appropriate yield' \"One of things we don't do here is chase yield,\" Conheady says. \"We chase appropriate yield; you have to be compensated for the risk you take on.\"\nThe rules are simple: stick to investment-grade issuers and investment-grade issues.\nHybrids from Origin, AGL and Tabcorp are excluded on those grounds because the instruments, not the issuers, are sub-investment grade, he says. \"We are dealing with the higher quality end of the market.\"\nBanks make up 55 per cent of the portfolio and insurance companies the remainder.\n Bank hybrids are notoriously hard to compare as APRA has changed the rules in line with Basel II and III regulatory changes, he says. Different call dates, maturities, coupons, trading margins – no two issues are alike, and some convert to equity if the borrower's tier one capital falls below a certain level. \"The terms are evolving,\" says Conheady, who emphasises he's comfortable with the credit quality of the banks and isn't expecting any of these triggers to be exercised.\n\"But if the instruments are different and there are differences in the risk profile they have to be reflected in the return that you get,\" he says. \"We're very mindful of not treating them all the same.\"\nChanging styles Recent hybrids are more equity-like than older ones. Conheady hasn't agreed to reveal exactly what investments are inside the portfolio but he will say there is a smaller weighting to the newer, Basel III-compliant variety.\nWhile the banks' risk profiles have been enhanced by issuance of new hybrids, you'd be forgiven for thinking there was something wrong as prices have softened. \"It's quite an interesting scenario,\" he says. \"The banks are in a better capital position now than they were six months ago, and yet the hybrids which from a credit perspective benefit from that have been sold off in recent times.\"\nWhy have they been sold off? Even Conheady can't say. Retail investors are happy in the hybrid space, perhaps unawares of all the risks, but institutions have been attracted by yields which stick out against government and corporate bonds. \"To be picking up a major bank hybrid that's yielding 6.5 to 7 per cent, it's very attractive when you see CBA coming to the wholesale market [two weeks ago] with 3-year senior debt paying less than 3 per cent.\"\nThe market has changed quickly. Commonwealth Bank preference share CBAPD launched in October 2014 with a margin of 2.8 percentage points over the 90-day rate; in September, Westpac launched WBCPF at 4 percentage point margin. There have been billions in new issuance, Conheady says, including Bendigo, Challenger and Macquarie. \"For the market to be able to absorb that, some investors were selling down expensive instruments to buy them and it just snowballed.\"\nInvestors who have the patience to wait for hybrids to be sold off may be able to pick up some value. Longer dated instruments, with call dates around 2021 to 2023, are trading well below par. Anything shorter dated is trading closer to face value, as they are generally older instruments and come with modest risk.\n﻿ Hidden risks There will always be risk with hybrids, and it can be well-hidden. \"I would be very surprised if retail investors sat down and read the 120-page PDS. The disclosure is there, but I would argue the understanding of the risk probably isn't.\"\nConheady stresses the portfolio he manages is a subset of a wider fixed income exposure. \"Our view of the world is hybrids should not dominate fixed income portfolios,\" he says, which would send a chill up the spines of a few self-managed super fund trustees around the country.\n\"The concern we would have is if someone looked at the listed space … and said that's my defensive part of a portfolio. It's not. It's just one step removed from equity. This is not a substitute for your total fixed income exposure.\"\nThe JBWere listed fixed income SMA portfolio returned 5 per cent for the 12 months to September 30; over three years, 6.55 per cent per annum.
