She tried transferring a large sum of cash from one of her accounts to another but the funds didn’t show up.\n“I transposed the last two digits of the bank account and I panicked,’’ she says.\n“The account details I entered matched someone else’s account so it was double bad luck.\n“I had visions of the recipient taking the money to the casino and having a good night.”\nCompleting the online transaction late at night, it wasn’t until a few days later that Tarrant realised the money failed to arrive in her other account.\n“I had to contact the bank that I was sending the money from to try and get it back,’’ she says.\n“I was really lucky, the bank helped speed it all up and I got the money back in about three or four days, but I would always say don’t try and do these things when you’re dead tired in the middle of the night.”\nME’s service excellence executive Craig Ralston says every month they have dozens of cases of customers making mistakes when moving money online and he urges them to act quickly if a mistake is made.\n“Time is critical, the sooner you are able to contact your bank the sooner they are able to initiate that investigation process,’’ he says.\nBut Ralston says if the account or biller details you entered are wrong and it hasn’t been sent to a valid account then it’s likely your funds will simply bounce back.\n“You don’t necessarily need to have the foresight that you have got fat finger syndrome and you got it wrong, the money is just going to bounce,’’ he says.\nBut it can take several days to scale your money back or, in some cases, weeks so enter those digits carefully.\nSAFE ONLINE BANKING\n— Take care when entering the digits online.\n— Add a list of payees or billers into your online banking list of recipients so you don’t have to enter their details each time.\n— Double check the digits before completing the transaction.\n— Always write down your receipt numbers. This will help down the track if something goes wrong.\n— If you have made a mistake, contact your own bank immediately to report the error.\n— Work with the bank to get the money bank.\n@sophieelsworth\n Have you got fat finger syndrome?
