Netflix plans to create four 90-minute movies as opposed to a 10-episode season, according to the Hollywood Reporter . The show, starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, aired for seven seasons, but show-creator Amy Sherman-Palladino was not on board for the final season due to a contract dispute. Gilmore Girls followed the life of single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Graham), her daughter Rory (Bledel) and diner owner Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) living in fictional Stars Hollow, Conn. The revival would allow Sherman-Palladino to end the series the way she always wanted to, media reports say. Fans probably won't see all of the show's popular characters, however. Melissa McCarthy, who played Sookie St. James on the show, is not expected to be in the revival, the Hollywood Reporter said. McCarthy's career has exploded since the show. Gilmore Girls joins a handful of other shows that went off the air only to be revived by Netflix or, increasingly, network TV. Over the years, more than a few fan-favorite shows have gotten reboots, including Leave It To Beaver , Dallas, Hawaii Five-O , Netflix's Arrested Development and The Killing .For the fall 2015 TV season, NBC revived its four-season show Heroes with Heroes Reborn , which premiered on September 24. The 13-episode season picked up a year after a terrorist attack and features a whole new crop of characters with extraordinary abilities who are being blamed for the attack. Many of the characters are now \"in hiding or on the run from those with nefarious motives,\" as NBC describes it.
