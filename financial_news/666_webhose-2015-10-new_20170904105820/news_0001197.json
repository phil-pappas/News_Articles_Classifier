Anne Vladeck, a lawyer for the traders, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nBarclays agreed in June 2012 to pay roughly $453 million of fines in settlements with U.S. and U.K. regulators, and admitted to artificially depressing Libor submissions from August 2007 to January 2009. \nThe case is Pabon et al v. Barclays Bank Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-07897.
