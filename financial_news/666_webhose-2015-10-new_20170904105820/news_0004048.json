To kick it off, here is a glimpse into how I spend my money. The last 10 things I bought: Wednesday 1. Toastmasters annual dues: $123.00 Professional development is important! At Toastmasters, I learn to give and receive something rare in this world — honest, constructive feedback! For $10 a month (and a small service fee), that’s certainly a bargain. Thursday 2. Reload my parking card: $20 To reduce costs (since I have a 40-minute commute to downtown Salt Lake City), I use my employer’s pre-tax transportation benefit: a monthly bus pass and a re-loadable daily parking pass. I take the bus about three days a week. This reduces my expenses for gas, wear and tear on the vehicle, and parking. As an added benefit, I use the commute time to write my blog and read what is going on in the world instead of needing to keep my eyes on the road.I figure I save a minimum of $200 a month over a daily commute driving my car. 3. Fuel: $35 I filled up the tank of my 2008 Subaru Outback, which only has 85,000 miles on it. By riding the bus more often, I can delay another car purchase as long as possible and make the fuel last. 4. Spicy chicken sandwich, coleslaw and an iced tea: $11.27 My coworkers were shocked to see me eating fast food, since I usually pack a healthy lunch that often includes a huge spinach salad. Every once in a while, fast food is fine, but I figure I easily save $160 a month by bringing my own food and snacks to work.The sandwich was really good. Friday 5. T-shirt: $17.99 When I saw the “Suck it up, Buttercup” tank top my coworker was ordering online, I asked her to order one for me, too, and gave her a $20 bill. Some days when I don’t want to hit the gym, I just need to suck it up and go.It was obviously an impulse buy, but I can’t wait to wear it! 6. Long black tunic sweater with gold zippers: $39.99 My husband called and asked where I was Friday night after work, and I said, “I’m “Maxxing.” I stopped at a discount retailer to see if they had any fashion gems. I found one, bought it and absolutely love it.I budget a specific amount each month for shopping, and my mantra is to only buy things I absolutely love and will wear over and over again. 7. Athletic wear: $53.25 Years ago, I learned something about myself. When I want to change my behavior, I respond well to rewards. This month, I set up a weight-lifting goal. After turning 50, weight-bearing exercises are vital to gain and keep muscle tone, as well as to keep bones strong.To accomplish this goal, I need to go to the gym during my lunch hour a few times a week, but it's often tough to make myself do it. Since I already get up at 5 a.m., getting up earlier isn’t really possible.Though I know my way around the gym, the workout involves standing near buff, sweaty guys lifting barbells and grunting in the mirror (which can be a little intimidating). So to get myself to the gym, I gave myself a $50 fashion reward to be redeemed at the end of the month.I wasted no time. After hitting my goal for September, I purchased a sweatshirt, some capris, and a tank top from my favorite online athletic wear shop. They threw in a year-long subscription to a cooking magazine. Pretty good value for $53, I think! Saturday 8. Cabela's credit card bill: $100 My husband and I paid off our new “trail cam.” Since we live in the country, we find deer grazing in front of our house every night. From our deck, looking through our binoculars, we can often see moose eating leaves by the river.We purchased an infrared camera that responds to movement and at night discreetly takes photos of the wildlife (without blinding them with a flash). Every couple of days we move the camera and switch out the memory card (and lock it up so it doesn't get stolen).We've captured photos of bucks and does, a moose and even a spotted skunk. (Who knew there was such as thing as a spotted skunk?) 9. Flute payment: $28.85 I recently rekindled an old hobby and began playing the flute with the choir on Sunday mornings at mass in Park City. Since I couldn’t hit the high notes with my more advanced flute, I bought a new flute on a rent-to-own basis with zero interest.You have to hit the high notes when you play the flute, you know? Sunday 10. Farmer’s market: $8.50 My husband and I purchased tomatoes, apples, pears and fresh corn. Yum. Favorite purchase? The athletic wear, because it reminds me that I set a goal and accomplished it. Even though I was doing my military press sets with 8-pound weights next to a guy pressing 50 pounds, I was there, in the gym, getting it done. Any regrets? None! I can see from this exercise that I am not a frivolous spender, and when I do spend, it’s planned and on things that add value to my life. Want to let FORBES into your wallet?
