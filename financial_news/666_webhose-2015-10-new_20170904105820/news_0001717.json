Their legal team will get nearly $1.5 million, which the lawyers said was a small fraction of what they would be due if they billed for the hours they worked on the case.\nA Publicis representative on Wednesday said the company was pleased to resolve the case, and noted that the settlement does not require changes to any company policies.\n\"We are confident that our workplace policies and practices are lawful, correct, and non-discriminatory,\" she said.\nGender discrimination lawsuits have become increasingly common in the United States over the last several years, with a range of companies including Novartis and Bank of America Corp agreeing to multimillion-dollar settlements. Many other companies are currently facing such claims, including technology giants Twitter Inc and Microsoft Corp.\nThe Publicis lawsuit, which originally sought $100 million, was filed by Monique da Silva Moore, who was global healthcare director in the Boston office of the company's public relations division, MSLGroup.\nThe lawsuit says that upon her return from a four-month maternity leave in 2010, Da Silva Moore was ordered to move immediately to New York without reimbursement for relocation expenses, forcing her to accept termination.\nAt least two other women who returned from maternity leave were also terminated while the company promoted and hired men at a disproportionately high rate, the lawsuit claimed.\nThe case is Monique Da Silva Moore v Publicis Groupe, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-1279.
