Photo: istock\nFew things annoy customers more than one part of an organisation not talking to another because of legacy technology systems or terrible internal communication .\nTake my recent experience. Two years ago I updated address details with a bank. A year later a personal bank card expired and the replacement was sent to the old address. Frustratingly, the customer records systems for the bank's personal and credit card divisions do not talk to each other.\nThis is not just a big-company issue with different divisions not talking to each other or being hurt by legacy technology systems.\nTony Featherstone When another card expired this month, the replacement was sent to the old address (all cards since cancelled). Apparently, the bank's personal and business-banking divisions use different systems to record customer details.\nThe bank sent electronic statements to the correct business email address, but couldn't manage to update the postal address, despite my request to update the address for all accounts and bank assurances the problem would be fixed.\nAdvertisement At another bank, a joint account had one statement going to the old address and another to the new address. It required both account holders separately updating their address details, which seemed like overkill when both can access the account.\nThat's better than a former colleague who was denied a personal loan and the next day received an offer from the bank's credit-card division to increase the borrowing limit. Or the elderly person who informed a large corporate that their partner had died, but the deceased still received mail from another part of the organisation that never got the memo.\nBanks talk about the potential of \"big data\" to transform customer relationships, yet some can't even update an address in one go, for multiple personal and business accounts. Or their call centre cannot change an address without transferring customers to another division and putting them on hold again.\nHow much money do companies waste each year by sending mail to the wrong address because of poor internal systems?\nWhat's your view?\nHave you dealt with organisations that manage your information poorly?\nHave you wasted time contacting different parts of an organisation because their systems do not talk to each other?\nHave you received offers from different parts of the organisation that make no sense, because their divisions do not communicate?\nWhy are so many companies hopeless at managing customer information?\nYes, I know you can update address details online at banks. But that assumes you know which addresses different parts of the bank are using for your account. The average consumer would, understandably, think that updating their address details once is sufficient.\nI sure the bank would have excuses about information security and the like, but even the call-centre operator complained that its internal customer systems are cumbersome and apologised for passing the call to another division.\nAlthough it sounds trivial, poor management of customer addresses can be a huge cost for business. They lose contact with valued customers, over-communicate to them because nobody controls the customer database, or torture them with unnecessary admin. As people change address more often, particularly renters, the problem will surely worsen.\nThis is not just a big-company issue with different divisions not talking to each other or being hurt by legacy technology systems. Banks, at least, have higher customer switching costs because it is harder to close and open accounts. Small-business customers usually find it easier to switch suppliers if service disappoints.\nHere are some considerations for small enterprise on customer information:\nUnderstand the importance of information management. In this digital age, the greatest asset and potential liability for many organisations is information. It needs to be stored, maintained and protected more efficiently than ever. It's not just about marketing your product; the legal, financial and reputational risk of lost data has never been greater.\nEnsure you have appropriate, modern customer relationship management software that enables different parts of the business to deal with the same customer and better serve them. It's money well spent: their details are too important to leave on a spreadsheet or antiquated system.\nHave clear responsibility for ownership and maintenance of customer records within the organisation. Somebody has to \"own\" the data as part of their role. Ensure there is appropriate storage, back-up, access and governance of this data.\nHave processes to audit, update or delete old data. It could be as simple as ensuring customer representatives check address details when speaking with a client who has not contacted the firm for some time.\nHave systems to deal with lost or returned mail. It's amazing how much corporate mail keeps being sent to the wrong address because companies do not make an effort to track down lost customers. Often, all it takes is a phone call.\nHave a clear plan for customer communication. Ensure the customer database is not \"overworked\" by different parts of the organisation that want to communicate with it, to boost their flagging sales, or that inappropriate or poorly timed offers are sent.\nHaving multiple addresses for one client may seem a small problem in the scheme of information management. But if a bank that spends millions each year on technology cannot get it right, it suggests the problem is more widespread than realised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:17:07.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
