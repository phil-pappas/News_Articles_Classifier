These at-risk children have a history of coming to school hungry and lack the means to purchase their own food. Cy-Hope assists these children by gifting them with backpacks that contain nutritious, healthy food that will sustain them through the day as well as into the evenings and over weekends and holidays.\n“Feeding our children should always be our number one priority, and Cy-Hope deserves the support of everyone in our community,” says Chris Bello, owner and manager of Bello Insurance Agency. “We’re proud to be working with Cy-Hope, and we’re going to do everything we can to ensure that they are able to continue feeding hungry children in our community.”\nBello and his team are reaching out to friends, family, neighbors, and clients alike in an effort to educate community members on the importance of the Cy-Hope organization, as well as collecting donations that will be used to further the Cy-Hope mission. In addition, the Bello team is constructing an online social media portal they predict will draw in support from all across Houston and the surrounding areas.\nBello Insurance has also launched an ongoing community involvement campaign they refer to as “Agents of Change,” and plans to assist a new local charity every 30-60 days for the foreseeable future.\nReaders who are interested is assisting the Bello Insurance Agency as they advocate and gather funds that will be used to feed hungry children in Houston are encouraged to visit the Bello Agency website and make a direct donation to the effort from this page: http://www.belloinsuranceagency.com/Fighting-Childhood-Hunger-in-the-Community_21_community_cause .
