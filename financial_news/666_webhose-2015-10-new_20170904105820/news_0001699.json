The views expressed are their own. \nLONDON, Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 15 (Reuters) - Only a few weeks ago he was the butt of much EU criticism over his authoritarian behaviour. Now (Frankfurt: 11N.F - news ) Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan is being courted assiduously by the bloc's leaders as an essential part of the solution to the migrant crisis. Tonight's EU summit will review plans under which it is hoped Turkey will cooperate to stem the flow of refugees west from its territory; in return Ankara will want easier visa access to the EU, more aid and a new push on its EU membership bid. Significantly, Germany's Angela Merkel will be heading to Turkey for talks this weekend. \nDon't expect much progress on talks over Britain's in-out EU membership question today. Even Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker acknowledged on the eve of the summit that technical talks on the sort of reforms Britain wants have moved little. The real debate is expected to start after Poland's Oct 25 election, in which the eurosceptic Law and Justice party is heading polls. \nFrom Stockholm to Lisbon, governments are seeing their parliamentary majority whittled away or outright destroyed by the rise of small, often extreme parties. Luckily for them, the warm embrace of mass ECB bond-buying means the ensuing political uncertainty is not being punished by markets -- witness the well-bought Portuguese debt auction yesterday. But the policy implications are no less tangible, with key legislation being postponed or put on the backburner -- not great at a time when the region needs to convince investors to help recovery. \nToday is the deadline for Iran to answer questions and hand over materials necessary for IAEA investigation of past nuclear activities. The expectation -- being watched closely in the oil markets -- is that the IAEA will say Tehran has provided it with what it needs to complete its assessment of whether those activities were related to a nuclear weapons programme. \nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will present a tax-cutting 2016 budget which pushes EU fiscal rules to the limit. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is likely to be more popular with voters than with the European Commission. \nMARKETS (0645 GMT) \nIt seems like everyone is \"learning in real time\", as the ECB's Vitor Constancio said earlier, and no one is terribly confident when or what the next policy steps will be. The incoming macroeconomic data, including yesterday's US retail sales and most likely the next wave of Chinese numbers this coming Monday, is now so disappointing that markets have pushed Fed rate hike expectations into the second half of next year. Whether that's an accurate forecast or not, it's having a easing effect on world asset prices by pushing the dollar and US Treasury yields sharply lower. Ten-year US yields plumbed back below 2 percent yesterday and even though they have firmed up a bit this morning, the dollar index has retreated to its lowest since mid-August. Euro/dollar continues to push higher and is now testing $1.15 -- moves which will likely bring ECB doves back out to play as the central bank prepares to meet in Malta next week. But for all the easier monetary horizon and hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing have given markets a lift, there's a terribly uncomfortable feeling about the limits of that stimulus if both developed and emerging economies are about to roll over in tandem next year. The 10-percent Wal-Mart plunge on its profit warning yesterday shows not all is right in corporate America as the earnings seasons there cranks up. Asia bourses caught a bid from the easier Fed view and dollar, however. Shanghai was up about 2 percent and the rest of the region up about 1+ percent. Europe is called higher in the slipstream. Just like Britain this week, US CPI later is likely to show annual inflation back in negative territory. Citi and Goldman are on the earnings slate. \nEmerging assets also have got a shot in the arm from the doubts over the Fed rate decision, with stocks snapping a two-day losing streak to gain 1.7 pct; China mainland shares chalk up gains of around 2 percent. Currencies are also advancing, with the Indonesian rupiah hitting a four-month high, the rand at a four-week-high, the lira at a strongest since last Friday while the rouble gains almost 1 percent. Korean won is also higher after the central bank gave a cautiously optimistic view of the economy while keeping rates on hold as expected at 1.5 pct. Kazakh tenge at its weakest in a month, down 0.25 pct, after the central bank said it will sell $3 bln from its oil fund on FX market by end-October. Currencies across CEE are treading water against the euro. \nEVENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:42:20.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
