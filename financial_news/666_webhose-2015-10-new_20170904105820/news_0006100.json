BMJ (British Medical Journal) reports that scientific fraud is rampant and nothing has changed lately to curb it. The respected journal was reporting on the big fraud by a drug major in the United Kingdom, having tentacles in the United States also, about the dangerous side-effects of one of their top selling anti-depressants—Paroxetine—which was known to them, right from day one. That drug may have killed millions by now; but the drug company has been fined a pittance—of $3 billion—while it has made 10 times more profit by selling that drug for years. The argument against ordering closure of the company is that the drug industry will suffer and that will adversely affect the economy. Do I understand that human life is of no consequence compared to corporate profits? Do governments exist to protect their interests at the cost of millions of lives? What sort of message are we sending out to the world? Make money—big money—and you can get away with mass murder! Statins: New Dangers Latest research has thrown fresh light on this darling of Big Pharma and their agents in the guise of doctors. Statins are known to accelerate ageing and damage the DNA and, possibly, shorten the length of the telomeres at both ends of the chromosomes. They, of course, damage the muscle, encourage diabetes in normal human beings to the extent of 10%-47% per year and affect mental functions. Still, friends in my profession refuse to believe that they are not good drugs for human use. Is Schumann Resonance Changing? The Schumann resonance (SR) is the electromagnetic energy encircling this earth derived from the sun’s energy circle. This affects human magnetic energy also—along with that of the earth. This was described to be around 7.8 hertz (beats per second) or so by Indian sages of yore which was reconfirmed by science recently. This is what gives us energy for all our activities. This also affects brain activity by controlling the brain waves. Lately, Russian receiving stations have been receiving mixed signals of the Schuman resonance frequency going up and also having frequent fluctuations. This is good and bad news. This change will make our cognitive functions better and we will be able to think better; but, at the same time, it might make us jittery and depressed. However, the best part of the whole exercise is that this change might make us wiser about our past and future happenings! Aspirin and Cancer Anew study from the Netherlands claims that aspirin can reduce deaths due to many cancers especially the GI (gastro-intestinal) tract cancers. This is too premature a study and cannot be solely relied on; but one can keep track of many such small studies coming out in the near future. “The study included 13,715 patients who received a GI cancer diagnosis between 1998 and 2011. They were followed up for a median of 48.6 months. Of these patients, 42.8% had colon cancer, 25.4% had rectal cancer and 10.2% had cancer of the oesophagus. To determine how aspirin use after a GI cancer diagnosis impacted the overall survival of these patients, the researchers linked patient data with drug dispensing information from the PHARMO Institute in Utrecht, the Netherlands. In this study we analysed each separate prescription per patient, and therefore we were able to achieve a more exact estimate of the effect of aspirin on cancer survival,” notes Dr Martine Frouws. Usually, such studies are funded by drug companies. Researchers have to deliver positive results when they claim large sums of money as research grants. Has science become a money-spinner? Researchers help drug companies with positive studies and governments help them by condoning dangerous drugs from being released into the market with prior knowledge of their side-effects which are blinded from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). The poor patient is at the receiving end. More in Moneylife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:28:15.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
