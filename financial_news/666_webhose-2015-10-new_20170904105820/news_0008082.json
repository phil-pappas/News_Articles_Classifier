Is it OK to pay the super back in this financial year?\nA: This can be potentially serious but it's also quite common, so a cautious and proactive approach will be required. For the purposes of clarity, I assume you mean that you've used the funds from your SMSF for personal expenses, so let's start at the top.\nSection 62 of the SIS Act (Superannuation Industry Supervision Act) states the sole purpose of a super fund is to provide benefits for retirement planning purposes, or to their beneficiaries in the event that a member dies before retirement. A test for contravening the sole purpose test is if you have personally received a benefit from the super fund prior to retirement. This certainly seems to be the case in your situation.\nThis is what \"could\" happen. Your auditor will need to \"tick the box\" to illustrate that a contravention has taken place in the annual auditor's report. As the ATO is alerted to the contravention via the auditors report, if it decides to investigate your situation (under a worst-case scenario), you could be fined up to $10,200 (paid personally, not by your fund), lose half of your assets in the super fund and potentially be disqualified as a trustee. I suggest you watch the sole purpose test video on the ATO website ( www.ato.gov.au .\nMy suggestion is as follows: repay the funds as soon as possible, ideally in the same financial year so the ATO can see that a \"mistake has been made\" and that it has been rectified immediately. This way when the auditor notes that a contravention has taken place, the ATO can see it has been rectified. It will then be up to the discretion of the ATO to pursue it. I'd definitely talk to your auditor or super und administrator (possibly your accountant) to smooth out this process and be as forthcoming as needed, possibly with an agreement letter stating that you acknowledge the contravention and that it has been fixed.\nQ: My wife and I have an SMSF, my portion (57 per cent) is in pension phase and my wife's (43 per cent) in accumulation. We are considering rolling hers over to pension phase as she's over 60. Is it better to do this at the beginning of the financial year? If it's done partway through the financial year, will her portion be taxed for the time that it's in accumulation phase, and how would that be calculated?\nA: In theory and my professional opinion, pensions and subsequent tax effects should be worked out pro-rata for the time spent in accumulation phase versus that time spent in pension phase.\n In practice, however, some accountants may suggest simply having the pension start at the start of the financial year as no paperwork has been done yet, given the financial year started just four months ago.\nIt makes sense to start the pension at 60 because that's when income from pensions becomes tax-free. But many retirees should do the calculations on what their actual tax would be under the age of 60 rather than just following their accountant's opinion as many will pay little or no tax, especially if they're not working. You can also draw $195,000 of your taxable portion from your fund under the age of 60 if you need cash.\nRemember there's also a 15 per cent rebate on the taxable portion of your super pension income for those under 60, often negating the reason to wait until age 60. Also note that earnings inside the fund are tax-free in pension mode and there's no capital gains tax so there may be added benefits to starting a pension under 60.\nSome accountants or advisors are just a little lazy and it's worth asking for a forecast pension tax calculation for those under 60 and retired so you know all the facts. Get them to include some rough calculations on assumptions such as income earnings at 4.5 per cent on shares, 2.8 per cent on cash and 2.5 per cent on property (after expenses) including franking credits on shares and potential capital gains of 4 per cent or so.\nQ: In one of last week's answers , I think you may be incorrect as an ATO refund doesn't have to go to member balances. My wife and I are both in pension mode and our SMSF has a reserve which will eventually make an anti-detriment payment. Each year we minute the decision that any ATO refund is to go to the reserve. This has been approved by our external specialist superannuation auditors.\nA: This is potentially true and I can assure you that you are in a vast minority if you are undertaking a strategy like this. Most readers won't understand anit-detriment or reserving so I'll keep those under wraps for future comments. As you would imagine, we need to address the majority in this column but your comments and opinion are greatly respected and acknowledged.\nFinancial planner Sam Henderson is chief executive of Henderson Maxwell.
