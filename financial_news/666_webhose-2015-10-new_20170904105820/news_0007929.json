Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd University of Newcastle engineer Graeme Jameson has won the 2015 Prime Minister's Prize for Innovation for his mineral processing technology which is estimated to have saved the coal industry $36 billion.\nAnnounced Wednesday in Canberra by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who has made innovation a centrepiece of his new government, the $250,000 prize recognises Professor Jameson for his invention of the Jameson cell which, since the 1980s, has been used to improve the extraction rate of minerals from slurry during processing.\nMr Turnbull also announced the other major winner, biologist Graham Farquhar of the Australian National University, who won the $250,000 Prime Minister's Prize for Science for his work in understanding photosynthesis, the most important chemical reaction for sustaining life.\nProfessor Jameson invented a process which uses fine bubbles, released at the bottom of mineral slurry, to pick up particles as they rise to the surface. It was originally used for base metals such as copper, lead and zinc, and then extended to the coal industry where it became enormously successful.\nProfessor Jameson, who is the director of the University of Newcastle's Centre for Multiphase Processes, is now working on updated technology, the Novacell, which can concentrate larger ore particles and save up to 15 per cent of the energy used in the process.\nOther winners in the 2015 Prime Minister's Prizes for Science are:\nCyrille Boyer of UNSW Australia, who won the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year. Jane Elith of the University of Melbourne who won the Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year. Ken Silburn, Casula High School, Sydney who won the Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools. Rebecca Johnson, Windaroo State School, Logan, Brisbane, who won the Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools.
