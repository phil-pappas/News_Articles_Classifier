Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's ability to get substantial changes through the parliament will be a critical test of his and his Treasurer's ability to sell complex ideas.\nThere is a strong chance that the majority of Australians have no idea that there is even a problem with superannuation taxes, so there will be a fair bit of explaining to do.\nRegardless of Mr Turnbull's oratory skills, there is a decent chance that taxing the family home, or counting the family home in the means test for the age pension will be a step too far for voters.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison also seems to have decided that reforming tax-free payouts is a step too far, last week describing Labor's plans to tax super earnings as greedy.\nAt a roundtable in Sydney last week a group of academics (always refreshing to listen to as they are one of the few groups with no vested interests) described Australia's regime of offering tax-free super to retirees after the age of 60 as an \"outrage\".\nThey urged the government to ignore the \"geritocracy\", whose command of the airwaves is disproportionate to their number, and end the free ride for retirees.\nIndeed Anthony Asher, associate professor of risk and actuarial studies at UNSW, argued that the longer the government left the current system in place, the harder it would be to unravel.\nThe more money savers have injected into super on the grounds that their capital would not be taxed in retirement, the more disgruntled they are likely to feel if that were no longer the case. Arguably time is already ticking. Tax-free payouts have already been available since July 2007.\n Less generous mood Labor has proposed a 15 per cent tax on retirees' super income of more than $75,000 a year.\nThe academics last week were in a far less generous mood. Indeed, John Evans, associate professor and director of the Institute for Research in Retirement Policy at Sydney Business School, described the $75,000 threshold as \"fiscally irresponsible\".\nDr Asher proposed taxing super income above a threshold, which could be equal to the level of the age pension, at the marginal tax rate with a 15 per cent rebate.\nThe age pension is currently set at $34,000 for a couple and $23,000 for a single person â€“ making Labor's proposal, even in its unindexed state, seem like a gift by comparison.\nAlternatively, Asher suggests Treasury could use the seniors and pensioners tax offset, currently $29,000 for a single person, as a threshold.\nEvans agreed with the principle, but with one key change.\nTaxing super income at the marginal tax rate with a rebate, he argued, would penalise retirees who need to withdraw large lump sums to pay for medical and other expenses.\nEvans preferred a model of taxing super income at a flat rate, say 30 per cent. But he was no more generous when it came to a tax-free threshold. The age pension level, he said, should be the basis for the point at which tax should be levied.\nEvans conceded that there was little that the government could do to curb the enormous tax breaks going towards retirees with several million dollars in super.\nIt may well be the case, as the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has pointed out, that in 2012-13 some $5.2 billion was paid in (largely tax-free) income stream payments to 24,000 self-managed super fund account holders who had balances of more than $2 million, but the fact is that those sums were accumulated legitimately.\nStill, said Dr Evans, future generations must be prevented from building large sums, a move that could easily be accomplished by abolishing post-tax contributions. Under the current rules individuals are able to inject $180,000 of post-tax money into super every year, or $540,000 every three years.\nAsher had one last plea. The government should remove household contents and personal effects from the means testing of the age pension. This would both reduce the administration costs involved in establishing and monitoring the value of such chattels and ease the pain of the somewhat nasty form-filling exercise faced by pensioners.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:11:44.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
