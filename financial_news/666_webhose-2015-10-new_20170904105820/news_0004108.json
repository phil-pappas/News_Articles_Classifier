The delegation is led by the China International Trade representative Mr Zhang Xiangchen and includes director generals and deputy director generals of various Chinese government arms. The Asian country has agreed to immediately bankroll a number of selected infrastructure projects sealed during President Mugabe's State visit to China last year, with experts from the National Development and Reform Commission -- the economic planning body of China -- visiting Zimbabwe recently to verify the bankability of the projects before financing them. The financial support to the much-needed key economic enablers is expected to create thousands of jobs and spur economic growth in line with Zim-Asset. The delegation's areas of focus include the expansion of Hwange 7 and 8 Thermal Power Station, special economic zones, construction of the national pharmaceuticals warehouse in Harare and construction of the new Parliament building in Mt Hampden. Meetings will also be held on the construction and rehabilitation of road and rail networks, allocation of funds provided by the Chinese government and consultations on the upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit in December. The delegation is expected to visit some of the sites where the projects are either being carried out or expected to take off. Yesterday the delegation immediately got down to business and toured the Victoria Falls International Airport which is being expanded at a cost of $150 million with the support of China Exim Bank. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joram Gumbo led the tour. \"We toured the (Victoria Falls) airport runway which is about four kilometres and took them through the new international terminal building which is almost complete,\" said the Minister after the tour. \"Final touches are being worked out on the project and we hope that by the end of November it will be open for use.\" Minister Gumbo said work on the airport also entailed upgrading the domestic terminal building, constructing a new fire station and a new control tower. \"The runway is currently under testing as all the civil works and equipment installation has been completed,\" he said. \"Finishing works including painting and flooring are ongoing on the new terminal building with physical completion at 90 percent.\" In terms of the loan draw-down, he said, $120 million had been released to date towards the project. Minister Gumbo said the airport would facilitate the development of the tourism sector through increasing accessibility to the country. \"It will become the gateway to Central and Southern Africa and it means more tourists will access the area easily. We expect to have closed door meetings again tomorrow with the same team.\" The delegation is also expected to meet Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services Minister Supa Mandiwanzira in Victoria Falls today before coming to Harare for meetings with Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and other Government ministers, led by Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi tomorrow. Identified projects, whose funding is ready, include special economic zones to be constructed in Harare and Bulawayo, dualisation of major roads, rehabilitation of the national railway and completion of water projects.
