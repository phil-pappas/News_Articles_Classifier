The cuts could include the first forced dismissals since the 1990s, according to the carrier, which subsequently postponed the meeting.\n“These attacks were made by isolated and particularly violent individuals as the demonstration by personnel on strike was going on calmly,” Air France said in an e-mailed statement, adding that a complaint had been filed for aggravated violence.\nUnder the savings plan announced today, Air France’s fleet would be reduced by 14 jets, with orders for Boeing Co. 787s scrapped and aging Airbus Group SE A340s phased out. The Air France-KLM Group unit indicated there was scope for compromise should unions come forward with serious savings measure.\nAir France said last week it was planning cuts to jobs, jets and routes in the absence of a deal with pilots, who had been asked to work more hours for the same pay to help end annual losses that began in 2011. Government ministers had urged the sides to continue talking so that jobs could be saved.\nAsia Impact The changes would require a shrinking of Air France’s network, with a reduction in frequencies and more sweeping seasonal capacity cuts next year, following by the termination of some routes in 2017, especially to Asia, where competition is toughest. Frequencies to 22 destinations would be affected.\nJob cuts couldn’t be implemented before mid-December at the earliest, given French legal requirements, leaving about two months for the two sides to agree an alternative way forward, should negotiations resume.\nChief Executive Officer Alexandre de Juniac has forced the showdown with pilots after last year being defeated in plans to establish a low-cost airline outside of France when crews walked out for two weeks, costing the airline 500 million euros ($564 million) and prompting the government to intervene.\nAir France has never recently fired workers outright, relying on attrition and early retirement packages to reduce the payroll by 9,000 over three years. The last time it sought to dismiss staff, in 1993, weeks of walkouts cost the job of CEO Bernard Attali.\nBI AIRM for commercial aircraft manufacturers’ dashboard BI AIRL EU European airline dashboard BI AIRMG INDD Monthly orders for new aircraft, parked fleet statistics\n—With assistance from Andrea Rothman in Toulouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:33:48.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
