Mr Butterworth said the requirements were too restrictive, particularly for start-ups.\nStart-up lawyer Alex Butterworth says the tax write-off “over promised and under delivered”. Source: Supplied\n“If you wanted to build some software and then license that to other businesses, or if you wanted to use it for personal and business, then it wasn’t eligible,” he told news.com.au. “A lot of my clients had the same problem.\n“There’s the immediate business cost, but once you’ve got software that is the business asset, you should be able to write off the value because after one year it’s going to be redundant and need updates.\n“It’s the same as if you have an apartment you rent out — after a certain amount of time you need to replace the carpet.”\nMale business owners were more likely to have taken advantage of the write-off, with 47 per cent having made an investment compared with just 35 per cent of women.\nThose most likely to make an investment were businesses with 6 to 19 employees (60 per cent), compared with 41 per cent of businesses with two to five employees, and 35 per cent for sole traders.\nCornerstone Group’s Tim Hoopmann, a tax adviser specialising in small businesses, said it was all down to poor timing. “For many of my clients, the rebate was brought in at a time when there were other priorities in their business,” he said.\n“SMB’s tend to finalise their annual budget at the end of the financial year, or at the start of the new financial year, so when the write-off was introduced in May, they either didn’t have any spare cash available to take advantage of it or were focusing on other aspects of their business leading into year end.”\nMr Hoopman said the deductions can be claimed until the end of 2017, giving SMBs plenty of time to use the benefit should the need arise.\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n Business turns down budget booster", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/business-turns-down-budget-booster/story-fn9evb64-1227552476339", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/01/1227552/476735-e8403d86-67f1-11e5-968b-5ebf3b994251.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:10:58.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
