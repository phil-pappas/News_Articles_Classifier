Share on twitter by Peter Ker BHP Billiton has made a better than expected start to the 2016 financial year, with its iron ore, copper and petroleum divisions performing better than most analysts had predicted.\nBHP shareholders were told to expect production declines in most BHP product groups this year, but the early performance in copper and petroleum in particular suggests that upgrades to the company's bearish guidance are possible.\nThe 377,000 tonnes of copper produced was better than the 368,000 tonnes expected by analysts, and puts BHP ahead of the pace required to achieve its full year guidance of 1.5 million tonnes.\nA similar situation is emerging in the petroleum division, where the 65 million barrels of oil equivalent produced in the September quarter puts the company ahead of where it needs to be to produce the promised 237 million barrels of oil equivalent in the full year.\nIron ore is the one product group expected to continue growing , and the 67 million tonnes shipped in the quarter was better than the 64.7 million that analysts had predicted.\nBHP's share of that 67 million tonnes was 61.3 million tonnes, with the balance owned by joint venture partners.\nDespite the strong start, BHP chief Andrew Mackenzie held full year guidance steady across all product groups.\n\"BHP Billiton remains on track to meet full year production and cost guidance after a solid operational performance this quarter,\" he said.\n Morgans analyst Adrian Prendergast praised the result, saying it was better than he had expected in iron ore, copper and petroleum.\n\"A strong operational result kicks off a good start to what is expected to be a tough year,\" he said.\nBHP has continued to slash capital spending, with petroleum capex now set to fall from $US3.1 billion to $US2.9 billion.\nRig numbers in the US shale division have duly reduced again, from 10 to 7; a stark contrast to the September quarter of 2014 when 25 rigs were working those fields.\nThe company noted in the quarterly that it was continuing to pursue \"high quality oil plays\" and had picked up significant amounts of new acreage in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Beagle sub-basin of Western Australia.\nBHP encountered hydrocarbons when drilling at Shenzi North in the Gulf of Mexico, and said further drilling there was planned.\nCoking coal production was slightly better than expected while thermal coal was slightly weaker than expected.\nIn a rare foray into a new mining province, BHP confirmed it had started mining at the Haju coking coal mine in Indonesian Borneo during the quarter, and produced 15,000 tonnes.\nAt just 1 million tonnes per year, Haju is a small mine by BHP's standards, but it is the company's first step into what could be a much bigger exposure to coal mining in Borneo through the \"Indomet\" project.\nBHP has seven mining leases in the area run under a partnership with Indonesian miner Adaro Energy, and the project is considered by some BHP executives to be the highest value undeveloped metallurgical coal resource in the world.\nIn a boost to its copper division, BHP said it had received extension permits out to 2023 for the Cerro Colorado copper mine in Chile.\nPrices for both iron ore and copper fell on Tuesday evening, with iron ore sliding to $US52.93 per tonne while copper was steady at $US2.36 per pound.\nOil prices were slightly higher at $US48.79 per barrel.\nBHP shares last traded at $23.99.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20151021/pdf/4327fx5v5syst5.pdf", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/pgker"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:05:53.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
