The vehicles to be recalled mainly include Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave SUVs of model year 2016, manufactured during Aug 18, 2015 to Sep 24, 2015. Of the total, only 6,400 SUVs have been sold while the remaining are with the dealerships.\n\nGeneral Motors revealed that the defect can cause the front windshield wiper motor cover to melt due to overheating and lead to smoke and even fire. Dealers will be replacing the faulty wiper motor covers of the vehicles that are presently being shipped. The sold vehicles will be repaired first.\n\nIn the meantime, General Motors has instructed customers not to use the windshield wipers till the problem is resolved. The fault was first discovered when a wiper motor got overheated at the plant near Lansing, MI, where these SUVs have been manufactured.  However, there have been no reports of fire yet.\n\nGeneral Motors announces frequent recalls to address safety issues, which impacts consumer sentiment to a great extent. Last month, the company recalled 121,000 cars owing to problems in the rear window defroster control which may get overheated and lead to fire. The recalled vehicles are ATS small sports sedans of model years 2013 to 2016. Of the total, 97,000 ATS vehicles were recalled from the U.S. while the remaining 24,000 were from Canada and Mexico.\n\nCurrently, General Motors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nBetter-ranked stocks in the same space include Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. NSANY, Daimler AG DDAIF and Superior Industries International, Inc. SUP. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
