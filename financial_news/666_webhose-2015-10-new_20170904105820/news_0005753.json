By Saffron Alexander | Telegraph – 39 minutes ago 0.000 \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) research reveals grandparents save around £700 each year for their grandchildren \nWhile over half of over 50s put money away from themselves each money, new research has revealed a quarter of all British grandparents are building a nest egg for their grandchildren. \nThe research, from Saga (Frankfurt: 2S8.F - news ) Personal Finance , found that on average people save £165 for themselves each month and £56 for their grandchildren - the equivalent of almost £700 a year. \nThey found that grandmothers are more likely to put money towards their grandchildren's driving lessons or first car, with one in seven doing so, whilst grandfathers tended to save for a deposit for their first house. \nBetween her own three children, Abigail Williams has eight grandchildren ranging from the ages of seven to 25: \"I put money away for all of the ones under 18 almost monthly. \n\"Once they reach 18, I give them access to the account and they can do what they'd like with the money. I'd prefer they spent it on something sensible, like their education, but I don't nag.\" \nAlthough she doesn't put money away monthly for her grandchildren over the age of 18, she does still save for them sporadically as she worries \"they won't be able to save enough on their own.\" \nSaga (LSE: SAGA.L - news ) 's chief operating officer Jeff Bromage said: “The over 50s are savvy savers and don’t like to live beyond their means. And it appears they’re not just worried about their own financial welfare as our research shows their grandchildren’s financial future is also at the forefront of their minds. \n“Our research shows they really are the generous generation and it’s nice to see that so many people are in a position to be able to help their grandchildren financially, whether that’s contributing to university fees , paying for driving lessons or helping them get on the property ladder . However, grandparents are wise to give their grandchildren money little and often rather than giving them a large lump sum as this can reduce their inheritance tax liability.” \nUnder current inheritance tax laws you can give up to £3000 per tax year and it will be exempt from inheritance tax. This is called an annual exemption, and any left over can be carried over from one tax year to the next, though the maximum exemption is £6000. \nWhen it comes to saving for themselves, the research from Saga found 59 per cent of over 50s are putting money away to spend on a holiday , while 34 per cent use their savings to help fund their retirement. \n23 per cent of men said they would use their money to buy a new car, while 26 per of women said they would put it towards buying new garden furniture or renovating their home. \n= How to save for your grandchildren = \n= Junior ISAs = \nAlthough grandparents can't open a Junior ISA for their grandchildren, they can make contributions up to the annual limit - £4080 for the 2015-16 tax year. Grandparents can top up the account via monthly direct debit payments. \nThe money in a Junior Isa cannot be accessed until the child turns 18, at which point the child gains control of the money. \n= Children's bonds = \nAvailable from the NS&I , there is no tax on the interest of children's bonds and you will be guaranteed a rate of 2.5 per cent over five years. The maximum investment is £3000, meaning after five years would would have just under £4000 saved. \nThey cannot be held beyond the child's 21st birthday. \n= Stakeholder pension = \nFor those thinking about the future, you could consider paying into a stakeholder pension for your grandchild. Money invested benefits from tax relief, so a grandparent could pay £2,880 a year, which would be topped up by the Government to the limit of £3,600. \nThe child takes control of the pension at the age of 18, but does not gain access to the money until they turn 55. Financial planner BestInvest calculated that an annual gift of £3,600 for the first five years could grow to £1,069,795 at age 55, assuming 8pc annual growth net of all charges (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:39:30.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
