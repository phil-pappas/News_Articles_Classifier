This is what your staff are likely to think of you. by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman As new managers fill vacancies created by retiring Boomers, how do their skills compare with the seasoned older managers they replace?\nTo test this, we explored the data we've accumulated on more than 65,000 leaders. We focused on managers aged 30 and younger and compared them to leaders over 45 to distinguish the characteristics of each group.\nThat the younger managers were promoted to managerial positions at such an age shows they had high potential. They already stood out. The 360-degree feedback instrument we use collects data on 49 leadership behaviours. When we matched the scores of the two groups on these 49 characteristics, the younger group ranked more positively on every trait. This excellent news indicate that there are talented younger leaders in our organisations who can step into key roles.\nSix weaknesses identified Young managers ask for feedback about their performance more often and seek ways to implement it. However, the following themes emerged as challenges for young leaders:\n1. Not fully trusted. Teammates did not always trust the ideas and opinions of younger, less experienced leaders. Their judgment was more frequently questioned.\nThis is a frequent issue we face in coaching young leaders. Older team members are often uncomfortable reporting to a relative youngster, making it difficult for young leaders to build positive relationships with their older colleagues.\n2. Lacking experience and deep knowledge. Even though younger managers typically have more current knowledge and training, their lack of experience leads others to question their technical expertise and professional skills. Because of their shorter tenure, they also lack in-depth knowledge that others in the organisation possess.\n 3. Not perceived as a role model. Peers and direct reports frequently observe that younger leaders do not walk their talk. Younger managers are more prone to make promises they can't keep, not because they intentionally mislead others, but because others control outcomes. For younger leaders, the path to success has come quickly, making it difficult for them to identify with the struggles of others.\n4. Insensitive to others' needs. Because they have faced fewer life challenges in their careers, younger leaders struggle to balance the need for results with the needs of their employees. They are not fazed by the need to work 80-hour weeks and cannot understand why others complain. They're not incapable of caring, but they hesitate to reflect and respond to the anxieties of others.\n5. Not capable of representing the organisation​. When an organisation chooses someone to represent them, they want someone who looks and feels like the organizational brand, and who can answer the difficult questions. Younger leaders are less likely to be viewed as able to fill that role.\n6. Lacking strategic perspective. The ability to look far forward is strengthened by perspective that comes from the past. Younger leaders are perceived as more shortsighted and less strategic than their veteran counterparts. They focus more on day-to-day decisions and put less emphasis on the long-term view.\nWhere young leaders shine However, we also found several dimensions in which younger leaders excelled:\n1. Welcoming change. Younger leaders embraced change and exhibited great skills at marketing their new ideas. They have the courage to make difficult changes, possibly because their lack of experience causes them to be more optimistic about their proposals for change.\n2. Inspiring. Younger leaders know how to get others energized and excited about accomplishing objectives. They are able to inspire others to high levels of effort and production to an even greater degree than their more experienced counterparts. Their older colleagues tend to lead by \"pushing\" while younger managers lead by \"pulling.\"\n3. Receptive to feedback. Young managers ask for feedback about their performance more often and seek ways to implement it. Older leaders, in contrast, tend to be less willing to ask for and respond to feedback from colleagues.\n4. Dedicated to continuous improvement. This may be the result of having less invested in the past, but younger leaders are more willing to challenge the status quo. They are constantly looking for innovative ways to accomplish work more efficiently and with higher quality.\n5. Focused intently on results. They have a high need for achievement and put every ounce of energy into achieving their goals. In contrast, when someone has been in an organisation for a long period of time, it is easy to become complacent and to see the status quo as sufficient.\n6. Good at setting stretch goals. Some older leaders have learned to sandbag a goal so they don't have to work so hard or run the risk of falling short. Younger leaders are more likely to set stretch goals and to inspire their team to achieve difficult tasks.\nAll organisations will need to appoint younger managers to fill vacancies left by the retirement of long-term predecessors. Understanding the strengths of this younger group is extremely helpful. The ability to leverage these strengths presents a big opportunity for higher productivity.\nBut awareness of younger leaders' weaknesses is helpful as well. Some will only be rectified by the passage of time. Others can be mitigated by coaching and careful selection of assignments that give younger managers the experiences required for development. But new managers and the leaders who support them should start soon — the earlier we can address the challenges and shore up the strengths, the more young managers and their organisations will benefit.\nJack Zenger is the chief executive of Zenger/Folkman, a leadership development consultancy.
