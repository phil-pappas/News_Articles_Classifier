Recently there was a week where I received a call almost every night from someone claiming to be from Microsoft or from Spark. \nSpark says the fraudsters are becoming more aggressive. They will tell you that your services will be cut off due to security issues unless you change your settings or clean up your computer. They then try to direct you to a website where you will be asked to download software. \nThey will also try to get you to give them remote access to your computer, give them your personal banking information or leave your phone off the hook for three days following the \"setting change\". \nSpark says it understands that in some cases people have been given a made-up \"employee number\" to verify their identity. \nIt says you should not visit the web page or provide any personal banking information. \nIf in doubt hang up and phone Spark on 123 to check. Tips for beating the scammers \nThere are some simple tips to help protect yourself from the fraudsters: Take care with emails: Do not reply to or click on links in emails that you are sent, even ones that look like they are from legitimate businesses. Do not call any numbers in spam emails. Protect your identity: The banks and other reputable businesses will not phone or email you asking for you to provide passwords or other sensitive information. Never share that information with anyone who contacts you claiming to be from the bank or any other company. When you phone the bank it is likely you will be asked to answer security questions or key in a security code via your phone keypad. This is to verify that you are the account holder. Protect our computer: Make sure your computer's software is up to date. Protect your money: Never send your personal details, or credit card number or account details by email. Too good to be true? If you receive an email or phone call with an offer or a prize that seems to good to be true, well, it probably is. \nHere are links to pages with good advice on dealing with scammers:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:27:18.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
