In a note Friday, Brian Johnson and team cut their price target 5% to $190 from $180 and lowered their rating to \"Underweight\" from \"Equal-Weight.\" The analysts said the new Model X SUV would provide a \"reality check\" on margins; they see manufacturing challenges ahead and a slower-than-expected production ramp.
