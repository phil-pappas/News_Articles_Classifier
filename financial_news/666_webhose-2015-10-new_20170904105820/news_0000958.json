As at July this year, VRA owed banks to the tune of over $1.3 billion and that has made it difficult for the power producer to obtain loans from commercial banks operating in the country. \nVRA is collapsing financially because of non-payment of power supplied to some of its major customers, as well as low tariffs. \nVRA spends 30 pesewas to buy fuel to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity, but consumers pay only 14.6 pesewas per kilowatt. \nVRA is owed by ECG, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the Volta Aluminium Company (VALCO). \nECG Privatisation Government is collaborating with Millennium Development Agency (MiDA) to privatise ECG in an attempt to access the second compact of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) worth about $500. \nInvestment analysts believe if government obtains that money, it should pay its debts to ECG to sustain the company. \nAccording to reports, an American company is likely to be given the assets of ECG over the next 20 to 30 years in order to access the US Millennium Challenge Account of $500 million. \nBy Samuel Boadi Business & Finance Follow Us Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
