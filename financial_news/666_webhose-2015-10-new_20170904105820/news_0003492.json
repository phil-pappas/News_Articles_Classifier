Photo: Salona Chithiray\nFashion retailer PAS Group says shareholders who paid $1.15 for its shares in last year's $120 million float may soon be back in the black, but only if they reject a $86 million takeover offer from one of its major shareholders .\nThe company behind brands such as Metalicus, Review and Black Pepper has urged shareholders to reject a 63¢ a share on-market offer from US hedge fund Coliseum Capital Management , saying its share price will return to $1.15 in time, underpinned by a rebound in earnings.\n\"We believe in the short to medium term we can get it back to the share price we listed at,\" PAS chairman Rod Walker told Fairfax Media after the retailer's annual meeting in Melbourne on Thursday.\n\"We hope in the short to medium term we can get back to that level, based on forward projections - longer term this business has tremendous potential,\" Mr Walker said.\nAdvertisement \"Our retail brands are performing particularly well,\" he said, pointing to positive like-for-like retail sales growth in the first two months of 2016 and plans to open 15 stores this year.\nSales in the Designworks wholesale division had stabilised after the loss of key contracts with Target, and the group was searching for more bolt-on acquisitions after buying bridal retailer White Runway and sports assets such as Everlast from Pacific Brands.\nChief executive Eric Morris says Coliseum Capital's offer is opportunistic, contains no control premium and materially undervalues the company. The offer values the company at 5.4 times 2015 earnings before interest and tax, well below the median historical EV/EBIT multiple of 8.1.\nPAS has hired investment bank Investec to search for better offers and fears shareholders who accept the offer before it closes on November 9 will miss out if a higher bid emerges.\nHowever, Mr Morris conceded that with Coliseum already holding a 19.3 per cent stake the company would struggle to find another suitor.\n\"This is not a classic hostile offer - they are not planning to get rid of management and spill the board - they're very supportive of what the business is trying to do,\" he said.\nPAS's former owners Macquarie Private Equity, Propel Investments and State Super raised $120 million in the float, but PAS shares have never traded above their $1.15 issue price, falling as low as 41¢ in May. Shares closed at 63.5c each on Thursday.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/retail/pas-group-rejects-86-million-takeover-bid-by-big-shareholder-20151006-gk26cr", "http://www.afr.com/business/retail/clothing-and-accessories/pas-group-gets-86m-takeover-bid-from-us-hedge-fund-coliseum-capital-management-20150922-gjs5sk"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:21:53.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
