But when asked about the implications of hiring an investment banker for the top job, he denied that Mr Staley is an investment banker by trade. \n“He is not an investment banker. He started life like me, as a commercial banker, he is a corporate banker,” said Mr McFarlane. \n“He then ran the equities division, but he didn't trade equities. He ran the fund management division, and then ran the investment banking. He is a client guy, like I started life, lending money to corporations.” \nBarclays’ executive chairman also warned that the sustained flood of fines and the steady tide of regulation could hit bank lending and undermine the wider British economy. \n“I'm worried about the real economy effect of all of this. Years and years after the crisis we are still pushing water uphill in terms of increased regulation,” he said. \n“If we can't [move on from historic problems] then other countries will, and we will be relatively disadvantaged.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:34:38.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
