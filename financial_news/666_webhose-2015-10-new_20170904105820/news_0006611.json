A study conducted by apex industry body the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) disclosed that over 75 percent of the total 3,540 projects remained non-starters. Total outstanding investments worth over Rs.14 lakh crore were attracted by these projects. \"On an average, real estate projects in India are facing a delay of 33 months in completion,\" said D.S. Rawat, secretary general of Assocham, while releasing the study report. \"We urge the government to pass the long-pending Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill on an urgent basis as it would help in resolving the key issues that are hampering the growth of the sector,\" Rawat said. According to the study, over 2,300 projects in the realty sector remained non-starter, while over 1,000 on-going projects have registered significant delays in completion.

Maharashtra led the states in attracting most investment from the real estate sector.
