He is also the author of five books including Europe's Promise: Why the European Way is the Best Hope in an Insecure Age.

Hill said that the job reports Wall Street traders anxiously await each month are not capturing the true picture of employment in America. \n\"What they are missing is that the number of 1099 forms, which is the form contractors file with the IRS -- those are climbing very fast,\" said Hill. \"The number of people filing Schedule C, which is the self-employment form, those are climbing very fast. So I don't think we are capturing accurately what's going on in this gig economy.\" \nHill said the emergence of the gig economy has enabled employers to dump many of their full time and salaried employees, replacing them with cheaper freelancers and independent contractors who do not receive benefits. \n\"If it's working for you and you have that flexibility, then that's great,\" said Hill. \"But the idea that these jobs are going to replace the jobs we lost as a result of the economic crash in 2008 and 2009, it's just not real world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:56:28.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
