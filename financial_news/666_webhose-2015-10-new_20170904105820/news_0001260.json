Albertsons' private-equity owners, Cerberus Capital, also declined to comment.\n\nIPO advisers put a lot of consideration into timing — weighing factors including whether other large issuers are in the market and holidays that could keep investors away from road-show meetings.\n\nSometimes the preferences of a company founder can come into play. When Alibaba Group was planning its IPO, some media reported that founder Jack Ma wanted the stock to begin trading on August 8 (or 8/8) because the number eight is associated with good luck in China. \nOf course, luck does have something to do with it. Investor sentiment can sour for unpredictable reasons. \n\nBut some risks can be foreseen. In Albertsons' case it is that Walmart was long scheduled to report its results on Wednesday morning.\n\nUnfortunately for the company's planned offering, when Walmart announced earnings it also cut its forward-looking estimates. Its share price dropped by as much as 9%, the biggest single-day decline in at least six years . \nLater in the day, Albertsons' IPO pricing was delayed. \n\nNow, it seems, that Cerberus and Goldman Sachs will have to live with that decision for some time. \nNOW WATCH: Fed's Bullard explains the problem with keeping rates at zero forever \n\nMore From Business Insider \nThe IPO market is about to face its biggest test of the year Albertsons is reportedly delaying its IPO indefinitely Exclusive - Albertsons delays IPO amid weak demand  \nIPOs Albertsons Walmart Goldman Sachs initial public offering", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:43:49.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
