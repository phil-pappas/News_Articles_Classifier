And it's happening.\nCharlie just called in from the deck of his 101 year old former naval patrol boat bobbing up and down in the Port of Melbourne, where he's arrived from the ancient Victorian fishing village of Queenscliff which sprung up around a 19th century colonial fort that was built to keep the Russians away.\n\"Job well done!\" says Louise.\nThe Russians had started to push into the Crimea during our Gold Rush and they have just managed to get it again.\nIllustration: Cathy Wilcox.\nCharlie better keep his engines running. Queenscliff was a little like the town that I came from in the 1950s with a population of around 5000 that would grow to 30,000 at the time of the Stawell Gift.\nAdvertisement There was only one house with a swimming pool. The world has changed. Now, almost every respectable middle-class home has a swimming pool or tennis court but while life is alright generally, wealth seems to be a problem.\n\"What's wrong with wealth?\" ask Louise.\nWell, if it all gets a bit uneven, everyone without a swimming pool starts to hate those who have one. Just as the Russians thought, and still might think, \"today Crimea, tomorrow Queenscliff\".\nThe United Nations was established in 1945 to bring about harmony on the planet.\nIt's tough but it does a great job. So when I heard of the United Nation's support for something called the 'Millennium Development Goals' some years ago, I was not the only one to take a deep breath and think, here we go again.\nBut Australia happens to be a star in the UN right now. A month ago when our Foreign Minister was unexpectedly invited into the group of 20 nations headed by Obama in New York, I thought we'd turned a corner, and we had.\nPM Turnbull did it. My informant was Sam Mostyn, chair of the Australia Council for International Development and a great Australian female executive probably more famous for being an AFL Commissioner.\nThe UN Millennium Development Goals said that we needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. And it's happening. In 1990, 47 per cent of people in developing countries lived on $1.25 a day.\nIt's down to 14 per cent this year. Education is also improving globally. In 1990, 50 per cent of children in Sub-Saharan Africa didn't finish state school. Now 80 per cent do.\nSo when I got the opportunity this week to sit down with a group of young people who have been asked by the UN to champion its new Sustainable Development Goals, I jumped at it.\nIn just three short months, they have set up a global network of young people who have run 100 different events in 40 cities to inspire young people to get behind the new set of goals, which are designed to make human wealth more equitable and sustainable.\nThese young people want to make a difference by getting the word out about the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which cover all critical areas of human wealth production and planetary impact – all of which have specific targets.\nSix young men and women who are our future but the greatest news is that they are all Australian. A mix of ethnic and religious backgrounds – excitedly working together to make our country and our world a better place.\nIn my chat with them I had to ask the question: how many of them were Muslim? Two of the six said they were and there were no barriers to their participation or reservations about their value to our society.\nTheir different religious backgrounds didn't mean anything to them, they were just six young kids, but it meant a lot to me and to many Australians who are concerned about our social cohesion.\nWe worry about the integration of Muslim youth and how they might become radicalised. Our police say you can't police against it and that the community has to be actively involved.\nWell that's true for everything in life. We all have to be involved in the solutions to our problems and challenges – particularly when it comes to sustainable wealth generation around the world.\nWe can't afford to leave anyone out and these young people know it. I was heartened by their commitment and enthusiasm. I think our future is in good hands.\nLook up their website http://www.sdsnyouth.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:44:04.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
