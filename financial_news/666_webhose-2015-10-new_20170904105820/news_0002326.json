The scales may be tipping in the favor of another cut this year as Russia’s consumer economy continues to weaken. Data due Monday will show wages probably fell for an 11th month when adjusted for price growth, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n“There are strong disinflationary trends, including falling retail sales, vehicle sales, wages, and household debt,” Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging-markets strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm, said by e-mail. “This weakness will give plenty of room for the” central bank “to cut rates, as long as oil prices hold up.”\nRussian policy makers have struggled to concoct the right policy mix to steer the country out of its longest recession in two decades. A fresh bout of ruble weakness forced the central bank to hold off on easing policy after it already rolled back most of a December emergency rate increase. With international sanctions and low oil prices shackling the economy of the world’s largest energy exporter, Standard & Poor’s last week forecast a deeper contraction as it predicts private consumption will remain weak next year.\nRuble Decline Since last month’s rate decision, the ruble has gained 10 percent against the dollar amid a revival in emerging-market risk appetite. The ruble has depreciated about 34 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, the second-worst performer behind the Brazilian real among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Forward-rate agreements are signaling 35 basis points of cuts in borrowing costs during the next three months, the biggest bets since July.\nVTB analysts Alexander Ushakov and Petr Grishin said in a note Oct. 15 that \"further proof of demand weakness,” including unemployment approaching 6 percent, an annual decline in real wages closer to 11 percent or an accelerating decline in investments is needed to shift the balance toward a 50 basis-point rate cut at the central bank meeting on Oct. 30. Other conditions include the ruble trading at about 62 against the dollar and the budget stance being kept tight, they said.\nThe wages release may supply the necessary evidence, as the median forecast of 14 economists is for a 9.8 percent drop, matching the August figure. Data to be published Monday will also show a 7 percent decline in fixed-capital investment in September from a year earlier, the 21st consecutive negative reading, economists forecast. That would mark the longest such stretch since at least 1995, when Bloomberg started compiling the figures.\n“We now anticipate a weakness in private consumption to extend into 2016, and an only marginal recovery in capital spending next year, helped by improved corporate profit margins and a slowdown in deleveraging,\" S&P senior economist Tatiana Lysenko said in a report on Oct. 15. The credit evaluator now sees Russia’s economy contracting 3.6 percent this year, followed by 0.3 percent growth in 2016, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:23:46.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
