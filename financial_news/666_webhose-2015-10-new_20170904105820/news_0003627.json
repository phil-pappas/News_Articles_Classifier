Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nAs used herein, the \"Company,\"\"we,\"\"us\" and \"our\" refer to Weatherford International plc (\"Weatherford Ireland\"), a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland, and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, or for periods prior to June 17, 2014, to our predecessor, Weatherford International Ltd. (\"Weatherford Switzerland\"), a Swiss joint-stock corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. \nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included with this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes and related MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future results. These statements are based on certain assumptions we consider reasonable. For information about these assumptions, please review the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and the section entitled \"Item 1A. - Risk Factors.\" \nOverview \nChange in Reportable Segments \nIn the first quarter of 2015, we changed our business structure to better align with management's current view and future growth objectives. This change involved separating our Land Drilling Rigs business into a reportable segment resulting in a total of five reportable segments which are North America, MENA/Asia Pacific, Europe/SSA/Russia, Latin America and Land Drilling Rigs. We have recast prior periods to conform to the current business segment presentation. See \"Note 15 - Segment Information\" for additional information. \nGeneral \nWe conduct operations in over 100 countries and have service and sales locations in nearly all of the oil and natural gas producing regions in the world. Our operational performance is reviewed on a geographic basis, and we report these regions as separate, distinct reporting segments mentioned previously. \nWe principally provide products, equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, both on land and offshore, through our product service line groups: (1) Formation Evaluation and Well Construction, (2) Completion and Production, and (3) Land Drilling Rigs, which together comprise a total of 14 service lines. \n� Formation Evaluation and Well Construction service line group includes Managed-Pressure Drilling, Drilling Services,Tubular Running Services, Drilling Tools, Wireline Services, Testing and Production Services, Re-entry and Fishing, Cementing, Liner Systems, Integrated Laboratory Services and Surface Logging. \n� Completion and Production service line group includes Artificial Lift Systems, Stimulation and Completion Systems. \n� Land Drilling Rigs encompasses our land drilling rigs business, including the products and services ancillary thereto. \nWe may sell our products and services separately or may bundle them together to provide integrated solutions, up to and including integrated well construction where we are responsible for the entire process of drilling, constructing and completing a well. Our customers include both exploration and production companies and other oilfield service companies. Depending on the service line, customer and location, our contracts vary in their terms, provisions and indemnities. We earn revenues under our contracts when products are delivered and services are performed. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment may be located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. Our services are usually short-term in nature, day-rate based, and cancellable should our customer wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to the Company. \nTable of Contents \nDivestitures \nThroughout 2014, we successfully sold several of our non-core businesses and investments. We received cash proceeds totaling over $1.7 billion from these dispositions and used $1.2 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain on these dispositions of $349 million. \nLong-lived Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges \nIn 2015, the continued weakness in crude oil prices contributed to lower exploration and production spending and a decline in the utilization of our pressure pumping assets. Based on these impairment indicators, we performed an analysis of our pressure pumping business and recorded charges of $176 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, including long-lived assets impairment charges of $124 million to adjust the assets to fair value in our North America segment and $52 million of other pressure pumping business related charges. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also incurred supply agreement charges of $2 million and $32 million, respectively, related to the divestiture of a non-core business. In connection with our long-lived asset impairment in the second quarter of 2015, we prepared an analysis to determine the fair value of our equity investments in less than majority owned entities. We assessed these declines in value as other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss of $20 million during the second quarter of 2015. In July 2014, we completed the sale of our rig operations in Russia and Venezuela. As a result of our commitment to sell, we recorded a $143 million long-lived assets impairment charge. See \"Note 6 - Long-Lived Asset Impairments\" for additional information. \nLitigation Settlement \nOn June 30, 2015, we settled a purported securities class action for $120 million in exchange for the dismissal with prejudice of the litigation and the unconditional release of all claims captioned Freedman v. Weatherford International Ltd., et al., that was filed in the Southern District of New York against us and certain current and former officers in March 2012. The settlement agreement was subject to notice to the class, approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and other conditions and was paid in August 2015. See \"Note 16 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies\" for additional information. \nIndustry Trends The level of spending in the energy industry is heavily influenced by changes in the current and expected future prices of oil and natural gas. Changes in expenditures result in an increased or decreased demand for our products and services. Rig count is an indicator of the level of spending for exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves. The following chart sets forth certain statistics that reflect historical market conditions: North Henry Hub Gas American International Rig WTI Oil (a) (b) Rig Count (c) Count (c) September 30, 2015 $ 45.09 $ 2.52 1,055 1,132 December 31, 2014 53.27 2.90 2,294 1,315 September 30, 2014 91.16 4.12 2,302 1,348 \n(a) Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil as of the date indicated at Cushing, Oklahoma - Source: Thomson Reuters \n(b) Price per MM/BTU as of the date indicated at Henry Hub Louisiana - Source: Thomson Reuters \n(c) Average rig count for the period indicated - Source: Baker Hughes Rig Count \nDuring the first nine months of 2015, oil prices ranged from a high of $61.82 per barrel in mid-June to a low of $38.24 per barrel in mid-August. Natural gas ranged from a high of $3.21 MM/BTU in mid-January to a low of $2.51 MM/BTU in mid-April. Factors influencing oil and natural gas prices during the period include hydrocarbon inventory levels, realized and expected global economic growth, realized and expected levels of hydrocarbon demand, level of production capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\"), weather and geopolitical uncertainty. \nOutlook \nWe entered into 2015 challenged by the recent steep decline in oil prices. This decline has materially reduced capital spending by our customers which has reduced our revenue, both through lower activity levels and pricing. Our response to this environment will be to continue to focus on developing our core businesses while rationalizing our cost base and improving cash flow. In the fourth quarter of 2014, responsive to these changing market conditions, we commenced a reduction in force exercise initially targeting 8,000 positions. During 2015, we increased the expected reduction by 75% due to the continued weakness in the price of crude oil, further reductions in activity from our customers and lower than expected exploration and production spending. \nIn the first half of 2015, we increased the targeted workforce reduction to 11,000 and then again in the third quarter of 2015 to a target of 14,000 with an increased focus on support functions. We completed the previously announced targeted headcount reduction of 11,000 as of September 30, 2015 and expect a realized annualized savings of $803 million from this cost reduction initiative. \nWe have also closed over 60 operating facilities across North America through the first half of 2015. In the third quarter, we have closed over 10 additional facilities and expect to close an additional 20 by the end of the year. In addition to our headcount and operating facility reductions, we have closed five of our planned manufacturing and service facilities during the year. We will close the sixth manufacturing and service facility by the end of 2015 with additional closures in early 2016. \nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2015, North America continued to be severely impacted by both lower volume and pricing pressure as our customers reduced spending due to the decline in commodity prices. For the remainder of the year, we expect North America to continue to be impacted by the curtailment of activity and show further reductions, which will be partially offset by our efforts to rationalize our cost structure. Internationally, we expect Latin America and Sub-Sahara Africa to show further reductions over the remainder of the year while the Middle East/North Africa and Russia are expected to show continued resilient year-on-year performance through the 2015 market decline with the fourth quarter remaining relatively flat compared to the third quarter. \nOver the longer term, we believe the outlook for our core businesses is favorable. As well production decline rates accelerate and reservoir productivity complexities increase, our clients will continue to face challenges associated with decreasing the cost of extraction activities and securing desired rates of production. These challenges increase our customers' requirements for technologies that improve productivity and efficiency which in turn increases demand for our products and services. These factors provide us with a positive outlook for our core businesses over the longer term. However, the level of improvement in our core businesses in the future will depend heavily on pricing, volume of work and our ability to offer solutions to more efficiently extract hydrocarbons, control costs and penetrate new and existing markets with our newly developed technologies. \nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or dispositions of assets, businesses, investments or joint ventures. We evaluate our disposition candidates based on the strategic fit within our business and objectives. It is also our intention to divest our remaining land drilling rigs. Upon completion, the cash proceeds from any divestitures are expected to be used to repay or repurchase debt. Debt reduction from divestiture proceeds, working capital or other sources may include the repurchase of our outstanding senior notes prior to their maturity in the open market, either through a privately negotiated transaction or otherwise. \nTable of Contents \nResults of Operations The following table contains selected financial data comparing our consolidated and segment results from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars and shares in millions, Favorable except per share data) 2015 2014 (Unfavorable) Percentage Change Revenues: North America $ 824 $ 1,814 $ (990 ) (55 )% MENA/Asia Pacific 445 633 (188 ) (30 )% Europe/SSA/Russia 361 555 (194 ) (35 )% Latin America 421 591 (170 ) (29 )% Subtotal 2,051 3,593 (1,542 ) (43 )% Land Drilling Rigs 186 284 (98 ) (35 )% Total Revenues 2,237 3,877 (1,640 ) (42 )% Operating Income (Expense): North America (54 ) 288 (342 ) (119 )% MENA/Asia Pacific 2 66 (64 ) (97 )% Europe/SSA/Russia 43 118 (75 ) (64 )% Latin America 73 96 (23 ) (24 )% Subtotal 64 568 (504 ) (89 )% Land Drilling Rigs 16 7 9 129 % Total Segment Operating Income 80 575 (495 ) (86 )% Research and Development (56 ) (72 ) 16 22 % Corporate Expenses (45 ) (45 ) - - % Long-Lived Assets Impairment and Other Related Charges (17 ) - (17 ) - % Goodwill and Equity Investment Impairment - 4 (4 ) (100 )% Restructuring Charges (49 ) (154 ) 105 68 % Gain on Sale of Businesses, Net - 38 (38 ) (100 )% Other Items (11 ) (28 ) 17 61 % Total Operating Income (98 ) 318 (416 ) (131 )% Interest Expense, Net (114 ) (122 ) 8 7 % Currency Devaluation and Related Charges (26 ) - (26 ) - % Other, Net 12 (9 ) 21 233 % Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 65 (98 ) 163 166 % Net Loss per Diluted Share $ (0.22 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.32 ) (320 )% Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 779 784 5 1 % Depreciation and Amortization $ 298 $ 327 $ 29 9 % \nTable of Contents \nThe following table contains selected financial data comparing our consolidated and segment results from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: \nNine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars and shares in millions, Favorable except per share data) 2015 2014 (Unfavorable) Percentage Change Revenues: North America $ 2,795 $ 5,083 $ (2,288 ) (45 )% MENA/Asia Pacific 1,494 1,831 (337 ) (18 )% Europe/SSA/Russia 1,196 1,632 (436 ) (27 )% Latin America 1,370 1,618 (248 ) (15 )% Subtotal 6,855 10,164 (3,309 ) (33 )% Land Drilling Rigs 566 1,020 (454 ) (45 )% Total Revenues 7,421 11,184 (3,763 ) (34 )% Operating Income (Expense): North America (156 ) 728 (884 ) (121 )% MENA/Asia Pacific 45 132 (87 ) (66 )% Europe/SSA/Russia 179 301 (122 ) (41 )% Latin America 247 262 (15 ) (6 )% Subtotal 315 1,423 (1,108 ) (78 )% Land Drilling Rigs 30 (16 ) 46 288 % Total Segment Operating Income 345 1,407 (1,062 ) (75 )% Research and Development (179 ) (216 ) 37 17 % Corporate Expenses (147 ) (137 ) (10 ) (7 )% Long-Lived Assets Impairment and Other Related Charges (208 ) (143 ) (65 ) (45 )% Goodwill and Equity Investment Impairment (20 ) (121 ) 101 83 % Restructuring Charges (159 ) (283 ) 124 44 % Litigation Charges (112 ) - (112 ) - % Gain (Loss) on Sale of Businesses (2 ) 38 (40 ) (105 )% Other Items (30 ) (72 ) 42 58 % Operating Income (512 ) 473 (985 ) (208 )% Interest Expense, Net (351 ) (376 ) 25 7 % Currency Devaluation and Related Charges (68 ) - (68 ) - % Other, Net (17 ) (37 ) 20 54 % Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 197 (136 ) 333 245 % Net Loss per Diluted Share $ (1.00 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.86 ) (614 )% Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 778 776 (2 ) - % Depreciation and Amortization $ 925 $ 1,033 $ 108 10 % \nTable of Contents \nRevenue Percentage by Product Service Line Group The following chart contains the percentage distribution of our consolidated revenues by product service line group for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Formation Evaluation and Well Construction 56 % 52 % 56 % 51 % Completion and Production 36 41 36 40 Land Drilling Rigs 8 7 8 9 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % \nConsolidated Revenues \nConsolidated revenues decreased $1.6 billion, or 42%, and $3.8 billion, or 34%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Revenues decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 across all our segments with declines of $990 million, or 55%, and $2.3 billion, or 45%, in North America, $552 million, or 31%, and $1.0 billion, or 20%, in our International segments and $98 million, or 35%, and $454 million, or 45%, in Land Drilling Rigs, respectively. International revenues represent revenues of our regional segments other than North America and the Land Drilling Rigs segments. The decline in North American revenue is consistent with the 54% decrease in North American rig count since the third quarter of 2014 with significant declines across product lines in the United States and Canada, particularly pressure pumping, artificial lift, intervention services and drilling services. The decline in the North America segment was driven by a combination of lower activity and customer pricing pressure. \nThe decline in revenues in our International segments is in line with the decrease in international rig count of 16% since the third quarter of 2014 as well as declines in revenue from our Europe/Russia/SSA and MENA/Asia Pacific due to pricing pressure and reduced activity across our product lines. Lastly, our Latin America segment experienced lower activity particularly in the Well Construction and Formation Evaluation product lines. \nThe decline in our Land Drilling Rigs revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in drilling activity consistent with the rig count declines, decreases in new drilling activity and the 2014 disposal of our land drilling and workover rig operations in Russia and Venezuela. \nOperating Income \nSegment operating income decreased $495 million, or 86%, and $1.1 billion, or 75%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. The decline in operating income is consistent with the reduction in activity resulting from the significant decline in both the price of oil and rig counts, which has put pressure on our pricing and has resulted in a lower volume of work. \nOperating income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 includes legacy contract and other related charges of $40 million and $2 million, respectively, and restructuring charges of $49 million and $154 million, respectively. Additionally, consolidated operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 includes legacy contract and other related charges of $118 million and $50 million, respectively, and restructuring charges of $159 million and $283 million, respectively. For additional information regarding charges by segment, see the subsection entitled \"Segment Results\" and \"Restructuring Charges\" below. \nTable of Contents \nOther items impacting our results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 included expenses of $11 million and $28 million respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 included expenses of $30 million and $72 million, respectively. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes professional and other fees, facility closure fees, and divestiture related charges. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, included expenses related to the divestiture of our non-core businesses, restatement related litigation, the settlement of the U.S. government investigations, the remediation of our material weakness related to income taxes and our 2014 redomestication from Switzerland to Ireland and other charges. \nSegment Results \nNorth America \nRevenues in our North America segment decreased $990 million, or 55%, in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $2.3 billion, or 45%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. North America average rig count decreased 54% since September 30, 2014. The decline in revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to lower activity and pricing pressure that broadly impacted all product lines, particularly artificial lift, pressure pumping, and intervention services and drilling tools. The disposition of our engineered chemistry business on December 31, 2014 also negatively impacted revenues when compared to the same period in the prior year. \nTotal revenues in the U.S. were $673 million and $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $2.3 billion and $4.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The remaining revenues of our North America segment of $151 million and $330 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and $484 million and $960 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were derived from our operations in Canada. \nOperating income in our North America segment decreased $342 million, or 119%, in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $884 million, or 121% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. The same factors contributing to the decline in revenues directly contributed to the decline in operating income. \nIn the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we recognized restructuring charges of $9 million and $16 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we recognized restructuring charges of $38 million and $44 million, respectively. In addition, we recorded asset impairment charges of $124 million, other pressure pumping business related charges of $52 million and supply agreement charges related to a non-core business divestiture of $32 million as \"Long-Lived Assets Impairment and Other Related Charges\" on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nMENA/Asia Pacific \nRevenues in our MENA/Asia Pacific segment decreased $188 million, or 30%, in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $337 million or 18%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.
