The Bloomberg China-U.S. Equity Index declined for a second day, losing 2 percent.

Policy makers are expected to lower their growth targets when they present the first five-year plan under President Xi Jinping next week.\nWorried Investors “Investors are very worried about the Chinese economy as reflected in the pressure on materials and commodity companies,” Gabriel Wallach, founder of North Grove Capital LLC in Boston, said in a phone interview. “But on the other hand, investors have come to understand that the weak economy doesn’t necessarily affect companies on the retail and service side. The drivers are a little bit different.”\nBaidu, scheduled to report its third quarter earnings on Oct. 29, fell to $149.63. The company, which has missed its own sales guidance in the past four quarters, said on Wednesday that it has suspended recruitment for general positions such as administration, back office and sales, while hiring from university campuses and for targeted technical positions will continue.\n“The company has been spending aggressively in new businesses, which are not profitable,” Wallach said. “If they are announcing a hiring freeze maybe it’s related to expectations to slower growth.”\nAlibaba fell the most since Sept. 8, closing at $69.48.
