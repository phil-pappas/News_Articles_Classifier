Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \n\n\nAdding to My GS and MS Stakes \nOriginally published at 10:02 AM EDT on September 28, 2015 I've added to Goldman Sachs at $175.10 and Morgan Stanley at $31.38 Monday morning. Position: Long GS (small), MS (small) \n\nAdding Small to My Cyclicals \nOriginally published at 11:19 AM EDT on September 28, 2015 \nMy net exposure in energy/cyclicals has been quite low over the last 12 months. I'm long only three cyclicals now -- Ford , General Motors and Potash and am short one cyclical, Caterpillar .\nHowever, I added to my longs Monday morning.\nPosition: Long GM, F, POT; Short CAT (small) \nKeep a Cool Head, Dear Reader Originally published at 3:53 PM EDT on September 28, 2015 As discussed in Monday morning's opening missive , my baseline expectation has and continues to be that we will successfully hold the August lows and then be range-bound between 1850 and 2025 in the S&P index as far as my eyes can see.\nThe amount of technical damage -- as expressed in \"Janet Yellen, Meet Mae West\" -- has been sufficient to limit the upside. On the other hand, numerous sectors -- cyclicals, commodities, energy -- are extraordinarily oversold on a near-term basis and have ALREADY likely approached bottoming levels, and it is that area that I plan to add in the future.\nI am attempting to be as emotionless and detached in this anticipated period of heightened volatility.\nAnd I would remind everyone that concerns about the high-yield market seem quite late to me. We have been discussing this in my Diary for three to four months now.\nEnjoy the evening and thanks for reading my Diary; I hope it was value-added.\nPosition: Long SPY (small) My Latest Trades Originally published at 10:37 AM EDT on October 2, 2015 I've added to Bank of America , Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase on weakness, moving to large positions from my previous medium-sized ones in these names.\nI also took my long of the Alerian MLP ETF back up in size.\nFinally, I added to my longs of Ford and General Motors .\nPosition: Long F, GM, BAC (large), C (large), JPM (large), AMLP (small) EXCLUSIVE OFFER: See inside Jim Cramerâ€™s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio to see the stocks he thinks could be potentially HUGE winners.
