That is absolutely true. We've worked hard, we've paid our taxes, we've given back.\" Andrew Meares by Phillip Coorey Joanna Mather One of the nation's foremost political strategists and a co-architect of past Labor election victories has warned the federal opposition to drop its attacks on Malcolm Turnbull's wealth or face a hiding in the polls.\nPollster Tony Mitchelmore said his marginal seat research showed swing voters respected Mr Turnbull's success, were aspirational themselves, and the opposition's primary vote would remain mired \"in the 30s\" if it continued the tactic .\nHe spoke after extraordinary scenes in Parliament on Thursday in which Labor frontbenchers, for a second successive day, pursued the Prime Minister over his investments in managed funds housed in the Cayman Islands.\nAfter explaining repeatedly that the investments were designed to minimise the potential for a conflict of interest and that he paid full tax in Australia on all earnings, Mr Turnbull accused Labor of a \"shabby smear\" and \"another wander down the avenue of the politics of envy\" before mounting a passionate defence of his wealth ..\n\"The fact is that Lucy and I have been very fortunate in our lives. We have more wealth than most Australians, that is true. That is absolutely true. We've worked hard, we've paid our taxes, we've given back,\" he told a hushed chamber.\n\"I don't believe that my wealth, or frankly most people's wealth, is entirely a function of hard work. Of course hard work is important but, you know, there are taxi drivers that work harder than I ever have and they don't have much money. There are cleaners that work harder than I ever have or you ever have and they don't have much money.\n\"This country is built upon hard work, people having a go, and enterprise. Some of us will be more successful than others, some of us are fortunate in the turn of business, some of us are fortunate in the intellect we inherit from our parents.\n\"So really, if the [opposition] wants to go round wearing a sandwich board saying, 'Malcolm Turnbull's got a lot of money,' feel free. I think people know that.\"\nThe pivotal performance buoyed the Coalition backbench and left Labor visibly deflated. After Question Time, some dismayed Labor MPs questioned why it was pursued for a second day, and tax experts defended the Prime Minister.\n Focus group polling Mr Mitchelmore conducted recently in the Western Sydney suburb of Penrith found that although expectations of the new prime minister were high and voters remained wary of the government, \"most are not resentful of his wealth, in fact [it is] a positive with many\".\n﻿ The focus groups of voters who switched from Labor to the Coalition in 2013 regarded Mr Turnbull variously as \"confident, a successful businessman and intelligent\" who was rightfully focused on \"economic leadership\".\nStick to battle of ideas Mr Mitchelmore told The Australian Financial Review that targeting Mr Turnbull's wealth \"is not going to play at all\".\n\"It's good if you want a primary vote stuck in the 30s,'' he said. \"Shallow personal shots. That doesn't help the big picture in terms of building Labor and Bill Shorten into a better proposition.\nHe said Kevin Rudd was successful as opposition leader against John Howard because he offered aspiration to working families, and Labor leader Bill Shorten should stick to his previous strategy of engaging in \"a battle of ideas\".\nEarlier in the day, Mr Shorten defended the strategy and dismissed Mr Turnbull's point that many super funds, including Australian Super, which once had Mr Shorten on the board, also invested in the Cayman Islands .\n\"There couldn't be a bigger gap or a bigger difference behind Malcolm Turnbull and his millions of dollars sent to the Cayman Islands and the superannuation of ordinary Australians,\" Mr Shorten said.\nHe questioned Mr Turnbull's argument that the money was put in the funds and invested at arm's length so there could be no conflict with his parliamentary responsibilities.\n\"I've heard a various range of reasons to go to the Cayman Islands, but I've never heard it's to be more transparent or more open.\"\nAustralian Centre for Financial Studies executive director Amy Auster said she could see nothing untoward in what had become a fairly \"silly\" debate.\n\"If you look at Australian Super, they're in the Cayman Islands, they're in Jersey, they're in Bermuda,\" she said. \"This is how the funds management industry works.\n\"To criticise individuals who are using perfectly legitimate mechanisms to invest their money in companies that are engaging in perfectly legitimate mechanisms to make their money, I can't see where there's an issue.\"\nPwC tax partner Peter Collins said ​investing in funds established in zero tax jurisdictions ​was legal and common.\n\"All of Malcolm Turnbull's comments are accurate: he is paying tax in Australia on offshore investment incom​e,\" Mr Collins said.\n\"Many funds are established in zero tax jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands so that investors don't have to pay tax twice on the same income – once where the fund is registered and again when the income is received in the investor's home country, in this case, Australia.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:10:26.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
