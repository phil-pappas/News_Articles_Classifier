ANZ dismissed 336 staff members, while a further 229 employees resigned.\nThe bank also issued 739 formal warnings for breach of ANZ's code of conduct, while 414 staff members were given verbal warnings.\n\"Breaches ranged from conflict of interest through to allegations of fraud, bullying and email misuse,\" ANZ said in its submission to the inquiry.\nAccording to ANZ's website its \"headcount\" for the year to September 2014 was 50,824. A spokesman said this only related to full time staff and including part time staff the number in 2015 was 65,000. He declined to provide the equivalent number for 2014.\nEliminating corruption 'desirable' ANZ operates in 30 countries around the world. As part of its push into Asia, the bank has set up units in Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.\nIt also has an extensive network of offices in the South Pacific including corruption hotspots Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste.\n\"ANZ firmly believes that eliminating bribery and corruption from international business transactions is a desirable goal,\" the bank said in its submission.\nSenator Sam Dastyari, who chairs the senate economics committee hearing the foreign bribery inquiry congratulated ANZ on the disclosure in its submission.\n\"These figures highlight the enormity of the challenges Australian companies face overseas even when they are trying to do the right thing,\" he said.\n\"The need for legislative reform is not only about catching out bad operators it's about making sure that companies who are trying do the right thing are able to do it in an easier way with clearer rules.\"\nThis year it emerged the bank had suspended seven traders as a result of an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission into rigging of bank bill swap rates .\nA spokesman for ANZ said \"the data doesn't include any staff involved in the BBSW issue as it covers the period to 30 September 2014\".\nResponding to inquiries from Fairfax Media, the ANZ spokesman said: \"We have only three staff members working in our Representative Office in Malaysia.

The bank declined to clarify whether staff from its Cambodian venture had breached its code of conduct during the 2014 financial year.\nANZ said it would also support a self-reporting regime that includes softer penalties for corruption and bribery including \"negotiated settlements, non-prosecution agreements and deferred prosecution agreements\".\n\"The current legislative framework does not give companies sufficient certainty as to when and what information or concerns should be raised with law enforcement and what are the consequences of that disclosure,\" the bank said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sdanck", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/anz-named-as-one-of-the-appalling-banks-in-ratefixing-probe-20150603-ghg0sz.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:10:33.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
