Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the completion of the transaction, expected benefits of the transaction, the ongoing relationship between the two parties after any closing of the transaction, and the growth potential of the business after any closing are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual future events and results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions that Windstream believes are reasonable but are not guarantees of future events and results. Actual future events and results of Windstream may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. \nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in Windstream's forward-looking statements include, among others: risks related to the anticipated timing of the closing of the proposed transaction; the ability to receive, or delays in obtaining, the necessary regulatory approvals or third party consents required to complete the transaction; risks that other conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied; the risk that the financing required to fund the transaction is not obtained; and those additional factors under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of Windstream's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov . \nIn addition to these factors, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially because of more general factors including, among others, general industry and market conditions and growth rates, economic conditions, and governmental and public policy changes. \nWindstream undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors that could cause Windstream's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect Windstream's future results included in other filings by Windstream with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov .
