Wayne Taylor by Rose Powell Andrew had been working for a technology company for three years before his best friend died unexpectedly. His employers sent their stunned and teary employee home and told him to take as much time as he needed.\nIt was two days before an email came from work asking him to quickly log in and fix a coding glitch.\nThe next day, he began receiving daily emails asking him when he was returning to work. The company had an already overdue software update to launch and it needed his sign-off.\nDishevelled, grieving and prone to mistakes, Andrew returned to the office, reviewed the code and sent the update live. It crashed within a few hours and cost the already struggling start-up thousands. No one in the office said a word or even made eye contact with Andrew – who shared his story with AFR Weekend on condition that his identity is not disclosed – until he resigned two weeks later.\nTech's outward glamour and billion-dollar valuations help mask an unpleasant underside: the hyper-competitive culture has made many tech firms awful places to work.\nHigh stakes and high pressure means hyped-up managers track their company's data so obsessively they wouldn't even notice a sobbing team member – or 10 . Rapid growth and a mantra of \"only hiring the best\" stacks the odds against creating healthy companies. How to keep high-performing A-types from ripping each other apart is an increasingly talked about problem – especially in the wake of The New York Times August expose of a toxic culture inside Amazon.\nLisa Rubinstein has seen it all too often – as stress levels rise, biological fight-or-flight responses kick in. Staff focus on self-preservation. Co-workers become less empathetic, less helpful. The culture turns poisonous and ethical standards leave the building, along with many of the staff.\nMatters get especially rough when tech companies start to fail or come out of their juvenile growth spurt phase and enter slower-paced adulthood.\n \"The challenge is type A personalities, which the tech industry means when they say 'the best', are wired to be highly competitive,\" says Rubinstein, founder of Axis NeuroPerformance, a consultancy that coaches leaders in emotionally intelligent leadership.\n'Pecking each other to death' \"And these kinds of people end up pecking each other to death.\"\nFor Australia, the problem is especially urgent as the country ponders how to build more tech companies of sufficient scale.\nOne person keenly involved in the challenge of building successful tech firms in Australia is Rich Wong of Accel Partners, a leading Californian venture capital fund that invested in Dropbox, Facebook and Spotify when such businesses were little more than ideas. Accel has invested more than $200 million across six Australian tech companies over the last decade.\n\"Culture is extremely important to us. It's probably the most important thing out of all the things we look for,\" Wong tells AFR Weekend in San Francisco.\nAny signs of an unedifying team dynamic are deal breakers when the Accel Partners are deciding which companies to invest in from among the thousands of pitches they get every quarter.\n\"It's not a do-gooder, apple pie rationale,\" he says. \"It matters if you really want to build sustainable companies for 5 to 10 years and beyond. If you can't recruit the best people, and challenge and excite them, you're ultimately not going to have a very successful profitable enterprise.\"\nThe ensuing flood of first-person accounts of tech industry horrors flushed out by the NYT's investigation into Amazon all but confirmed the notion that digital disruption is the domain of ruthless leaders who foster unrelenting expectations and slaughter their staff's spirits in a monthly blood bath, also known as KPI reviews.\nThese accounts revealed an industry in which companies can momentarily thrive despite having cultures in which underperforming staff work in near silence from their colleagues, pregnant women are frozen out, and middle managers build personal fiefdoms of their chosen team members, and everyone else.\nConcern is growing, but so too is a movement within the technology industry to mitigate the nasty side-effects of trying to change the world.\nObjective percentage ratios Talking about bad behaviour, bias and bickering is never easy. So the tech industry is turning to data to fix the problem. Melbourne-based start-up CultureAmp conducts comprehensive organisation-wide surveys to reveal cultural problems as a matrix of ratios to give companies insight into how they tick.\nIts data sets reveal issues that are almost industry-wide such as often women and non-Caucasian people feeling overlooked for promotion or outright undermined.\nSince launching just a few years ago the company's client base has grown to more than 10,000 and includes heavyweights like Atlassian, AirBnB, Pinterest and Adobe\nCultureAmp's founder and chief executive Didier Elzinga said technology companies present the usual cultural and team building challenges of businesses everywhere. It's just that in tech the problems are severely magnified.\n\"These companies when they take off grow at staggering rates. Many are more than doubling their head count each year. This means half of your team is always new so establishing culture is hard,\" he says.\n\"One of the really interesting things right now is companies are getting better at hiring more diversely, especially more women, but struggle to keep them which comes down to fixing and improving work environments.\"\nElzinga adds that getting culture right early is essential because after the rapid growth phase calms slightly, companies can find themselves far too large to significantly change practices or behaviours that have already taken root.\nThis is probably why when two tech veterans, Parker Harris and Marc Benioff, launched Salesforce 16 years ago, they sought to hardwire generous behaviours into the team right form the beginning. Salesforce, an automated sales management software company, is now the world's fourth largest software company.\nHighly collaborative style sought \"We will always need our culture to be highly collaborative,\" Harris told Fairfax Media in San Francisco.\n\"This is super important because if you take a bunch of type A people, they all want to do their own thing and build their own empire. The only way to fix that is you have to get everyone aligned so their individual mission is part of the company's plan.\"\nUnwilling to compromise on hiring the smartest people they could, the pair instead launched the Salesforce Foundation the same week they took their sales management software out to market.\nThrough the foundation, the company gives away 1 per cent of its equity (profits), product and staff time to support not-for-profit good causes.\n\"The foundation has been critical to keep our company healthy,\" foundation president Suzanne DiBianca says. \"It means the whole company is always striving for something positive and bigger than our selves, and that unites everyone.\"\nSalesforce now has a market cap of $US46 billion ($63 billion), and spends weeks each year going through processes to make sure its many business units and teams are aligned.\nSuch processes are critical for keeping a company afloat, Rubinstein says.\n\"Structures aren't as sexy as sales figures, but they matter just as much. The solution isn't to get rid of ruthless high-performers, it's about balancing that capability with continuously evolving empathy skills and building teams with a diversity of talent.\"\nThe question of culture was front of mind for Sydney-born email marketing software group CampaignMonitor, which spends hundreds of thousands of dollars carefully developing its company culture across both offices.\nAfter Accel's injection of $270 million in 2014, the team has established a second headquarters in San Francisco, more than doubled in size and hired a new chief executive.\n'How to keep each other happy, pumped, excited' When Alex Bard joined the company, he spent his first weeks having one-on-one catch ups with every single employee, many of whom thought it was a time-consuming hassle for a new leader.\n\"But after I was able to present back to the company what I had learned from every one of them, I think it help ensure the trust would continue, and that's critical for us,\" Bard says.\nAs companies grow, so too do silos and any lingering malcontent. To stop CampaignMonitor from descending into a series of squabbling factions, Bard and the company founders, Dave Greiner and Ben Richardson developed ways of talking and a web of meetings, training and frequent social events to keep the teams connected and aligned.\n\"There are ten thousand things we could do on any day to grow the company faster,\" Bard says. \"But the only thing I think about every single day is how do we keep each other happy, pumped and excited, because everything else flows from that.\"\nSo what ever happened to Andrew? Months after he left, he had heard from a grand total of one former co-worker. She worked in admin and Andrew remembers that she was so frequently yelled at that she often seemed close to tears. She emailed him to ask how he was going.\nHe got another coding job, and is now flirting with the idea of starting his own technology company. With his own rough experience still smarting in his mind, its seems fair to assume he'll lead a kinder team. Maybe he even poaches his former admin team mate and they can work together somewhere happier, healthier and ultimately more sustainable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:16:51.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
