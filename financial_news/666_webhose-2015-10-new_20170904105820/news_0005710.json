The Belfast-based broadcaster - which produces some of Northern Ireland's most popular shows - has struggled in recent months. \nThe company launched its nationwide UTV Ireland station in January. But it has had a disappointing start, reporting half-year losses of £7.5m this year. The group as a whole, UTV Media (LSE: UTV.L - news ) , reported pre-tax profits £5.5m last year. \nITV's acquisition cements its shift in focus from reality television and entertainment producers in the US, to drama and factual programme makers in the UK If approved, ITV will own 13 of the 15 regional licences for the Channel 3 network across the UK. \nChief executive Adam Crozier said: \"We are pleased that they are joining the ITV family. \n\"We have a long-standing relationship with UTV, which has been the leading commercial broadcaster in Northern Ireland for many years thanks to its strong regional identity and blend of excellent local programming\". \nJohn McCann, chief executive of UTV Media, said: \"Becoming part of the ITV Family is by far the best way to take UTV's television business forward with an ongoing focus to provide brilliant television to viewers right across Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:29:54.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
