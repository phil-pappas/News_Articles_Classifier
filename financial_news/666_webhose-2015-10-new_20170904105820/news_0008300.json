Like the international survey, this survey was also done as per international standards EN 13816,” the official said.\nCSS included various crucial aspects of Metro operations such as availability and accessibility, new facilities offered to customers, information, quality of service, customer services, outside Metro area, comfort and view on fare revision, security and safety, it added.\nThe official statement, however, states that the areas in which commuters expressed the need for improvement were pavements, lighting, cleanliness/orderliness and encroachment outside station premises.\nDMRC will take up these issues with the civic authorities and work towards necessary improvement, it added.\n 04, 2015 6:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:09:08.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
