Louie Douvis by Duncan Hughes Complaints about house construction are going through the roof as the building industry booms and annual spending on renovations reaches a record of nearly $2 billion, according to government statistics.\nA patchwork of competing regulations from myriad industry and government bodies provide limited safeguards, while gaps in domestic building insurance mean a shortage of protection.\n\"You have to do your due diligence,\" warns Daren McDonald, partner with ShineWing Australia and adviser to the property and construction industry.\n\"Make sure you are getting the best team of professionals. Ask friends and contacts who have had a good experience with builders or tradesmen, and then ask these for referrals.\"\nUntold grief: Pam Mulready at her Seddon home in Melbourne. Jesse Marlow Home owners are spending nearly a third more on DIY or professional home renovations than they did 10 years ago, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nConsumer bodies, such as NSW Fair Trading, report complaints about builders and rows about construction contracts are now among their most common cases, alongside traditional disputes about used cars and home appliances.\nProfessional standards Scathing reports by industry watchdogs including the Victorian Auditor-General about professional standards, oversight of building surveyors, monitoring of compliance and dispute resolution make it clear the best protection is self-protection.\n \"Cheap prices and Quote: s from a builder are a sure sign you are headed for disaster,\" warns Robert Auricchio, an associate with lawyers Slater & Gordon who specialises in building disputes.\n\"One trick is the builder providing a cheap Quote: and then stinging the client with additions to make up the shortfall.\"\n\"In some cases where variations were not agreed to in advance, the home owner is billed and the builder threatens to walk off the job unless paid.\"\nMcDonald advises property owners to check in advance if tradesmen and builders are professionally qualified, certified and insured.\n\"Ask for two or three references and be mindful they will always give you the names of their happiest clients,\" he adds.\nA search of names on court, professional tribunal and consumer affair websites might also reveal useful information.\nBathrooms and kitchens, which involve sub-contractors ranging from electricians and plumbers to plasterers, cabinet makers and builders, are popular rooms for renovation.\n\"Quality control is a big issue,\" says Auricchio.\nFor example, in Victoria, the registered builder does not need to supervise the work.\n\"Scope what needs to be done,\" says McDonald. \"Does the Quote: include everything needed to fully complete the project? For new homes this may include landscaping, fences, driveways and retaining walls. For renovations, make sure that all plumbing and electrical work is included.\"\nSource of complaints A constant source of complaints is the failure to included in signed drawings and contracts features and fixtures promised by the sales representatives who originally secured the renovation work.\nSelect fixtures and fittings, and make sure they are specified in the contract, warns a spokesman for Consumer Affairs Victoria.\nOther costly items that should be considered include building fees, planning permits, lodgement fees, inspection charges and government levies.\n\"Domestic building contracts usually contain provisions that clearly exclude prior representations,\" says Auricchio. \"You may have a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct but the cost of proceedings usually makes the claim commercially unviable.\"\nHe recommends taking photographs before, during and at completion.\n\"Also, engage your own building consultant at each stage. It sends a clear message that poor workmanship will be picked up before it is covered over.\"\nTypical examples of shoddy work that might not be immediately obvious to the untrained eye include incorrectly installed insulation; missing or inadequate flashing around windows; and insufficient nails in roof brackets.\nThe law sets out progressive payments during building stages from foundation laying to frame construction, external cladding and internal fixtures.\nTypically, 10 per cent deposits are charged for work worth less than $20,000, and 5 per cent for jobs that cost more.\nProperty owners are advised to seek confirmation of a builder's domestic building insurance and certificate of currency – which shows it is current and what it covers. Some lawyers recommend withholding the deposit until you have received an insurance certificate.\n\"Some builders load up contracts at the beginning or during one of the stages,\" warns Auricchio.\n\"Resist all threats by the builder to walk off the job if additional, unscheduled payments are not made. Often, this is a sign your builder is running short of funds and using your money to plug financial holes.\n\"Another trick is to disappear and stop returning calls when the owner has paid about 80 per cent of the contract price.\"\nAll contracts negotiable McDonald says all contracts are negotiable and it is reasonable to document what is needed to achieve a suitable outcome for those involved – and possibly avoid costly and lengthy legal proceedings.\nFor example, a dispute might arise at the end of a project because of concerns about defects or unreasonable expectations of quality.\nAuricchio says: \"At this stage it might be best to negotiate with the builder, perhaps suggesting that payment be made into a solicitor's trust account to be released once an independent building consultant approves the repair work.\"\nAt the completion of a project, home owners are advised to check everything in the contract is delivered and in working order before making the final payment.\nThey should also keep records of all documents, agreements and certificates relating to the contracts and understand their rights under implied warranties, which is a promise that a service, or product, is fit for its intended purpose.\nCase study A bitter wrangle between a building company and a Melbourne woman has dragged out the completion date of a home extension from six months to six years.\nPam Mulready, a former researcher at Deakin University, claims the delays have caused her untold grief.\nThe building company, Extension Factory, claims it has commissioned three independent reviews of the work and agreed to undertake recommended changes upon payment of outstanding fees.\nMulready signed a contract in July 2010 and moved in to alternative accommodation in the expectation that the work on her home in Seddon, in Melbourne's western suburbs, would be completed by Christmas 2011.\nEighteen months later it was still not complete and a lot of the work was not to her satisfaction.\nAlleged problems included an extension to the house being unlevel with the original structure, damage to existing fixtures including the fireplace, unlevel floorboards, problems with stormwater drainage and failure to replace the switchboard.\n\"It has cost me my savings and ruined my life,\" says Mulready.\nShe claims she had to quit her job because of the time needed to get the company to correct the problems and that legal and other fees forced her to sell an investment property.\n\"It has cost me more than $1 million,\" she says.\nRepresentations have been made by both sides to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Victorian Builders' Association.\nA spokesman for Extension Factory, which has about 100 clients a year, admits it had a \"few issues\" but claims it has attempted to resolve the problems through reviews, mediations and agreeing to changes.\n\"We are more than happy to fix items and complete the job,\" a company spokesman says. \"During the past 37 years we have had about 8000 clients. Maybe 1 per cent are not happy. We have hundreds-and-hundreds of testimonials. About one-quarter of our work comes from referrals. The problems come from problems in the existing building, not our extension.\"\nHe adds that the company has processes involving independent third parties in place to deal with any client complaints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:10:34.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
