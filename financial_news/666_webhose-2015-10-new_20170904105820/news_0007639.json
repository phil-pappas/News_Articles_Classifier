Jenny Evans by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Shaver Shop is considering cashing in on red-hot interest in specialty retailers and making a run at the Australian Securities Exchange boards early in the new year.\nIt is understood Shaver Shop's owners have met with brokers in recent weeks, seeking counsel on potential valuations and investor appetite for the seller of beard trimmers, electronic toothbrushes and everything hair removal.\nThey want to find out whether Shaver Shop could follow rival small cap retailers Baby Bunting Group , Adairs, Lovisa, Burson Group and Beacon Lighting, who have all had extremely successful ASX debuts in the past 18-months.\nMorgans, which worked on each of the above five floats, is expected to be in the frame along with the other brokers busy in small cap retail listings including Morgan Stanley. It's understood appointments, or a final decision to pursue an IPO, are yet to be made.\nShaver Shop's deliberations come after the company's owners abandoned plans for a trade sale or secondary private equity buyout. As Street Talk reported in June , Shaver Shop hired Canterbury Partners to test buyer interest and even sent an information memorandum to potential acquirers.\nIt is understood Shaver Shop's owners - a group of high net worth investors put together by former banker Brodie Arnhold's Arnhold Investments - decided it would be better to postpone the sale and look at joining the list of small cap retailers on the ASX.\nIt seems there is more equity and better valuations for such businesses in listed markets at the moment, than there is among private equity firms. Baby Bunting, for example, floated at 10.5-times forecast 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amoritsation, and last week jumped 33 per cent in its first three trading days.\nIt's understood Shaver Shop was advised it could float as early as February, but its owners are keen to take things a bit more slowly. The business is expected to turnover $160 million in the 2016 financial year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:03:39.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
