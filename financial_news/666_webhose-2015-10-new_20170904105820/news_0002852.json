In an interview with media recently, Mr Rajeev Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, revealed that there will be three new models in the 2015 Bajaj Avenger Range. Though he didn’t disclose the lineup, spy shots doing round on internet suggest that there will be two trims – Street and Cruise – powered by the same 220 DTS-i engine that does duty on the outgoing model. And unlike rumours, there may not be any 200cc engined model on sale.\nThe Bajaj Avenger 220 Cruise is expected to look largely identical to the current model, though it will get heavy chrome treatment and a new exhaust pipe. The Street version, on the other hand, has gone through significant cosmetic updates. The 220 Street version seems to have taken its inspiration from the Harley Davidson Street 750 with the identical all-black body paint. The bike’s engine, alloy and exhaust too will get black treatment. Digital instrument cluster and new graphics will further add to its appeal.\nThough there is no clarity if the company will tune the 220cc DTS-i engine for the new Avenger lineup, slightly more power will surely help improve the bike’s cruising capabilities. Just so you know, the 220cc DTS-i churns out 19bhp and 17.5Nm in its current state of tune.\n 13, 2015 4:05 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:23:45.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
