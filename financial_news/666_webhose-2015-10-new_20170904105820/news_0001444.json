Share on twitter by Karen Maley Investors are continuing to shun the commodity sector as low-cost producers refuse to pare back production despite prices being hard hit by slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy.\nOil prices suffered their biggest weekly fall in seven months and investors were disheartened by the biggest weekly increase in US crude stockpiles since April. According to the US Energy Information Administration, crude inventories rose by a staggering 7.6 million barrels, much higher than expected.\nAdding to the downward pressure, the world's leading energy forecaster predicted that the world's crude oil glut will continue through next year, as a result of higher output from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the slowdown in global growth.\nThe International Energy Agency warned of a \"marked slowdown\" in oil demand growth as the stimulus from lower prices fades and economic activity weakens in commodity-based countries.\n\"Oil at $US50 a barrel is a powerful driver in rebalancing the global oil market,\" the IEA said in its monthly report. \"But a projected marked slowdown in demand next year and the anticipated arrival of additional Iranian barrels … are likely to keep the market oversupplied through 2016.\"\nGoldman Sachs, an influential player in the commodities market, added to the pessimism by repeating its warning that the oil price would stay \"lower for longer\" as a result of excess supply.\nJeff Currie, a top Goldman commodity analyst, told journalists in London this week that excess supply, large inventories and weakening Chinese demand mean oil will probably trade below $US50 a barrel for most of the next 12 months.\n\"When you look at the supply coming out of the low-cost producers – Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq – it has surprised to the upside,\" he said. \"If you look at Norway and Brazil, you've also seen surprises in their production.\"\n And even though commodity prices have fallen close to six-year lows, resource giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have signalled they have no plans to cut their production levels.\n\"The difference between us and some of our competitors is that we have big, tier 1, high-margin businesses. Obviously we are not going to shut very cash-rich operations,\" Arnoud Balhuizen, BHP's head of marketing, noted.\nRio Tinto has adopted a similar line, warning it will not cut copper production.\n\"Why should I make cuts?\" Jean-Sebastien Jacques, head of copper and coal at Rio, said in an interview. \"If you have marginal assets and marginal projects and you have a pretty weak balance sheet, I think you may be in trouble pretty soon,\" he added.\nIndeed, BHP and Rio have stepped up their low-cost Pilbara iron ore operations even as commodity prices have tumbled in order to increase market share, at the expense of higher-cost rivals.\nKeeping it in the ground Their approach is in stark contrast to other key resource companies such as the Anglo-Swiss mining and trading house Glencore, which this month announced plans to cut its zinc production by more than a third (the equivalent of 500,000 tonnes per year) by shutting down or cutting back mine operations in Australia, South America and Kazakhstan.\nLast month Glencore said it would suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper production at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The company has also announced cuts to its Newcastle coal operations.\n\"We should not be increasing production in anticipation of China demand,\" Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg said in mid-August. \"Keep it in the ground. You can dig it out any time.\"\nThere was at least one bright spot for commodity bulls this week, with the gold price climbing close to $US1,200 an ounce – its highest level in more than three months – as investors decided that the latest spate of disappointing economic figures reduced the chances of the US central bank hiking interest rates this year.\nAll the same, the glimmer of optimism from gold will not be enough to offset the huge loss of jobs worldwide as resources companies, struggling to survive in the face of depressed prices, close loss-making projects and lay off workers.\nThis week troubled Australian energy group Santos announced it would cut a further 200 jobs as it steps up its efforts to cut costs.\nThe latest job reductions come on top of the 565 job cuts signalled by the debt-laden company at its half-year results in August.\nSimilarly, Glencore's decision to cut its zinc output will lead to the suspension of almost half its zinc production in Australia, with the expected loss of 535 jobs.\nBut the cuts announced by these two companies are only a small fraction of the thousands of job losses that Australia is likely to see as resources companies dig in for a long period of low commodity prices, and as the construction of major liquefied natural gas projects reaches completion.\nResources companies are also responding to lower prices by putting their capital spending plans on hold.\nThe implications of the recent emphasis on cost-cutting in the mining sector was discussed by Reserve Bank board members at their September meeting, who noted that \"it would probably lead to mining investment eventually stabilising at a lower level than had previously been expected\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:23.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
