The views expressed are their own. \nLONDON, Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 16 (Reuters) - European Union leaders have offered Turkey a possible 3 billion euros in aid, the prospect of easier travel visas and \"re-energised\" talks on membership in return for its help stemming the flow of migrants to Europe. This is all a pretty good win for Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan two weeks before the early elections he hopes will cement his authority. And what about the EU's oft-stated concerns over human rights in Turkey? Doused by realpolitik. \"In our neighbourhood, we are not asking any more for fundamental rights after the Arab Spring,\" said one EU official. \"We are asking for stability.\" \nBy the end of today Greece's parliament is expected to approve the set of austerity measures and reforms agreed with EU/IMF creditors for the next instalment of its bailout, which Athens hopes will open the way for debt relief talks. Among them is a bill which raises the retirement age to 67 years by 2022 and cuts pensions by 10 percent for people below that age who have retired but have yet to reach 67. About 200 protesters blocked the entrance to the ministry handling the reforms on Thursday but officials look determined to push ahead. \nMARKETS (at 0645 GMT) \nThe pendulum has swung a little way back towards a Fed rate rise this year after core U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . inflation came in higher than expected and that has lifted the dollar, although it's still on track for a losing week. Futures markets are not pricing in a 15 bps rise in U.S. interest rates until March but the data assuaged the worst fears, after some pretty ropey numbers of late, about the state of the U.S. economy. That has lifted Asian shares and Europe looks set to follow them higher at the open. Wall Street ended higher, with the S&P at an eight-week peak, after the data and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) 's 51 percent rise in quarterly profit. Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan are just in positive territory and Tokyo's Nikkei closed up 1.1 percent on the U.S. data and hopes for more stimulus in Japan. \nOil snapped a week-long losing streak as investors bet lower U.S. production would ease a global glut. Brent last up 54 cents at $50.27 a barrel. Gold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) down 0.3 percent at $1,1750 an ounce. \nEmerging market stocks and many big developing economy currencies saw a quiet end to their third straight week of gains on Friday. Polish markets were waiting to see the outcome of its national elections on Sunday and Turkey's lira dipped as signs that Europe will provide support to help control the flood of refugees from Syria and Libya were overshadowed about nerves ahead of elections there at the start of next month.
