The champagne remains in the cupboard. What I am saying is that we may be at the point where things get \"less bad\". supplied Share on twitter by Patrick Commins At the risk of sounding shockingly naive, every now and again it's worth thinking about what could go right. It's particularly useful when every headline is telling you how much money you are losing in your portfolio.\nInvestors are struggling to remember the good times, which is odd, because they were only a handful of months ago. In April we had the champagne chilling, ready to celebrate the benchmark ASX 200 Index breaching 6000. Those bottles of bubbly remain firmly un-popped after some massive bank equity raising smashed bank share prices and took the wind out of the market's sails. Then collapsing oil prices sparked renewed commodity complex losses, which rolled into a Chinese sharemarket rout, an emerging market currencies \"crisis\" and, finally, a spooked US Fed.\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying things are about to suddenly get better. The champagne remains in the cupboard. What I am saying is that we may be at the point where things get \"less bad\".\nOur starting point is the highest short interest in US stocks since the Lehman collapse almost exactly seven years ago, according to Merrill Lynch. At the same time, global fund managers have the lowest relative exposure to emerging markets in a decade. We have Glencore shares collapsing, and Origin Energy this week announcing a massive equity raising alongside a 40 per cent cut in dividends.\nHopeful signs But behind these shocking headlines there have been hopeful signs over the past few weeks. Oil prices have stabilised, and August may prove the low for that market. Emerging market currencies have proved more resilient to bad news. Chinese shares are no longer in freefall and were positively sedate in September. A key Chinese factory activity indicator, the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index, this week came in slightly ahead of expectations and unchanged from the month before. The number wasn't better, and was still in contractionary territory, but it wasn't worse, and that set the scene for a handy afternoon rally on the ASX.\n\"Most of the ingredients for stability and reversal and rally into the year end are in place,\" says Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital, although he warns it \"won't be a straight line\".\nNaeimi is now starting to \"step back into the market\" after holding a lot of cash in recent months, taking particular interest in European shares and Asian sharemarkets, such as those in Taiwan, Korea and China H-shares.\n How markets could rally So let's consider a road map of how markets can rally heading into the new year.\nIt begins on Thursday when Alcoa kicks off the US quarterly earnings season, in what may prove a defining period for investors globally. Forecasts are for American corporate profits to be 3.9 per cent lower from a year ago, on Thomson Reuters data. Half of reporting companies' profits are expected to post lower earnings, thanks to a combination of lower oil prices, a strong currency and weak global demand. Expectations for future quarters are falling as well. A rolling 12-month forward earnings per share forecast now stands near negative 2 per cent, the lowest since late 2009, when it was down 10.1 per cent.\n\"The US reporting season is the No. 1 trigger\" for a potential end-of-year rally, Naeimi says. \"If earnings come through, then it doesn't take long to turn investors from being negative to being positive.\"\nIf we see companies beating the already very low sales growth and earnings expectations, that may cause investors to take another look at valuations, which are clearly better than they were six weeks ago.\nInvestors have half-convinced themselves that a global recession is just around the corner, and more optimism about the US corporate sector will go a long way to allaying fears about the state of the country's – and the world's – economy.\nIf US profits surprise pleasantly, then maybe the focus will turn to the still resilient American consumer, or the fact that business sentiment in Europe remains robust despite fears that an emerging market meltdown would decimate the region's exporters.\nSo that's the second step – the discounting of a global recession, at which point investors may be prepared to see the good in addition to the bad in other parts of the world, China and other emerging markets being obvious candidates.\n\"If you get some decent stats in terms of a little bit more expansion out of China, then people could start to concentrate more on the services rather than the industrial side of the economy – that could be a catalyst [for better sentiment],\" says Altair Asset Management chief investment officer Philip Parker.\nLocal opportunities And Australian shareholders should enjoy any improved sentiment about emerging markets, given that we have been increasingly been seen among global investors as a proxy for China.\nParker sees opportunities in companies like Sydney Airport, pointing to the recent tripling of China Air's weekly flights into Australia, as well as healthcare names like hospital operator Ramsay Healthcare, which is now cautiously moving into Asia.\nStaying local, it's also worth noting one X factor that could see banks, which have been a primary drag on our market, rallying into the end of the year: what Macquarie analysts call \"the dividend run-up effect\". That's where, the analysts explain, stocks paying attractive dividends tend to be bid up in the lead-up to their ex-dividend date.\n\"With the sell-off that began in April the banks are currently trading at valuations not seen in years,\" they write. The analysts believe the November ex-dividend dates for Westpac, NAB, ANZ and Bank of Queensland will act \"as a catalyst to return valuations to more normal levels relative to the market\".\nThat could provide some handy and much-needed momentum to the ASX over the coming month, even if that same effect tends to drag the other way post the ex-div date.\nNone of this is a prediction – I'm not paid enough to make a fool of myself trying to forecast the market. But it is a possibility, and not a terribly unlikely one, that markets can end 2015 on a brighter note.\nAll we need is a pleasant surprise or two.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:09:30.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
