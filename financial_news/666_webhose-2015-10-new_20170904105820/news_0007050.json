However the decline in sales accelerated in the period hit by weak consumer electronics demand in its top market of Brazil and the August bombings in Thailand. \n\"This is a good set of sales results for Casino. The bad news in Latin America, mainly Brazil, and Thailand was known before,\" Bernstein analysts, who rate the stock with an outperform rating, said. \nUnilever (NYSE: UL - news ) rose 4 percent after the consumer goods maker reported better than expected third-quarter sales, although it added sluggish markets globally continued to weigh on its performance. \nHowever, Burberry fell 9 percent after a sharp sales slowdown in China and Hong Kong led the British luxury goods company to miss forecasts for first-half sales growth and warn of an increasingly challenging environment. \nSyngenta (LSE: 0QOP.L - news ) also reported disappointing results which sent its shares down 2.8 percent. Sales for the Swiss agricultural chemicals group fell a worse-than-expected 12 percent hit by currency weakness in its second biggest market, Brazil. \nVolkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) edged up 0.05 percent, shrugging off news that the German automotive watchdog KBA will force the carmaker to recall 2.4 million vehicles in connection with a emissions test rigging scandal. \nItalian shipbuilder Fincantieri fell as much as 18 percent, its biggest daily fall since Rome privatised it last year, and reached an all-time low after launching a profit warning citing woes in Brazil. The company also said it had not taken any decision yet on a possible cash call. \nMining stocks were the top sectoral gainer in Europe, helped by London copper prices approaching four-week highs. \n(Reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Janet Lawrence)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:09:18.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
