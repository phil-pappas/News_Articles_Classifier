If the market price of power ever exceeds the guaranteed price, which will be index-linked, EDF will pay back the difference. \nAt the time, EDF said it wanted only a 45pc to 50pc stake in the project. It has since been forced to absorb the 10pc stake that would have been funded by reactor-maker Areva (Paris: FR0011027143 - news ) , after Areva’s financial difficulties resulted in EDF (Hanover: E2F.HA - news ) taking over its reactor unit. \nEDF has also been unable to attract outside investors to the project, with group chief Jean Bernard-Levy admitting are deterred by the example of delays and cost overruns seen in the construction of EDF’s EPR reactor design in France and Finland. \nEDF hopes to attract further investors and sell down its stake once construction is underway. \nA spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"Nuclear power is a key part of our low carbon energy mix and will provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for future generations. The UK Government and EDF are continuing to work together to finalise the Hinkley project which will power nearly six million homes and create more than 25,000 jobs. The deal must represent value for money and is subject to approval by Ministers.” \nEDF declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:10:12.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
