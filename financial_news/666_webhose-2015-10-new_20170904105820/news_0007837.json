Rapid DNA allows personnel with minimum technical training to produce forensic DNA profiles in two hours or less. The goal of using Rapid DNA is to produce the DNA profile while a suspect is still in custody, thereby accelerating the identification and apprehension of criminal suspects more quickly than currently possible with traditional laboratory-based DNA profiling methods. Samples processed on the Rapid DNA platform have been used by eight Police forces across England and Wales. To date, the profiles generated by the Rapid DNA platform have produced a total of 17 matches against the NDNAD, including burglaries and other serious crimes. \n“This same day DNA service offered by KFS has provided a great opportunity for forensic services to further support police investigations in a very timely manner. In the past we have battled against the PACE clock to get a quick DNA result to assist the decision making in respect of the arrestee,” stated Lisa Lee from Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate. “This time pressure is removed with this same day service and enables more effective direction of investigative resources based on the results achieved.” \nAccording to Paul Hackett of Key Forensic Services, the faster processing time of Rapid DNA makes a significant difference to the law enforcement community. “What used to be considered an urgent or premium service has become KFS ‘business as usual’. We aim to offer the most competitive and responsive DNA service in the world, and today KFS sets a new benchmark in DNA timeliness.” \nRobert Schueren, President and CEO of IntegenX, agrees with Hackett. “The ability of Key Forensic Services to offer such testing routinely, and upload and search results against the NDNAD demonstrates the technology is mainstream and can be done as a part of routine law enforcement. We foresee the vast majority of DNA profiling will be done in real time and, like fingerprinting, will become a common biometric tool in the law enforcement.” \nIntegenX Inc., headquartered in Pleasanton, California, is the market leader of Rapid Human DNA identification technology. IntegenX’s technology platforms integrate advanced fluidics, optics, and biochemistry capabilities to produce sample-to-answer products for DNA-based human identity testing for forensics and law enforcement applications.
