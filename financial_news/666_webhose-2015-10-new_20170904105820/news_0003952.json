All the wig and costume sellers we spoke to have already sold out of their swoopy marmalade locks — and creating Trump’s tresses at home is no easy task.\nWig seller MaxWigs.com says sales for the $29 “Donald TrumpDeluxe,” which the company has offered for years, are “out of the norm” (usually Halloween sales don’t truly pick up until late September or early October) — and as of mid-September it had sold out of the wig. “People were rush shipping them — they want them now,” says Ray Lenci, the president of MaxWigs.com, who is re-upping his stock of Trump wigs — as of late September, he had restocked the wig. “We’ve sold more Trump wigs than ever before.”\nIt’s the same deal at HalloweenCostumes.com , which sold out of their $12.99 Billionaire Wig this month, and at VogueWigs.com , which sold out of its $29.95 Characters Line Donald TrumpWig. As of mid-September, all the companies were working on re-upping their stock to meet demand.\nThat may not be enough. “We expect to sell them out again when they’re back in stock,” says Mark Bietz, the vice president of product for HalloweenCostumes.com. For those dying for a Donald-esque wig right now, some sellers on Amazon do have them in stock.\nRubie A 'billionaire wig' for sale on Amazon. Google Trends says it’s seeing huge demand for the Trump wig as well: Trump costume searches have increased 30-fold since May, and “Trump wig” is the No. 1 most searched item. And there were 25% more searches for “Donald Trump wig” than “Donald Trump mask” from May to the present.\nIt’s not easy (or cheap) to make a Trump wig — at least if you want one that looks nearly identical to the Donald’s real hair (and yes, it’s real, according to Trump, who told a crowd in South Carolina last month that “it’s my hair … I swear,” and then called a woman onstage to pull it as proof).\nHigh-end wig and hair-extension specialist Angelo David Pisacreta, the owner of Angelo David Salon , says that to create the most realistic Trump wig, you’d need to use “high quality European hair” — this is very fine (and expensive) hair — and place that atop lace, which will help you achieve the Donald’s natural hairline. Custom wigs using premium real hair can easily cost hundreds of dollars; most of the mass-market Trump-esque wigs use synthetic hair, which is cheaper, but give you a less realistic look.\nIf you’re hoping to be Trump for Halloween and can’t afford a custom wig or can’t get your hands on a ready-made wig, we asked stylists how you can achieve the ‘do at home. It’s “hard to achieve,” says Don Bewley, co-founder of eco-friendly haircare brand Eufora .\n“There’s a lot of stuff going on there,” says stylist Ricky Pennisi, founder of hair products company RI CI products .\nTrump has not yet responded for our request for comment about how he styles his own hair, but for all of you set on being the Donald for Halloween, we asked some experts how to style your own tresses to look like Trump’s.\nLong on the sides, bald in the middle\n“Let your hair grow at least 10 centimeters,” says Charlie le Mindu, a stylist and author of “Haute Coiffure ”. Then, “shave the middle top of your head like a monk,” he says. This will give you the right launching pad for a comb-over. (Note that Trump himself has a “pretty decent hairline,” says Pennisi; still, if you want an at-home style, shaving or close-cutting the hair atop your head can make this easier for you to achieve.)\nVolume, volume, volume\nHair that seems to defy gravity is no easy task to create. Bewley says Trump likely “uses a blow dryer to help achieve the volume he is so well known for.” To get said volume, you’ll need to use a brush to hold hair in place and blow dry sections upwards, he says. Then use a product like root lift mousse or spray that can keep hair standing high.\nThe shellacked comb-over\nThe comb-over itself is easy — comb your side-tresses until they cover that shaved or thinning spot atop your head — though keeping it in place is not easy. Use “a lot of hairspray to finish the look and keep it in place,” says Bewley; Le Mindu recommends “a strong spray.”\nT h at special shade of marmalade-blonde\nOf course, no ‘do would be complete without the proper color. “If I had to recreate that color, I’d go to CVS,” says Pisacreta — who thinks an “out-of-the-box color” on your own hair would best mimic the Donald’s current light strawberry blonde shade.Pennisi recommends looking for a golden blonde shade at the drugstore that seems to match Trump’s (look for a level 8 color, he says; hair color tends to go from 1, which is very dark, to 10, which is very light). But don’t assume you can just go marmalade-blonde in one-step: Those with dark hair may have to achieve this color gradually.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/trends/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1909399647", "http://www.angelodavid.com/"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:16:06.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
