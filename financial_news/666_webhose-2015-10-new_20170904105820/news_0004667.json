Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Commonwealth Bank of Australia's home loan interest rate hike is proof that the country's banking oligopoly will defend the interests of its shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders. The biggest losers will be those who rely on bank deposits for their income.\nWe now know that the fully franked dividends that have driven bank share prices to record levels will be protected for as long as possible. Australia's record-high dividend payout ratios from banks are going to be sustained even though the rate of growth in dividends will slow.\nIronically, the relative attraction of those dividends will increase when the Reserve Bank of Australia is forced to respond to the banks by cutting interest rates on Melbourne Cup Day .\nThe RBA has been concerned about the economy's sub-trend growth. It will not want the negative hit to sentiment from a round of home loan rate increases to impact on the important Christmas trading period.\nWhen CBA followed Westpac Banking Corp in raising its standard variable home loan rate , it directly linked the move to the prudential regulator's demand for increased capital to make the banking system safer.\nBanks are being forced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to hold more capital after David Murray's financial system inquiry found they were less well-capitalised than their peers overseas.\nWhen faced with these demands, banks first pulled the equity capital lever. They raised about $18 billion this year to lift their tier one capital ratios to about 10 or 11 per cent. The increase in interest rates on standard variable home loans means the banks can earn more on their assets and build more capital for the next round of higher capital charges.\nDividends first UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said in a note this week that the recent 25-basis-point home loan hike by Westpac would lift its return on equity from 15 per cent to 15.3 per cent.\nHe upgraded his profit numbers for Westpac following last week's rate hike and the release of a solid full-year profit number.\nMott thinks the banks will have to raise billions of dollars in additional capital.\nHigher capital requirements are on the way because of a toughening of the global rules called Basel 4 and the imposition of a leverage ratio, which lowers the amount of money that can be earned on each dollar of capital.\nAnother reason for higher capital charges is a requirement that banks have higher levels of \"total loss-absorbing capital\".\nBut when faced with all these demands for higher capital, the banks have obviously decided not to slash their dividends. Such a move would have a drastic effect on share prices, which in turn would negatively impact all of the country's superannuation savings.\nBanks form an important part of the asset allocation of super because they comprise such a large part of the index and they offer yields of about 6 per cent.\nThe industry's oligopolistic structure means that it has enormous pricing power. When one member of the oligopoly moves, it is virtually guaranteed that the others will follow.\n$1.68b profit hike This time around, Westpac took the early political flak. It was left hanging for about a week before CBA followed with a less aggressive 15-basis-point rate hike.\nThe remaining members of the oligopoly, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank, are certain to follow CBA and Westpac. ANZ and NAB can choose to follow Westpac's 25-basis-point hike or CBA's 15-basis-point rise.\nEither way, the interest rates on about $1.2 trillion worth of Australian mortgages will go up before the end of the year.\nAssuming the average increase in rates is 20 basis points, then the back-of-the-envelope maths says that the additional interest income on that will be about $2.4 billion. When you take account of the corporate tax rate of 30 per cent, you end up with additional profit for the entire banking industry of about $1.68 billion.\nCBA's home loan rate hike will not please Treasurer Scott Morrison . But he will probably be pleased that the increased bank profits will deliver him an additional $720 million in revenue.\nThere is a view among some bankers that Australia did not have to go down the route of ensuring its banks were \"unquestionably strong\", as demanded by David Murray.\nThe proponents of this argument say that the banks managed to get through the financial crisis with tier one capital of about 6 to 7 per cent. They are now being forced to hold tier one capital of about 10 to 11 per cent. Also, it is probably headed higher, to 12 to 13 per cent.\nThis argument does not hold water when you consider the concentration of housing risk that is prevalent in the Australian economy. Apart from the widespread investment in banks through super funds, there is the exposure to housing through negatively geared property investments, as well as family homes.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-10-22T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:09:38.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
