MSCI's all-country world equity index was down 0.1 percent.\nChinese stocks jumped over 3 percent in heavy volume to end at their highest since Aug. 21. China's central bank took fresh steps to inject liquidity into the economy and said the stock market's correction \"is almost over.\"\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday.\nGREENBACK REMAINS WEAK\nThe dollar index edged lower, trading near its lowest in almost a month.\nThe euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1368 and the yen 0.2 percent stronger at 119.96 to the greenback.\nChina's yuan firmed as far as 6.3175 to the dollar, its strongest since the Aug. 11 devaluation.\n\"We could get some further weakness in the dollar versus the euro and yen, but those two are mainly along for the ride. Most of the weakness will be concentrated on emerging currencies, said Stephen Gallo, a strategist with BMO in London.\nSpot gold rose 0.4 percent after gaining 1.6 percent last week.\nCopper rose following a more than 3 percent gain last week after production cuts by Glencore boosted base metals, but analysts warned the shift in output may not be enough to offset weak demand growth in China.\nBrent was down 58 cents a barrel at $52.07 after reaching an earlier high of $53.31. U.S. light crude was down 78 cents at $48.85.
