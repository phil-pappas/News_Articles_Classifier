Alex Ellinghausen \"As things cool off in the mining side of the economy we do need to look at new ways to boost growth and there's a recognition that startups have a big role to play,\" he said.\n\"Particularly working with Bill as a leader, we're trying to send a message to startups that their existence is recognised.\"\nLabor policies Last month Labor announced a number of new startup targeted polices including entrepreneurial visas and a startup year for university students.\n Up to 2000 foreign university graduates and 2000 entrepreneurs wanting to start their own business would be able to come to Australia under the new visas.\nThe $5.5 million startup year policy would also let university students want to start their own business access a HELP loan of about $10,000 of funding.\n\"This is of practical assistance and it also signals to the wider community that we value entrepreneurs,\" Mr Husic said.\n\"It has to be interpreted as starting to break down the culture which works against startups. People are focused on getting into university or TAFE and into a salary or wage-based position and we're saying that if you have a good idea in university, we'll encourage you to pursue it.\"\nMr Husic said there were more startup policy announcements to come.\nDifferent to small business \"The sector wanted evidence that there is a distinct difference between small business and startups and this is it,\" he said.\n\"We've said publicly that innovation shouldn't wait for a federal election and we've put forward ideas that we're happy for the government to explore and take up themselves.\"\nMr Husic applauded the move by Mr Roy to hold a so-called Policy Hack alongside startup incubator BlueChilli this weekend. The event aims to bring together the startup and venture capital communities with policy makers to thrash out new ideas for improving conditions for startups.\nBut Mr Husic said his main focus would be on tackling access to talent and capital and fostering a strong startup ecosystem.\n\"The biggest thing we have to tackle now is the low rate of startup transformation in Australia,\" he said.\n\"We have the know how and the ingenuity and now we have to make it a reality, either by dealing with talent, capital flows, regulations that stand in the way or having a more reactive regulatory framework.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:04:51.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
