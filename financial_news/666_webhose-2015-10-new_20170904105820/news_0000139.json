Revenue fell 18.3% to $6.9 billion, missing views of $7.1 billion. That's the third time in four quarters that Goldman's revenue has declined. \nThe volatile markets, fueled by concerns of slowdowns in China and other emerging markets, hurt a number of Goldman Sachs units during the quarter. Institutional client services revenue fell 15% to $3.2 billion. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities tumbled by one-third to $1.5 billion. Equities trading revenue rose 9% to $1.8 billion.

Financial-advisory revenues soared 36% to $809 million as Goldman remained one of Wall Street's top banks for mergers and acquisitions. \nTotal underwriting fell 14% to $747 million. Equity underwriting plunged 55% to $190 million, as fees on initial public offerings and stock sales declined. Debt underwriting rose 25% to $557 million. \nGoldman's expenses fell 5% to $4.8 billion. \nReturn on equity was 7% in Q3. Total assets under supervision rose 3% to $1.2 trillion as of Sept. 30. \nGoldman shares rose 1.4% to 181.95 in early afternoon trading in the stock market today . Its current IBD Composite Rating is 47, meaning it is being outperformed by 53% of other publicly traded companies. \nCitigroup Legal Costs Dive \nCitigroup also was impacted by choppy stocks, though it benefited from favorable comparisons to the year-earlier period, when it had to restate earnings due to mammoth legal costs. \nThe New York-based bank earned $1.28 in Q3, up 13.9% from a year earlier, topping estimates by 3 cents. Net income jumped 51% to $4.3 billion, thanks to significantly lower legal expenses. Revenue fell 7.4% to $18.496 billion, missing views for $18.541 billion. That's the seventh time in eight quarters that Citigroup's revenue has fallen. \nOperating expenses dropped 18% to $10.7 billion, with Citigroup joining Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America in cutting costs as business flagged. \nCitigroup's overall trading revenue slipped 7% to $3.6 billion, slightly worse than the bank had forecast last month. JPMorgan Chase reported a 6% decline in trading revenue, while Bank of America trading revenue fell 4%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:44:03.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
