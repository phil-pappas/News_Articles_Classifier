Dudley said, cautioning that recent data signal growth may be slowing.\n“If the economy performs in line with my forecast, I would favor lifting off later this year. But it’s a forecast. It’s not a commitment,” Dudley told an audience in Washington Thursday, repeating an argument that he used on Friday and noting that “sometimes the forecasts are right, and sometimes the forecasts are wrong.”\nTepid U.S. economic data are clouding the outlook for liftoff this year and Fed governors Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo said earlier this week they favored patience on the timing of the first rate increase since 2006.\nDudley acknowledged that recent data have been subdued, though he said the domestic economy was performing pretty well, even with headwinds including an inventory adjustment and weaker trade.\nEconomy ‘Slowing’ “The recent economic news suggests the economy is slowing, and we have these developments in China and emerging-market economies that could develop in a way” that could come back and hurt the U.S. economy and inflation, Dudley said.\n“When I put it all together, I still see an economy that is growing a bit above trend,”\nhe said.\nFigures on retail sales, producer prices and inventories released this week all were weaker than forecast, suggesting weakness in inflation and third-quarter growth. Those come on the heels of a September jobs report that fell short of estimates.\nInvestors have cut to 30 percent the probability of a rate increase by policy makers’ December meeting, according to pricing in the federal funds futures market. That compares to 60 percent a month ago, assuming the effective funds rate is 0.375 percent after liftoff.\nDudley earlier discussed monetary policy rules like the so-called Taylor Rule at an event at the Brookings Institution and warned they could lead officials to make mistakes because they aren’t forward-looking and they don’t incorporate key forces shaping the economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:30:48.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
