Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: This Dhanteras you will be able to buy sovereign gold coins — which will be marginally cheaper than those sold by private players — in addition to getting the option of buying bonds, instead of the yellow metal in precious form. According to officials, the gold monetisation scheme (GMS) — which will help you earn some interest on broken or discarded pieces of jewellery lying in bank lockers — and the India gold bullion scheme will be launched on November 5. The bonds, GMS and the bullion scheme are meant to reduce import of the precious metal, which puts pressure on trade deficit and in extreme situations impacts the exchange rate. In the initial lot, the government has ordered 50,000 India Gold Coins — which are being manufactured by Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India — and will be sold through banks, post offices and MMTC, the public sector companies which will market it with the World Gold Council . This is the first time that the government has launched sovereign coins in India, which are available in several countries. Initially, 20,000 coins of 5 gram and 30,000 coins of 10 gram have been ordered, sources said. They added that private players usually impose around 12% \"making charges\" on such coins but the India Gold Coin will be 2-3% cheaper. While gold coin sales peak around Diwali, market players said the launch of sovereign coins could have been advanced so that there was more awareness. The schemes were announced in the last Budget and are being operationalized now. More than the coins, the government is keen to push GMS and gold bonds. The borrowing calendar for the current fiscal has been pegged at Rs 15,000 crore but the timing of the fund-raise is still to be announced.
