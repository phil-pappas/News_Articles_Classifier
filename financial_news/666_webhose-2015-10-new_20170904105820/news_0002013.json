The so-called following 'Cyber' Monday is thought to be the biggest day for online buying. In the last few years, brands have extended offers to UK shoppers over the Black Friday weekend and through to Cyber Monday, which has prompted more and more retailers to get in on the act. \nCurrys and PC World has promised that in 2015 its Black Friday sale will be smoother than ever, and is set to drop the cost of everything from TVs and laptops, to washing machines and fridges. \nAnd John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield has said that sales will be more \"thoughtful\" this year. \nThe British retailer appeared to caught a little off guard by Black Friday last year, as it cut prices with the slogan: \"If our competitors have a sale, we have a sale\".
