State revenue has grown 4.5 percent in the first quarter of the budget year that ends June 30. \nBut Kentucky's road fund did not fare well. The fund made up mostly of gasoline taxes fell 20.5 percent in September, mostly because of a drop in the tax rate. Lawmakers had planned for the fund to increase 2.1 percent this year. But for that to happen, collections would have to increase 5.8 percent for the rest of the year. \nThe Consensus Forecasting Group meets Tuesday to revise official forecasts for the next biennium. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:10:50.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
