Repeating the experiment in human cells grown in lab cups, the scientists found that cancerous skin cells inserted with NAC and vitamin E, another strong antioxidant, became better at invading adjacent tissue.\n‘ There are no conclusive studies showing antioxidant supplements would be beneficial for them [cancer patients] and there’s growing evidence it could be harmful. ’\n—Martin Bergö\n, a professor at the Sahlgrenska Cancer Center at the University of Gothenburg. More research is needed to confirm the findings. Still, the scientists at Sahlgrenska Academy say the findings supports a growing body of evidence that antioxidant supplements could help different types of cancer cells grow faster. The study was published in the medical journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday.\nPrevious studies have shown an increased risk of prostate cancer for patients taking vitamin E supplements and have linked antioxidants to the spread of lung tumors in both mice and human cells. The Sahlgrenska study is the first to demonstrate that some antioxidants may cause malignant melanoma to metastasize at a quicker pace.\nENLARGE Martin Bergö, a professor at the Sahlgrenska Cancer Center at the University of Gothenburg who led the study, emphasized that the researchers only looked at nutritional supplements and that people should feel comfortable continuing to eat antioxidant-rich foods.

Around 73,000 Americans are likely to be diagnosed with the condition in 2015, of which nearly 10,000 will die, according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.\nPeople who have cancer or who are at a higher risk of developing cancer, such as smokers or those with a family history of the disease, should avoid nutritional supplements that contain antioxidants, said Mr. Bergö.\n“There are no conclusive studies showing antioxidant supplements would be beneficial for them, and there’s growing evidence it could be harmful,” said Mr. Bergö.\nAntioxidants, which are found in many fruits and vegetables, help protect cells from damage and have long been thought to lower the risk of certain diseases including cardiovascular problems. Makers of antioxidant supplements often promote their products’ health and disease-fighting benefits, but a growing body of researchers question some of those claims.\nMr. Bergö said the overall conclusion from the various studies is that antioxidants protect healthy cells from so-called free radicals, which can lead to cell damage and disease, but they also help a tumor once it has developed. “Antioxidants don’t cause cancer but if you already have small tumors it can speed up the process,” he said. “Simply put, antioxidants help both healthy cells and cancer cells.”\nThe Swedish Cancer Society, a nonprofit organization, said cancer patients should always ask their doctor before taking dietary supplements. This study “shows the great complexity when it comes to antioxidants’ effect on the origin, growth and spread of cancer,” Klas Kärre, chairman of the society’s research committee, said.\nWrite to Anna Molin at anna.molin@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR317_antica_M_20151008105350.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR317_antica_P_20151008105350.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:33:03.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
