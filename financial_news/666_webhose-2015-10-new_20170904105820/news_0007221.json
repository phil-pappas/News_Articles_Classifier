(Photo: Chevrolet Volt) \n11 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAUSALITO, Calif. -- There's every reason to love the new, second-generation Chevrolet Volt.\nThe front end of this pioneering, underappreciated plug-in compact has been given a fancier look and the car is more shapely overall. The dashboard doesn't feel like it's trying to imitate a hard-plastic appliance anymore. The gas-powered engine is now quiet enough that it silently take over from battery power without the driver really being able to tell.\nWe only wish the 2016 Chevy Volt had a little more pizzazz. It's all practicality, no flash.\nThe new Volt feels like any competent small car. It's quiet, sure-footed and saves tankloads of gas. But don't expect a clot of jealous neighbors to wander over to your driveway with quizzical looks.\nThe new Volt feels like Chevrolet wanted it to become more mainstream. In the process, it lost some personality. This car was more fun as a brat. Now it's a grown up.\nOf course, there's a lot to appreciate about grown ups. Outside, it's less angular, less extreme in appearance. From a distance, it looks like any other well-designed General Motors small car. The appearance is likely to stay fresh, longer.\nThe new 2016 Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric car with a backup gas engine is coming to showrooms with longer electric range and other improvements  Chevrolet Fullscreen The all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt plug-in looks less unusual than the last generation  Chevrolet Fullscreen The all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt gets a new front-end design  Chevrolet Fullscreen The all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt is large enough that it can fit a fifth passenger  Chevrolet Fullscreen Two huge displays dominate the interior of the 2016 Chevrolet Volt  Chevrolet Fullscreen A black and tan interior is one of the options on the new 2016 Chevrolet Volt .  electric car with extended range showcases a new brandy interior along with a sleeker, sportier design that offers 50 miles of EV range, greater efficiency and stronger acceleration Fullscreen The Chevrolet Volt is charged from a port near the front doors  Chevrolet Fullscreen The all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt electric car has longer electric range  Chevrolet Fullscreen Like this topic?

The interior feels more upscale, although a high contrast black-and-tan interior combination wasn't exactly to our liking. There's now a fifth seat -- if the extra rear passenger doesn't straddling the rear hump in back that's part of the T-shaped battery pack.\nThe dashboard ditches the white or black hard plastic around the center stack like an iPod or coffee maker and now is just dominated by two larger display screens. One is in front of the driver and the other is in the middle.\nBesides navigation, audio and climate control, the screens impart information about how the Volt is stacking up on electric range and fuel use. Like Toyota's Prius, it has a screen showing which way the electrons are flowing to help coach drivers toward more gas savings.\nThe redesigned Volt is a darling for GM engineers, who poured their souls into drawing more range and power from its batteries. The electric only range is now 53 miles before the 1.5-liter gas engine kicks in, what GM says is a nearly 40% improvement. The new electric motors are 12% more efficient and 100 pounds lighter than the outgoing model.\nDriving around the hills north of San Francisco, we tried to drain the car's batteries over a long afternoon -- and couldn't. The car always seemed to have reserve electricity, recharging itself during braking.\nBetween the juice and gas engine, the new Chevy Volt has a range of 420 miles. In everyday commuting, with owners charging the car in the garage ever night, Chevy officials say most will go 1,000 miles between visits to the filling station.\nWith those kind of numbers, even in times of low gas prices, you'd think that Chevrolet Volt would have sold better. GM says it has put 80,000 of them on the streets since it went on sale for the 2011 model year. That's not a lot considering the high expectations GM once had for it. This year, GM sold 9,264 through the first three quarters of the year, down 36.3% from a year ago.\nIt won't help that the new one, which is just coming to dealerships, will be limited in sales to California, Oregon and some East Coast states until supplies build. \"We're going where customer demand is,\" says Steve Majoros, Chevrolet's marketing director.\nChevrolet is held back by its relative high price -- $33,995 including destination charges but before up to $7,500 in federal tax incentives. The Volt starts at twice the price of the conventionally powered and similarly sized Chevy Cruze. But at the same time, Volt is about half the price of the cheapest Tesla Model S.\nAt least Volt has become a mainstay of the Chevrolet lineup, not a knee-jerk reaction to chaotic gas prices. It's now a \"poster child\" for GM's high-tech prowess, Majoros says. Pizzazz? That's another matter.\n\"It's done everything we've wanted the car to do in its category,\" he says.\nWhat Stands Out \n•Hush: Engine or battery, both are quiet\n•Range: 420 miles between electricity and gas\n•Interior: Updated, but black-and-tan hurts the eyes\n2016 Chevrolet Volt \n•What? The new version of the extended-range electric sedan\n•When? Coming to dealers in California, Oregon and some Eastern states, with the rest of the nation to follow\n•Where? Made in Hamtramck, Mich.\n•How much: $33,995, including $825 shipping\n•What makes it go? A 18.4-kilowatt lithium-ion battery backed up by a 1.5-liter gas engine\n•How big? 15 feet long\n•How thirsty? Up to 53 miles of electric driving. The backup gas engine is rated at 42 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving. The government mile-per-gallon equivalent is 106 MPGe.\n•Overall: It will set engineers' brains on fire, probably not hearts\n11 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LlSKXS TOP VIDEOS Newer Fiat Chrysler workers could hit $29-an-hour 00:54 Ferrari could be worth $12.4B in its looming initial public offering 00:54 U.S. Treasury seeks info about ISIS use of Toyotas 00:40 Midday report: SABMiller fends off takeover; stocks Rise 01:12 Netflix Increases Its Subscription Plan for Customers 00:44 Elon musk calls Apple A 'Tesla Graveyard' 01:03 State of tech valuations: bubble or no bubble? 05:10 Stocks next move will be earnings-driven | America's Markets 02:30 These states have the widest gap between the rich and poor 02:24 Eliminating debt a top priority for millennials 01:22 Amazon launches Etsy killer with 'Handmade' 03:23 Data storage company EMC jumps after Dell's reported interest 01:32 Deutsche Bank braces for EU6.2B 3Q loss 02:29 VW's U.S. CEO to Face Congress in Diesel Probe 02:28 VW America CEO to face Congress over TDI Emissions Scandal 00:53 What to watch Thursday: investors hungrily eye Domino's pizza earnings 01:37 Steve Rannazzisi confronts 9/11 lie on Howard Stern 02:05 Tesla's charging challenge: why some drivers still aren't sold 03:12 AB InBev's $100B SABMiller Offer: a Deal Worth Toasting? 02:17 How do you fix 11 million cars? 03:00 'Jay Leno's Garage' hits CNBC 00:45 Recall issued over not-so Cheerios 01:07 ATM fees up 21% in last 5 years 01:10 This is NOT a drill: Coffee shortage is imminent 01:06 Americans buying new cars, just not VW 01:15 Twitter names Jack Dorsey CEO, Nelson Peltz takes GE stake 02:07 AB InBev expected to make formal bid for SABMiller 03:31 Calif. shop turns out perfect, rare vintage Porsches 08:06 Find New & Used Cars New Cars Used Cars Make Acura Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Dodge Ferrari Fiat Ford GMC Honda Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche RAM Rolls-Royce Scion Smart Subaru Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Model Price $1,000 $2,000 $3,000 $4,000 $5,000 $6,000 $7,000 $8,000 $9,000 $10,000 $11,000 $12,000 $13,000 $14,000 $15,000 $16,000 $17,000 $18,000 $19,000 $20,000 $21,000 $22,000 $23,000 $24,000 $25,000 $30,000 $35,000 $40,000 $45,000 $50,000 $75,000 $99,000 $99,000+ Distance 10 Miles 20 Miles 30 Miles 40 Miles 50 Miles 75 Miles 100 Miles 150 Miles 250 Miles 500 Miles of Search Cars Powered by Cars.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:29:33.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
