The PBOC also lowered the reserve ratio requirement for most banks by 50 basis points, and for banks that lend to agricultural and small business by a full percentage point.\nThe bank's sixth rate cut since November showed regulators battling to build a floor in the country's slowing growth rate. The effort to transition from an export-led economy to one driven by domestic consumer demand has made strides, with the services sector expanding 8.6% in Q3, vs. overall growth of 6.9%.\n  View Enlarged Image \nData also showed that industrial output slowed to 5.8% in September, near the six-year low set earlier in the year.\nThe rate cut is likely to show up most clearly in reduced rates for mortgages and in increased credit available to large businesses, according to the Financial Times.\nThe announcement was made after China's market close, so stocks there will have to wait until Monday to react to the news .\nThe Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index both gained 1.3% Friday, posting gains of less than 0.1% for the week. The tech-heavy Shenzhen Composite jumped 2.5% in a fifth straight weekly advance.\nNew Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE: EDU ) led a group of China-based stocks trading in the U.S. that easily outpaced their home markets. New Oriental bolted 15% higher for the week, buoyed by a strong fiscal Q1 earnings report on Tuesday.\nBoth Jefferies and Brean Capital upgraded shares to buy from hold. Both attached price targets of 32, 28% above the stock's closing price of 24.98 on Tuesday. Four straight weekly gains have hoisted New Oriental's shares well up the right side of a five-month cup base.\nTAL Education (NYSE: XRS ) ended up a bit less than 3% for the week after an up-and-down week. The Beijing-based operator of a network of 289 locations, where it offers after-school tutoring services to 1.5 million students, blew past analyst consensus earnings and sales forecasts on Thursday. Investors sent shares down 3% in heavy trade, possibly because operating margin growth lagged that of earnings.\nAnalysts are raising TAL's EPS growth estimates, currently at 23% for this year and 24% for 2016. The stock is 4% below a 38.48 early buy point in a nearly six-month cup base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:34:21.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
