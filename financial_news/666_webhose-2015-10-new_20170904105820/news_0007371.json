Analysts predict goods and services deficit of £2.15bn in August, down from £3.37bn the previous month when the UK imported more than it exported. \nJuly's trade deficit was the highest recorded in 2015 and four times wider than it was in June, driven by a decline in exports of chemicals and manufactured goods. \nAcross the Pond, US wholesale inventory and sales data is set for release in afternoon trade. Wholesale trade sales are forecast to drop 0.4% in August compared to a month ago, while inventories are expected to be flat. \nFederal Reserve officials Dennis Lockhart and Charles Evans are also due to speak, a day after release of the minutes of the US central bank's 16-17 September policy meeting. Any clues on the timing of the first interest rate increase in almost a decade will be closely monitored. \nFriday's agenda will otherwise be relatively quiet following a busy day that included policy meeting minutes from the Fed, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. \nFriday 09 October INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) , Ashley (Laura) Holding, Berendsen (LSE: BRSN.L - news ) , Bwin.party Digital Entertainment, Cape (LSE: CIU.L - news ) , Capital Drilling Ltd (Stuttgart: C8D.SG - news ) .
