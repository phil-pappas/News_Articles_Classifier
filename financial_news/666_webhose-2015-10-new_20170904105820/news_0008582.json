This means that immediate measures must be taken to reduce Ghana’s public debt, because the country’s current financial position might make it difficult to pay its debts on time. \nWhen a country is classified as High Debt Distress country, the IMF usually prescribes a freeze on borrowing by that country until it makes some progress in reducing its debts. \nGhana’s rising public debt has already affected the country’s ability to secure good assessment from credit rating agencies. \nSome agencies are even warning investors outside the country that it might be risky for them to lend money to Ghana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:53:48.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
