Played at a rapid pace, D-Day: Imminent Assault drops you and up to five other players in the middle of World War II. You gather your soldiers and build up your resources in preparation for a head-to-head clash on land and on sea.\n“We decided to reach out to people who play board games to fund this program because we want people who play the game to be rewarded for their investments,” said Karel Hartinger, lead developer for the game D-Day. D-Day is the military code name for the US invasion at Normandy Beach, France, that marked a turning point in WWII.\nBoard games bring people together. Family nights can be built around board games, but playing the same game all the time can be boring. You need variety,\" said Hartinger. “Mix it up. Play D-Day one night and choose another board game another night, unless you get so involved with D-Day that everyone wants to play it again.\nThe game is ready to go into production. Metal figurines are going to be made in-house and a print shop is lined up for that work.\n“All we need is you,” Hartinger said. “We have tested the game for several months and the feedback we've received couldn't be better. The game is relaxing enough that you can pick it up worry-free and involving enough that you will become emotionally invested.”\nMoney raised will be used for marketing, distribution and mass production.\nHe said the development team chose a WWII theme because of the historical aspects and WWII should be familiar to everyone. While every country on Earth didn’t fight in the war, every country was affected by it in some way and the history of the war is taught in schools everywhere.\n“We wanted something that people would understand. We also wanted a game that is excited and encourages people to think and use their imagination,” he said. “ In D-Day, players have build resources, develop plans and try to beat the enemy. D-Day is relaxing enough that you can pick it up worry-free and involving enough that you will become emotionally invested. You will build towers, command war ships, land units, capture islands, and craft strategies, all with the conquest of your enemies as your final end.”\nAt the same time, the game is easy to understand and pick up. Hartinger said it is suitable for anyone from 13 years old and up.\nFor more information about the game visit the Facebook game page https://www.facebook.com/gamellama15 .\nFor information about the Indiegogo campaign, visit https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/d-day-imminent-assault-board-game/x/11097025#/", "external_links": ["https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/d-day-imminent-assault-board-game/x/11097025#/", "https://www.facebook.com/gamellama15", "https://twitter.com/Game_Llama"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:04:35.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
