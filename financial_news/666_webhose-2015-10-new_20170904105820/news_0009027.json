It is not a film that is going on, it is about India and Ramji,” Vadakkan told ANI.\nVadakkan also said that Bihar will develop, but without Prime Minister Modi.\n“He (Modi) can have Diwali everyday, he is an NRI Prime Minister, where does he have the time for India? All the time he spends at rallies seeking and catching votes,” he added.\nModi had said, “There will be two Diwali celebrations this time in Bihar. One will be on the day of the festival and second on the day of poll results.”\nThe prime minister also said that India cannot progress unless Bihar moves forward.\n 03, 2015 7:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:13:33.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
