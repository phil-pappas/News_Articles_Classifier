Barclays Plc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch see strong demand for the bonds, which are as safe as sovereign notes and offer yields about 50 basis points higher.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing state leaders to play a greater role in jumpstarting an economy that is expanding below potential even as it boasts one of the world’s fastest growth rates. State governments have control over land, water and electricity, making them essential to attracting investment.\n\"If you want development, it cannot be a top-down strategy,\" Sonal Varma, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by phone. \"If you want more bottom-up participation in growth then the best way is to encourage greater competition among states, which is what China did.\"\nModi is sharing a record 42 percent of tax revenues with state governments and is trying to push through legislation that will unify them under a single national sales tax. Working together, India’s 29 states would form a bloc that has a bigger economy than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, more members than the European Union, and twice the population of North America.\nState budget deficits have halved to about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product over the past 15 years. Between April to September, their governments have spent more than Modi’s administration and are poised to outstrip federal spending for the first time in at least six years.\n\"Indian States are benefiting from growth deepening after 25 years of reforms,\" BoFAML economists Indranil Sen Gupta and Abhishek Gupta wrote in an Oct. 5 report, referring to an economic overhaul since India first opened its economy in 1991. \"Rising aspirations are putting pressure on state governments to follow pro-development policies.\"\nThe investment cap will be 35 billion rupees this year, and will steadily rise to 500 billion rupees by 2018. The limits will be “fully utilized” given the appetite for government securities among offshore investors, the BoFAML economists wrote.\nIndia’s $207 billion of outstanding state bonds currently account for 19 percent of the overall debt market and are \"far less liquid\" than federal debt, according to Barclays. That justifies their roughly 50-basis point spread over sovereign notes, strategist Rohit Arora wrote in an Oct. 8 report.\nUBS Global Asset Management will wait for the market to develop before it considers investing, Ashley Perrott, its Singapore-based head of pan-Asia fixed income, said by e-mail.\nOthers are more optimistic. The introduction of new investors will ensure that state governments stay disciplined with their budgets, Anubhuti Sahay, an economist with Standard Chartered Plc said by phone. Rajeev de Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore, said foreign funds will also help separate better performing states from the laggards.\n“Foreign investors should help absorb some of the states’ additional issuance at a reasonable yield,” de Mello wrote in an Oct. 8 e-mail. “They might also help in the relative pricing between the different states.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:59:53.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
