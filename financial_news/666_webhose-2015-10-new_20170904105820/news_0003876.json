The stake was worth about £160m, whereas Centrica has a market value of £11.8bn. \nIn a fund update for September, Mitchell Fraser-Jones, head of investment communications at Woodford Investment Management, said: \"We [have] sold the remainder of the holding in Centrica. Following [its] disappointing dividend cut earlier this year, we initially added to the position but have subsequently become more concerned about its exposure to the oil price and increasing competition and regulation in downstream energy markets, both here in the UK and in the US. \n• Neil Woodford makes 20pc in first year \n\"We think the company will now struggle to deliver growth much above low-to-mid single digits, which, combined with a reduced cash return, leads to a modest total return expectation. At the prevailing valuation, therefore, the shares can no longer justify their position in the portfolio.\" \nHe said Centrica had become \"the latest victim of the intense fight for [the fund's] capital between existing positions and new ideas\". \nThe fund sold its holding in SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) , the utility formerly known as Scottish & Southern Energy, in July. Mr Woodford's only remaining energy holding is Drax. \n• Centrica and SSE (Amsterdam: UW8.AS - news ) 'uninvestable' but Woodford hangs on \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Centrica and SSE are owned by hundreds of thousands of private savers across the country who acquired them in the privatisation of British Gas and the electricity companies under the Thatcher government. \nWoodford Equity Income also sold its stake in Amlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) , the insurer, after it agreed to be acquired by a rival. \"We sold the holding after the shares soared on the news,\" Mr Fraser-Jones said. \nMore generally, Mr Woodford remains concerned about various aspects of the world economy, including debt and growth. \n\"We continue to be concerned about productivity, deflation, debt and the overall global growth outlook, and remain focused on maintaining a portfolio that can prove resilient to these long term structural headwinds,\" the update said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:43:20.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
