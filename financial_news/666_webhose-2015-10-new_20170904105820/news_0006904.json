We get Minotaur’s proven expertise in exploration and analysis and they get access to our vast repository of data.”\nOZ Minerals will reimburse Minotaur for up to 80 per cent of its time costs expended on the research work, a task expected to take several months.\nA $3 million budget funded 50/50 will allow for initial “truthing of prospects” to achieve proof of concept, with Minotaur as operator. A joint venture could subsequently be formed with Minotaur holding a 20 per cent interest.\nThe Mt Woods area represents classic iron-oxide copper-gold prospective terrain.\nMinotaur shares closed 8.7 per cent higher on 7.5c yesterday, while OZ stock was 4.4 per cent lower at $3.90.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:30:53.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
