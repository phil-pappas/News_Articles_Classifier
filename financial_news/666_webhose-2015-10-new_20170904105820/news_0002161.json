These are expected to be the first many prospective deals. \nUnder Mr Clarke’s tenure Britain’s biggest supermarket sold 68 stores for £2.7bn in sale and leaseback transactions to help fund its global growth ambitions. At the time the agreements meant that Tesco could reduce its debt and realise value from its property portfolio. \nHowever, the 25 year lease obligations that sit on Tesco’s balance sheet have been a cause of concern in the City. Against an intensely competitive trading environment some shops had become unprofitable, eroding the margin gains of leasing the properties. \nThis is partly because rent rises are pegged to the retail price index of inflation, rather than consumer price index, which means that Tesco’s rent bill is likely to rise faster than the price of a basket of goods in the current deflationary environment. \nAs part of its strategy to increase the proportion of its freehold supermarkets Tesco sealed a £733m property swap in March with British Land (LSE: BLND.L - news ) to take back 21 superstores which reduced the company’s lease commitments and insulated it from indexed rent reviews. \nThe deal took Tesco’s freehold ownership up to 55pc. Tesco is now looking to use the proceeds of the £4.2bn sale of its South Korean Homeplus business to protect and strengthen its balance sheet. At the time of the deal to Asia’s private equity firm MBK Partners Tesco said that it would “consider value accretive opportunities across the group including the selective purchase of some existing leasehold stores in the UK.” \n“It’s good that they are gaining control by owning the stores as it reduces their rent liabilities. But in writing a big check they have to be sure that they can make substantial operating improvements to justify the increase in debt”, said Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital. \nTesco last week called an end to its asset sale programme and said that it would not need a rights issue to improve the balance sheet. Instead Mr Lewis claimed that a “self-help” programme would shore up the business, despite posting a halving in operating profits. \nTesco declined to comment on the potential deal to buyback its stores (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:16:41.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
