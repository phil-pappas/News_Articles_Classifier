The underlying Exchequer deficit in 2015 is c. €2.1 billion compared to an underlying deficit of c. €6.1 billion in 2014 (Excluding all of the substantial one-off transactions). This equates to a year-on-year improvement of c. €4.0billion on the back of increased tax and non-tax revenue and reduced expenditure. \nTax revenue collected is 5.8% ahead of target. In terms of year-on-year performance, tax revenues are actually up €2.5 billion or 8.7% allowing for the SEPA effect last year \nCommenting on the strong performance of tax revenues, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan T.D. stated: \n“Overall, the tax performance for the first nine months of 2015 is ahead of expectations, with a very strong performance across all the major tax heads reflecting better than expected economic growth in 2015. The tax performance has been very strong through the first nine months of the year, with tax revenues 5.8% above profile and up nearly 9.0% on an adjusted basis, in year-on-year terms. This provides a very solid base heading into the final quarter of the year and Budget 2016”. \nCommenting on the Exchequer Returns Minister for Public Expenditure & Reform Brendan Howlin T.D. stated: \n\n“Government spending on investment and delivering public services was €39bn for the first 9 months of the year. This is broadly in line with expectations and profile set out in the Book of Estimates last year. The position on spending for the remainder of the year will be updated at Budget time as part of the 2016 Estimates process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:07:00.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
