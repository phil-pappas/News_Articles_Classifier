Photo: Peter Morris\n The Governance Institute was an early supporter of the government's plan to overhaul the board composition rules for superannuation funds, but now the peak body's newly appointed chief executive Steven Burrell has called for the \"over politicised\" legislation to be scrapped.\nIn a submission to the Senate Economics Committee on Thursday, The Governance Institute called on the government to abandon legislation mandating that one third of superannuation fund boards be comprised of one third independent directors including an independent chair, arguing that the process has become \"overly politicised to the detriment of genuine governance outcomes\".\n\"Superannuation governance is in vital need of reform and we support moves to increase the number of independent directors on superannuation trustee boards,\" Governance Institute chief executive Steven Burrell said.\n\"However, the blunt club of legislation is not the way to do it. We believe a better solution is to take the principles-based approach recommended by the Cooper Review and establish a superannuation industry-led body to collectively develop guidance on governance matters, similar to the ASX Council's principles and recommendations\".\nAdvertisement Previously The Governance Institute had backed the push for one third independent directors calling it a \"pragmatic initial step\", while pledging to continue to advocating for a majority of independent directors arguing that independent directors \"need the numbers\" to be able to truly influence how boards operate.\n\"Ultimately we would like to see a majority of independent directors on the boards of superannuation funds, which would align with the board composition on their investee companies,\" Governance Institute policy director Judith Fox told Fairfax Media in June.\nSpeaking on Friday, Ms Fox said the current call to scrap the legislation was \"definitely not a backflip\".\n\"We always advocated for a principles based approach to strengthening governance on super boards,\" Ms Fox said.\n\"We also always said we'd prefer to see super funds appoint a majority of independent directors but if the government was going to take a black letter law approach then one third was a fair starting point\".\nMs Fox said that problems with the definition of independence used in the proposed legislation was the reason the peak body for company secretaries, the officers responsible for ensuring company boards meet their legal obligations, had withdrawn is support.\n\"Each draft of this legislation has thrown up a new set of problems with the definition of independence that would have unintended consequences contrary to the spirit of improving governance. The current draft would allow an employer group to nominate two thirds of the representatives on an industry fund board,\" she said.\n\"It was time to step back, legislating for independence is a hiding for nothing\".", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/industry-and-retail-super-funds-in-stoush-over-new-board-rules-20150625-ghy5k7"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:18:21.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
