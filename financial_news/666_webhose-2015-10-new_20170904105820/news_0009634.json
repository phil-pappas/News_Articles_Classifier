Photo: Graham Tidy\n﻿ Tricia Compas-Markman was in Haiti after a devastating earthquake killed more than 160,000 people when she finally realised her idea to change the world was a winner.\n\"Even after a year, people were still living in tents, still affected by cholera, still very much affected by the earthquake,\" the engineer and entrepreneur recalled.\nThe 31-year-old American travelled to the Caribbean nation in 2011 with relief groups and trained local communities to use an innovative bag she designed to collect, transport and treat drinking water in disaster zones.\n\"People told us they had to queue in long lines to get a couple of water bottles and explained how the waterbags could help them,\" she said while visiting Australia last week.\nAdvertisement \"That really gave me the motivation and inspiration to say: yes, we're going down the right track and this is a system that's very much needed.\"\nMrs Compas-Markman first envisioned the clean water solution in 2007 while studying in California and expected the project to take \"a couple of months\".\nTwo years later, she had finalised the design for the DayOne Waterbag, which has since been deployed to disaster zones in 21 countries as an all-in-one solution to provide clean water and prevent water-borne diseases.\nThe 10-litre bag is worn like a backpack, sterilises water and filters out sediment, making contaminated water safe to drink in 30 minutes.\nMrs Compas-Markman again saw the bag in action this year when she travelled to Nepal after a massive earthquake there in April.\n\"Being there is very fulfilling but its also gives us real opportunities for feedback,\" she said.\n\"We can see if it is packaged correctly, learn about how relief organisations work and distribute products, and see how we can improve what we do.\"\nMrs Compas-Markman, who was in Australia to meet suppliers and potential customers, said the key to the bag is it standardises the purification process and ensures the correct ratio of water to chemicals.\n\"What's used widely are just buckets and jerry cans and chlorine tablets, but someone might not know what 10 litres is in a bucket, or the bucket can already be contaminated,\" she said.\n\"The Waterbag is a closed system too, so you prevent recontamination of treated water, where a bucket has the potential of being contaminated.\"\nThe bags are also more efficient to transport into disaster zones than buckets or jerry cans and cheaper than bottled water.\nDayOne​ Response, Mrs Compas-Markman's company, hopes to more than double production of the bags to 100,000 in 2016 while also exploring ideas for other disaster relief products.\nAs well as humanitarian groups, the waterbags have caught the eye of the US military and, last week, Mrs Compas-Markman pitched the bags to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nThe invention has earned the young CEO a slew of awards and accolades but also support from the \"angel investor\" community.\nThe US network Golden Seed has poured $US1.5 million into the company, with 17 Australians from a similar local female-focused investment group, Scale, contributing $A530,000.\nThe group decided to invest in DayOne after using the waterbag to turn murky Yarra River water into potable water in 30 minutes.\n\"Australia is all too familiar with natural disasters, such as the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, the Brisbane Floods and south Asia tsunamis,\" said Wendy Kozica, who led the deal on behalf of Scale Angels.\n\"I could see a real need within Australia, and also for international aid programs.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EjwIJf5L7bg?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:59:53.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
