The contract will lead to eliminating a two-tier wage system that the UAW fought hard to kill.\nThe agreement also sets a precedent for ongoing UAW talks with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F ).\nThe contract was approved by 77% of UAW workers and provides for across-the-board pay raises for both hourly and salaried workers — the first raise for long-time workers in nine years — and an upfront one-time bonus of up to $4,000.\n  View Enlarged Image \nIt also provides a path to eliminate the two-tier wage system over a period of eight years.\nThe two-tier system was set up during the Great Recession, which began in 2007, to give automakers relief from high wages.\nChrysler and General Motors went bankrupt in 2009, leading to Chrysler's eventual merger with Italy's Fiat in 2014. Under the two-tier system, Chrysler could pay previously hired workers at one level and hire new workers at much lower wages.\nFiat Chrysler said in a statement Thursday, \"With the bargaining process now complete, the company and our employees can look forward to continuing to build world-class products, investing in our operations and achieving the targets set out in our five-year business plan.\"\nUAW President Dennis Williams said that the new four-year agreement boosts wages and gives members job security \"while still allowing the company to competitively produce high-quality vehicles.\"\nFiat Chrysler continued to struggle for several years after the recession ended in June 2009 and today has the highest number of tier-two workers of the U.S. Big Three.\nStill, the UAW has said that it wants to eliminate the two-tier wage system in the U.S. auto industry, and it's pushing hard for that in contract talks with GM and Ford.\nFiat Chrysler stock has been consolidating for more than five months, forming a 30% deep trough during that period, and it's set up a 17.18 buy point. Shares were up fractionally in Thursday afternoon trading on the stock market today . The carmaker is expected to report quarterly earnings Oct. 28.\nGeneral Motors reported a 55% jump in Q3 EPS to $1.50 on Wednesday, crushing views for $1.18 . Revenue dipped 1% to $38.84 billion due to the strong dollar but also beat Wall Street estimates.\nCFO Chuck Stevens said that he expected \"earnings to accelerate in the next several years.\" GM shares were roughly unchanged Thursday afternoon after rising 2% Wednesday.\nFord rose 1% Thursday afternoon. Among other top automakers, luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) rose 1%, and Volkswagen (OTCPK: VLKAY ) was up 0.5%.\nFollow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:21:40.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
