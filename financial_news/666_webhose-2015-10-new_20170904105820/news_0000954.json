With consumers now expecting great bargains and trouble free service, retailers must ensure they have planned their marketing strategies and logistics around these key dates, with carefully prepared cross-channel campaigns, engaging the right customers, via the right media.” \nThe research also identified two consumer groups driving the growth in festive spending. Time pressed, middle income families were the driving force behind pre-Christmas sales in 2014, which saw over GBP810m spent on Black Friday alone. In contrast, shoppers on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day are more likely to be younger, urban consumers. \n“These findings have significant implications for retailers,” the study noted. “Last year, the majority of shoppers in the early-season Black Friday sales period were found to be living outside the major city centres in more rural locations. As a result, added emphasis needs to be placed on logistical planning and delivery services. However, bargain-hunters on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day are likely to require more support and service in-store, and in-person.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:41:22.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
