The company is targeting each device at different markets, with the Huawei made Nexus 6P aimed at the high-end premium market while the LG made Nexus 5X focusing at a mid-range crowd. Despite the slightly lower specifications on the 5P, the phone turns out to be quite a value for money proposition as compared to the competitors in the market. Sponsored Links \nNow, the Nexus 5X is available for sale in a number of regions such as US, Canada, UK, Ireland, India, Korea and Japan starting today. The phone will be available via the company’s online store as well as via wireless carriers and retailers in their respective countries. \nAlthough the plastic design profile of the Nexus 5X may not be as premium as the 6P, it’s still a bit different than the traditional offerings from the company in the past. This is the third time Google has partnered up with LG for its Nexus device, after releasing devices like the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4 in the past couple of years. \nThe phone is available unlocked as well, which is ideal for some who wouldn’t want to be stuck with a 2 year carrier contract. The retail price of the phone is $379 for the 16GB version and $429 for the larger 32GB version. \nLike all Nexus smartphones, the Nexus 5P too comes with a pure Android experience. It is the first set of phones to receive the new Android 6.0 Marshmallow update and comes with stock Android OS without any bloatware or manufacturer specific features. The phone features a fingerprint sensor as well, which is a first for the Nexus family. The sensor is located at the back of the device, making it ideal to operate even with one hand. \nAs for the other specs, the Nexus 5P comes with the six-core Snapdragon 808 chipset. This is the same chip that powers the LG G4 flagship. It features a 5.2-inch FHD 1080p display and 2GB of RAM with 16GB storage. At the back, there’s a new 12.3MP camera with a large sensor. There’s the new USB Type-C port as well with support for fast charging. Finally, the phone will come with three color options, white, black and blue. \nIt is said that the phone will release in more markets in the next couple of weeks.
