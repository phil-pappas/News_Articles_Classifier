Share on twitter by Bani McSpedden The biggest challenge facing watch designers today seems to be coming up with something that doesn't look like a dinner plate with shiny bits hanging off the edge. Where legibility and the ease of reading the hour of day were once the Holy Grail of watchmaking, it seems brands are increasingly vying for new ways to complicate the task.\nThat's partly understandable; marketing folk would question who wants a watch that looks like any other, or performs like one you've already got. And for their part, watchmakers, bored with the usual cogs and springs, relish the chance to do something different.\nAs for the consumer, complications such as stop-watch modules, moon-phase indicators, and day and date windows give a bloke something extra to enjoy. Adding a bit of bling does the same for women, with diamond hour markers and bezels more popular than ever, and little moon effigies peeping out from dial after dial.\nMillion-dollar babies Icing the cake means jewellery watches have never been so ravishing or indulgent – witness recent million-dollar babies from Piaget, Cartier, Girard-Perregaux, Dior and Chanel – while men with means now pore over mind boggling contraptions from Greubel Forsey, Cartier, Urwerk​ or MB&F. Men without means look at SevenFriday​. This brand is the Rubik's Cube of watches; it's inexpensive and makes time-telling a challenge of mathematical proportions.\nAll in all, this is a land of tourbillons, skeletonised movements, three-dimensional doo-dahs and the kind of machinery it's hard to imagine inhabiting your forearm. You can add to the aforementioned list the venerable Louis Vuitton, whose uber-watchmaker, Michel Navas​, has defined the focus of the brand as \"telling the time differently\". Vuitton is responsible for the Spin Time, a watch that avoids anything as mundane as hands, managing to indicate the time via tiny cubes rotating on the end of shafts. It's a fabulous thing.\nBut given such a thicket of wrista-donnas, what if you hanker for something, well, pared back? Something more Bang & Olufsen​ than brash and out there? Judging by the mail I receive, polite timepieces are the hardest to find these days. Architect types, graphic design students, connoisseurs and cyclists who favour the upright riding position are united in their despair. But they're not the only ones; many others simply want a nice watch yet come up wanting.\nWhere to find them Such pieces, however, are out there if you look. At the high end consider Jaeger-LeCoultre's ultra-thins and A. Lange & Söhne, which has timepieces that tick two boxes: restraint and collectability. Ditto the simpler IWC Portugiesers​ and refined models from Girard-Perregaux and Vacheron Constantin.\nFor high style, the new Slim d'Hermès​ offers both cachet and clarity. The brand even commissioned Parisian designer Philippe Apeloig​ to look at the graphics, resulting in winning stencil-like numerals. Dior's Chiffre Rouge likewise does restraint with an edge.\nFor high credibility with the design crowd, Nomos​ is a serial Red Dot design award-winner, while the Max Bill by German brand Junghans and Georg Jensen occupy similar territory. If it's horological types you want to impress, makes such as D.Dornblüth & Sohn​ and Moritz Grossmann get the high fives.\nAnd if it's high value you're after, Calvin Klein offers snappily-designed, inexpensive watches year after year. You won't like every model, but within the range you'll always find something cheerfully unaffected.\nAt the very least, watches like these are a pleasant change from the extravagant machinery that usually grabs the headlines. Yes, you can take that as a bit of a mea culpa. l\nBani McSpedden is watch editor of The Australian Financial Review and watch-next.com.\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram\nThe AFR Magazine Design issue, out Friday October 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/afrmag", "https://twitter.com/baniwatch", "https://instagram.com/afrmag/"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:02:49.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
