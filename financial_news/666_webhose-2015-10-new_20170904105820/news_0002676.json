Rates are charged regardless of whether a business is profitable or not, unlike corporation tax. \nDuring the financial crisis, many thousands businesses were ultimately pushed into bankruptcy because of business rates bills. \nIn theory councils could now compete with lower rates to attract business, or fund better council services with higher rates. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is an agenda which will match the devolution of powers over welfare, business support and the NHS to localities such as Greater Manchester. \nMr Osborne said: \"In my view, proud cities and counties should not be forced to come to national government with a begging bowl. \n\"So I am announcing this: Today I am embarking on the biggest transfer of power to our local government in living memory. \n\"We're going to allow local government to keep the rates they collect from business. \n\"That's right, all Â£26bn of business rates will be kept by councils instead of being sent up to Whitehall.\" \nHe went on: \"So this is what our plan means. \n\"Attract a business, and you attract more money. \n\"Regenerate a high street, and you'll reap the benefits. \n\"Grow your area, and you'll grow your revenue too.\" \nAnnouncing he would scrap the uniform business rate imposed on every council entirely, he said: \"Any local area will be able to cut business rates as much as they like to win new jobs and generate wealth. \n\"It's up to them to judge whether they can afford it.\" \nMr Osborne said: \"Money raised locally, spent locally. \n\"Every council able to cut business taxes. \n\"A new way to govern our country. \n\"Power to the people. \n\"Let the devolution revolution begin.\" \nIn his speech to activists at his party's conference in Manchester, he said the Conservatives were \"the builders\". \nHe also vowed the Government would \"go on fixing the roof while the sun is shining\". \n\"Labour are the wreckers, we are the builders,\" Mr Osborne said. \nIn a sideswipe at the Labour leadership he said: \"Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) we're told that instead of earning the money we need to spend, the Bank of England can simply be told to print it. \n\"What could be easier than that? \n\"They said in Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany too. \n\"It's not monetarism - it's magic money-tree-ism.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:46:47.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
