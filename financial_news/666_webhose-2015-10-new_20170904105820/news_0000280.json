Analysts predict the UK added 140,000 jobs during the period, compared to 42,000 in the previous three months. Average weekly earnings are estimated to have climbed 3.1% following a 2.9% gain the prior quarter when it reached a six-year high. \nThe unemployment rate is forecast to hold at 5.5%. \nJobless claims in September are projected to have fallen 2,200 after a 1,200 increase in August. \nThe Bank of England is closely monitoring the jobs market, particularly wage growth, as policymakers weigh the best timing for an interest rate hike. \nLast week the central bank said in its policy meeting minutes that costs pressures in the labour market were rising too slowly for inflation to return to the Bank's 2% target. The central bank expects inflation will stay below 1% until spring 2016. \nAlso high on Wednesday's agenda will be the release of China inflation figures. The consumer price index may have risen 1.8% in September compared to the same month a year ago, following a 2% increase in August, according to analysts' forecasts. The producer price index is estimated to fall 5.9% year-on-year in September, the same as August. \nUS retail sales figures will be released in afternoon trade and are expected to reveal a 0.2% increase in September, the same rate of growth as the previous month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending which is a major contributor to gross domestic product. \nWednesday 14 October INTERIMS Brown (N.)
