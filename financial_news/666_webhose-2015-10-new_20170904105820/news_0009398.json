Ben Rushton For all its blunt language – Macquarie's \"inconvenience\" is what others in the workplace design game call \"creating destinations\" – the new office that holds 2000 staff, including those from its institutional and wholesale banking divisions, takes lessons from company's previous workplace designs and improves on them.\nThe former Commonwealth Bank of Australia building has a wide central atrium cutting through all the 1800-square-metre floors that also links staff with staircases connecting those floors. Like a department store that forces shoppers to take a roundabout route through different floors of merchandise to reach their destination, these internal staircases route through the fifth-floor coffee station.\n\"That brings people together,\" Walker says. \"If you want to use the whole staircase, you've got to walk through Level Five.\"\nThe coffee-powered social engineering is matched by the appointment of a general manager who – in a similar way to a building concierge in a multi-tenanted office tower – is charged with building a sense of community among staff.\nOld and new: Macquarie's 50 Martin Place has built a steel canopy over the former 9th-floor roof of the 1928 building. Ben Rushton \"It's a bigger step forward than that,\" says Walker. \"It's linking that facilities management team, the front of house team, with the service teams and even in the way that we support people at the desktop with the technology support, we think of that as almost a hotellin g experience in the office.\"\nAt 50 Martin Place and the contiguous 19 Elizabeth Street building, which has an additional 4500 sq m and contains much of the support functions such as end-of-trip facilities, general manager Kate ffrenc h Blake oversees that combination of physical and human resources, such as the rooftop garden that staff tend as well as the bank's two rooftop beehives .\nFlexible desk use Staff at the new head office may have to walk more than they do at Shelley Street, at least at 50 Martin Place – one of three sites the banking group occupies in central Sydney – they at least have more desks. Use of the desks is flexible, but the ratio of one desk per person is higher than at Shelley Street, Walker says.\nJust under one-third of Macquarie Group's 6500-odd staff are at 50 Martin Place, but there could be more in the future, he says.\n\"There's always space to grow, but there's always alternate ways to work to allow for growth as well,\" Walker says. \"Ratios will change as the way people work changes.\"\nThe way people have worked at 50 Martin Place, which Macquarie purchased from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2012, has certainly changed. Until 1976, CBA branch tellers kept guns behind the counters and the roof of the building was a shooting range for target practice. Packing heat being less of a requirement for banking staff these days, the new owner was able to redevelop the roof of the original nine-storey building as part of its $100 million-plus renovation, putting a two-level stainless steel canopy that it now uses for functions and events.\nThe conditions of any building are unique and in the case of 50 Martin Place, which started life as the Government Savings Bank of NSW – and later merged with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia building – employers use all available tools to build a sense of community and loyalty among staff. Being part of a long-standing part of the banking industry based in Martin Place is part of the appeal of the building for staff, as it strengthens that sense of community, Walker says.\nIt is also good for the public. At last November's Sydney Open, the building had 3600 visitors. It will be open again for the same architecture festival next month .\nA 'public presence' \"It has a public presence,\" says architect Richard Johnson, whose firm Johnson Pilton Walker designed the renovation. \"This building could have been occupied by somebody who really made it a fortress. But it's actually open to the public at certain times.\"\nWorkplace design is an evolving discipline and 50 Martin Place builds on previous work done at its offices in Melbourne, Shelley Street and London's Ropemaker Place.\n\"We talk about being on a journey,\" says Global Head of Workplace Anthony Henry. \"We're working from a model where everybody was highly compartmentalised and if you look at most traditional office blocks that's how they are.\"\nThe banking group is now redesigning its third site in Sydney, the seven floors it occupies in the Charter Hall-owned 1 Martin Place building diagonally opposite. The company is cutting a hole through five floors to connect the staff working on those floors with a central atrium, global head of Corporate Real Estate Michael Silman says.\nThe 1 Martin Place project is a way for the company to test new workplace designs that it will also look to roll out in other offices around the world, Walker says. That also includes technology-based practices that he ways will give staff a \"virtual bump,\" particularly as they use conferencing and other software on mobile devices. So it doesn't entirely depend on coffee.\n\"We don't have one size fits all,\" Walker says. \"We have some principles and those principles change a little as time goes along.\"", "external_links": ["http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/sydneyopen/2015/50-martin-place"], "published": "2015-10-06T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:05:34.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
