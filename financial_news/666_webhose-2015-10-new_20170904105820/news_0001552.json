The Shiv Sainiks, numbering over 70, carried a black flag and shouted slogans of 'Pakistan murdabad' and 'Shashank Manohar murdabad'. Later, police detained more than two dozen activists and whisked them away, even as Manohar quietly watched from his office. A protester said the Shiv Sena would not permit any cricket relations between the two countries until Pakistan stopped the killing of Indian soldiers and civilians on the border.
