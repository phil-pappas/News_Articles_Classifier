One big mistake workers make is not paying attention to their 401(k) retirement plan elections. It’s especially important this year because there have been a lot of changes to 401(k)s that might seem small but over time can add up to have a big impact on your retirement nest egg.“Not every employer puts a 401(k) check-up in the open enrollment flow,” says Rob Austin, director of retirement research with Aon Hewitt. Here’s what you need to know, based in part on developments Aon Hewitt found in its latest bi-annual survey of large employers’ defined contribution plan practices (the 2015 survey covered 367 employers with a combined 10 million employees). Eligibility. If you’re eligible, start saving! Almost three-quarters (72%) of large employers let new workers immediately sign up for a 401(k). In 2005, it was only 38%, meaning employers are coming around, ditching delayed eligibility rules. “The ability to put your money in on Day 1 might not seem like a big deal, but it’s really good news for employees,” says Austin. The earlier you put money away, the more time the magic of compounding can work for you.[caption id=\"attachment_12949\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Small moves can have a big impact on your 401(k) balance.

The number of employers that automatically enroll employees in a 401(k) has been stuck at around 60% for a long time, but what’s new and different is that employers are setting the default contribution rate (the percentage of pay you’re saving) higher and higher. Two years ago, only 14% of companies had 6% as the initial default contribution rate. Now it’s nearly doubled to 27% of companies who default employees at 6% of pay. Watch out: that still leaves a lot of employees getting defaulted in at a savings rate that is likely too low to guarantee adequate retirement income. Match formula. Half (51%) of employers will put employees in the 401(K) at a level where they’ll get a full employer match on their contributions, leaving the other half to figure it out themselves. A lot of them are getting it wrong; they're leaving billions of 401(k) dollars on the table . It’s crucial to make sure you’re deferring enough to grab the full employer match because it’s basically free money your employer will deposit in your 401(k)—but you have to fully understand the match formula to make sure you get it. The most common match today is $1 for $1 on 6% (that’s at 42% of employers in the aon Hewitt survey, up from 25% in 2011). So you’re putting in 6% of your pay, and your employer is putting in 6% of your pay. “That’s saving 12% which is not too shabby,” says Austin. Contribution Escalation. Here’s the biggest change. When companies automatically escalate employee deferrals from 3% of pay to 4%, then 5% and so on, it was common for them to turn it off at 6%. Just two years ago, half the employers Aon Hewitt surveyed stopped at 6%. Now two-thirds of employers have moved the top rate to 10%. For employees who were not likely to escalate deferrals to 10% of pay on their own, “it harnesses the power of inertia,” says Austin. Back-sweeping: Most employers only automatically enroll new hires, but there’s another way to get employees to sign up (if they weren’t eligible when hired or opted out initially). With “back-sweeping” employers automatically enroll all eligible employees on an ongoing (usually annually) or one-time basis. Currently, 16 percent of employers back-sweeping, double the percentage that did in 2013. You’ll still get the option to opt-out but don’t do it. You’ll thank your younger self when you’re retired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:05:49.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
