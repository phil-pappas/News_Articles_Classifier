(Biz Carson/Business Insider) If you've ever wondered how many people actually see your Facebook posts, a new bug found in the social network might answer that question. \nSome users have reported seeing view counters next to their Facebook posts, as multiple reports have indicated. \nA few Facebook users have tweeted screenshots that show a new metric displayed alongside a Facebook post that reveals how many people have seen that post. \nThis counter is displayed in the same spot where you would normally see how many people liked or commented on your Facebook post. \nHere's what it looks like: \nAnyone else see a \"view\" count on their Facebook posts now? pic.twitter.com/USrmCblRHq ‚Äî Stephen Robles (@stephenrobles) October 14, 2015 \nWHAT IS THIS?!
