Analysts estimate GDP eased to 0.6% in the third quarter from 0.7% in the second quarter. However, on a year-on-year comparison, growth is forecast to remain at 2.4%. \n\"The UK economy is expected by many observers, including the Bank of England, to have slowed somewhat, but the exact extent is a matter of intense interest,\" said Monex Europe . \n\"If tomorrow's data are well short of expectations and the outlook for the future deteriorates significantly, a complete overhaul of monetary policy could ensue.\" Meanwhile, the US will see a batch of data including durable goods orders, consumer confidence, the S&P Shiller Composite on house prices, and the services purchasing managers' index. \nUS durable goods are estimated to fall 1.3% in September, following a 2.3% drop a month earlier. \nThe consumer confidence index is projected to hold at 103 in October. \nThe S&P Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index is forecast to rise to 5.10% year-on-year in August compared to 4.96% a month earlier. \nMarkit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) 's PMI on US services is expected to rise slightly to 55.2 in October from 55.1 in September, above the 50 level that indicates expansion in the industry. \nThe Federal Reserve is taking a range of economic releases into account in determining the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. The Fed will announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday but many analysts expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged. \nOn the company front, BP releases its third quarter results on Tuesday with investors likely to focus on how the group has coped with lower oil prices. \nThe recent quarter has seen the lowest average price for oil, so both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter comparisons are likely to be affected, though there should be higher production in some expansion projects. \n\"Investors should look out for reserves replacement levels as well as commentary surrounding their Rosneft investment,\" said Graham Spooner, Share Centre analyst. Spooner added that the market is likely to hear less about the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster as it is now well in the past. The analyst lists BP as a 'buy'. \nTuesday 27 October INTERIMS Bloomsbury Publishing (LSE: BMY.L - news ) INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN.L - news ) INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Consumer Confidence (US) (15:00) M3 Money Supply (EU) (09:00) Q3 BP GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) Randall & Quilter Investment Holdings (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) FINALS Utilitywise plc (LSE: UTW.L - news ) EGMS VinaCapital Vietnam Opportunity Fund Ltd.
