GDP had expanded at a 7.0 percent rate in each of the two prior quarters. \nBeijing also reported that industrial production growth dropped to 5.7 percent year-on-year in September. \nThe data are \"raising concerns about Chinese demand at a time when normally demand globally is weakening because we're in the shoulder season,\" said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group, referring to the period between the northern hemisphere summer and winter. \n\"Although China's retail sales turned out strong, industrial-related data remained weak. This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,\" including oil, said Daniel Ang of Phillip Futures in Singapore in a market commentary. \nThe market also was looking ahead to a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC technical experts in Vienna on Wednesday, amid a push by some producers including Venezuela for action to raise prices. \nHowever, on Monday the chair of Libya's National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, said the OPEC member can \"easily\" increase daily crude output to two million barrels a day from only 440,000 barrels currently, if the country's security situation improves. \nUN envoy Bernardino Leon has put forward proposals for the power-sharing government, but both Libya's internationally recognized parliament and the Islamist-backed assembly have balked at the appointments (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:41:08.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
