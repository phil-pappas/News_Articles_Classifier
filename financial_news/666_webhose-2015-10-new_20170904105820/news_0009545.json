Kirk Gilmour Share on twitter by Robert Harley Leading real estate agent John McGrath has agreed to buy his largest franchisee, the 10 Sydney offices controlled by Shane Smollen, in a move that helps clears the way for a float of the McGrath business.\nPrice has not been disclosed but would be over $10 million. The Smollen operation, with offices from the Northern Beaches through the North Shore and the Northern Suburbs to Castle Hill, is a major real estate operation in its own right.\nThe business has a sales team of 65, including 12 who are among McGrath's top agents, and a growing rent roll of over 2,200 properties.\nCorrectly structured, the purchase should boost McGrath's income, from a fixed franchise fee to a much more substantial company income.\nMr McGrath, said the agreement was a \"considered and strategic step\" in his company's growth.\n\"Our model is a hybrid of both company owned offices as well as franchises and we are equally passionate about both sides of our business,\" he said.\n\"We are continuing to rapidly grow our franchise network organically into other high value high volume markets whilst never losing focus on McGrath's most important stakeholders, being our team and our customers\nAhead of the Smollen acquisition, McGrath had 12 company offices and 60 franchise outlets.\n Mr McGrath said scale would be a key differentiator in a world where innovation and continued significant investment in technology would be critical.\"\nMr Smollen, who will stay with the business, said the transition would be seamless. \"Our team already live and breath the McGrath way,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-10-06T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:05:23.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
