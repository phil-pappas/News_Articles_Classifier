The share prices of Rocket Fuel and Yume, for instance, have fallen about 50% since April 1, while others like TubeMogul, Tremor Video, and Rubicon Project have also been hit. One reason, as industry folks have long said, is that Wall Street remains confused about where the many companies stand in a complicated online ad ecosystem dominated by Google and Facebook. More recently, some publishers have pulled away from third party ad-tech firms , as CMO Today reported.\nBLOCKTOBER : The media world is in collective freak-out mode over the rise of ad blocking, particularly on mobile devices. But a New York Times NYT -0.08 % analysis of how ad blockers affect various news sites makes it clear why people would want to download these apps: they make Web pages load faster, use up less data and give phones longer battery lives. For example, the Times found that Boston.com takes 30.8 seconds to load advertising content compared with 8.1 seconds to load editorial content. The Daily Beast takes 11.3 seconds for ads and 5 for editorial content. The Times also found that battery life improved slightly with ads removed. It’s easy to see why consumers would want to block ads, but in so doing they are blunting the revenue stream paying for the content they enjoy.\nFILTERED : Snapchat recently added a set of wacky selfie “lenses” that can make users appear old, turn their eyes into hearts, or even vomit rainbows. Now brands will get their shot to sponsor lenses , the Financial Times reports. The new ad product is the latest move by Snapchat to win advertising dollars from big brands. And it’s not hard to picture how sponsored lenses might function in the next few months. Almond Joy on your face for Halloween. A Bud Light pouring into your mouth on Thanksgiving. Maybe you turn into the Coca-Cola polar bear on Christmas. You get the idea.\nPRIME SPOT : Amazon is making big moves to take on other streaming video services, and it’s not trying to play nice. Bloomberg reports that the online retailer will stop selling Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast . Other devices where Amazon’s Prime Instant Video service runs smoothly, like Roku, Xbox and Playstation, won’t be affected. And, of course, Amazon’s own Fire TV stick will remain. Meanwhile, Amazon also announced a deal with CBS for the rights to summer series in 2016, 2017 and 2018, CNN reports. Two of the shows covered in the deal haven’t even been announced yet, and as CNN notes, it’s unclear if they’ve even been conceived. But the deal prevents Netflix from swooping in and grabbing rights to shows that, who knows, could become hits.\nElsewhere Bloomberg Businessweek editor Josh Tyrangiel is leaving the company [ CMO Today ]\nBill Simmons blasted ESPN in his first podcast since leaving the network [ CNN ]\nDish affiliates surrendered some spectrum licenses back to the government [ WSJ ]\nHorror producer Jason Blum is getting into branded content [ CMO Today ]\nViacom has a digital agency veteran to lead its audience science unit [ CMO Today ]\nYouTube is scrambling to update its Kids app to make it easy for parents to scrub inappropriate content [ TechCrunch ]\nFacebook is doing more of its own creative for ads in house [ Adweek ]\n“Empire” dropped 20% of its 18-to-49 audience for the second episode of this season [ AdAge ]\nBrian Williams anchored MSNBC’s coverage of the Oregon campus shooting [ Variety ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox: http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall?lang=en", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/youtube-addresses-complaints-about-inappropriate-content-in-updated-youtube-kids-app/", "http://adage.com/article/media/empire-drops-20/300714/", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/brian-williams-anchors-msnbc-oregon-shootings-coverage-in-tv-news-scramble-1201607612/", "https://twitter.com/perlberg?lang=en", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/01/media/bill-simmons-espn-nfl/index.html", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4e2f193c-6860-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5.html#axzz3nLdsFHfY", "https://twitter.com/nftadena?lang=en", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/01/media/cbs-summer-series-amazon-deal/index.html", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO?lang=en", "http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/why-facebook-taking-more-its-advertising-work-house-167291", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html?_r=0", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/asharma?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/srabil?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields?lang=en"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:48:21.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
