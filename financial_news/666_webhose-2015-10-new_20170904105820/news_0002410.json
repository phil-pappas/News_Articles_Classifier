Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed. The bluenica solution is an easy-to-deploy, reliable and cost-effective means to ensure the quality and freshness of food products in grocery stores, convenience stores and restaurants, as well as in refrigerated trailers and warehouses. The temperature monitoring Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application uses low-power wireless sensors, communications gateways and cloud-based software to continuously monitor the temperature of perishable goods and to deliver real-time alerts automatically to a smart phone, tablet or computer. This prevents spoilage and loss, lowers labor costs and helps organizations comply with food safety regulations. The fully integrated bluenica IoT solution is designed for easy self-installation across multiple distributed retail locations. 'We have worked hard to develop this patent-pending, cold-chain IoT offering,' said Colin Warkentin, founder and chief executive officer of bluenica. 'We are excited to join Digi International. With Digi's technology breadth and market reach, we believe we can rapidly scale to meet the growing demand for our bluenica solution.' 'We believe the retail cold-chain market represents a large underserved market that can take much greater advantage of wireless sensor networking and IoT capabilities delivered as a reliable, cloud-based service offering,' said Ron Konezny, president and chief executive officer, Digi International. 'We expect Digi's wireless expertise and global market presence will help accelerate adoption of this purpose-built IoT application to a broad customer base.'
