The University of Florida recently announced plans to terminate an 11-year contract with Pearson, saying it had failed to meet certain performance goals. \nMr Taurel, 66, is expected to bring experience of dealing in global business markets and tackling complex regulatory environments. \nThe Moroccon-born businessman became a US citizen 20 years ago, and was a former adviser to George W Bush for much of last decade. This was alongside his role as chief executive and chairman of Eli Lilly. \nDuring his time at the pharmaceutical company, he worked in South America, eastern Europe and the UK, and he is fluent in French, Spanish and Portuguese \n“I am looking forward to helping the Pearson management team develop our strategy and deliver long-term value for our students, customers and our shareholders,” said Mr Taurel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:26.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
