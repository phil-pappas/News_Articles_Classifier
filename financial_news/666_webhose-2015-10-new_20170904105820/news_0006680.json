Noting that the said provision was brought back in the Maharashtra Police Act in 2014 after being held ultra vires in 2013 by the top court, the bench of Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Prafulla C. Pant said that it is \"appropriate to stay the provision\" that prohibits the dance performances. However, the court made it clear that the dance performances should not be remotely explicit of any kind of obscenity.
