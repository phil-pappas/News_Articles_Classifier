Peter Mathew Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth So the major take-out from James and Lachlan Murdoch's first tag-team interview since taking over 21st Century Fox is – does James have a body piercing?\nHint: there's no visible sign of any adornment other than glasses and tatts. We've never seen, for example, his midriff.\nThe speculation about what lies beneath came as an aside from his brother, Lachlan, which on the one hand puts it into the category of a little too much information.\nOn the other, it was perhaps the only unscripted comment in a smooth two-step that the brothers played out in their first public outing together, speaking to Matthew Belloni of the Hollywood Reporter.\nThe Murdoch brothers played a straight bat when asked about the return of Rebekah Brooks as head of News Corporation UK. AP Can the two work together as they claim? Lachlan's aside made their assurances more telling. And for the Murdochs, that's good news.\nJames and Lachlan would have been aware, as they spoke to Belloni on October 8, that a furious proxy war was going on behind the scenes ahead of the News Corp AGM on October 14 , when more than a third of shareholders voted against their re-election as directors.\nIn fact, the interview is published with handy timing ahead of the 21st Century Fox annual meeting on November 12.\nMinefield of issues Chase Carey – tremendous partner, friend, colleague ... and employee. Next question? Reuters Lachlan, as co-executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, and James, as chief operating officer, had a minefield of issues to walk through in the hour-long Q&A session, any one of which could have blown off a Murdoch limb or two.\nThey all involved relationships.\nWhat about the return of Rebekah Brooks as head of News Corporation UK? They played a straight bat.\nLachlan, who is also co-executive chairman of News, left the question to James, who explained that, as a non-executive director at News, he \"really wasn't very involved\".\nWhen asked about Fox News chief Roger Ailes's future, James Murdoch delivered a master class in corporate ambiguity. WireImage What had the British hacking scandal that has cost News and Fox more than $US1 billion ($1.38 billion) taught James? \"A lot about politics.\"\nWhat's in the pipeline for 21st Century Fox? The answer involved much Hollywood-speak and a promise the pair would be moving Fox forward \"at a pretty high velocity\".\nEssentially, they said we can't tell you what we are going to do next.\nThe two Murdochs were masterly when asked about Chase Carey, the widely respected former chief executive who now reports to them.\nCould James and Lachlan emulate the successful partnership between Carey and their father?\nWhile Chase, of course, was a tremendous partner, friend and colleague, James made clear: \"It's different in that Lachlan and I are actually partners and equal shareholders in the business.\"\nHow to put this politely – Chase is an employee. Next question?\nIt's so very Murdoch.\nNo retirement for Rupert And the bad blood with Fox News chief Roger Ailes? While it was friction with Ailes that helped push Lachlan out of the company in 2005, four years later, when Ailes was furious with James, Rupert took Ailes sailing with Lachlan to calm him down.\n\"We have a huge regard for him and he's done a great job,\" Lachlan said.\nBelloni tried for a wrestling hold: \"Can you commit right now to keeping Roger as long as he wants to stay?\"\nThe ambiguity in James' answer was pure artistry: \"We hope he stays for as long as he wants.\"\nRupert himself is never going to retire, they made clear. While Murdoch senior now appears to have very little active input at Fox, his lingering presence forestalls questions about Ailes, Carey and other time bombs.\nThe biggest question is how well James and Lachlan work together. This is where the next generation of Murdoch management stands or falls.\nLachlan had stayed in Australia for a decade, refusing to return to the United States even when he was appointed co-chairman with his father of News and 21st Century Fox.\nBut last June, with the appointment of James as chief operating officer of 21st Fox, Lachlan was suddenly moving to Los Angeles.\nHe was reported to have told friends that if James thought he was going to run Fox by himself, he had better think again.\n'I don't think we ever disagree' Sibling rivalry, then. It can be a positive or a negative, but which side of the line does it fall?\n\"I don't think we ever disagree,\" Lachlan said.\nJames was of one mind: \"From a strategy point of view, on the board-level stuff, I don't think Lachlan and I have ever had any major – or really any minor – disagreements with respect to where the direction of the business needs to be and how we prosecute that.\n\"But we're brothers, we used to fight like cats in a bag. But you know, we were young then.\"\nThat's when Belloni asked a Dorothy Dixer​ – whether James retained any parts of his rebellious youth; the days when he quit Harvard, dyed his hair, got some piercings and founded a rap label.\nJames was nicely self-deprecating. \"One hundred and fifty per cent of it. The nice thing about middle age is that you still think to yourself, pathetically, that you're still that guy.\"\nYou can imagine the little pause before Lachlan slipped in his comment: \"Why do you assume he doesn't have any piercings?\"\nIt was the best line of the interview. It's not criticism, it's not aggressive sibling antagonism. It's funny. It's banter.\nIt's a comment people make when they retain a fondness for each other; a signal that so far the partnership is working.
