I have said all week the Ferrari IPO, which priced at the high end of the price talk, was an anomaly. The IPO market is suffering from a large number of withdrawals and postponements, and those that have priced recently are typically roughly 20 percent below the midpoint of the price talk.\nThat trend is continuing this morning. Two companies priced overnight, and look what happened.\nMulti-Packaging Solutions (MPSX): packaging primarily for consumer and health care products\nPrice talk: 18.75 million shares at $15 to $17 Priced at: 16.5 million shares at $13 Dimension Therapeutics : liver disease treatments\nPrice talk: 5.5 million shares at $14 to $16 Priced at: $13 And earlier this week, look what happened to American Farmland , a farm REIT that owns property California, Illinois and Florida that began trading on Tuesday:\nAmerican Farmland: farmland REIT\nPrice talk: 12 million shares at $8.50 to $10.50 Priced at: 6 million shares at $8, opened at $7 Ouch! Not only did all three price below the range expected, but two of them lowered the amount of shares offered!\nIf you add it all up, here's how much less they raised compared to what they were seeking.\nTough week for IPOs (percent below midpoint of amount sought)\nMulti-Packaging Solutions: down 28.5 percent Dimension Therapeutics: down 13.3 percent American Farmland: down 58 percent And remember, we have the biggest IPO of the year that happened last week: First Data . Look how that has fared.\nFirst Data: payment technology solutions\nPrice talk: 160 million shares at $18 to $20 Priced at: $16 That, too, priced roughly 16 percent below the midpoint, and is trading in the $15 area.\nSo where do we go from here? In hiding, to a certain extent. Hibernation. I mean it. There's nothing on the calendar! Oh sure, we have Square, Match.com, Ballast Point Brewery, and SoulCycle. And Albertson's was never withdrawn.\nBut what's clear is the IPO market has changed in the second half of the year. Here's what I see:\nPrice cuts Postponements Slower traffic Poor after-market returns Will this change going into the last two months, or will this cycle carry us into the 2016? The hope is that seasonal trends will lift the market enough for many names to get through the door at higher prices.\nIf the market lifts, you can bet someone will start the ball rolling. There's an old saying in the IPO business: one dog starts barking in the kennel, and the rest of them all start barking as well.\nWoof.\nOne dog barks in the kennel, and the rest of the dogs start barking.\nWoof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:51:28.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
