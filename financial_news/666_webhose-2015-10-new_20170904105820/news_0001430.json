James Alcock by Duncan Hughes and Su-Lin Tan Sydney's weekend auction clearance rate slipped to its lowest level in three years, in more evidence the market is cooling.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's financial stability review, released on Friday, found \"tentative\" signs of a turn in sentiment in both Melbourne and Sydney, the nation's flagship property markets, citing slower price growth and weaker auction results.\n\"There has been a remarkably sharp fall in Sydney,\" said Domain Group's senior economist Andrew Wilson.\nDr Wilson said clearance rates in Sydney's western suburbs had fallen below 50 per cent, creating a buyers' market for the first time in several years.\nAccording to Domain's preliminary figures, the Sydney clearance rate was 65 per cent, compared with 72 per cent for the same time last year. According to RP Data figures, Sydney cleared 67 per cent, compared with 72 per cent last year.\nAcross the nation there were more than 2800 auctions and a clearance rate of below 70 per cent for the fifth successive week, according to Domain.\nWestpac last Wednesday jacked up interest rates by 0.2 of a percentage point for the first time in more than three years, a move other banks are predicted to follow to some extent.\nDropped out In Sydney's lower north shore, an unrenovated older style three-bedroom house sold for more than its reserve price of $2.2 million at auction but not before one of the three bidders dropped out.\n\"You can blame Westpac for that,\" one disappointed bidder called-out at the auction at 28 Wyong Road. The bank last week announced a rate rise for owner-occupiers.\n\"Borrowing went from 90 per cent to 70 per cent,\" the bidder, who did not wish to be named, said.\n\"You spend six months looking for a property ... then you had to go and find another $200,000.\"\nMarketing agent, McGrath's Priscilla Shonell said there had been \"some whispers\" among buyers about the rate hike affecting their buying abilities but the Sydney lower north shore market remains healthy.\nBy contrast, in Melbourne, where many auctions in the dress circle inner suburb of Caulfield were postponed because of the racing carnival, sales remained robust, and more than seven-in-10 properties auctioned were sold.\nSales in Melbourne's outer eastern area, which is popular with Chinese investors, topped 80 per cent.\nNicholas Smedley, chief executive of Steller, the largest supplier of medium-density apartments in Melbourne's south-east, said sales were steady despite there being a dip in the number of inquiries.\n\"We still have the same conversion rate of sales from inquiries,\" he said. \"People who are cashed up and ready to go are facing less competition.\"\nChristopher Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, a mortgage broker, said a mix of rising rates, tougher borrowing conditions and market chatter about cooling prices were combining to weaken buyer sentiment.\n\"We are entering a new part of the cycle,\" Mr Foster-Ramsay said. \"The outlook will not be as hot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:08:46.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
