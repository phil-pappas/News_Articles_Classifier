David Mariuz by Tim Binsted Arrium will cut jobs and overhaul operating practices at its Whyalla steelworks in South Australia to save $100 million as the company rolls ahead with an auction for its prized mining consumables business.\nThe embattled steel, mining, and materials group said on Thursday it is seeking an additional $100 million of cost savings in its steel arm, OneSteel, on top of $60 million of previously announced cost savings from the group.\n\"In steel, global steel over-capacity means a step change in its cost base is required to maintain the competitiveness of the business,\" the company said.\n\"Arrium and its key stakeholders are aligned in the objective of improving the competitiveness and ongoing viability of the Wyalla business.\"\nNo figure was given on the number of jobs losses at the plant.\nThe company only said it was looking for \"broad-based cost reductions and efficiency improvements\" in areas such as \"labour and overheads, sourcing and procurement, production conversion costs, site rationalisations, and corporate costs.\"\nThe Whyalla steelworks produces about 1.2 million tonnes of raw steel every year, almost half of OneSteel's 2.5 million tonnes of annual production capacity, and is a key employer in the region.\nDebt burden struggle Arrium is struggling to cope with its $1.75 billion debt in the midst of depressed steel and iron ore markets.\nFellow listed steel maker BlueScope Steel has also said it must cut $200 million in costs from the nation's biggest steelworks at Port Kembla or it will mothball the plant and import commodity steel.\nScott Martin, the Australian Workers' Union organiser for Whyalla and the Eyre Peninsula, said the union and the workforce understood the tough conditions facing the company.\n\"We all know the steel works and the iron side of the business are struggling. They need to cut costs pretty dramatically and we are working with them as we can,\" he said.\n\"It's a bit grim up here. People in Whyalla are pretty resilient but they are nervy and people who have been made redundant have been struggling to pick up work.\"\nHe said the AWU covers about 650 employees working in and supplying the steelworks. In April 75 jobs were cut from BGC mining contractors, which works for Arrium, and a further 125 were cut in July.\nArrium has already slashed production ints its iron ore business from 13 million tonnes to 9 million tonnes to stem losses on higher cost production.\nThe group booked $1.9 billion of write-downs in 2014-15 , primarily against its iron ore assets, and shuttered its higher-cost Southern Iron mine, with 500 job losses, in January.\nOn track to break even The company said on Thursday it is on track to get its break-even cost of mining iron ore down to $U47 a tonne by the end of 2015-16, below the current spot price of $US56.32 a tonne.\nThe sale of Arrium's mining consumable business, which the company insists is not a sale but a response to \"significant interest\", has progressed to a short list of candidates.\nThose candidates, which are understood to include private equity firms Blackstone and TPG , will now undertake due diligence.\n\"Arrium continues to assess a number of alternatives to provide more diverse and flexible debt funding to ensure its debt structure is appropriate irrespective of whether a mining consumables transaction proceeds,\" the company said.\nThe mining consumable business, which supplies steel grinding balls to miners to separate minerals from ore, is the only Arrium business generating meaningful cash flow.\nIt is estimated to be worth up to $2 billion.\nArrium said it will continue to look for additional cost savings beyond the $160 million of current targets.\nIn an interview in August Arrium chief executive Andrew Roberts said, \"We are constantly looking at our costs and capital requirements. It is a bit like having breakfast. We get up, we have breakfast, we go to work, we take costs out.\"\nHe said in a statement on Thursday that the strategic review, launched in June, and cost savings measures, were progressing well.\nArrium shares were up 1 per cent to 8.8Â¢ at midday on Thursday, giving the group a market value of $257 million. The stock is down 75 per cent over the past year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:11:08.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
