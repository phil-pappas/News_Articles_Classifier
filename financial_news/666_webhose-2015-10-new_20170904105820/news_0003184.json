States need long-term certainty in order to make these key investments in significant transportation projects. That kind of certainty requires a robust and long-term federal commitment. Short-run, patchwork solutions by Congress will not do.\" \nIt has been ten years since Congress passed a highway bill that last longer than two years, much to the chagrin of transportation supporters who argue that states need longer to plan large infrastructure projects. \nThere’s little doubt that some sort of highway funding extension will materialize before the Oct. 29 deadline. The Senate has passed a multiyear highway bill in the summer and the House has scheduled a long awaited marked up a six-year highway bill of its own for Oct. 22. \nThere will likely not be enough time for the measure to work its way through the House before the deadline, however, meaning transportation advocates will have to settle for another extension. \nThe Democratic governors said Congress should instead focus on finishing work on a long-term highway bill. \n\"While we recognize and take seriously the magnitude of the infrastructure funding shortfall you confront, the current level of funding is insufficient to invest in America’s infrastructure in a way that strengthens our security and economy,\" they wrote. \n\"We understand that Congress is currently considering several funding proposals,\" the Democratic governors continued. \"Regardless of which proposals you ultimately choose, we urge you to act this year to advance a long-term proposal that sets our country on a path to bring our infrastructure back to a state of good repair. \n\"This is a matter of the utmost importance,\" they concluded. \"No less than the economic wellbeing of our nation and the safety of our citizens are at stake.\" \nThe letter was signed by Govs. Steve Bullock (D-Mont.); Dannel Malloy (D-Conn.); Jerry Brown (D-Calif.); John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.); Jack Markell (D-Del.); David Ige (D-Hawaii); Steve Beshear (D-Ky.); Mark Dayton (D-Minn.); Jay Nixon (D-Miss.); Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.); Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.); Kate Brown (D-Ore.); Tom Wolf (D-Pa.); Alejandro García Padilla (D-Puerto Rico); Gina Raimondo (D-R.I.); Peter Shumlin (D-Vt.); Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.); Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) and Earl Ray Tomblin (D-W.
