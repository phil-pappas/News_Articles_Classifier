WFT is set to report third-quarter 2015 results on Oct 21. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.In the last quarter, the company’s adjusted loss of 10 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an adjusted loss of 12 cents. The results also deteriorated sharply from the year-earlier adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share. Will Weatherford impress with its upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by it? Let’s see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around. Past Quarter Flashback In the third quarter of 2015, Weatherford was seen aligning itself with the changing market conditions. As a result of continued weakness in the North American market, Weatherford plans to further reduce its expenses. The company cut 10,000 jobs during the second quarter and another 1,000 personnel, mainly in the U.S. in the third quarter. Weatherford plans to close 30 facilities in the second half of 2015. These measures are expected to help the company overcome the impact of the downturn as well as take advantage of the opportunity to develop a leaner structure and a tighter organization. For the third quarter, Weatherford expects positive free cash flow from a reduction in working capital balances and efficiency in capital expenditure spending.The bleak picture was the result of Weatherford being an oilfield machinery and equipment manufacturer, the business of which is positively correlated to crude price. The oil pricing environment was extremely weak during the entire third quarter. This in turn might have resulted in less work for the likes of this company. On top of that, oil price is expected to remain low through 2015. Owing to weak commodity pricing, the company has further reduced its capital expenditure guidance for 2015 by $100 million to $750 million, which is 48% lower than the 2014 level. Based on its cost-reduction efforts, the company estimates annualized savings to exceed $700 million.Overall activities of Weatherford during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted loss per share deteriorated to 11 cents from 8 cents per share over the last 60 days. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Weatherford is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 11 cents. Zacks Rank: Weatherford has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.
