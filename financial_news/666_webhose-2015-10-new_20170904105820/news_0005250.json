The number of seats will be limited to no more than seven in each car.\nUber and Didi Kuaidi are locked in a turf war in China, investing billions of dollars to lure in riders with steep discounts and to subsidise the money earned by drivers.\nUber China said in a statement on Thursday it was preparing documents to apply for a licence.\nDidi Kuaidi, a $16 billion firm backed by Chinese Internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd also said on Thursday it had received a car booking licence for its operations in Shanghai and that it was seeking more licences from other cities.\nDidi Kuaidi is the dominant ride-hailing app in China, although Uber recently closed a $1.2 billion deal to enter 100 more Chinese cities in the next 12 months.
