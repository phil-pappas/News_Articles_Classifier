Andrew Meares by The Australian Financial Review Joe Hockey has spelled out the economic policy agenda that Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison must sell to the Australian people.\nIncreasing the 10 per cent rate of the goods and services tax and broadening its base would allow income taxes to be cut \"so that people and companies are given more incentive to take risks and receive rewards\". Superannuation tax concessions should be pared back to further pay for a system of lower but broader-based taxation.\nIn his valedictory speech in Parliament , Mr Hockey nominated a 40:20:20 rule: a 40 per cent top marginal personal income tax rate that cut in at a lower income; a 20 per cent tax rate for most income earners; and a 20 per cent company tax rate.\nBy stimulating economic growth, that would generate a larger and more sustainable tax base with which to look after the less advantaged.\nFrom the Gallery: David Rowe David Rowe As well as restoring incentives in the tax system, Mr Hockey rightly urged the Turnbull government to fix the \"structural imbalances\" in workplace regulation that are strangling the supply of good-paying jobs. Punishingly high penalty rates are literally penalising small businesses, particularly those that compete in a global and digital marketplace, he noted.\n'Man of the people' Treasurer Joe Hockey was a \"man of the people Treasurer\" who came to be unfairly depicted as a cigar-chomping elitist. He gave one of the most influential Australian political speeches of modern times in his End of the Age of Entitlement address in London in 2012 that depicted universal access to payments and entitlements from the state as both fiscally unaffordable in the wake of the global financial crisis, and culturally corrosive of enterprise.\nYet his first budget included an ultra-generous new entitlement program, for parental leave, at the behest of his prime minister. He was still being touted, as recently as July last year in an unwisely encouraged biography, as being next in line to succeed Tony Abbott. Yet, just over four weeks ago, he lost his job, along with his boss..\nFormer Treasurer Joe Hockey delivers his valedictory speech at Parliament House. Andrew Meares Wednesday's valedictory showcased Mr Hockey's attributes: a heartfelt communicator and retail politician capable of convincing arguments for what he believes. The son of small business-owning migrants, those beliefs include hard work, the opportunities offered by his family's adopted home and the virtues of enterprise. After swinging a rhetorical axe through Australia's entitlement mentality, his real axe was blunted by a prime minister whose instincts were ultimately wary of major economic reform or removing entitlement.\nAs The Australian Financial Review has argued, the downfall can be traced to before the September 2013 election victory, when Mr Abbott ruled out too many areas of spending cuts that, in office, he and Mr Hockey later tried to rule back in. Amid the contradictions, the Abbott government fell at the first hurdle of the May 2014 budget.\nMr Hockey's first budget did not clearly and consistently lay out the case for reining in the the over-inflated expectations of a resource boom that had now ended. It was perceived, unreasonably for the most part, as unfair. Yet it had too many proposals that were not sufficiently signalled, explained, or in some cases, thought through. Without popular support, the expected backing of the oddball Senate crossbenchers evaporated.\nThere were victories amid the defeats. Along with NSW Premier Mike Baird, Mr Hockey's asset recycling fund has encouraged state governments to sell mature assets – such as power grids – in order to finance new infrastructure. And Mr Hockey politically led the preparations for a well-organised G20 summit.\nMr Hockey receives a standing ovation from colleagues. Andrew Meares But the end was signalled by Mr Hockey's second budget, in May this year, based around a politically desperate, and fleeting, small business stimulus. By then, getting the budget back to surplus was relegated to eight sentences tacked on to the end of the budget speech, sweetened with tax breaks for tradies. That retreated on one of the core promises on which the Abbott government was elected – to secure Australian prosperity by getting its public finances back in order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:02:22.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
