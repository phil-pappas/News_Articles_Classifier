Velocity therefore affects the clocks’ observed tempo.\nResearchers were looking at the description of unstable particles moving in accelerating motion in a straight line.\nAccording to an effect predicted in 1976 by physicist William Unruh, the number of particles visible within a quantum field varies depending on the acceleration experienced by an observer – the greater the acceleration, the more of them there are.\nThe unstable particles which the researchers treated as fundamental clocks in their analysis decay as a result of interactions with other quantum fields.\nThe theory says that if such a particle remains in a space filled with a vacuum it decays at a different pace than when in the vicinity of many other particles interacting with it.\nThus if in a system of extreme acceleration more particles can be seen as a result of the Unruh effect, the average decay times of particles such as muons should change.\n“Our calculations showed that above certain very large accelerations there simply must be time disorders in the decay of elementary particles,” said Dragan.\nIf the disturbances affect fundamental clocks such as muons, then any other device built on the principles of quantum field theory will also be disrupted, he said.\n“Therefore, perfectly precise measurements of proper time are no longer possible,” said Dragan.\nThe study was published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity.\nFirst Published on October 11, 2015 6:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:09:29.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
