The biggest driver of housing prices is employment growth, so it's hard to see Sydney slowing much while jobs are not.

Periods of large growth have been followed by years of sideways price action, he said.\nWhile auction clearance rates are falling, Deutsche Bank says there is little chance of the property market crashing.

It's true that debt levels are very high compared to history, but the interest burden isn't,\" Mr Baker said.\nHe said the construction cycle, which had a bigger influence on the economy, jobs and company earnings, had moved with price in the past decade, but that was not the historical trend.\n\"Record housing starts are cited as a warning sign, but relative to population (also at a record level) they're below previous peaks,\" Mr Baker said.\nAfter a boom, house prices have tended to be relatively flat for several years rather than fall, Deutsche Bank says Photo: Deutsche Bank\nConstruction needed to pick up by 20 per cent to approach historic peaks, and said poor affordability among renters was evidence of an \"underbuild\".\nOn the equity market, investors seemed to be pricing in a fall, meaning that housing sector-exposed stocks were now trading at a 5 to 10 per cent price-earnings discount to the market.\nThis is the largest discount in four years, despite the companies, which include Boral, Stockland, Fletcher Building and Harvey Norman offering above-market earnings-per-share growth.\nConstruction needed to pick up by 20 per cent to approach historic peaks, says Deutsche Bank.
