This should help arrest the sim box menace which is costing both the government and the telecos millions of Ghana cedis” he added. \nThe role out of phase 1B which will be after 1A will provide other value added services like EIR (Equipment Identity Register) services for the blocking of stolen handsets, a common platform for independent international wholesale carriers to deliver calls and the capability of routing of local interconnect calls. \nAfriwave Telecom is a wholly owned Ghanaian company that employs a wide range of technologies in its operations including GSM, GPRS, LTE, Wi-max and CDMA among others was licensed by the National Communications Authority (NCA) as an Interconnect Clearing House, the first of its kind in Ghana in February 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:17:03.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
