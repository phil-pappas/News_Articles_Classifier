Venkatesham on Thursday launched celebration of BATHUKAMMA in collaboration with PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry to popularize the colourful and vibrant festival of Telangana for north India, beginning Friday ( 16.10.2015 ) with a commitment that it will evolve into a global carnival by 2020. Addressing the members of media at a press conference held here on Thursday which was witnessed by the Vice President, PHD Chamber, Mr. Gopal Jiwarajka among others Mr. B Venkatesham said that the newly carved out state of Telangana would make the Bathukamma as a pan India festival since in the past, the celebration of this festival stayed confined to Telangana region in the united Andhra Pradesh. “Now that the 29 th State of the Indian Union has come into existence since 2014, the government of Telangana has pledged to itself to gradually extend it to all part of the country as this is the only festival perhaps in the entire globe that seeks to empower a female child and the women’s as a whole”, said Mr. Venkatesham. Explaining about the Bathukamma, the Secretary said, “ Bathukamma is a beautiful flower stack, arranged with different unique seasonal flowers most of them with medicinal values, in seven concentric layers in the shape of temple towers. Bathukamma is a combination of two words of Telugu language, viz., bathuku (life) and amma (mother). As such, Bathukamma is a rendering of humans to MOTHER NATURE. It is one sort of tribute of mankind to Nature and shows the harmony and relationship between them”. “This festival is celebrated to glorify womanhood and her exalted position in the family. During the celebration, Goddess 'Gauri' the patron Goddess of womanhood is worshipped by all the women with utmost devotion and piety. Bathukamma is the biggest flower festival of the world which is celebrated by women”, said Mr. Venkatesham. According to him, Bathukamma is celebrated with joy and gaiety in the entire State of Telangana. During this 9 day festival, there are dance performances, music, dramas and a variety of entertainments as lakhs of tourists and locals too, flock to witness the festivities and celebrations. This is an ideal occasion to visit the State of Telangana which offers its visitors a plethora of places of pristine natural beauty, abundant wildlife, magnificent palaces and forts reflecting architectural blends along with immense opportunities to explore its artistic and cultural enrichment. The State Government of Telangana has an ambitious plan to transform this occasion as a Global Carnival at Hyderabad with an estimated footfall of around 1 million people by 2025. Directorate of Tourism and Department of Language & Culture, Government of Telangana and PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry have joined hands to position it as a leading Tourism Carnival of the country under the brand of F 3 (Female, Flower, Festival) Carnival.
