Louie Douvis by David Oon Among the numerous rules that apply to SMSF trustees when making investments, the sole-purpose test is one that strikes fear into the hearts of many.\nDespite this, the lore in this area is scarier than the law. While certainty is probably out of reach, there are many myths that can be dispelled.\nThe sole-purpose test broadly requires that a fund is maintained for certain core purposes, or for the core purposes and certain ancillary purposes. The core purposes mainly relate to providing retirement or death benefits. The ancillary purposes include providing benefits on or after termination of employment. In broad terms, the test can \"catch\" prohibited investments as well as prohibited benefits taken out of superannuation.\nAdditionally, since many people know that dealings with business real property can be permissible, they assume that the sole-purpose test must have a \"carve-out\" for these types of dealings. Many people also expect that the sole-purpose test contains words that prohibit \"present-day benefits\", the use or enjoyment of residential property by members and related-party benefits. However, the surprising reality is that none of these terms are mentioned in the test whatsoever.\nThe Tax Office in its ruling SMSFR 2008/2 examined certain past court and tribunal decisions and confirmed that compliance with the sole-purpose test is \"discerned from an objective consideration of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the maintenance of an SMSF\". To restate this, the test is an objective test that asks what a reasonable observer would conclude. The test is not focused on a trustee's actual subjective intentions or motivations. This objective nature of the test was also confirmed in Montgomery Wools [2012] AATA 61.\nUse in decision making One of the best tools in understanding the sole-purposes test is an examination of how it has been applied in decisions. Once again, the sole-purpose test can apply to SMSF investments and also SMSF benefits.\nThe key is that contraventions of the sole-purpose test for SMSF investments only ever appear to arise where there are non-arm's-length dealings. This means an SMSF either invests directly in a non-arm's-length fashion, or indirectly as part of an arrangement that involves non-arm's-length dealings.\n The only reported decisions of an SMSF failing the sole-purpose test have involved SMSF trustees transferring money to others and then failing to take arm's-length steps to have the money repaid. Despite this, the ATO has not expressly endorsed this method of dealing with the sole-purpose test.\nThe sole-purpose test does not mention the words \"arm's length\". However, recall that it is an objective test. If an investment is made on an arm's-length basis, the natural objective conclusion is far more likely to be that it was done to provide retirement benefits, etc, such that the investment is seen to be consistent with the sole-purpose test.\nIn Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Superannuation) v Graham Family Superannuation Pty Limited [2014] FCA 1101, Buchanan J described a contravention of the sole-purpose test as occurring because an SMSF trustee provided rental accommodation on non-arm's-length terms to a related party.\nAdditionally, provided there is arm's-length rent, it is broadly accepted that an SMSF can lease business real property to a member, for the member to use in the present. This could be done even when the member is too young to take any benefits out of superannuation at the time. The member might even subjectively enjoy using the business real property (it could be a well appointed office, and the member could enjoy spending time at work).\nIt is difficult to see how this does not contravene the sole-purpose test, unless it is true that the essence of the sole-purpose test is not focused on what the asset is or whether the person enjoyed it, but rather on whether the dealings were objectively at arm's length.\nThere is a more straightforward application of the sole-purpose test to when a benefit is taken from superannuation. The rule of thumb is that if the benefit is taken out contrary to the payment rules (eg, taken out by a young person who is not entitled to benefits due to preservation rules), then the benefit is also likely to contravene the sole-purpose test.\nThe broad nature of the sole-purpose test might suggest it is difficult to prove that it has been contravened. While this is true, it represents a double-edged sword. In the decision of Montgomery Wools [2012] AATA 61, an SMSF bought all the units in a unit trust. The unit trust essentially allowed its assets to be used to support a family business. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal took the view that because the SMSF only passively allowed the unit trust to operate in this way, the arm's length rule was not contravened. On the other hand, the sole-purpose test was contravened. That is, the actions were not \"caught\" by the narrower arm's-length rule, but they were caught by the sole-purpose test.\nWhile an SMSF may sidestep certain laws on a technicality, there is a wide ambit in the sole-purpose test that arguably captures broader non-arm's-length dealings.\nDavid Oon is a senior associate at DBA Lawyers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:16:57.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
