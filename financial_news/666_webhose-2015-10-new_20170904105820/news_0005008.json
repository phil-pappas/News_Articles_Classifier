(2) The Early Tender Premium is included in the Total Consideration for Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offer at or prior to the Early Tender Date (as defined below). (3) Barrick is the applicable Offeror for the 2.50% Notes due 2018, the 6.95% Notes due 2019, the 3.85% Notes due 2022 and the 4.10% Notes due 2023. (4) Barrick (PD) Australia Finance Pty Ltd is the applicable Offeror for the 4.95% Notes due 2020. (5) Barrick North America Finance LLC is the applicable Offeror for the 6.80% Notes due 2018 and the 4.40% Notes due 2021. \nHolders of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 13, 2015 (the \"Early Tender Date\") and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable \"Total Consideration\", which includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 of principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase (the \"Early Tender Premium\"). Holders of Notes who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date, but at or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below), will be eligible to receive only the applicable \"Tender Offer Consideration\", which is an amount equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium. The Tender Offer Consideration or Total Consideration, as applicable, will only be paid to holders of tendered Notes to the extent that the applicable Offeror accepts such Notes for purchase. The Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, for each series per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was determined by reference to the applicable fixed spread (the \"Fixed Spread\") specified for such series over the applicable yield (the \"Reference Yield\") based on the bid side price of the applicable reference U.S. Treasury Security (the \"Reference U.S. Treasury Security\") specified for such series of Notes on the front page of the Offer to Purchase or in the table above, as calculated by Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (the \"Dealer Managers\") at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 14, 2015. In addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes accepted for purchase will be paid from the last applicable interest payment date up to, but not including, the settlement date. Withdrawal rights with respect to the Notes tendered expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 13, 2015. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Offer to Purchase, holders may tender Notes until midnight, New York City time, on October 27, 2015, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Expiration Date\"). The settlement date for the Tender Offer will follow promptly after the Expiration Date. The Offerors expect the settlement date will be October 28, 2015. The Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If any of the conditions are not satisfied or waived by the Offerors, the Offerors will not be obligated to accept for purchase, purchase or pay for, validly tendered Notes, in each case subject to applicable laws, and may terminate the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on the tender of a minimum principal amount of Notes.
