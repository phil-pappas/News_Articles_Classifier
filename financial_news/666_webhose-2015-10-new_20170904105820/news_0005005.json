Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Treasurer Scott Morrison appears to have put the kybosh on taxing the superannuation earnings of retirees, by describing Labor's plans to do so as \"greedy\" and a betrayal of investors.\nA day after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said all options on super, including Labor's already announced policy proposals, should be considered as part of the tax reform process, the Treasurer indicated any change the Coalition might make would focus on the accumulation phase.\n\"It is also important that if you are going to put in place tax incentives for superannuation, we're encouraging Australians to invest in this superannuation, then they have to have some certainty about what is going to happen in 20 or 30 years' time when they're in the retirement phase,\" Mr Morrison told Parliament on Wednesday.\nHe said while \"the government will be looking at issues in relation to superannuation\", voters could be assured that the Coalition would ensure stability for those already saving in the belief their earnings in retirement would be tax free.\n\"What the shadow treasurer [Chris Bowen] is putting forward is to increase the uncertainty around superannuation investments by focusing his greedy tax initiatives on the retirement phase,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"Now, those on this side have a very good record when it comes to understanding that when you have saved for your future we don't come and raid it.\"\nMr Turnbull also underwent a shift in rhetoric, accusing Labor of \"playing the politics of envy\" through its desire to \"assault\" and \"undermine\" superannuation.\n'Punch and Judy show' again Labor has promised a 15 per cent tax on the super income of retirees on all earnings of more than $75,000. Also, the 30 per cent tax rate on contributions would apply to those on incomes from $250,000 and more, down from the current threshold of $300,000 .\nMr Bowen said on Wednesday that it was \"the Punch and Judy show\" again.\n\"First … [Joe] Hockey would leave it on the table and then [Tony] Abbott would rule it out.\n\"Now we have Mr Turnbull leaving it on the table and Mr Morrison ruling it out.\n\"If we are serious about addressing budget reform in a fair and sustainable manner, then the growth of earnings tax concessions must be addressed.\"\nOn Tuesday night, Social Services Minister and former Western Australian treasurer Christian Porter said it could not be assumed that if super taxes were increased, then the tax previously foregone would translate directly into revenue, because people may choose to invest elsewhere.\nMr Morrison faces a separate tax challenge when he meets state and territory treasurers on Friday. He has pledged no increase in the overall tax take but believes he can generate revenue by changing the tax mix to stimulate economic growth. He has not ruled out using a GST increase to fund tax cuts to combat bracket creep.\nBut the Labor states of Victoria and Queensland reaffirmed on Wednesday they remained opposed to any GST increase and South Australia reaffirmed it would support a GST increase only if the proceeds were used to help cover the growing health funding gap, not fund election-year tax cuts.\n﻿", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:03:26.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
