Eurostat is expected to confirm the consumer price index fell 0.1% year-on-year in September, down from August's 0.1% rise, as energy prices continued to drag. \nThe expected deflation comes despite the ECB's â‚¬60bn monthly asset purchase programme. \nECB governing council member Edward Nowotny on Thursday said fresh measures were needed to lift inflation towards the monetary authority's target of just below 2%. \n\"The ECB is using monetary policy instruments available but in my view it's quite obvious that ... additional sets of instruments are necessary,\" Nowotny said at an event in Warsaw. \n\"These include structural measures ... but also on the demand side of the economy and also on the institutional factors of the economy.\" On the calendar elsewhere, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence report is due in Friday afternoon trading as well as industrial production figures. \nFollowing a batch of recent negative US data including retail sales and non-farm-payrolls, any further weakness is likely to add to expectations the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates this month. \nFriday 16 October INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Barr (A.G.), Christie Group (LSE: CTG.L - news ) , Computacenter (LSE: CCC.L - news ) , esure Group, G4S (Copenhagen: G4S.CO - news ) , Glanbia (Other OTC: GLAPF - news ) , Highcroft Investment, Highland Gold Mining Ltd (Other OTC: HGHGF - news ) ., Octopus AIM VCT 2 (LSE: OSEC.L - news ) , Petrofac Ltd., Robert Walters (LSE: RWA.L - news ) , SafeCharge International Group Limited (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ), Total Produce (LSE: TOT.L - news ) , Treatt (LSE: TET.L - news ) , Tribal Group (LSE: TRB.L - news ) INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Balance of Trade (EU) (10:00) Capacity Utilisation (US) (14:15) Consumer Price Index (EU) (10:00) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (EU) (10:00) Industrial Production (US) (14:15) New Car Registrations (EU) (10:00) U. of Michigan Confidence (Prelim) (US) (15:00) Wholesale Price Index (GER) (07:00) GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) React Energy (LSE: REAC.L - news ) , Trinity Exploration & Production (Stuttgart: 3BEA.SG - news ) FINALS Volution Group (WI) SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE esure Group AGMS Mortice Ltd.
