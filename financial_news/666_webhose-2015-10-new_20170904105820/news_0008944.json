The terms and conditions of the transaction are consistent with those outlined by Goodyear when the agreement was announced on June 4, 2015.\nView photo\n. \"This successful resolution enhances our flexibility to grow profitably as we focus on delivering strong performance and sustainable economic value,\" said Goodyear Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President Richard J. Kramer. \"Despite current challenges in the global economy, the long-term growth prospects for the tire industry remain strong. This agreement paves the way for us to pursue our growth strategy and strengthen our presence in key global markets particularly where our technology leadership and the Goodyear brand provide us competitive advantage.\"\nThe alliance, which was formed in 1999, primarily consisted of four joint venture operating companies, one each in North America and Europe, and two in Japan.\nUnder terms of the agreement, Goodyear retains exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires in the replacement market and to non-Japanese auto manufacturers in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Goodyear also retains exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires in replacement and original equipment markets in European countries where the former joint venture exclusively served the market. Additionally, Goodyear regains exclusive rights to serve Japanese markets with Goodyear-brand tires. The completion of the transaction will resolve the pending arbitration filed in January 2014.\nAs previously announced, the transaction does not impact the company's existing financial targets or capital allocation plan. The company will include the impact of the transaction in its full-year outlook beginning in February 2016.\nGoodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies. It employs about 66,000 people and manufactures its products in 49 facilities in 22 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.
