Aluminum company Alcoa (NYSE: AA - news ) shares were down 5.4 percent following disappointing results. \nZinc jumped, in its biggest daily gain in seven years, after troubled mining giant Glencore said it would cut production. \nGlencore shares gained and were on track for a gain of about 40 percent on the week - their biggest weekly rise since being floated in mid-2011 - and doubling from the record low reached only two weeks ago. \nThe dollar also fell against the Swiss franc, while a dollar index was down 0.5 percent. The euro was last up 0.59 percent against the dollar at $1.12430. \n\"The comments about inflation remaining low, the concern that that's going to push the hike out to next year is what's driving currencies against the board,\" said Jason Leinwand, managing director at Riverside Risk Advisors in New York. \nThe Fed minutes revealed the extent to which policymakers are concerned that a global economic slowdown might threaten the U.S. economic outlook. Though they said overseas turmoil had not \"materially altered\" economic prospects, they opted to hold interest rates steady last month. \nAn unexpectedly weak U.S. jobs report for September last week led many investors to speculate that the Fed will not deliver its first hike until 2016, a feeling strengthened by the minutes. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.95 points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,086.7, the S&P 500 gained 3.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,017.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.99 points, or 0.52 percent, to 4,835.78. \nThe FTSEuroFirst index of the leading 300 European shares was up 0.5 percent. \nBRENT TRACK FOR WEEKLY GAIN \nBrent crude oil futures were lower but on course for a rise of more than 10 percent on the week, which would be its biggest weekly gain since 2009. \nU.S. crude was up 1.2 percent at $50.01 a barrel. Oil also got a boost overnight after forecaster PIRA Energy Group predicted crude prices would rise to $70 per barrel by the end of 2016. \nThree-month zinc futures were up 11.2 percent on the London Metal Exchange at $1,854 a tonne after Glencore said it will cut production by 500,000 tonnes, equivalent to 4 percent of the world's output. \nZinc had fallen 30 percent since May to a five-year low, so the rebound could mark the bottom of the market and the commodities complex in general, some analysts said. \nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury prices were flat, with the yield at 2.102 percent. \nOn Thursday HSBC issued one of the boldest U.S. and European yield forecasts of all the big investment banks, predicting the 10-year U.S. yield will fall to 1.5 percent and the equivalent German bund yield at just 0.2 percent next year.
