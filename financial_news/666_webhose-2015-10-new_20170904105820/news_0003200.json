On Thursday, the embattled automaker said it is examining early models of its current diesel, the EA 288, to see if it also contains software to cheat on emissions tests. JULIAN STRATENSCHULTE / EPA Almost five weeks after it admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests in the United States, Volkswagen is still grappling to get to the bottom of a scandal that has wiped about a third off its stock market value, forced out its long-time CEO and rocked the global car industry and German establishment.\n\"The way this is all coming out ... is amazing,\" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. \"Perhaps they can change their advertising slogan from 'Das Auto' to 'Das Motor: Engines so complicatâ€Žed even we don't understand how they work!'\" he said.\nVolkswagen said in its statement there was no banned software built into vehicles with its latest EA 288 Euro 6 diesel engine, adding this had been confirmed by Germany's KBA automotive regulator.\n\"Other generations of the EA 288 are currently being examined,\" it added, without elaborating.\nadvertisement Ferrari Blasts Off Down a Road Not Taken (Until Now) With NYSE Listing\nU.S. regulators have already said they are investigating Volkswagen's \"generation 3\" vehicles in the United States, which are powered by the EA 288 diesel engine.\nBut analysts said that would be small number compared with the volume of vehicles with EA 288 engines on European roads.\nDiesel vehicles account for about a half of auto sales in Europe, compared with a small fraction in the United States.\nVolkswagen said last week it would recall and refit 8.5 million vehicles in the European Union. It added on Wednesday that about 3 million of those would need hardware changes -- a more costly upgrade than the software changes needed for the other affected vehicles.\nadvertisement", "external_links": ["http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1271821/151022-volkswagen-ea189-engine-mbm_552629904bf832395015e2a30cdd9f9a.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1271821/151022-volkswagen-ea189-engine-mbm_552629904bf832395015e2a30cdd9f9a.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1271821/151022-volkswagen-ea189-engine-mbm_552629904bf832395015e2a30cdd9f9a.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:57:18.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
