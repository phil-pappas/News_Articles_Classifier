(NASDAQ: CTCT) today announced that it is joining the Facebook Marketing Partner Program, a select group of world-class marketing companies vetted by Facebook for their ability to drive exceptional results. The badge status follows the early success of Constant Contact's tool for Facebook advertising , which allows small businesses to easily convert their Constant Contact email into a highly targeted, mobile-optimized digital ad on Facebook in minutes. \n'Facebook is dedicated to helping small businesses around the world grow,' said Steve Irvine, global head of Facebook Marketing Partners. 'Our Marketing Partner Constant Contact is helping make Facebook advertising easy for small businesses, and we will continue to expand our Small Business Solutions program to bolster innovation on the platform.' \nWhile email marketing has traditionally been used to engage current customers, Constant Contact's new tool allows small businesses to leverage email campaigns-created via a platform they are already familiar with-as a new and budget-friendly way to reach new customers. \n'Email and Facebook have become a one-two punch for small business marketing. More than 45 million small businesses have active Pages, and they also cite email as the top marketing tool to drive customer loyalty ,' said Joel Hughes, senior vice president of emerging businesses at Constant Contact. 'As leaders in our respective industries, Constant Contact and Facebook are giving small businesses an easy and affordable way to become more effective marketers and grow their business.' \nConstant Contact's New Tool for Small Businesses Utilizes Lookalike Audiences \nConstant Contact's tool for Facebook advertising allows small businesses to save time and easily create a Facebook Ad by using the content of their Constant Contact email campaigns, automatically pulling in email content and images. \nAfter the ad is created, Constant Contact uses Facebook's Lookalike Audiences to find potential new customers with traits and interests similar to the contacts in their Constant Contact account. Lookalike targeting factors include location, age, gender, interests, and likelihood to purchase, making it more likely that those who see the ads on Facebook are interested in the small business's product or service. Reporting metrics, including reach and clicks, are made available in real time. The entire ad process-from creation to reporting-is conducted right within the small business's Constant Contact account. \nTo date, customers using this tool have each reached nearly 8,000 potential new customers on average per campaign. \n'With Constant Contact's tool for Facebook advertising, small businesses can take their tried and true email marketing formula and automatically apply it to this new and effective channel, gaining new fans and customers in the process,' said Hughes. \nInserted directly into the email campaign product, the new tool requires no additional technological savviness on the part of the small business. Constant Contact has a dedicated team and proprietary technology that monitors performance and adjusts ads to improve click-through rates. Additionally, ads created with this new tool will be automatically optimized for mobile display, an ideal experience for the hundreds of millions of people who access Facebook every day through their mobile phones. \nFor more information about Constant Contact's tool for Facebook advertising, click here . \nAbout Constant Contact®, Inc. \nConstant Contact introduced the first email marketing tool for small businesses, nonprofits, and associations in 1998.
