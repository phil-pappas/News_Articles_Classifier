The banking industry has now paid out more than £24bn in compensation to customers who were mis-sold the product. \nThere were still 883,043 complaints about payment protection insurance in the six-month period, but this was down 16.6pc on the second half of 2014, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority. That dragged down the total number of complaints by 2.1pc to 2.1m. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is the first time since 2012 that PPI complaints have fallen below the 1m mark in any six-month period, and the product now accounts for less than half of all financial services complaints, at 41.3pc of the total. \nBoth current accounts and pensions products have undergone radical overhauls in the last few years to offer more choice to consumers. Despite this complaints in both of these areas have jumped. \nCurrent accounts received the second highest level of complaints in the first half of the year, with 506,326 lodged against banks and building societies - a leap of 31.6pc on the previous period. Under the seven-day switching service , introduced in 2013, customers are allowed to move from one bank to another in the first two years after opening a current account. \nMeanwhile decumulation, life and pensions products attracted 73,055 complaints - a rapid increase of 19.7pc. Last year the Government reformed the pension system to give people more financial flexibility at retirement age. \nComplaints about credit cards also shot up, rising 11.1pc to 121,615 in the first half. Consumer group Which? has launched a campaign for changes to the way credit cards are advertised, as it believes it is unfair to promote a card as offering 0pc on balance transfers for a set period of time, when the cards can in fact come with a fee for transferring that debt. \n“The decrease in the overall number of complaints is driven by a drop in PPI claims, but overall the figures are still far too high and it’s particularly worrying to see current account complaints continuing to rise,” said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which? \n“Banks must step up their efforts to ensure that they deal with issues quickly and fairly and stop the same problems happening repeatedly.” \nHowever, some areas saw complaints fall general insurance complaints slid 4.3pc to 304,919, while savings complaints fell 6.4pc to 78,981.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:50:26.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
