It is still not easy to be young and starting out in today's labour market,' she added. \nAccording to the report, global shares of youth in the total labour force, whether employed or unemployed, are decreasing over time; explaining that one reason is that more young people (although still not enough) are participating in education. \nIt said however, millions of young people in low-income countries continue to leave school to take up jobs when they are too young. \nAccording to the report, 31 per cent of youth in low-income countries have no educational qualifications at all, compared to six per cent in lower middle-income countries and two per cent in upper middle-income countries. It also highlights a persistent gender gap with the rates of young women's participation in the labour market being significantly lower than those of young men in most regions; stating that they continue to be also more exposed to unemployment than their male counterpart.\nIt said more young people in developed economies were now finding work but the quality of jobs is below their expectations; adding that still too many remain stuck in long-term unemployment. \nIt said developing economies continue to be plagued by structural underemployment, informal employment and working poverty. \nIt noted that while working poverty (living on less than two dollars per day) has decreased over the past 20 years, it still affects 169 million (one in three) young workers in the developing world. \nThe report said the number increases to 286 million if the near poor are included (living on less than four dollars a day). \nThe report offers new evidence on how young people move into the labour market based on data from recent school-to-work transition surveys. \nIt said for young people who aspire to a stable job, the transition period takes an average of 19 months. \nIt said a young person with university education is able to move to a stable job in one-third of the time needed for a youth with primary education; stating that in most cases the transition takes longer for young women than men. \nIt said rapid changes in technology, in patterns of work and employment relationship, as well as new forms of start-ups, requires constant adjustment to new labour market conditions and addressing skills mismatches. \nThe report said providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality. \nIt mentioned that providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background. \n'We know that today's youth do not face an easy labour market transition and with the continued global economic slowdown, this is likely to continue, but we also know that greater investment in targeted action to boost youth employment pays off. It is time to scale up action in support of youth employment,' said Azita Berar Awad, Director of the ILO's Employment Policy Department. \nThe report said a combination of efforts that place priority on job creation and target the specific disadvantages of young people are required to reap the benefits of public and private investments and of other measures to restore economic growth. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:13:17.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
