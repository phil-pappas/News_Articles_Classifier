Photo: Peter Mathew\nKlaus Bartosch, the man responsible for 5000 of the 6500 final submissions to the Murray inquiry into the financial system, says the government's ban on excessive credit and debit card surcharges isn't one and could make matters worse.\nMr Bartosch heads up a newly listed doctor booking website 1stAvailable. On a trip to Melbourne three years ago he just \"got pissed off\" and decided to launch a campaign on Change.org from his hotel room to pressure the government to ban surcharges.\nHe got a strong response to \"Jetstar: drop your deceitful, rip-off $8.50 credit card surcharge for booking online\" , and had 109,951 supporters as of Tuesday. The 5000 submissions that swamped the Murray inquiry last year, which he had encouraged signatories to submit, were the pleas that got the government's attention.\nThey were enough to give Mr Bartosch the ear of then treasurer Joe Hockey and Malcolm Turnbull. He said representatives of Mr Hockey spoke to him, and Malcolm Turnbull wrote him a letter when he was communications minister about six weeks ago.\nAdvertisement He said they both appeared to support a complete ban on surcharging, but claimed they were rolled by cabinet. \"Joe Hockey's office made it clear that they were supportive of the full ban but did not have full cabinet support to do so,\" Mr Bartosch said.\nSimpler He thinks companies should just count the costs of accepting cards and other forms of electronic payment as another cost of doing business, like electricity or salaries.\nAs such, he argues it would be much simpler to just completely ban them.\nMasterCard has estimated surcharges cost consumers about $1.6 billion a year. Its Australian chief, Andrew Cartwright, argues businesses don't surcharge for the cost of handling cash so they shouldn't for cards. The Reserve Bank of Australia has found, however, that cash is the cheapest payment method for business.\nThe Murray inquiry recommended against giving any agency such a specific power because it argued it would be too costly and impractical to enforce. Instead, it recommended a complete ban on debit surcharges and a cap on Visa and MasterCard surcharges â€“ which is essentially what the government will introduce.\nMr Bartosch agrees with the Murray inquiry. \"I am very much delighted that the Turnbull government chose to take action. It is a really great win for consumers and all those that signed the petition,\" he said.\n\"But it doesn't go far enough. They have now opened the door to allow every merchant to apply a credit card surcharge albeit limited by legislation. While it is useful to have ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] enforce it, I don't think it has the resources to enforce it.\"\nAirlines have frequently been criticised for charging excessive surcharges. Qantas charges flat rates of between $2.50 and $7 for domestic bookings and $30 for international bookings. Virgin Australia charges $7.70 per booking. The RBA has said this can amount to up to 8 per cent on a standard Sydney-Melbourne flight.\n\"We've made it clear that we're open to reasonable changes and we look forward to seeing some more detailed proposals,\" a Qantas spokesman said.", "external_links": ["https://www.change.org/p/jetstar-drop-your-deceitful-rip-off-8-50-credit-card-surcharge-for-booking-online"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:03.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
