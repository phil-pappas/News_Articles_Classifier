Based on comScore's closing price on September 28, 2015, Rentrak shareholders would have received compensation valued at approximately $49.62 per share. According to Yahoo! Finance , at least one Wall Street analyst has issued a price target for Rentrak stock at $100.00 per share. \nThe firm’s investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company’s Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company’s shares of common stock. \nIf you currently own common stock of Rentrak and believe that the proposed buyout price is too low, or you would like to learn more about the investigation being conducted by Brower Piven, please visit our website at http://www.browerpiven.com/currentinvestigations.html .
