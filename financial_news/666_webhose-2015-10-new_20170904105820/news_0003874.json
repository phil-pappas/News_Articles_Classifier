PUBLISHED: 13:45, Wed, Oct 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:19, Wed, Oct 14, 2015 GETTY Tesco shopping baskets have been stolen in the wake of the plastic bag tax \nTesco's Oldham store lost a third of its baskets in the week after the controversial 5p charge was been introduced on plastic bags in England at the beginning of October. \nThe Chadderton Tesco has now fitted baskets with tags to stop shoppers using them to take shopping home. \nSome Tesco stores in London and Manchester have also tagged baskets off the back of the plastic bag ban. \nTesco said it is a localised issue and not all baskets are to be tagged. \nAll large retailers must now add 5p for each plastic bag on to shopping bills when a customer forgets to bring enough of their own bags or boxes to carry home shopping. \nBut many people are not happy with the charge that is set to cost households hundreds of pounds over a lifetime and is likely to fail in its environmental aims, according to campaigners.
