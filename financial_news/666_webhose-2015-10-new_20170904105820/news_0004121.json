Photo: Justin McManus\nA Melbourne stockbroker referred to as the \"Grimm Reaper of Collins Street\" has had liquidators appointed to eight companies in which he is a director by the Federal Court.\nBradley Grimm and his partner Vanessa Ash, along with a host of their private companies, are currently subject to a major investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission over their alleged siphoning off of about $2 million of clients' money.\nFollowing an application by ASIC, the Federal Court in Melbourne made orders to appoint Leanne Chesser and Craig Shepard from KordaMentha to the companies.\nThe affected companies include Ostrava​ Equities Pty Ltd, Ostrava Wealth Management Pty Ltd, Ostrava Asset Management Pty Ltd, Ostrava Securities Pty Ltd, Prometheus Capital Pty Ltd, Beta Pharmacology Pty Ltd, Thrive Lending Pty Ltd and Trade BTC Pty Ltd.\nAdvertisement Mr Grimm and Ms Ash, a former lawyer for ASIC, agreed to the orders.\nASIC alleges Mr Grimm and Ms Ash have been involved in multiple contraventions of the corporations legislation including unauthorised withdrawals of client funds and charging of fees by Ostrava Equities Pty Ltd, a company that provides financial services, including establishment of self-managed superannuation funds.\nAs previously revealed by Fairfax Media , ASIC's investigation has already allegedly uncovered evidence that between July and September last year, Ms Ash transferred $2 million to an overseas bank account from her private company Bitcoin Pty Ltd.\nThe court also made orders restraining the companies and Mr Grimm from being involved in a financial services business.\nMs Ash gave an undertaking to the court to the same effect.\nMr Grimm said he welcomed the appointed of provisional liquidators by the court: \"It means the matter will be examined by an independent body and it will save expensive court time.\n\"Our agreement to the appointment of the provisional liquidators in no way infers we accept the previous allegations, which we maintain are baseless and we look forward to continuing to assist the provisional liquidators in this matter.\"\nThe Federal Court is due to hand down a decision tomorrow on whether to award costs to Mr Grimm and Ms Ash over an earlier application by ASIC to freeze their passports that was later overturned.\nMr Grimm was named under parliamentary privilege in 2005 as the \"Grimm Reaper of the Melbourne stockbroking\" world in the Victorian government by MP Luke Donnellan​, who is now the Minister for Ports and for Roads and Road Safety, over concerns about his former business activities.\nMr Grimm was declared bankrupt in 2008 and stepped down as a director of Ostrava until his bankruptcy was discharged in 2011.\nMs Ash was a lawyer at ASIC for eight years from 2000 to 2008, when she left the regulator to help her husband Mr Grimm run Ostrava after his bankruptcy.\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Ms Ash was employed as a solicitor with the Office of Public Prosecutions within both the general prosecutions and major fraud areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:23:02.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
