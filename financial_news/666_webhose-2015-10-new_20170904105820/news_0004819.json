Written by: Gina Ragusa 10/19/15 - 10:46 AM EDT \nA recent report from College Scorecard may not be the best news for the millions of students who are not attending or graduating from an Ivy League school. \nThe report, released last month didn’t unearth shocking information but reaffirmed that going to Harvard or Brown positions graduates for financial advantages. \n“A typical student who attends a four-year institution at the top 10th percentile of the institutional earnings distribution has earnings of about $55,000 per year, while a typical student who attends a four-year institution at the bottom 10th percentile has annual earnings of about $30,000,\" the report authors wrote. \"If this difference remained constant, cumulated over a 30 year working career, a typical student at a top school would earn over $300,000 more than a student at a bottom 10th percentile school, in present value. In fact, this is likely an underestimate since earnings growth tends to be higher for workers with higher earnings.” A prestigious degree isn't everything when it comes to future earning power, according to Mark F. Smith, senior policy analyst of higher education in the education policy and practices department at the National Education Association.

One reason students who graduate from Ivy League institutions earn more than those who graduate from state universities is that Ivy League students tend to come from wealthier families to begin with.” \nThe Ivies typically come with a heavier price tag too. College Tuition Compare.com data found the average cost for 2016 tuition and fees for an Ivy League college is $47,697 and slightly less for the 2014-2015 year at $46,632. \nQuite the contrary to the Ivy League, tuition at the University of Florida, which ranked number 47 on the U.S. News and World Report list, is a measly $6,310 for yearly in-state tuition. Even more affordable, the cost of in-state tuition and fees for Cameron University in Oklahoma is $5,340, and U.S. New and World Report ranks number 69 Bismarck State College in North Dakota as being the most affordable public institution with in-state tuition and fees at $4,222 annually. \nDeveloped in 2013, College Scorecard was launched by the U.S. Department of Education to provide students and families with decision-making information and insight into what the cumulative college process may involve as well as in-depth individualized college discernments. Given the $1.3 trillion in outstanding student loans, there's an an added emphasis on ROI -- with attention paid to how much college costs and what graduates earn coming out of certain institutions.
