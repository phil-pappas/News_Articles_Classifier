Alvopetro will operate all of the blocks acquired and holds a 65% participating interest, with ENGIE holding the 35% remaining participating interest. \nAlvopetro is very pleased to commence this partnership with ENGIE in Brazil. ENGIE is a global energy player and an expert operator in the three businesses; electricity, natural gas and energy services. ENGIE has upstream assets in 14 countries and is the largest independent power producer in the world, with power generation capacity of 115 Gigawatts. In Brazil, ENGIE is the largest private power producer with 8,765 Megawatts in operation and 4,515 Megawatts under construction. Following this Bid Round, Alvopetro holds and operates 16 exploration blocks and two mature fields, comprising 153,330 gross acres (142,625 net acres.) \nIn the third quarter, the pressure transient build-up analysis data for our 182(B1) well crude oil discovery indicates an expected initial oil rate of 123 bopd from the Agua Grande Formation. In addition, our 182(B1) well tested 46 bopd from the Candeias Formation. Subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals, we expect to commence long-term production testing from the well before the end of 2015 by commingling the Candeias and Agua Grande zones. In January 2016, we plan to drill our next conventional oil prospect on Block 170. \nWe continue to be prudent and patient with our capital activity in light of world crude oil prices, and to benefit from reduced service sector activity and equipment prices to improve our long-term capital efficiencies. \nUPDATED CORPORATE PRESENTATION \nOur updated corporate presentation is available at http://www.alvopetro.com/corporate-presentation . \nAlvopetro Energy Ltd.'s vision is to be the premier independent exploration and production company in Brazil, maximizing shareholder value by applying innovation to underexploited opportunities. Our strategy is to focus on three core opportunities including lower risk development drilling on our mature fields, shallow conventional exploration, and the development of the significant hydrocarbon potential present in our deep Gomo resource play. \nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release. \nTest Results . Any references in this news release to test results, production from testing and performance rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however, such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such well will continue production and decline thereafter. Test results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance of the relevant well or fields or of ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons. \nDisclosure of Oil and Gas Information \nBOE Disclosure . The term barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6Mcf/bbl) of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalence is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in this news release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio mix of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. \nContingent Resources. This news release discloses estimates of Alvopetro's contingent resources and the net present value associated with net revenues associated with the production of such contingent resources. There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of such contingent resources and the estimated future net revenues do not necessarily represent the fair market value of such contingent resources. Estimates of contingent resources involve additional risks over estimates of reserves. \nDiscovered Petroleum Initially-in-Place . DPIIP is defined is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations prior to production. The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum initially-in-place includes production, reserves and contingent resources; the remainder is unrecoverable. There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources. \nSupplementary Information of Oil and Natural Gas Resources and Reserves . The disclosure in this news release summarizes certain information contained in the D&M Report and is supplemental to the disclosure required under NI 51-101. The D&M report estimates the DPIIP and the contingent resources associated with Alvopetro's Blocks 197 and 198, and there are no reserves, prospective resources, unrecoverable or recoverable undiscovered petroleum initially-in-place associated, nor any unrecoverable discovered petroleum initially-in-place with these blocks. Full disclosure with respect to the Company's reserves as at December 31, 2014 is contained in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ). \nForward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Language.
