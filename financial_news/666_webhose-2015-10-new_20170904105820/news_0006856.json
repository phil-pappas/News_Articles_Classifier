Estimize is currently expecting EPS of $0.46, 2 pennies higher than Wall Street’s consensus. Revenues are also slightly higher at $1.184 billion vs. the Street’s 1.173 billion. This would easily get Under Armour out of the red on the bottom-line, with 12% EPS growth, after two negative quarters. Revenues are expected to stay in their recent range with 26% growth.\nInvestors have taken this stock up 45% since the beginning of the year, but some worry that it is overvalued. With a forward P/E of 46 it’s certainly priced to perfection, and will have to hit analyst’s predictions for Q3 or else risk a significant drop in price.\nBy comparison, Skechers ( SKX ) trades at 20x and Nike ( NKE ) at 25x. The main focus for Under Armour this quarter will be on footwear, college athletic apparel and women’s apparel. The spike in popularity of basketball shoes makes the footwear segment an obvious target. Currently footwear accounts for less than 20% of UA’s total revenues, vs. competitor Nike for which footwear makes up around 65% of revenues.\nUnder Armour should get some help from the Steph Curry shoe line which is rumored to have sold $100M+ worth of shoes in the last year. The company also recently signing an apparel and footwear deal with the University of Wisconsin worth nearly $100M over a decade, and is pursuing the University of a Texas in a deal that could be worth $15M+ a year. These deals add up quickly and help increase awareness with fans. The company is also going to try to more effectively penetrate the women’s market, currently dominated by brands such as Lululemon ( LULU ).\nGet the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App \nSkechers also reports on Thursday, but after the bell and is expecting profit growth of 320% YoY! Revenues are also expected to come in strong at $876M vs. the Street’s consensus for $868.4M, growth of 30%. It’s no secret that Skechers is loved by investors who have more than doubled its value in the last year despite an uncertain and volatile market environment. Fundamentals have been strong throughout the year, with the company surpassing the Estimize consensus on the top and bottom-line in Q1 and Q2, and by a sizeable amount. In fact, the Q2 EPS actual beat the higher Estimize consensus by 52%, a 128% YoY growth rate.\nThe third quarter is expected to be no different, with a boost coming from a strong back-to-school shopping season. Not only has the company been doing well domestically, but also internationally despite currency headwinds. The athleisure trend has been a large boon for Skechers which is now taking on the bigger athletic brands such as Nike and Under Armour, offering stylish options at more compelling prices. They are slowly starting to steal market share from those names as the U.S. consumer begins to pull back on how much of their discretionary income they are willing to allocate to apparel and accessories.\nMore on Yahoo Finance \nPrime day to boost Amazon's results; eBay posts first quarter since Paypal spinoff \nThese states are the most financially ready for retirement \nMillennials turned off by the new chip credit cards \nConsumer Discretionary Finance Skechers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:08:15.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
