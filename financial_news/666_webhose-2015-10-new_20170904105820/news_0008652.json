Launched on May 9, it has a term insurance scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojama (PMJJBY), and an accident insurance one, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY).\nThe scheme website shows public sector banks sold the largest number. State Bank of India had the highest share with 21 mn, followed by Punjab National Bank with 8.5 mn. Other PSBs with more than 5.5 mn enrolments are Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Bank of India and Central Bank of India.\nThis scheme involves one life, one non-life and one pension scheme. The government had said it would build on these to get a universal social security scheme.\nKshitij Jain, managing director, Exide Life Insurance, says a big plus from these schemes is their help in spreading awareness of insurance and its benefits in rural areas. On the other hand, insurers say fraudulent claims have already been detected. The data shows almost all companies taking part in the scheme have found these.\nPMSBY is an accident insurance scheme of a Rs 2 lakh sum assured, with a premium of only Rs 12 a year. PMJJBY is a life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh, with an annual premium of Rs 330. These are for the 18-50 years age group.\n\nAdded to this is the Atal Pension Yojana, for the unorganised sector. Here, the government would give half the subscriber's contribution or Rs 1,000, whichever is lower, for 5 years if an enrolment is before this December. It is for the 18-40 age group and guarantees a minimum monthly pension of Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000.\n\nSince banks are an integral part of the scheme, where both the policy and claim would be dealt through them, insurers say enrolments have been faster. \"Tying up with banks which already have a presence in rural areas is an advantage, since our costs of distribution come down. This was essential, since the cost of the policy is very low,\" said a senior in a government-owned insurer.\nThe country's insurance penetration is 3.9% of gross domestic product and these schemes are expected to give a needed push to this. According to a Swiss Re study, life insurance penetration was 3.1% and non-life insurance was 0.8%, as of end-March 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:49:42.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
