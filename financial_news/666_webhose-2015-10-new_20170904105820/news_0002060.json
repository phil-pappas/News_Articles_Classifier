But HMRC has decided to “grandfather” its original approach, ensuring that the tax-efficient financing used to buy property before that date will not need to be unwound. \nHMRC said it had made its decision “after careful consideration”, once it emerged that some property owners who had relied on HMRC’s original guidance faced difficulties in unwinding their financing. \nIn its original announcement in August 2014, HMRC said it was withdrawing the concession relating to the tax treatment of offshore collateral because it was seeing “large numbers of arrangements” not considered to be within its intended scope. \nThe decision sparked anger from many non-doms and their advisers who said the disruption and costs being faced by clients who had followed explicit HMRC guidance was eroding the UK’s appeal to wealthy individuals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:29:16.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
