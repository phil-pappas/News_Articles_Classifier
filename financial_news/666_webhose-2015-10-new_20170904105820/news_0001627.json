However, properties catering to the lower middle income segment have not seen much investment,' it stated \n'The country already has a housing deficit of over 1.7 million units, with the gap widening each year. The lack of real estate data is partly responsible for this situation.' \nThe real estate market report is therefore, a welcoming relief for players in the real estate industry. \nIt aims to help real estate developers in their pricing while educating the public on what costs to expect in various locations. \nAkua Nyame-Mensah, the Managing Director, Lamudi Ghana, outlined the importance of the report to the public. \n'Building, selling or buying real estate will likely be one of the biggest decisions Ghanaians ever make. Lamudi's publications equip property-seekers with the information they need to make better investment decisions and, ultimately, to find their ideal home,' she said. \nThe second edition of Property Now magazine includes other educational and entertaining content - expert interviews, development highlights and market trends - is available for free online. \nLaunched in 2013, Lamudi is a global property portal focusing exclusively on emerging markets. \nThe fast-growing platform is currently available in 34 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, with more than 800,000 real estate listings across its global network. \nThe leading real estate marketplace offers sellers, buyers, landlords and renters a secure and easy-to-use platform to find or list properties online. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:06:51.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
