(10/20/15)--Millennials are making wiping out debt a top priority. That's according to a USA Today /Bank of America Money Habit survey ( USAToday Oct. 13). \nAmong those surveyed, two-thirds of millennials said they have made getting out debt a top priority. This ranks just above having minimal financial stress, spending less than they earn and having an emergency savings fund. \nThe study showed a significant difference in responses from college-educated millennials versus those without a degree. Almost 60% of respondents with degrees said they were somewhat satisfied with their current financial situation, while only 40% of non-college grads felt confident about their status. \nOther findings: On average, 64% of those polled have savings--57% without a college degree and 85% with a degree. Even college grads strapped with student loan debt have more confidence than those who didn't go to college or didn't graduate; Across the board, 51% are concerned that they won't have enough money to achieve financial wellness; Among millennials with savings, 43% have less than $5,000 put away; and One-third of those with savings have a 401(k): About half of millennials ages 26-34 participate in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, while only 14% of millennials younger than 26 participate in a plan. \nEven though most young adults said that at times they worry about their financial situation, most generally are satisfied with their situation. They are wary about taking on more debt and are hesitant to purchase items they can't afford. \nFor related information, read \"Why Millennials Are Buying Very Small Houses\" in the Home & Family Finance Resource Center . \nHome & Family Finance® Resource Center Copyright © 1997-2015 Credit Union National Association Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:02:06.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
