This was partly offset by a 4 percent rise in gas production to 14.5 mmboe, due mostly to its prized stake in the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. \n\"We said that we would produce more for less and this quarter's figures are a strong reflection of that. Year to date production is up 10 percent while capex is down 55 percent and unit production costs are down 15 percent,\" Santos CEO David Knox said in a statement. \nSantos has just started exporting from its $18.5 billion Gladstone LNG project, the biggest project it has ever built and operated, boosting its credentials as a gas supplier to Asia. \n($1 = 1.3864 Australian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:09:54.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
