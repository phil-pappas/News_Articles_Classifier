Photo: Getty Images\nChina's economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, as resilient growth in the emerging services sector helped compensate for a deepening industrial rout.\nChina's official statistics agency said Monday that gross domestic product rose 6.9 per cent year on year for the September quarter; while beating economist forecasts of 6.8 per cent, it is still the slowest pace of growth since the financial crisis.\nChina had faced \"increasing downward pressure of domestic economic development\" in the first nine months of the year, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement accompanying the data release, but added that \"the overall performance of national economy was stable and moving in a positive direction\".\nThe better-than-expected economic data indicates that the central government's aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus policies have supported growth to within touching distance of Premier Li Keqiang's target of \"about 7 per cent\" this year. The statistics bureau suggested last month that growth as low as 6.5 per cent would be within the target range.\nAdvertisement Economists expect further easing before the end of the year to help offset an entrenched weakness in industrials and manufacturing. The government has cut interest rates five times since November, relaxed lending restrictions and brought forward infrastructure spending as it manages a broad industrial slowdown and attempts to engineer a transition to an economy more reliant on domestic consumption than fixed asset investment and exports.\nRetail sales growth ticked up modestly to 10.9 per cent in September, up from 10.8 per cent the previous month, seen as crucial proof that the wild swings in the Chinese sharemarket hadn't adversely affected wider consumer confidence.\n\"This remains the key positive in China's economy,\" Moody's Analytics said in a note. \"The volatile stock market may reduce spending among the richer middle class, but the recovering housing market should make up some of the difference.\"\nManufacturing and property construction remained weak, with the slide in producer prices extending to a record 43 months.\nIndustrial output decelerated to 5.7 per cent, the slowest since March, from 6.1 per cent in August. Economists had anticipated a slowdown to only 6 per cent. Fixed asset investment growth came in at 10.3 per cent, sharply lower than the 16.1 per cent for the same period last year.\nFinancial services had provided a temporary boost to growth earlier in the year as the industry raked in windfalls from the stockmarket boom.\nThis led to expectations that growth would correct sharply after the market crashed, but services growth only fell modestly compared to the second quarter.\nThere were also continued signs of modest recovery in China's real estate sector. Property sales grew 7.5 per cent in the year to September, having previously contracted for 17 straight months in the year to June.\nUBS has said it will take almost two years for the market to work through a supply glut of new apartments in China's smaller provincial cities.\nAustralian markets reacted positively, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index gaining around 10 points immediately after the data release. The Australian dollar rose, spiking as high as US72.91¢ off the day's low of US72.39¢.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:27:13.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
