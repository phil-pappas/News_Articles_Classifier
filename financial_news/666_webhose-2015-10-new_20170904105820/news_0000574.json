Daniel Acker Share on twitter by Karen Maley US investors may be happy that the chances of a US rate hike this year are diminishing by the day, but their cheer is not shared by the bosses of the country's big banks.\nIndeed, the third-quarterly profits just released by major US banks show just how tough market conditions have become now that all the world's major central banks have pinned interest rates close to zero.\nOvernight Goldman Sachs reported that its net income for the quarter was $US1.43 billion , a slide of 36 per cent from a year earlier. The investment bank's net revenue was $US6.86 billion, falling below the $US7 billion level for the first time in two years.\nThe difficulty of making money in extremely uncertain market conditions was reflected in the one-third drop in the investment bank's revenue from its huge fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading division.\nGrowing worries about the health of the global economy also made life tougher for the investment bank. \"We experienced lower levels of activity and declining asset prices during the quarter, reflecting renewed concerns about global economic growth\", Goldman boss Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement.\nIn contrast Goldman, which is Wall Street's leading adviser on mergers and acquisitions, enjoyed a 36 per cent jump in revenue from traditional investment banking activities as US corporate activity has hotted up.\nSo far, Blankfein has resisted embarking on large-scale cuts, arguing that activity from trading clients will bounce back. All the same, Goldman's drop in FICC trading revenues was worse than that of JP Morgan Chase (down 23 per cent) and Bank of America (down 11 per cent).\nInvestors had been bracing for disappointing profits from the banks as their net interest rate margins have been squeezed by a prolonged period of near-zero interest rates and the sector has the faced growing regulatory pressures. But the results reported by the big banks have proved worse than expected.\n Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, missed market estimates when it reported net income of $US6.8 billion in the third quarter, and unnerved analysts with a 7 per cent dip in revenue.\nTo offset this slide in revenues JP Morgan Chase promised to step up its efforts to cut expenses, promising to deliver a further $500 million in savings, on top of its scheduled $1 billion cost-cutting program for 2015.\nBut investors have been dismayed by signs of increasing pressure on revenues of other major US banks. Bank of America saw its net revenues drop about 2 per cent. Wells Fargo, which is the world's biggest bank in terms of market capitalisation, reported a 3 per cent lift in revenues, but this was lifted by the bank's acquisition of $9 billion of real estate loans from GE capital.\nThe squeeze on bank revenues is partly the result of almost seven years of near-zero US interest rates, which means that banks are writing new loans at much lower rates than their older loans, which are now rolling off.\nAnother factor is the fragile US economic recovery, which has translated into sluggish demand for home loans and credit cards in the banks' retail operations.\nTougher regulation has also played a role, reducing margins in formerly highly profitable activities such as trading and underwriting.\nThe squeeze on revenues leaves banks with a difficult choice â€“ either they have to prepare their investors to expect lower returns, or intensify their efforts to slash costs and exit unprofitable business activities. But this will result in even more job losses in the banking sector, which will do little to bolster US consumer confidence.\nBank of America has already closed a net 206 branches over the past year, while JPMorgan Chase has reduced the headcount in its consumer division by about 10,000 so far this year.\nAs they go about pruning their workforces, US bank bosses will be keeping a close eye out for signs that the US central bank might finally provide some relief by lifting US interest rates.\nBut it could be a long wait. The chances of a US interest rate rise this year are rapidly decreasing amid growing evidence that the US economic recovery is faltering.\nThat's something that US bank bosses have been aware of for quite some time.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:10:28.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
