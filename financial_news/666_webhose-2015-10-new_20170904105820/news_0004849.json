Our uncertainty is just about the extent and about the patterns over the course of the season,\" he told reporters. \nWalden described last year's Black Friday as \"almost an unnatural collection of orders and obligations to fulfil on a single day or a single weekend.\" \nHe said if that was repeated there was a potential for disruption, though the firm had learnt lessons from last year and had improved its capacity to meet orders. \nWalden is transforming Argos, which contributes about 70 percent of group revenue, from a catalogue-based retailer into a digital-oriented business, targeting higher sales from mobiles and tablet PCs and making collections faster and easier. \nHome Retail reported underlying pretax profit up 10 percent to 34.1 million pounds in its seasonally less important first half, helped by a stronger performance from Homebase. Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) sales fell 2 percent to 2.6 billion pounds. \n($1 = 0.6482 pounds) (Editing by Jason Neely and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:17:00.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
