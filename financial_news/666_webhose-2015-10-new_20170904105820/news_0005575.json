Louise Kennerley Australia also developed strata title law first, in the 1960s. New South Wales was the leader on this occasion.\nStrata title legislation underpins the sub-division of most apartment blocks in Australia, allowing individuals to own the portion of the block they reside in whilst having a shared ownership of and responsibility for common areas such as external structures, stairways, hallways and the land the building resides on.\nThese two legislative developments – around a hundred years apart – epitomises the Australian egalitarian spirit of 'a fair go.' By simplifying title rules, they made it easier for Australians to own, trade and subdivide property, which enabled more of us to become landowners.\nIn a testament to the confidence in which the modern titles system is held, banks routinely lend individuals 90 per cent, 95 per cent and sometimes 100 per cent of a property's value, effectively based on an ownership entry on a database in the state or territory's land registry IT system.\n But the 1960s isn't actually that long ago and blocks of apartments began to appear on the landscape from the 1920s and 1930s. So you won't be surprised that there are some older apartment blocks with title documents that pre-date the strata title system.\nWhen owners of early apartment blocks considered how they could sub-divide and sell individual units, they turned to corporate law for a solution.\nA company was established which became the registered owner of the property. Unit owners were then sold shares in the 'company' which gave them exclusive access to their dwelling and shared use of common areas.\n'Company Share' apartments are typically older architectural style and they tend to be found in the older suburbs in our older cities – Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne and Adelaide.\nThere are other forms of apartment titles as well.\nFor instance, In Victoria, in the early 1960s Stratum Title was a forerunner to the strata title regime. It still involved a company share arrangement for common property, but owners also received a title to their unit.\nAnd in South Australia, a Moiety or Cross Lease system gave each unit holder a share in the land the apartment block sat on plus a lease to exclusive use of their property.\nBeware that these older forms of titles are not just a historical footnote. Banks tend to have tighter lending restrictions – lending as little as 50 per cent of the loan-to-value ratio currently – on non-strata titled apartments, and too often, won't lend at all.\nIn the case of company share, banks are concerned that the collateral for their loan isn't the title of a property but a share in a company.\nIn the case of stratum title in Victoria, although the banks do have a title they can claim on, the stratum title legislation gives the stratum scheme's service company (akin to the body corporate) first claim on a defaulting borrower's mortgage to pay outstanding service company fees.\nNaturally, banks aren't comfortable about potentially being second in line if there is a default.\nConsequently, non-strata title apartments can trade at a discount to comparable strata title properties. So make sure you always engage a good lawyer when buying apartments to check the title documents.\nRichard Wakelin is a director of Wakelin Property Advisory , an independent firm specialising in acquiring residential property for investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:48:25.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
