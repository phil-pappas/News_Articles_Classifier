Louise Kennerley by Vesna Poljak Tim Binsted Australian boards pay their executives too much and have failed to align pay with performance, investors and governance firms say.\nAs the annual meeting season gets under way in earnest, remuneration will come under intense scrutiny , particularly at cyclical companies where executives were enriched during boom times but have not shared in the bust.\n\"I do think that inherently humans are driven by selfish motivations and far and away the biggest thing you need to fix is remuneration structures,\" Allan Gray portfolio manager Simon Mawhinney said.\n\"It is time for some real wholesale changes. Remuneration structures are not long-term enough and they are asymmetric. The management team does very well if the company does well, but they don't do badly if the company does badly.\"\nLast week investors sent a warning to boardrooms by voting down glove and condom maker Ansell's remuneration report .\nUnder the two-strikes rule, which was introduced in 2011, investors can trigger a board spill if 25 per cent or more of a company's shares are voted against consecutive remuneration reports.\nDaniel Smith, director of research at governance firm CGI Glass Lewis, said the Ansell vote was \"a real bellwether of investor sentiment\".\n\"They [Ansell] actually had a grant of options to the CEO [Magnus Nicolin] voted down which we rarely see in the market,\" he said.\n Mr Smith said that the Ansell board tried \"to move the goal posts halfway through the performance period\" to ensure the CEO hit his bonus target.\n\"They cancelled a grant of performance rights that was due to vest at the end of FY16 and changed that with an increase in the STI [short term incentive] basically because it looked like the STI awards might be paid out,\" he said.\nBeaumont weighs in Bennelong Australian Equity Partners portfolio manager Julian Beaumont also hit out at the tendency to shell out hefty bonuses regardless of performance.\n\"Shareholders are struggling with large performance-related payments, particularly where it hasn't been accompanied by good performance, and this will attract a lot of attention. We agree in paying high performing management teams well, but there are very few of them,\" he said.\nMr Beaumont said that executives should be rewarded for their actual contribution, not simply for being in charge during an economic upturn or during a bull market.\n\"In years gone by, management teams have benefited from a strong economy helping out corporate performance, or more recently from a market re-rating that has helped their company's shares,\" he said.\n\"Now managers will need to prove their worth. There should be an appropriate division in pay between those managers that add value and those that do not.\"\nOwnership Matters governance analyst Martin Lawrence said investors do not want to see executives being given an \"option over the upside in an economic cycle\".\n\"Shareholders are not against managers getting paid for doing a good job. What they do have an objection to is getting paid for riding a cycle,\" he said.\nMr Lawrence said that Qantas is a good example of how to handle pay through the business cycle, with CEO Alan Joyce seeing his pay cut in bad times and subsequently increasing in good times .\nCGI Glass Lewis' Mr Smith said that most of the resources companies will be watched very closely now that earnings and share prices have collapsed with the end of the mining boom.\nHe said that iron ore miner Fortescue Metals has paid big bonuses despite huge share price falls.\n\"The executives have done well taking costs out of the business, but they've been paid massive bonus payments when the share price has fallen massively. There is an incongruence,\" Mr Smith said.\nExcess executive pay Fund managers also attacked the excessive overall level of executive pay in Australia.\nMr Beaumont said that \"many management teams are paid too much\".\n\"We will take aim at those companies in our portfolio where the remuneration is out of sync with performance,\" he said.\nAllan Gray's Mr Mawhinney said some managers are paid \"crazy\" amounts.\nHe said companies all benchmark against one another and aim to pay in the 75th percentile, inflating pay across the board.\n\"That is a classic example of huddling.\"\nMr Mawhinney also criticised the fact that managers of bigger companies are paid more and therefore they are incentivised to grow the business, often through acquisitions, without regard for shareholder value.\nMacquarie quantitative strategist Luciano Sturiale, in new research to clients, foreshadowed that executive remuneration will be topical this year.\n\"The current weak operating environment coupled with a weak share price backdrop will expose underperforming executives and more so overpaid, underperforming executives,\" he said.\n\"In this environment, we expect strikes and protest votes will increase this AGM season as the industry continues to elevate its focus on governance issues.\"\nAccording to Macquarie, companies on watch for a second strike include Reckon, Buru Energy, Sino Gas, McMillan Shakespeare, UGL Limited, Fantastic Holdings, FlexiGroup, Seven Group Holdings, Salmat, Harvey Norman, Cabcharge Australia and Primary Health Care.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/ansell-earnings-hurt-by-strong-us-dollar-20151007-gk3xo3.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:19:50.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
