Higher interest rates will probably only help push prices lower. \nAEI's Oliner said that the September economic projections of 17 FOMC participants showed the majority see inflation more likely to fall than rise, \"a significant change from the balance of risk in June.\" \nThe second key gauge, the jobs market, appeared a bit weaker, too, when data for September came in at the beginning of this month. \nIn addition, a number of recent reports, including the Fed's Beige Book survey this week, have underscored that the strong dollar is taking a significant toll on US exports, especially in manufacturing. \nAdded to that is a mostly negative flow of data from China and signs of more feeble growth all around. \nFischer said part of the reason the Fed did not act in September was to have more time to assess the global trend. \n\"That is natural given the increasing influence of foreign economic developments on the United States economy,\" he noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:55:28.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
