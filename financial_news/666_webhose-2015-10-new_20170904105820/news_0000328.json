It filed its appeal in September and expects to have an answer next month. If the appeal fails, Lowe said it will seek further relief from the Canadian government.\nThe tariff exists \"to protect Canadian industry, but there are no ship builders in Canada that build this kind of thing,\" said Lowe. \"So it's a barrier for no useful purpose.\" ($1 = 1.2923 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Julie Gordon; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:38:47.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
