It forecast inflation of 0.7 percent three months ago. \nBut the bank, which is trying to bring an end to decades of deflationary pressure, will only cut by 0.1-0.2 point its forecast that price rises will accelerate to 1.9 percent next fiscal year, keeping it near its target, they said. \nThe sources said the forecasts had not been finalised and changes could be made ahead of the announcement. The projections are compiled by the central bank's nine policy board members. \nThe BOJ is preparing to slash this fiscal year's forecast for economic growth to around 1 percent from 1.7 percent, the sources said. But it probably will not substantially alter its forecast for 1.5 percent growth next year, they added. \nThe BOJ releases a semi-annual report with long-term economic and price forecasts in April and October that serve as a basis of monetary policy decisions. It reviews these forecasts in January and July. \n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Will Waterman) Read the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2015.
