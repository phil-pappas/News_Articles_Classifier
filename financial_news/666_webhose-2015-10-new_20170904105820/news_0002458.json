Get everyone's finances out in the open. You can't plan without the proper information. Ask your parents to share their financial situations with you, get a clear picture of your own finances, and share it with your kids. It will make it easier for your kids when it's their turn, and help them understand why you can't buy certain things so easily; Be clear about whose money it is. When you spend your parents' money, keep in mind that it's their money, not yours. Conversely, when you help your kids pay for certain things, be sure they pay their fair share and help out with personal expenses--even if you can afford it without their help. Don't let them grow up to be dependent on you; Get professional help. Ask a certified financial adviser for help with the big issues, from college planning to retirement. Seek legal advice from an estate attorney about preparing documents (for yourself and for your parents) such as a will, a living will, and a power of attorney. Let the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging help you connect with your local Area Agency on Aging to help you find nonprofit programs. Research organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association if needed. Ask the Aging Life Care Association to help you find a geriatric care manager; Find good care and companionship. Most likely your elderly parent not only needs care, but is lonely and alone. Ask friends, family members, and neighbors for help. You can also ask for help from the agencies mentioned above; and Make time for yourself. Guilt comes with the territory of living in the sandwich generation. No matter how much you do, it never feels like enough. Make time to do the things you enjoy, whether it's reading a romance novel, working out, lunch with friends, or your favorite sport. Recharge your physical and mental batteries so that you can continue to be strong for the people who need you. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:42:54.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
