Reuters by Joyce Moullakis Deutsche Bank's Australian employees are on tenterhooks awaiting further information on the company's strategy and potential job cuts this month, after one of its biggest-ever restructures .\nDeutsche's co-chief executive John Cryan on Sunday night announced a split of its corporate banking and securities unit, a management shake-up, and the abolition of its group executive committee and 10 of 16 management board committees .\nAll eyes are now on October 29, when Mr Cryan will provide further details on his plans and future strategy.\nA spokeswoman for Deutsche Australia said the global changes would not have a large impact on the local franchise, bar the split of the corporate finance and markets units. \"Businesses will still run the same,\" she said, declining to comment further.\nOne local employee, who declined to be named, welcomed the changes, saying Mr Cryan was making a \"clean sweep\". Employees have not been briefed in detail on potential job cuts or other implications.\nJames McMurdo is Deutsche's Australia and Zealand chief, James Roth and Bruce MacDiarmid jointly run investment banking, Mike Roche is mergers chairman and Michael Richardson heads equity capital markets.\nSplit into two divisions The global changes see the corporate banking and securities unit split into two divisions. The sales and trading activities will form a new division called global markets while another unit will be known as corporate and investment banking.Deutsche said the new framework would \"fundamentally change\" its leadership structure. Mr Cryan wants a \"better controlled, lower cost\" bank.\n It is unclear what the restructure means for one of Deutsche's most senior Australian executives, Michael Ormaechea, who among other roles is co-head of corporate banking and securities for Asia Pacific. In August, he was also elevated to chair an executive committee for Deutsche's fixed income and currencies business globally, adding to his role of leading the Asia Pacific FIC division.\nMr Cryan's overhaul follows investor outrage and litigation against global banks for compliance failures.\nAs part of the changes, Colin Fan, the co-head of corporate banking and securities unit, will leave Deutsche. His co-head Jeff Urwin – who this year replaced Rob Rankin who left to take a role at Crown Resorts – will head the corporate and investment banking division, while Garth Ritchie will lead global markets.\nQuintin Price, formerly of BlackRock, will run Deutsche Asset Management, which is being split from private wealth. Michele Faissola, the current head of asset management and wealth, will depart.\nThere is talk of downsizing at Deutsche. Bloomberg has reported 8000 jobs may be cut, in addition to those eliminated through the sale of one of its consumer bank units. Other firms are also re-evaluating their investment banking presence.\nCredit Suisse will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, in an announcement that may include job cuts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:07:41.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
