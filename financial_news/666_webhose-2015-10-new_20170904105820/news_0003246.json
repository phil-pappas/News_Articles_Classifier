Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan One-fifth of 1 percentage point might not sound like much. However, Westpac's surprise announcement this week that it would slug mortgage borrowers an additional 20 basis points represents so much more than an extra $40 or $50 a month on the average housing loan.\nComing in a week when a critical mass of investment banks and equity analysts had warned that a cooling property market imperiled Australia's vital re-balancing away from mining-related investment, Westpac's move is a sign that the fundamentals are shifting for house prices.\n\"Home buying conditions have deteriorated sharply,\" equity analysts Damien Boey and Hasan Tevfik wrote in note to clients.\n\"Housing is no longer the safe-haven asset relative to equities,\" they said.\nNot all agree that prices will drop; most simply expect the turbo-charged double-digit annual price growth seen in Sydney and Melbourne over the past few years to ease.\n\"Nationwide price falls are unlikely until the RBA starts to raise interest rates and this is unlikely before 2017,\" said AMP Capital's head of investment strategy and chief economist, Shane Oliver.\n\"And, then, in the absence of a recession or rapid interest rate hikes, price falls are more likely to be 5 per cent to 10 per cent, as was seen in the 2009 and 2011 down cycles, than anything worse.\n\"In fact, the cooling in investor demand in Sydney and Melbourne are likely to provide greater flexibility for the RBA to cut interest rates again.\"\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has long been concerned that its reduction this year of the cash rate to a record-low 2 per cent would overstimulate already-overheated residential property markets in Sydney and Melbourne. Working with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, it addressed its main concern - the rising proportion of loans to buy-to-let and buy-to-sell investors - by capping growth rates in this market segment and making it more expensive to borrow for this type of venture.\n Added to tougher rules on how much capital banks have to hold on their balance sheets against their home lending portfolios, the RBA-APRA-ASIC offensive was designed to both fortify lenders against a systemic meltdown if mortgage arrears started to climb, and take some of the heat out of the the riskier end of the housing market.\nRecent credit data and home auction rates suggest this is working. New investors are paying between 1 and 1.2 percentage points more for their home loans than before the different macro-prudential measures were announced, according to calculations by Morgan Stanley. A fall-off in demand from cashed-up foreign buyers, mainly because of the slowdown in China, is also cooling the investor segment, according to Credit Suisse's Damien Boey.\nCompliance or commercial decision?\nWestpac's decision to make loans to own-occupiers more expensive as well, while dressed up as regulatory compliance, is designed to protect its profit margins against the inevitable slowdown in mortgage demand. Most commentators agree that some, if not all, of the other big three lenders will follow suit.\nMoreover, this regulatory crackdown and mortgage repricing is working at a time when potential owner-occupiers - the good guys in this movie - are also holding back because house prices in Australia's two biggest cities have risen out of reach and they feel these are about to plateau or come down. This, in turn, could eventually lead to oversupply, which would put further downward pressure on prices.\nHouseholds are also being squeezed by falling real incomes and rattled by an unemployment rate that has not been below 6 per cent since May last year. Australian households are also among the most indebted in the world, with total average liabilities worth 160 per cent of annual disposable income.\nHouse prices, at an average 6.4 times household income, are also among the highest in the world, and compare with 3.6 times in the US and 4.7 times in the United Kingdom.\nAnnual growth in Sydney dwelling prices was last measured by market monitors CoreLogic at 16.7 per cent, which was down from a peak of 18.4 per cent in July. Growth in Melbourne prices is running at 14.2 per cent, the fastest pace in five years. The median house price in Sydney is currently $930,000, according to CoreLogic, and the median unit price, $673,750. In Melbourne, they'll set you back $600,000 and $482,000, respectively.\nAnd then there's the demographics: nearly all the commentators warning of a quicker-than-expected housing downturn stress Australia's slowing rate of population growth, the product of both lower net immigration and ageing, as a factor.\nThe Australia Bureau of Statistics last month made much of the fact the country's rate of population growth is at the slowest for almost 10 years.\nThe cost of all this, according to Australian investment house Macquarie, is a 7.5 per cent correction in house prices after March next year.\nThe end of the housing boom comes at a difficult time for the wider economy. Though more a levelling-out than a bust, the so-called \"wealth effect\" impact of this is more important than the cold metrics.\nOwners will feel less wealthy\nIf you're a recent buyer who has leveraged to the gunwales to purchase a property that is already losing value, you'll be skimping on discretionary items such as holidays, dining out, extra furniture or renovations until further notice.\nRBA governor Glenn Stevens has himself referred to the wealth effect of rising house prices on several occasions during the current easing cycle, and may soon voice his concerns about the impact on consumer sentiment and behaviour of falling property values.\nWith rental yields lower than all assets except, perhaps, term deposits and government bonds, buy-to-let investors are currently relying on capital appreciation for their returns. Once this disappears, so does their interest in property.\nOne of the biggest take-outs from Westpac's mortgage rate decision, assuming the other three big lenders follow suit, is that the RBA is now freer to loosen monetary conditions if it sees fit.\n\"A key thing to stress here is that what the RBA thinks about is end borrowing and savings rates in the real economy,\" said Nomura's rates strategist for Australia, Andrew Ticehurst.\n\"It adjusts its cash rate to try to achieve desired borrowing and savings rates in the real world.\n\"Nomura's house view is for a 25 basis point RBA rate cut in February and not this year.\n\"But, particularly if the other three big lenders follow Westpac's lead, this would of course increase the possibility that the RBA could respond this year,\" he said.\nWhat could actually force the RBA's hand is open to debate. Some economic pundits warn of the impact of any further cooling in China's economic growth, while others suggest the stubbornly high unemployment rate is the one to watch. Continued vacillation by the US Federal Reserve on when it may start lifting interest rates is also a consideration.\nRBA rate cuts won't reignite housing\nBoey of Credit Suisse says that even if the RBA responds to Westpac's rate rise by cutting official rates, the housing boom is unlikely to restart. \"It will be much harder to generate a bounce in property interest this time from a few RBA rate cuts.\"\nGoldman Sachs' bearish, but most times prophetic, economist for Australia, Tim Toohey, this week warned of another shadow about to darken Australia's economic door: severe drought.\nThe forecast is based on expectations of a particularly intense El Nino cycle and a positive phase in the so-called Indian Ocean Dipole. Combined, these add up to much lower than average rainfall, which could, according to Toohey, shave between 50 and 100 basis points off gross domestic product growth next calendar year.\n\"The combination of pre-emptive independent interest rate hikes by the banking system and the emergence of a new and significant threat to Australia's economic growth comes at a particularly uncomfortable time in Australia's economic cycle,\" Toohey wrote following the Westpac decision.\n\"Economic growth remains well below the RBA's downwardly revised measure of 'potential' and pressures are well contained.\n\"Moreover, declining commodity prices, weak income growth, sharp declines in investment expectations and a peaking in the contributions to economic growth from housing have long suggested that the risks to economic growth were skewed to the downside.\n\"The unexpected and large interest rate hike by the banking system could also be expected to result in a significant decline in consumer confidence heading into the crucial trading period for the retail sector,\" he said.\nThe RBA, which had wanted to clip the pace of property price growth in Sydney and Melbourne, might have been more careful of what it wished for.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-10-16T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:05:34.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
