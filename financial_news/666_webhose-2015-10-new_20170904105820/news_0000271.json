The Rio de Janeiro-based miner will join rival Rio Tinto Group in boosting production at a time prices for the mineral used in steel head toward a third year of declines. Vale will post an all-time high of 87.9 million metric tons for the third quarter, the survey shows.\nVale, Rio and BHP Billiton, the three dominant players in the iron-ore industry, have been boosting capacity, displacing less efficient producers and raising oversupply concerns as demand from China, the top consumer, slows. Benchmark iron ore prices have been trading below $US60 a ton for all the second half of 2015, down more than 70 per cent from a 2011 peak.\nVale will post an all-time high of 87.9 million metric tons for the third quarter, a Bloomberg survey shows. Photo: Bloomberg\nVale is adding production from three new projects in Brazil's southeastern state of Minas Gerais as it finishes the expansion of Carajas, the world's largest iron-ore complex, next year.\nAdvertisement A powerhouse third quarter has seen Rio Tinto prove it can quickly stretch the capacity of its Pilbara iron ore system beyond its capacity of 360 million tonnes, as it sold some of its stockpiled ore to release cash.\nRio's shipments from the Pilbara rose 16 per cent to 85.6 million tonnes for the September quarter on the year prior, and was slightly ahead of analyst expectations. That included 4.2 million tonnes, or about $US250 million, of its stockpile and is expected to sell another 3 million to 4 million tonnes before the end of the year. The sales were higher than analysts expected; six months ago Rio's stockpile was about 13 million tonnes.\nVale, also the world's largest producer of nickel, probably will say production of the base metal advanced 4.9 per cent in the quarter to 75,600 tons, the survey shows. Output for copper, the industrial metal used in wiring and plumbing, is expected to have gained 4.9 per cent to a quarterly record of 109,900 tons, according to the poll.\nThe company is set to release its third-quarter financial results on October 22.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/rio-tinto-cuts-into-ore-stockpiles-as-it-races-to-hit-target-20151015-gkahw6", "http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/Pages/default.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:12:10.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
