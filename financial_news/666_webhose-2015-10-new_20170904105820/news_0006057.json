The regulations would enforce, among other things, tower setbacks, density, a builder's contribution to open space, and his own decision-making discretion.\nCreative Wealth's proposal is to replace blue-ribbon airspace over an existing three-level building, with a tower to rise a total of about 90 metres from the ground.\nCaydon's 14-level apartment at 443 Upper Heidelberg Road. Photo: Supplied\nThe 1873 Cobden Buildings, a structure known by the address of 1-5 Queen Street, will be restored externally to its 1955 state and partly act as a podium for the new tower, which would offer unobstructed views over the Banana Alley Vaults and Yarra River, Albert Park Lake and Port Phillip Bay.\nAdvertisement The property was occupied from the mid-1950s until recently by clothing manufacturer Fletcher Jones.\nA shadow test which accompanied Creative Wealth's 26-level proposal last year showed the complex would shade part of the river precinct for three hours from 11am.\nPeter Singer was part of a consortium to pocket $2.7 million from the sale of a complex in Rowena Parade, Richmond. Photo: Michael Nagle\nAs well as a reduction in height, Creative Wealth's revised tower is set back from the historic building more than it was in the 2014 application.\nAcross the Yarra River, in Southbank, riverside sites arguably more connected to waterfront public spaces have made way for skyscrapers twice the height of Creative Wealth's proposal.\nCreative paid $11 million for the 737-square metre site in 2012.\nAnother Major Brunswick Site Sale?\nMelbourne businessman Tony Beris is speculated to have sold his outgoing and long-time company headquarters, ending an era in inner-north Brunswick.\nMr Beris, who moved to Melbourne in 1956 as an imitation jewellery salesman then went on to establish successful importing business Delta Sales, listed the 3667-square metre asset at 17-23 Hodgson Street earlier this year via agency TCI Teneketzis.\nDespite its super size, the property is in a low-rise pocket of Brunswick and is unlikely to make way for a medium or high-rise development, according to sources. It was expected to exchange for a little over $10 million but this could not be confirmed with selling agent Jack Teneketzis​.\nA deal would be the latest in a string for the suburb – just last week, a 2946-square metre Ballarat Street site sold for a speculated price of more than $8 million to a developer. A few weeks earlier, the neighbouring 3136-square metre property, on the corner of Ballarat and Ovens streets, exchanged for $8.3 million to an investor.\nIn his heyday, Mr Beris, now an octogenarian, distributed more than 850 tonnes of cheese and 250 tonnes of olive oil, imported to the Hodgson Street factory. For a period until the mid-1980s, Mr Beris was business partner with John Kotis, who went on to establish his own import business, Elco Foods.\nPlay Central Leases Bayside Building\nFormer merchant banker James McIntosh has leased one of Port Melbourne's most prominent buildings for his latest business venture.\nThe 2000-square metre deal will see the former Mitchell Laminates site at 37-53 Crockford Street repurposed as a children's entertainment venue, Play Central.\nThe Mitchell family recently rejected an offer to sell their vacated Port Melbourne site to a developer – the gentrifying suburb finding favour in recent years with builders able to buy commercial land cheap, then propose medium and high-density projects.\nAt least three towers of more than 35 levels are proposed for the Fishermans Bend area nearby.\nA Mitchell spokesman said the presence of Play Central will enhance the evolving neighbourhood. The former laminates showroom will now include, among other things, a section for dodgem cars and another, with climbing apparatus.\nBayley Stuart's Alasdair MacGillivray​ signed Play Central to the site.\nBanyule Council Offers Public Land to Private Market\nThe Banyule City Council can expect just over $2 million from the sale of a Heidelberg West property earmarked for decades as a potential public housing site.\nThe 3319-square metre vacant tract known as 219 Southern Road abuts parkland near Darebin Creek, also the border with the more valuable suburb of Preston.\nKnight Frank's Tim Grant and Ken Smirk are marketing the property, which is also walking distance to the Northland Shopping Centre (a major bus hub).\nEarlier this month local developer Caydon was permitted to build a controversial 14-level apartment building on an Upper Heidelberg Road, Ivanhoe, site which was until recently deemed to be in Heidelberg.\nChurch Sells Viewbank Land\nAn investor is paying just over $6.5 million for a 9370-square metre former church site in Viewbank, 15 kilometres north-east of the CBD.\nThe property at 19-35 Graham Road, zoned GRZ2 – which allows for a medium-density redevelopment – is currently configured with a church hall and seven self-contained units.\nOffloaded by the New South Wales-registered Community of Christ Limited Pty Ltd, the site is a short walk from Banyule Creek and Viewbank Primary School, but some distance from the nearest train stations, Macleod and Rosanna.\nBarry Plant Eltham agents Aaron Yeats and Jamin Silluzio​ settled on the deal within a week of expressions of interest campaign closing.\nIcon Corners East Melbourne Site\nLocal developer Icon Property is paying a speculated $15 million for a relatively large corner block in East Melbourne – the suburb often said to carry the city's highest land rate value, when measured per square metre.\nThe 1000-square metre plot at 30 Powlett Street, at the south-east intersection of George Street, is currently configured as a three-level hotel with 45 studio suites.\nThe asset was offered with a permit to add 13 rooms – though the property was expected to attract larger developers, like Icon, who may propose a new concept – including a lower-density, luxury development.\nCarroll McKeddie's Peter McKeddie​ and Kay & Burton's Gerald Delany were the marketing agents.\nTheir deal comes six months after another local developer paid $13 million for a 709-square metre block at 132-142 Wellington Parade, on the corner of Powlett Street – a property now mooted to become a mid-rise apartment complex.\nNearby, in August, philosopher Peter Singer was part of a consortium to pocket $2.7 million from the sale of a Rowena Parade, Richmond, complex, configured as ten bedsit flats.\nEmail: marcpallisco@gmail.com\nTwitter: @marcpallisco", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:28:53.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
