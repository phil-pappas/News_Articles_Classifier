If you have one of these faux pas on your profile, your job might end before it even starts. \n1. Posting inappropriate pictures \nProspective employers don’t want to see you chugging beer. Or worse – photos of you after you’ve chugged several beers. Certain pictures may seem innocent, but do they reflect how you want to be seen professionally? \n2. Complaining about your current job \nEveryone gripes about their bad boss, their low pay or their lousy office. But few really want to hear or read about it, especially someone who might become your new boss. \n3. Statuses you wouldn’t want your boss to see \nBe smart. Don’t post a status like, “I’m calling in sick tomorrow so I can party tonight.” Any status that makes you look unprofessional won’t impress an employer. \n4. Not understanding your security settings \nReview and understand your privacy options. At the very least, your profile should only allow friends to see your pictures or information. \n5. Losing by association \nYou can’t control what your friends post on your page – but you don’t have to leave it there. If you wouldn’t want your mom to see it, delete. \nWhen you’re job hunting, it’s a good idea to create a second, public profile for professional use. Facebook can be fun, but remember – if it creates the wrong impression, it’s limiting your job opportunities. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:33:47.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
