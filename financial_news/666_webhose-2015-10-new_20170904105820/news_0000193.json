PUBLISHED: 14:48, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:01, Thu, Oct 15, 2015 GETTY Black Friday sales are expected to be across UK high streets this year \nBritain's retailers are gearing up for a day of huge spending, with Curry's, Amazon, Asda and Tesco just some of the big names lining up sales. In fact, retail expert at consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs Jonathan De Mello said that almost all of the UK's high street shops will be offering sales.He told Express.co.uk: \"Black Friday 2015 is set to be bigger than ever. \"It's more of an American thing, but it came to the fore last year and is now predicted to be the first UK Â£1bn shopping day .\"Everybody has to take part - if your competitors are doing it, you are doing it.\"However, now that the UK economic recovery is further along the track, with wages rising and inflation at zero, there is less need for retailers to offer steep discounts. Furthermore, a number of British retailers were thought to have hurt their bottom line by offering large discounts too early on in the season. Mr De Mello said: \"This year, lots of retailers from Next to John Lewis will have learnt.\"The depth of discounting will be curtailed and discounts won't be as deep.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:44:24.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
