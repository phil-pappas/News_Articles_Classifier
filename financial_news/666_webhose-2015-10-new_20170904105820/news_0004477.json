The firm was also in breach of its debt covenants. \nThe US fashion retailer, which has shops in nine British cities, has built its brand on making all of its clothes in Los Angeles. \nMr Charney, the Canadian who founded American Apparel in 1989, has filed several lawsuits against the firm since it dismissed him for alleged misconduct last year. \nAmerican Apparel's New York-listed shares have fallen from more than $2 two years ago to 11 cents last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:21:14.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
