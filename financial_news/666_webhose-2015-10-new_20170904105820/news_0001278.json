PayLease raised the funds through its annual charity golf tournament, which took place on June 13th at Maderas Golf Club in Poway, CA. The annual tournament draws a large turnout of golfers and volunteers. Several businesses also support the event, including this year’s platinum sponsor, Banc of California.\nApproximately 7,000 patients from all over the world have traveled to San Diego to receive treatments from Fresh Start Surgical Gifts. Some of the conditions Fresh Start treats include: Microtia, Hemangioma, Neurofibromatosis, Hairy Nevus, Cleft lip and Cleft palate, Treacher Collins Syndrome, Portwine stains, and Hemifacial Microsomia. Surgeries to treat these conditions are provided by Fresh Start at the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, CA.\nThis is the fifth consecutive year PayLease has organized a golf tournament where 100% of the proceeds benefit Fresh Start. To date, PayLease has donated over $45,000 to the charity. Fresh Start recently announced that it will commemorate PayLease’s long-time support by naming a clinic room after the firm. In addition to bearing the firm’s name, the clinic room will be designed and decorated by PayLease.\nMoving forward, PayLease expects its charitable involvement with Fresh Start to increase as both organizations have recently expanded into the Chicago area. PayLease recently acquired Chicago-based Ocius , a convergent and utility billing provider for the multifamily industry. Fresh Start also announced the opening of a second clinic at the University of Chicago.\nAbout PayLease\nPayLease ( http://www.paylease.com ), is a leading electronic payments provider for the property management industry, specifically targeting the multifamily, single family, HOA and commercial markets.
