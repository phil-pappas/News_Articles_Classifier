Virginia Star Share on twitter by Jamie Freed You arrive at the airport in a self-driving Uber car, paying a few dollars extra for the closest kerbside access.\nYou have already checked for the flight on your mobile and there are permanent tags on your luggage, so all you need to do is place your bags on a conveyer belt.\nYou then walk into the entry hall, place your bag on a security scanner and are identified biometrically while your body is scanned, so there is no need to speak with an immigration agent.\nOnce past security, you may order some food via an app or perhaps visit virtual shops, where you scan a code for an item that will be delivered to your home when you return from your trip. You then board the aircraft through an automated gate and get on with your journey.\nWelcome to the airport of the future.\n\"We are moving toward a self-service airport,\" Airbiz Aviation Strategies managing director Greg Fordham told delegates at the Australian Airports Association annual conference in Hobart last week.\n\"But one important thing is self-service doesn't mean no service by human beings. It remains the redeployment of customer service people to the people who require it, while the other 70 to 90 per cent of travellers can do it themselves and want to be in control.\"\nAs everything becomes more automated, the processes also become quicker. Bill Matz, a director of The Strategic Airport Planning Group, said self-driving cars would become a major disrupter to the industry on two fronts.\n The first is, drive times will be estimated accurately in the future, removing the need to leave for the airport early in case traffic is bad.\nNo parking required And self-driving cars also won't require airport parking, a major revenue source for the operators, because they will return home or collect a new passenger.\n\"Removing that [traffic] unpredictability which is why people get to the airport early … that scares the bejesus out of me,\" Mr Matz said. \"That is going to have some really dramatic impacts on dwell times. And if you don't need airport car parking, we are going to have to find new sources of income.\"\nHe said one idea would be for passengers wanting to be dropped off at the airport entrance to pay more than those arriving at a more distant location.\nAirports look to maximise \"dwell time\" – the amount of time available for shopping, eating and drinking – to help achieve higher revenues. But as the parking, check-in, bag check, security and immigration processes become more streamlined, there is less incentive for passengers to arrive early.\n\"Having given all that time to passengers we need to give them something to do,\" Mr Fordham said.\nThat said, they might be more relaxed and ready to spend once past security and immigration, which are the biggest pain points for Australian passengers, according to a study by airport technology group SITA.\n\"You can see the stress levels from the passengers going up when they go through security because they lose control,\" SITA Asia Pacific president Ilya Gutlin said. \"Here you have got the authority that is able to do anything that they want. They can say yay or nay.\"\nDavid Blackwell, the executive general manager customer service at Adelaide Airport agreed long queues were a problem. \"If we can eliminate them, I'm not guaranteeing it turns into more retail spend but it is a more pleasant experience for our customers,\" he said.\nNew strategies needed With queues gone, Mr Fordham said airport operators would need new strategies for encouraging passengers to want to spend time at the facility.\nHe said the airport could be a great spot for showrooms for luxury goods including cars that could then be ordered for delivery at a later date by affluent passengers or even used as an opportunity for grocery shopping at a virtual store.\n\"Having given all that time back to the passenger, we need to give them interesting things to do,\" Mr Fordham said. \"These are people with high disposable incomes that are time poor.\"\nMajor brands are already recognising the opportunity for airport showcases, such as the Heineken Lounge bar at Dubai Airport and The Peugeot Lounge for owners of the French car at the Subang Airport in Malaysia .\n\"It is not about selling beer at Dubai Airport,\" Mr Fordham said of the Heineken bar. \"Yes, they might sell some beer but it is all about brand awareness.\"\nFor his part, Mr Matz said he believed \"robot restaurants\" where orders were taken via an app, customised and then delivered to an automated box could also take off in the airport environment as they have at the Eatsa restaurant in San Francisco .\nMobile robots could also deliver airport purchases to customers at the gates.\n\"It is coming,\" Mr Matz said. \"It is going to happen.\"\nThe reporter travelled to Hobart as a guest of the Australian Airports Association.", "external_links": ["https://www.eatsa.com/", "http://paultan.org/2013/01/17/nasim-launches-peugeot-lounge-at-subang-skypark/", "https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://www.emiratesleisureretail.com/Brands/HeinekenLounge.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:03:33.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
