At the same time, as the regulator, we must ensure that regulatory requirements are met and are developed in a way that delivers the high standards customers deserve,\" he said. \nUber has launched an online petition against the changes. \nLondon is one of many cities where San Francisco-based Uber has sparked legal battles and opposition from taxi drivers. \nTfL said the number of minicabs in London has risen from around 59,000 in 2009-2010 to more than 89,000. \nAt the current rate of growth, it said the total number could rise to 128,000 within two years (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:59:07.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
