Mainardi reckons there could be about 5,000 co-op farms in China, with their number growing by 15-20 percent each year.\nSubsidies - which can cover up to 30-40 percent of the cost of a tractor or give incentives for deep ploughing - have also encouraged rapid gains in mechanisation in a sector still dominated by the lower-horsepower tractors and other machinery used on smaller farms.\n\"There are a lot of subsidies, and with a bigger land area you get more efficiency and more income,\" said Zhao Shuanzhen, director of the Gaocheng Zengshou Agricultural Machinery Service Cooperative in Hebei province.\nZhao's cooperative originally only leased equipment and services to farms across China, but since 2011 has also been farming on its own account, and now rents 40 hectares from more than 100 households.\nThe co-op has more than 200 wheat harvesters - including more than 30 it bought this year - 180 tractors and 24 corn harvesters, almost all of them domestic brands.\n\"If our land area was bigger, we might consider buying some good (foreign) equipment,\" said Zhao.\nForeign players now account for an estimated 80 percent of the high-horsepower market, although they can expect to face greater competition from local counterparts in the future.\nUnder the national \"Made in China 2025\" plan, Beijing wants domestic companies to take 30 percent of the 200-plus horsepower market by 2020, and 60 percent by 2025.\n($1 = 6.3731 Chinese yuan) (Additional reporting by Pete Sweeney in SHANGHAI and the SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:52:49.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
