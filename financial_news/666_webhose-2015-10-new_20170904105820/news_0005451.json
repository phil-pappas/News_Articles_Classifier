It now has three sites in Manhattan and Long Island and will pop up in two more locations in Brooklyn by 2016. The company is in the process of negotiating leases in Coney Island and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and has its sights set on Williamsburg after that. \nCure’s chief executive Elan Katz said he wants to target low-income areas that are considered medically underserved, with a shortage of doctors. At the same time, he wants to remain accessible to wealthier people who are more likely to have commercial insurance, the primary market for the urgent care center industry. \n“Now it’s viable to open up in underserved areas, but a year ago it wasn’t,” said Katz, who grew up in Midwood, Brooklyn. \nWhat changed is that Katz started signing contracts with insurers that enroll Medicaid beneficiaries. \nIn the past, Medicaid managed care plans urged members to see their assigned primary care doctors. But those insurers' attitudes toward urgent care centers are starting to change, Katz said. New contracts with Medicaid managed care plans have helped boost the number of Medicaid visitors at Katz’s clinics to about 32% today from about 12% at the end of 2014. \nEmpire BlueCross BlueShield HealthPlus (previously HealthPlus Amerigroup) was once hesitant to work with urgent care centers. The insurer, which serves the five boroughs and surrounding counties, has signed contracts with nine urgent care operators at 19 locations since 2014. \nMetroPlus Health Plan, which serves four of the five boroughs, has penned deals with about a dozen urgent care operators within the past year. B efore that, MetroPlus had reservations. \n\"It was a new model. There was some concern about the quality, concern about whether people would use this in a way that avoided primary care physicians,\" said Seth Diamond, chief operating officer at MetroPlus. \"Now we have more confidence that the model works.\" \nNot all urgent care centers are willing to accept Medicaid's lower rates, Diamond said. \nBut he said the potential benefits of the model have become clear. Urgent care centers, which tend to keep their doors open on evenings and weekends, could help people avoid expensive visits to the emergency room. \nHaving the convenient clinics in-network could also make MetroPlus more attractive to consumers. In the upcoming open enrollment period, MetroPlus will list Cure Urgent Care among its providers on the Obamacare exchange for the first time. Working together will be a good selling point for both companies, Diamond said. \nKatz aims to open Cure’s new sites in close proximity to another of his businesses, Quick Rx pharmacies. Each new clinic will cost between $900,000 and $1.4 million to build and will be self-financed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:03.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
