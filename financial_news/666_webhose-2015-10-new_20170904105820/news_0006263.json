The art is to correctly price each individual opportunity.\"\nDuring the quarter, Platinum exited stocks including Ping An Insurance, China Life, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Hitachi. It added Oracle and Ericsson; partially selling Intel and Cisco and exiting Ciena. PayPal was introduced and Platinum bought more Tencent. The Platinum Global Fund, which has an annual return since inception of 14 per cent, lost 5 per cent in the quarter, trailing its benchmark which recorded a loss of 1 per cent over the same period.\nThe Hamish Douglass-managed Magellan Global Fund entered the third quarter with highly defensive positions and a large US dollar cash allocation of about 15 per cent.\nHis fund rose by 4.5 per cent during the quarter, beating its benchmark which returned 0.2 per cent.\n Fed outward-looking The other significant event in the third quarter was the United States Federal Reserve's decision to hold back raising interest rates at its September meeting. The event revealed the Fed was much more outward-looking than realised. It moved not just the bond market but global equities too, by underscoring the severity of the slowdown in global activity, led by China.\nMr Douglass maintained his optimism around the US economy. \"Consumer spending and the housing market have held up relatively well despite the softening of the global economy exacerbated by uncertainties in China,\" he said. \"We continue to believe that the uncertainties as to where US monetary policy is headed over the next few years is the most important factor that could lead to a major market correction translating into material losses for investors.\"\nHis biggest portfolio holding is Microsoft.\n\"Despite incurring a record loss due to the $US7.5 billion write off of Nokia, Microsoft's results exceeded market expectations. Microsoft's software and cloud businesses continue to grow strongly,\" Mr Douglass said.\nThe ASX-listed Ellerston Global Investments declined 3.1 per cent during the quarter, versus the 7.7 per cent fall by its benchmark.\n\"It may be early days, but the fears about China look overblown,\" the fund told investors. \"The capital flight is subsiding. Although the Chinese economy is slowing, the shift from infrastructure investment to consumer spending is ongoing.\n\"More worrying is the uncertainty of Federal Reserve monetary policy. A genuine fear that the Fed is losing control over monetary policy is now at the back of every investor's mind. This will not go away until there have been multiple raises with short rates getting to at least 1 per cent and perhaps even higher. This in turn could lead to severe volatility in markets for some time to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:07:11.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
