The government has said it will seek to spur more home-building through changes to planning rules. \n\"With local authorities, housing associations and developers no longer satisfying the country's housing needs, those in particular looking to rent or buy smaller homes must hope for the cavalry to come to their rescue, in the form of government action or large-scale institutional investment,\" Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst, said. \nThe survey was conducted between Sept. 13 and Oct. 10.
