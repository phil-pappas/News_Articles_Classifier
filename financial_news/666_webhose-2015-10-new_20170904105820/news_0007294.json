The drop was less than the fall to 107.8 expected by financial-market analysts.\nSentiment proved resilient despite the scandal at major automaker Volkswagen, which has admitted equipping cars with software that enabled them to evade U.S. emissions tests. The company faces heavy fines and the possibility of lost sales.\nThe survey by the Munich-based Ifo institute is based on surveys of 7,000 businesses about their view of current conditions and where the economy is going.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
