That is why it must reform. The UK needs to pursue a global agenda - and the issue is whether it is able to do that in a reformed EU or whether it needs to pursue that approach outside.\" \nMr Lyons comments follow a report backed by the Mayor last year that showed the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) would continue to thrive outside the 28-nation bloc . \nLondon's value to the UK economy - currently £350bn - would rise to £640bn by 2034 if Britain stayed in a reformed EU and adopted policies encouraging more trade with fast-growing markets, the report showed. \nBut if the UK left the EU but continued to pursue its own trade-friendly, London would still grow to £615bn over the next two decades, it found. \nDavid Cameron has outlined four key demands to keep Britain within the bloc , including a “red card” system to bring powers back from Brussels and fresh safeguards for the City. \nThe Prime Minister has pledged to deliver a written list of his renegotiation demands within weeks .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:17:22.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
