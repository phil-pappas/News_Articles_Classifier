Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Traffic jams, lack of affordable housing and urban blight risk turning Australia's biggest cities into today's equivalent of the industrial revolution's \"dark satanic mills\" unless businesses work with governments to invest in serious renewal.\nThat's a key message of a new report that argues in favour of doing more to unlock the inherent productivity-boosting benefits offered by cities.\nAccording to the report's author, Ian Harper, Deloitte Access Economics partner and head of the government's recent competition report, the economic benefits of getting cities right is \"many multiples\" greater than politically difficult reforms to the tax system or even competition policy.\nProfessor Harper will on Tuesday challenge businesses to stop waiting for federal, state and local authorities to ensure the nation's cities are made attractive to people, investors and industry – something that governments are well aware of but often too financial constrained to fix.\nThe report adds to a growing debate about future infrastructure demand, after Labor last week announced a $10 billion \"bank\" to fund new investments.\nMonday's The Australian Financial Review reported that rail and other city-building projects could soon be funded by pledging to bondholders a slice of the future gains in land taxes generated by rising property prices under options being considered by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull .\nThe suggestion has been warmly welcomed by investors and groups such as the Property Council of Australia, which argues that so-called tax increment financing is a proven way of overcoming two of the biggest hurdles facing new projects – finding enough upfront capital and getting all levels of government working together.\n\"The beauty of tax increment financing is that it secures funding from additional revenue streams without the need to levy new taxes,\" property council chief executive Ken Morrison said.\nRelated \"It's is an approach that uses economic growth to fund projects and we strongly encourage the government to further explore this opportunity.\"\n'Taxpayers must benefit' Federal opposition infrastructure spokesman Anthony Albanese told the Financial Review that big projects such as Sydney's Badgerys Creek airport need to ensure taxpayers benefit from the increase in value such projects deliver, rather than allowing all the gains to private interests.\n\"The railway needs to be built first and factored into the lease of the airport,\" he said, alluding to the rising in property prices that will follow its construction.\nDeloittes' latest Building the Lucky Country report – the fifth so far in its series looking at ways of growing the economy – suggests the world's successful cities have mastered the trick of encouraging and enabling people to work closely together, while simultaneously controlling the downside.\nJust as the industrial revolution produced phenomenal gains in living standards thanks to factories and mass production, they also brought the misery depicted in William Blake's early 1800s poem.\n\"Today's Satanic Mills are congestion, urban blight, crime and affordability,\" said Professor Harper, ahead of Tuesday's launch of the report by Treasurer Scott Morrison in Canberra.\n\"As Australia moves from farms and factories to the networks and ecosystems of a service economy, our living standards increasingly depend on economies of scale and the knowledge capital of creativity and innovation, generated by people living and working closely together.\n\"The challenge… is to create and nurture places where people want to live and work.\"\nThe potential economic gain of unlocking the latent productivity of cities would be many times greater than tax reform, a politically challenging task that would probably only bring a one-off boost to gross domestic product of 2 per cent.\nThe report classifies Australia into five types of regions; the inner cities, suburbs, outer urban areas, regional cities, and rural and remote places, and analyses the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of each.\nWhile technology – transport and communication – appears to have solved the \"tyranny of distance\", location and place are still vitally important, according to Professor Harper.\n\"People congregate in particular places because place matters for their prosperity. It matters directly, materially or non-materially, and for better or worse.\n\"People want places where they can flourish.\"", "external_links": ["http://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/building-lucky-country/topics/building-lucky-country.html", "https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:43:50.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
