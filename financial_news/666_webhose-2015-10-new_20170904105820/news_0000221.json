Bloomberg by Greg Smith United States homebuilder Lennar recently posted fiscal third-quarter earnings that came in handily ahead of analyst expectations. Driving the result were double-digit percentage gains in home deliveries and a mid single-digit rise in the average price of houses sold.\nWe believe the Miami-based company is one of the best homebuilding exposures in the United States. The company has an attractive land bank, scale in its business, good geographic positioning and an appealing range of dwellings targeting everyone from entry-level buyers to the relatively affluent.\nThe US housing recovery since the global financial crisis has thrown up mixed data at times, but the overall weight of data has been positive. The slow and steady nature of the recovery is in our view preferable to the market becoming overheated again. We believe more growth is likely over the next couple of years, barring any major economic derailments.\nInterestingly, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen recently stated that the US housing market was \"very depressed\". Given this week's S&P/Case-Shiller report shows that US house prices in 20 major metropolitan areas jumped 5 per cent in the year to July, there is probably a bit of brinkmanship here. The Fed is looking for reasons to justify its ultra-low rates policy, hence Yellen's negative commentary.\nImproving consumer confidence, low interest rates and low inventory have helped boost new home sales in recent months and on balance we expect more of the same over the rest of the year.\nThis should augur well for Lennar, which reported an 18.4 per cent increase in third-quarter revenues to $US2.49 billion ($3.54 billion), and a 22 per cent jump in pre-tax earnings to $US320.7 million. Underpinning the result was a 22 per cent increase in turnover at the core home-building segment, which came in at $US2.23 billion. The unit delivered an operating profit of $US333.7 million, up about 27 per cent year on year.\nNew home orders up 10pc Home deliveries were robust, coming in 16 per cent higher at 6314, while average sales prices rose 5 per cent to $US350,000. A 10 per cent increase in new home orders in the quarter, swelling backlog and prices that are still rising, also bode well for future earnings.\n Compared with some other results in the sector, Lennar has preserved its gross margin relatively well at 24.1 per cent. And in an absolute sense the $US531.4 million in gross margins on home sales was well ahead of the $US456.2 million in the prior corresponding period.\nLennar is trading about 15 times FY15 earnings, forecast to decline to 13 times the following year. With a forward price-to-book value multiple of just 1.9 times, it is attractively priced in our view. We believe there remains plenty of room to run for the company's earnings, with the US housing recovery looking a lot more sustainable this time around.\nGreg Smith is the head off research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.\nFor a free trial to Fat Prophets' daily market commentary please click here http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview", "external_links": ["http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview", "https://webmail.fatprophets.com.au/owa/redir.aspx?C=1FcMqgWj8Uut_OmGESNhBJEGBVmUw9IIuC5Ai2F9Tp0O-GWRZJzGDGD0V0eTuwvGr_tsamaGzL4.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fatprophets.com.au%2ffranked_dividends.aspx%3fref%3dFinReview"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:59:12.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
