But finding a place to stay on rent is becoming quite difficult here. We find out why migrants are finding it difficult to locate apartments for rent in Bangalore. \nDealing with brokers and landlords \nIf identifying a property was not a tough task in itself, trusting and dealing with real estate brokers has made it worse. Trusting the broker and then dealing with the home owner has put off a number of potential tenants. Landlords usually hesitate when it comes to renting out their property to bachelors due to their lifestyle. Home owners also think they will end up with damaged property as they think single men will not be able to maintain their property. \nHigh rentals \nWith property prices soaring landlords are renting properties because of the profitability factor. The robust rental returns have created a good opportunity for many second time home buyers and local investors. The city today has been cited to be one of the most expensive cities for rental properties and landlords today are marking up rentals by five times due to the constant demand. \nUnaffordable security deposits \nIf high rents were not enough, landlords today are requesting a lump sum amount as deposits. A landlord can easily ask for a deposit which falls anywhere between INR 1 lakh to INR 16 lakhs depending on how well the homes have been furnished. Since the tenant is forced to produce the bulk amount within a limited time period, most of the tenants give up on hunting for rental spaces. \nCompromised privacy \nAnother common issue faced by the tenants here is lack of privacy. Home owners are at free will to invade the tenantsâ€™ privacy thus forcing tenants to retaliate or move away from the property. If tenants are bachelors then landlords draw up a curfew that bans them from drinking, partying or having many friends over. \nEviction \nSudden eviction has always been a major concern for tenants. The delay in return of security deposits and introduction of sudden clauses in the rental agreements are also some of the problems faced by tenants. Landlords asking tenants to leave the property immediately due to personal reasons too has created a havoc. \nNidhi C Thacker for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: https://www.flickr.com/photos/119599301@N02/13059257905 \nBy: indiaproperty.com Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic Taxation Q Interest rates are going to go down.
