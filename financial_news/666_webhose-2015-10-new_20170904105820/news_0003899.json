Photo: Louie Douvis\nAnalysts have given their approval to Insurance Australia Group's incoming boss Peter Harmer, as respected insurance veteran Mike Wilkins prepares to retire in November.\nAfter more than seven years at IAG, the owner of brands such as NRMA and RACV, Wilkins will cede the top seat at Australia's biggest insurer to former CGU boss Mr Harmer.\nDeutsche Bank said the transition had been orderly, with few surprises, while Kieren Chidgey, insurance analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note to clients: \"With over 15 years' experience as CEO of insurance divisions, Mr Harmer comes with a wealth of experience and is a logical choice as successor to Mr Wilkins.\n\"We believe the market's focus will be on how Mr Harmer steers IAG through the cyclical downturn to maintain growth and margins, and what he plans to do with the significant surplus capital IAG is sitting on following the Berkshire-Hathaway deal.\"\nAdvertisement Mr Wilkins will be remembered as the chief executive who struck one of the biggest deals in Australia's insurance industry, after signing a 20 per cent quota share agreement with US-based Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire will shoulder part of IAG's risk, and give the insurer a multimillion-dollar capital injection in return for 20 per cent of its business.\nHe will also be remembered as the chief executive to have forged IAG's path into Asia, and the overseer of the company's $1.85 billion acquisition of Wesfarmers' insurance underwriting business.\nJan van der Schalk, an analyst at CLSA, said Mr Wilkins had been \"the right man at the right time\" at IAG.\nHe said the industry would be looking at Mr Harmer to take a disciplined approach to the group's commercial business, which has been hampered by falling premiums in a competitive market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:10:47.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
