One has to find a solution somewhere in between. There are many ideas, I hope we can work out a solution that would be acceptable,\" Duda said. \nInitially parliament had debated a proposal that would have divided the conversion costs equally between the banks and their clients, but this was unexpectedly amended so that 90 percent of costs were on the banks. \nBut this proposal was rejected by the upper house of parliament. \nThe mortgage conversion bill sparked protests from some foreign parent banks. They have said they would seek compensation for any losses incurred as a result and that such legislation infringes on Poland's international investment protection agreements. \n(Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:03:55.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
