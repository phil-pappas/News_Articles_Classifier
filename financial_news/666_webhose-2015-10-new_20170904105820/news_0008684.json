Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by John Stensholt\nLarry Kestelman's intent was obvious. The owner of the Melbourne United basketball club stood the entire match, inches behind the team's then coach Darryl McDonald on the sidelines listening and watching intently.\nThere was no sitting back in a corporate box enjoying the atmosphere. Kestelman was brimming with intensity, focused on the coach's strategy and willing his players to claw their way back into yet another game they were destined to lose.\nIt was November 2014, and only weeks after Kestelman had sacked the team's previous coach and just months after he had changed the club name from the Melbourne Tigers, a brand that that existed since the early 1980s.\nKestelman believes the league is one of the best in the world outside the behemoth that is the United States' National Basketball Association (NBA). Here, Matt Knight of the Perth Wildcats passes the ball against Lucas Walker of Melbourne United during the round five NBL match between the two teams at Perth Arena on November 9, 2014. Paul Kane Kestelman was showing exactly who was boss.\nAnd at the same time, behind the scenes, he had started the process of what would be a stunning move: taking majority ownership of the entire National Basketball League, which began its 2015-16 season this week.\nKestelman, an entrepreneur who has made his fortune in high-end property development – also co-founding the Dodo internet and phone business, which sold for almost $230 million in 2013 – has done what probably no other business identity has done around the world.\nHe hasn't just bought a sports club, he's bought an entire sporting league.\n\"I'm not the right guy to do things slowly and transform things in a gentle manner,\" says NBL executive director Larry Kestelman, here with Melbourne United basketballers Chris Goulding, right, and Hakim Warrick, left, at Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre. Arsineh Houspian \"I definitely classify myself as a control freak,\" Kestelman tells AFR Weekend in his Melbourne CBD fringe top-floor office with its sweeping views of the city. He explains that while his role as NBL executive director won't last forever, his move to take control was necessary.\n\"I did it because it had to be done. I'm really bad at standing by and letting things happen if I feel that it's within my control to do something about it.\"\nKestelman has paid about $7 million to take majority control of the NBL. It's a competition that has existed since 1979, but one that seemingly peaked in the early to mid 1990s, with the glory days of sell-out crowds around the country. In the league's history, more than 30 clubs have gone broke or merged and, during the past off-season, both the Townsville and Illawarra teams had short stints in administration.\nHad enough Larry Kestelman is also CEO of Property Group which has high rise offices on Melbourne's Queens Rd: \"I definitely classify myself as a control freak.\" Arsineh Houspian It was during that time that Kestelman decided he had had enough. Just as with soccer in Australia a decade ago, basketball was on its knees financially and that was despite the playing talent being of a higher standard than ever before. As well as the issues in Townsville and Wollongong (the home of the Illawarra Hawks), the Adelaide 36ers last season were understood to have debts of more than $1 million and the Sydney Kings to have made a loss of more than $1 million.\nOn the other hand, huge crowds still flocked to watch the Perth Wildcats, with the team making a profit of more than $1.5 million for its BRW Rich List member owner Jack Bendat. The success in Perth, a profitable Cairns Taipans and the popularity of the sport at grassroots level, was proof to many that the NBL still had great potential.\nKestelman made his $7 million offer to recapitalise the league and take control in May, after the end of last season. After some initial resistance from some club owners, the offer was accepted. In truth, there was not a plan B. By that stage, the NBL had no television broadcast deal, few sponsors and several struggling teams.\nThe league's new owner set about an intensive 100-day plan to appoint new executives and find new sponsors, negotiate pay-television and free-to-air TV deals, launch a new NBL logo, announce a new team in Brisbane and revamp the entire NBL digital platform, including the website and online streaming.\nEverything was achieved, including a deal for Nine Entertainment Co to show a live match every Sunday and Fox Sports to broadcast every match live. An advertising and marketing campaign costing $1 million is also being rolled out across the country.\n\"This has been 80 per cent of my time and all that has meant is I have had to make more time,\" Kestelman says. \"So less sleep, and I have not stopped for 100 days. But I'm not the right guy to do things slowly and transform things in a gentle manner. If I have a vision of what I think is needed to make it a success, then I need to go 100 miles per hour. Step change in this sort of scenario would not work.\"\nOff-court professionalism slipped Kestelman has owned Melbourne United (formerly the Tigers) since February 2012 though he had been a sponsor for a decade before that. During that time he said he witnessed the professionalism of the league off the court slowly slip, causing him to step in.\nHe still believes the league is one of the best in the world outside the behemoth that is the United States' National Basketball Association (NBA); Australia continues to produce top class players and the national men's team is considered a medal chance at the Rio De Janeiro Olympics next year.\n\"The core product is great. Without it you could not have made it work like a business. There will not be a game go by without multiple slam dunks and alley oops. And I think our teams could compete on the world stage, [and beat anyone] bar about a dozen outside the NBA.\"\nFuture plans include selling NBL television rights to overseas markets as a prelude to admitting teams from Asia to the league, with Kestelman setting his sights on the China, Indonesia and the Philippines. The latter, a basketball-mad nation, in particular fascinates Kestelman. He is a regular visitor to the Philippines and owns an outsourcing company employing 7000 people.\nBut with the NBL season now underway, Kestelman says he is \"pacing the hallways nervously\" as he did for the birth of his son and the establishment of several companies.\nHe says a turnaround can take place within a relatively short period of time, after which the league can stand on its own two feet and he can at least step back from a financial point of view.\n\"I will invest what ever is needed to make it right. I think it can be a proper functioning business and be profitable and viable [in] a maximum of a few years. Maximum. It might even be before then.\"\nBut Kestelman warns he can't act along to resurrect the league.\n\"I'm happy to be the saviour but the game cannot be about me. I'm just the guy who set up the platform to help them enjoy. If everyone sits back and says, 'oh good basketball is back' - but does nothing about it, it won't work.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:06:14.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
