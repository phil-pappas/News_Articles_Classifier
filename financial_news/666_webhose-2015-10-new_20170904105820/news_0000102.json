Louise Kennerley by Matthew Smith Deep value funds manager Simon Mawhinney from Allan Gray has been buying selectively in the battered resources segment, but he admitted \"we're not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel\".\nMr Mawhinney said he had been buying names in energy, aluminium and gold as the S&P/ASX 200 has lost about 15 per cent of its value since its April peaks, with the resources segment the hardest hit.\nHe said he continued to avoid iron ore and copper producers because of their reliance of demand from China.\nOn Thursday morning Mr Mawhinney said he had bought up all of the available rights in the Origin Energy $2.5 billion equity capital raised to company announced the previous day, which he said he had to sell some positions to fill.\n\"I think with energy the supply side of the equation will fix itself soon,\" Mr Mawhinney said of the world's energy demands and the amount energy prices have already come down.\n\"Energy prices have already cut deep into the cost curve,\" he said.\nStrong balance sheets Among the listed energy names Mr Mawhinney said had also recently bought Woodside to add to the investment firm's stake.\n Woodside is the largest position in the investment firm's $3.2 billion Australian Equity Fund's strategy.\nIn the resources segment Mr Mawhinney said he planned to stick to investing in companies with assets low on the cost curve of production with strong balance sheets.\n\"Where the cycle has been going on a long time and, those companies that don't have debt have been washing their face during the cyclical down turn and when the cycle turns they should do extremely well...They are fantastic companies to invest in when you can find them,\" he said.\nMr Mawhinney put Woodside into this category. He also said he had been buying Alumina in recent weeks to add to the firm's existing position.\nMr Mawhinney added that the Origin Energy's debt spiral and subsequent capital raise took him by surprise.\n\"Even as recent as six months ago Origin appeared to have manageable debt but you throw in lower earnings and capex and that can change quickly,\" he said.\nAvoid heavy debt Ric Ronge, Pengana Capital Global Resources Fund portfolio manager, said he'd invested up to 8 per cent of the capital of the fund he co-manages in recent weeks as share prices had continued to fall.\nRonge said he had focused his buying at the smaller capitalised end of the market and had been avoiding companies with weak balance sheets that might be forced to raise equity following the Origin raise.\nCompanies with heavy debt loads in this segment included gold miner Newcrest, Fortescue and Santos, he said.\nOn Thursday morning, Newcrest announced it had finalised the sale of its Evolution asset and would use the proceeds to pay down debt.\nMr Ronge added that he continued to avoid companies paying dividends from earnings which are at risk.\nThe progressive dividend policies of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton in which dividends have continued to rise in line with earnings per share has been put under the spotlight since the recent commodities price rout.\n\"A lot of companies in the segment remain stressed with respect to balance sheets and those paying out high earnings ratios to palatinate shareholders… As a buyer you cant be blasé, you have to respect the market and we're in a sell off,\" Mr Ronge said.\nMassive opportunity? Mr Mawhinney said he believed for some commodities, it's not unreasonable to imagine we could be about to enter a prolonged downturn to rival the period during the late 1990s.\n\"For copper for instance from 1995 it took until 2002 for the (copper) price to bottom before it got swept up again in the mother of all commodity booms.\nHe pointed to Glencore and Anglo American as companies that have been forced to rationalise production because of the \"extreme pain\" because of commodity prices.\n\"I'm sure we'll look back on this time in a few years and say that was a massive opportunity, but it's not easy to recognise when you're in the middle of it,\" said Ronge.\n\"Those companies with gearing under control and capital expenditure behind them and are still able to generate earnings but might have been caught in the sell off…There's no doubt the sector is showing a degree of value but there's also a lot about it that feels like a value trap,\" Mr Ronge said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:09:33.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
