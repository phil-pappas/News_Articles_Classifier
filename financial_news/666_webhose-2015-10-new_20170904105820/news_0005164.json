Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Reserve Bank of Australia is being urged by a group of prominent monetary policy experts to shun growing calls for another official interest rate cut.\nWith fresh evidence emerging that the jobs market is gaining strength, the experts have warned that cutting the official cash rate below 2 per cent would be unlikely to spur additional economic growth and may even exacerbate already sky-high debt levels.\nMembers of the so-called \"shadow board\" – a high-powered group that includes two former Reserve Bank board members and is hosted by the Australian National University – argue that interest rates should be kept either at their current levels or lifted over the next six months.\nThey also believe the Reserve Bank should keep the cash rate unchanged on Tuesday, as is forecast by the majority of financial market economists.\nWhile expectations for any change on Tuesday are near zero, many analysts will be on the look-out for any suggestion in the board's statement that monetary policy could be cut in coming months.\nLast week saw some prominent forecasters argue in favour of additional interest rate cuts to put further downward pressure on the currency, which traded at US70.69¢ on Monday.\nSpeculation about the need for additional cuts has grown amid concern about the labour market and the US Federal Reserve's decision to again delay its \"lift-off\" from zero interest rates, a decision that has put renewed modest upward pressure on Australia's currency.\n\"Despite recent suggestions that the RBA should cut, it would appear unwise to do so in a world where the Fed is now very likely to raise at its next meeting,\" said shadow board member Mark Crosby, associate professor in economics at Melbourne University's business school.\n Professor Crosby said while Australia's economic fundamentals remain weak, those problems are better fixed through tax, competition and other reforms than through further monetary policy easing.\n\"Issues with excessive debt remain significant in many economies, and Australia ought not to exacerbate potential problems on that front through cutting rates,\" he said.\n\"The medium-term question is still how rates become normalised.\"\n'Rate cuts are off the agenda' While financial market betting late last week implied there is about a 30 per cent chance of a cut in November and roughly 50 per cent for December, more positive economic data argues against further action.\nJob ads jumped last month by 3.9 per cent , ANZ Bank said on Monday, a sign the economy is benefiting from the lower dollar and adjusting to lower commodity prices and mining investment.\nSeparate figures showed new car sales at a record and the inflation rate potentially heading higher. The services sector continued to expand, according to Australian Industry Group's monthly performance of services index.\nThe improved data-flow prompted Commsec chief economist Craig James to reiterate his forecast that official interest rates will remain unchanged for the next year.\n\"Rate cuts are clearly off the agenda for now,\" he said.\nThe shadow board's confidence that the cash rate should be kept unchanged is 72 per cent, down from 77 per cent a month earlier, with confidence that a cut is appropriate edging up five percentage points to 14 per cent. Confidence that the rate should be hiked to 2.25 per cent was unchanged at 14 per cent.\nThe shadow board includes professors Bob Gregory and Warwick McKibbin, both former RBA board members, as well as HSBC's Paul Bloxham, University of Melbourne's Guay Lim, James Morley of University of NSW, Jeffrey Sheen of Macquarie University, Mardi Dungey of University of Tasmania and John Romalis, professor of economics at the University of Sydney.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:03:14.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
