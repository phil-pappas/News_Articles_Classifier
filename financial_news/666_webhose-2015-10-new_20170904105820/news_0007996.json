Helmed by Rupert Murdoch, an Australian American business magnate, News Corporation amassed a vast media empire that included news, film, television, publishing, and other various assets during 1979-2013. And on June 28, 2013, News Corporation split into two powerhouse companies: 21 st Century Fox (FOXA), which kept most of the film, television, and new media holdings; and News Corp (NWS), which concentrates on news and publishing. Murdoch continues to chair both companies.\n\n\n\nSo what media outlets do News Corp and 21 st Cenutry Fox operate? A lot, it turns out. Here’s a look at all the media holdings owned by each company.\n\n\n\nNews Corp \n\n\n\nView gallery\n. \nPhoto: Deadline.com \n\n\n\nAfter the major split in 2013, News Corporation’s publishing sector was funneled into News Corp, one of the two newly-formed companies. Arguably the biggest asset of News Corp is Dow Jones & Company, which is an American publishing and financial firm that is best known for the influential Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and similar market statistics. Under this umbrella falls the notable The Wall Street Journal , Barron’s Magazine , MarketWatch.com, FinancialNews.com, BigCharts.com, and ProfessorJournal.com. Also in the United States, News Corp operates the daily newspaper the New York Post .\n\n\n\nThe second largest arm of News Corp is HarperCollins Publishing LLC, one of the world’s largest publishing companies, with groups in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India. A result of many mergers between past publishing houses, HarperCollins has published famous authors like J.R.R. Tolkein, Mark Twain, the Brontë sisters, and Agatha Christie.  \n\n\n\nNews Corp also has a huge presence in Australia, operating newspapers like The Australian , The Daily Telegraph , and Herald Sun , among many others. The corporation also controls Australian versions of the Associated Press and popular magazines GQ , Vogue , and Golf Digest , all in a long list of magazine publications. In the United Kingdom, News Corp runs newspapers The Sun , The Times , The Sunday Times , and TLS , The Times’ literary supplement.\n\n\n\nIn addition to all these news, business, and lifestyle publications, News Corp owns a marketing subsidiary called News America Marketing, which offers three categories of products: Home-Delivered network, In-Store network, and Online-Savings network.\n\n \n\n21 st Century Fox \n\n\n\nView gallery\n. \nPhoto: 21cf.com \n\n\n\nThe second company formed from the 2013 split, 21 st Century Fox, is a certified leader in film, television, and other entertainment productions. Its major film studio, Twentieth Century Fox, has distributed famous movies like the Star Wars series, Home Alone , and Planet of the Apes , as well as the highest and second highest grossing movies of all time, Avatar and Titanic , respectively. Other studios include the smaller Fox 2000 Pictures, Fox International Productions, and Fox Searchlight Pictures, among a few others.\n\n\n\nThe company also has a very successful television division, producing hit TV shows like Empire , Modern Family , and The Simpsons , as well as classics like M*A*S*H and The X Files . At this year’s Emmy Awards ceremony, Fox won four awards, with its subsidiary FX Networks, an ode to the standards put forth by premium cable networks HBO and Showtime, winning eight awards.\n\n\n\nOther basic channels owned by Fox include National Geographic, Fox Sports, Fox News Channel, Fox International (300 channels across Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa), and STARIndia (a network of over 30 channels in seven languages). This division also includes Fox Television Stations Group, which contains roughly 28 local stations across the United States, as well as Direct Broadcast Satellite Television, which is located primarily in the United Kingdom (BSkyB), Deutschland (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; Sky Deutschland), and Italy (Sky Italia).\n\n\n\n21 st Century also owns roughly a third of Hulu, the popular Internet streaming video service, in partnership with Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA).\n\n\n\n Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
