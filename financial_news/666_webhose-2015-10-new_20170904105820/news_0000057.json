The ball is in their court,\" Vincent de Rivaz, who heads up the UK division of EDF, told the Financial Times this month. \n- 'Future (Other OTC: FRNWF - news ) of nuclear' - \nHinkley Point would not be the first time EDF has worked with the Chinese. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) already has a long-standing partnership with CGN in building two EPR reactors at Taishan, and the French group hopes to open wider the doors to the huge Chinese market. \n\"Nuclear energy is an option that cannot be overlooked. The country (China) has 50 reactors of which 25 are under construction, representing the majority of nuclear plants being built in the world,\" said Herve Machenaud, an EDF representative in China. \n\"The future of the sector is taking place for a big part over there,\" he said. \nEDF also needs its ties with Chinese firms to maintain its know-how, an advantage which surpasses the risk involved in the transfer of technologies, experts say. \n\"The Chinese are no longer copiers. The have become more and more the motor\" of industrial development, said Cyril Crocq-Gaillard, consultant at Sia Partners. \nBut clouds hang over the prospects for Hinkley Point. \nEDF has had to push back four times the launch of its EPR reactor project at Flamanville in northwest France, now set for late 2018, causing increased cost overruns. \nAnother EPR project in Finland involving Areva (Paris: FR0011027143 - news ) , the French atomic energy giant together with German engineering group Siemens (BSE: SIEMENS4.BO - news ) , has also been plagued with a string of technical and safety setbacks. It plans to launch a testing phase next year. \nOn the legal front, the Austrian government has filed a complaint with the European Court of Justice against state subsidies for the planned nuclear plant in Britain, on the grounds they distort the market. \nSeen as a major boost to the nuclear industry four years after the disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant, some environmentalists view Hinkley Point as an unnecessary support for nuclear energy just as renewable energy technologies begin to take hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:31:49.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
