This is a huge risk,\" he added. \n\"We need at least 19 billion cubic metres to pump into our storage facilities to ensure gas transit.\" \nThe resumption of deliveries could help Kiev accumulate 17 billion cubic meters of natural gas by October 21, the \"absolute minimum for the security of gas transit to Europe,\" said analysts from VTB Capital bank. \nBut these reserves could not be enough if the winter is harsh, they warned. \nEnd-of-year haggling over energy prices had been a familiar problem between Russia and Ukraine but ties collapsed altogether after a popular uprising in Kiev ousted Kremlin (LSE: 0Q8D.L - news ) -backed leader Viktor Yanukovych last year. \nKiev has been seeking to diversify its supply base away from Russia after Moscow cut gas supplies to Ukraine in 2006 and 2009, interrupting transit to Europe. \nMoscow hiked the price it charges Ukraine following the ouster of Yanukovych, which unleashed a pro-Russian insurgency in the east of the ex-Soviet country. \nWith Russia slipping into recession on the back of lower oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, the economy ministry said Gazprom could produce 414 billion cubic metres of gas this year, an all-time low due to weak demand, among other reasons. \nLast week Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said a \"real truce\" had begun in eastern Ukraine but a long-lasting peace with pro-Kremlin insurgents would still take some time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:15:14.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
