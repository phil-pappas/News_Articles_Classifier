Lindsay Edelman, an instructor whose mission is to reform the offenders, hammered home the basic rules, so they wouldn’t break them again.\nThe offense they were all guilty of: excessive use of water. California’s record drought has forced many cities like Santa Cruz to put in place mandatory caps on per capita water usage. If water users exceed their allocation, they get a hefty financial penalty.\nENLARGE Conservation sign Or they can attend Santa Cruz Water School, the environmental equivalent of traffic school. At the end of two hours of the free class, the offenders must take a test to be officially pardoned.\nThe adults weren’t attending out of a thirst for water knowledge. “I don’t even know what I’m doing here,” said Nancy Westreich, owner of a vacation rental in the surf town. A toilet in her cottage was constantly running, and she hired a plumber as soon as her guests reported it. Still, her monthly water bill was higher than normal, $150 instead of the usual $75. Add to that a fine of $425, which she didn’t need to pay if she completed the course.\nCities such as Santa Cruz are getting more creative to get people to save water as the drought stretches into its fifth year. In addition to water school, which opened last summer, Santa Cruz gives out free five-minute shower timers and garden hose shut-off nozzles. The city pays residents up to $2,500 to remove their lawns. Sacramento also runs a water school, and California’s Urban Water Conservation Council has stressed the advantages of both programs in its handouts.\nTattling on neighbors is often more popular than changing one’s own behavior. “Drought shaming” is a phenomenon occurring all over the Golden State. Santa Cruz opened a “leak line” where people can report leaks, but city officials say many use it to tell on their neighbors. Terms like “grasshole” have popped up on social media to describe people with flourishing green lawns.\nSanta Cruz is also rapping some knuckles. The city put in place water rations in May 2014 and introduced penalties for exceeding them. Residents can easily be flooded with fines of several hundred dollars. Paradise Park, a residential development in the Santa Cruz Mountains, faced a record penalty of more than $20,000 this spring.\nAttending water school gives offenders one free pass to get their penalty waived. The idea, inspired by traffic school, was under consideration for years before it was enacted last year when the drought worsened. After a 1976-1977 drought, city clerks were drowning in appeals against water fines long after the dry spell ended. Santa Cruz wanted to avoid a similar situation this time around.\nSome water consumers are trying to ration their water ration violations. Saskia Amaro, one of the students in an August class, regretted using her free pass on a pool leak that cost her $175 in fines. She feared she would rack up an even higher bill soon since she had just hosted her son’s wedding at her house, an occasion for which she had spray-painted her dry lawn. She accommodated 14 guests who showered, flushed toilets and washed laundry regularly.\n“Visitors won’t leave a toilet unflushed in someone else’s home,” said Ms. Amaro, “and you can attend water school only once.”\nAt the class, adults poured in after work. The five instructors, all employees at the city’s water department, checked them in, turning away one person who arrived 20 minutes late.\nBrowse Recent A-Heds ENLARGE Chicago Baseball Fans Follow Tradition to the Letter Germans Have a Burning Need for More Garbage LSD Archive Has Been on a Long, Strange Trip First up on the water school curriculum was a geography lesson. “Folks, has anyone seen San Lorenzo River lately?” asked Neal Christen, a Santa Cruz native who has taught most of the 30 sessions of the class. “What river?” a student replied, eliciting laughter from his classmates. Mr. Christen explained that the river, which resembles a stream in some parts, accounts for almost half of the city’s water supply. “This may or may not be on your test later,” he hinted with a wink.\nNext up was show and tell. “Who knows where your water meter is?” the instructor asked, while handing around the object that had ratted out the students.\nThe teachers gave tips on how to save water. Ms. Edelman shared that she created a five-minute playlist to time her showers, featuring songs such as “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head.” Mr. Christen has advocated for sharing showers. Another rule: “If it’s yellow, let it mellow,” Ms. Edelman said. “If it’s brown, flush it down.”\nThen they turned it over to the students for ideas, though many were playing with their smartphones instead. One attendant suggested building bigger storage units for water, which Mr. Christen nixed as too costly. A student in a previous class proposed wearing clothes only once to avoid washing them.\nIt was time for the students to test their new water knowledge. The instructors handed out a multiple-choice quiz of nine questions, such as how much water comes from the San Lorenzo River and four ways to conserve more water.\nMore than 800 locals have passed through water school and about $500,000 in fines have evaporated as a result, says Toby Goddard, who developed the concept as the city’s water conservation manager. Initiatives like the water school are helping Santa Cruz be among the best in class in slashing water use. Its daily per capita water use was about 41 gallons in August, less than half of the statewide average.\nThe test was self-graded, and some of the students had to correct their answers when reviewing their results. (Unlike real school, the students didn’t need to pass the test to graduate.)At the end of the evening, each water violator left with a bucket full of advice and a gift: a package of toilet dye tablets to check for leaks at home and avoid a new fine.\nThen the instructors dismissed their new graduates. “This is a onetime deal,” said Mr. Christen, “as much as we’d like to have you back.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT977_Sign_G_20151019161518.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:02:39.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
