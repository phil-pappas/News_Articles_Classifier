This topped the $2.1bn raised in the whole of 2014 and is three times more than the £790m raised in 2010, according to data from promotional organisation London & Partners. \nLondon has been the main beneficiary of funding, attracting 75pc of total investments. \nHowever, firms outside the capital are also attracting multi-million-pound offers from investors. Major non-London deals included an $82m investment into Cheshire-based holiday company Sykes Cottages, $61m of financing for Lancashire-based communications firm Daisy Group, and an injection of $50m into Cambridge Quantum Computing. \nTop investments outside London this year *Sykes Cottages, Cheshire, $82m *Daisy Group, Lancashire, $60.77m *Cambridge Quantum Computing, Cambridgeshire, $50m *Gigaclear, Oxfordshire, $46m *First Light Fusion, Oxfordshire, $35.41m Just four companies accounted for half of the $491m raised in London in the past three months. These were online takeaway service Deliveroo, which raised $70m in July, Made (Paris: FR0010328302 - news ) .com and Secret Escapes, which recently raised $60m apiece, and Prodigy Finance’s $19.5m investment round. \n= Total VC investment in technology for London and UK = \nThere has been a rapid rise in the number of tech businesses in the capital. London’s digital technology sector has grown by 46pc since 2010 , and there are expected to be 51,500 firms by 2025, according to consultancy Oxford Economics. \n“In little more than five years we have seen investment in London’s tech sector increase tenfold. Today’s figures, and the fact that London is home to more software developers than anywhere else in the world, validate the fact that London’s tech sector is maturing and is one of the world's leading tech hubs,” said Eileen Burbidge, partner at London-based investment firm Passion Capital and newly appointed head of government agency Tech City UK. \nLondon’s tech industry has boomed since internet use became mainstream. Over the past decade , more international tech investment projects have come to London than to rivals Paris, Dublin, Madrid, Amsterdam and Munich put together. \nLondon grabbed 1,009, against just 381 for Paris, according to research from EY, the accountancy giant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:35:14.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
