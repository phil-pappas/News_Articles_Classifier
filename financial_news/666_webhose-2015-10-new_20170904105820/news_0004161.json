The People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) said it will cut its one-year deposit rate and one-year lending rate by 25 basis points each to 1.5% and 4.35%, respectively. \nThe PBoC also cut the reverse requirement ratio for all banks by 50 basis points to 17.5%, with an extra 50 bps reduction for some lenders. \n\"These moves come after clear signs of weakness in the economy in recent months. Amid continued capital outflow and falling CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) inflation, we believe these cuts may be necessary to prevent a tightening of financial conditions,\" said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) . Earlier in China the latest survey from the Conference Board showed its index rose 1.6% month-on-month in September compared with a 1% gain in August and a 0.9% climb in July. The coincident index slid 1.2% after rising 0.7% in August and 1% in July. \nManufacturing data, ECB stimulus The Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index held at 52 in October compared to a month ago, beating expectations for a reading of 51.7, Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) revealed. A reading above 50 signals expansion in sector activity. \nSeparately, Markit's US manufacturing PMI rose from 53.1 in September to 54 in October, comfortably above the 52.9 reading analysts had expected. \nMeanwhile, the market continued to digest Thursday's European Central Bank press conference where president Mario Draghi hinted at further stimulus to address prolonged low inflation amid concerns about risks from China and falling commodity prices. \nDraghi said policymakers would re-examine the ECB's â‚¬60bn a month asset purchase programme in December and consider extending it past September 2016 if needed. He also revealed that the central bank had also discussed furthering lowering the deposit rate, although there was \"no specific preference to one instrument or the other, they were all considered\". \n\"Strong ECB easing in December also limits the chances the Fed will hike at the same time, pushing a lift-off further into 2016,\" said RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) analysts. \nTalkTalk under pressure Market Movers FTSE 100 (UKX) 6,444.08 1.06% FTSE 250 (MCX) 17,240.70 1.15% techMARK (TASX) 3,107.42 1.44% FTSE 100 - Risers Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) (TPK) 1,939.00p 5.09% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 4,641.00p 4.41% WPP (Swiss: OXWPP.SW - news ) (WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) ) 1,478.00p 4.16% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 351.40p 4.09% Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) (BRBY) 1,351.00p 4.00% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 758.00p 3.84% Schroders (SDR) 2,961.00p 3.82% Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,581.00p 3.65% Dixons Carphone (Other OTC: DSITF - news ) (DC.) 458.20p 3.59% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,073.00p 3.47% FTSE 100 - Fallers Pearson (Amsterdam: PR8.AS - news ) (PSON) 900.50p -5.21% BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) (BG.) 1,057.00p -2.31% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,775.50p -1.53% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,762.50p -1.37% Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.) 6,249.00p -0.97% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,208.00p -0.58% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 540.00p -0.46% British Land Company (BLND) 865.50p -0.46% Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) 3,502.00p -0.31% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 976.00p -0.31% FTSE 250 - Risers Petra Diamonds Ltd (LSE: PDL.L - news ) .(DI) (PDL) 90.10p 7.58% Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 370.80p 6.98% Cable & Wireless Communications (LSE: CWC.L - news ) (CWC) 74.60p 6.57% Carillion (CLLN) 319.70p 6.50% Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) (ALM) 447.30p 5.52% AA (AA.) 276.50p 5.33% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 283.50p 5.08% Clarkson (CKN) 2,525.00p 4.34% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 166.40p 4.33% BBA Aviation (LSE: BBA.L - news ) (BBA) 206.20p 4.30% FTSE 250 - Fallers William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) (WMH) 318.00p -7.93% Home Retail Group (HOME) 112.70p -6.08% Micro Focus International (Other OTC: MCFUF - news ) (MCRO) 1,170.00p -4.96% TalkTalk Telecom Group (TALK) 256.80p -4.36% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 74.80p -3.48% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 212.30p -2.84% SIG (Stuttgart: QIG.SG - news ) (SHI) 137.60p -2.76% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 209.00p -1.88% Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) (TLPR) 341.60p -1.84% Sophos Group (LSE: SOPH.L - news ) (SOPH) 257.90p -1.71% Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) and Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) were among the top rises on the FTSE 100, lifted by the PBoC's announcement. \nTravis Perkins rebounded after it said on Thursday that its full-year earnings are likely to be at the lower end of market expectations due to weakness in the repair, maintenance and improvement market.
