However, Sydney dipped 0.50 percent. \nHong Kong was closed for a public holiday. \nThe dollar bought 119.94 yen compared with 119.84 yen in New York and well up from 119.44 yen earlier Tuesday in Asia. \nThe euro bought 136.24 yen and $1.1363 against 135.97 yen and $1.1346 in US trade. It bought 135.30 yen and $1.1328 in Asia Tuesday. \nThe single currency got a lift after the European Central Bank said eurozone banks reported that its own stimulus programme had led to an improvement in lending conditions for businesses. \nAdditional liquidity made available to banks through the ECB's bond-buying scheme, launched in March, was being used to grant loans over the past six months. \nThe positive report came ahead of an ECB policy meeting on Thursday that is being monitored to see if it further loosens monetary policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:07:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
