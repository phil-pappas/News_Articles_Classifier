However, a 4pc fee is applied. Some borrowers do this to pay off other debts elsewhere as part of a risky balancing act. \nThere’s also a 2.79pc fee on balance transfers. \nIn terms of these fees, customers could get a better deal on a 36-month credit card, if they were confident they could pay off the balance a month sooner. Barclaycard's Platinum card offers 36 months at 0% with a 2.39pc balance transfer fee, and for the same interest free time period, Halifax charges a 2.45pc fee. You can cut fees further by getting a balance transfer card with a shorter 0pc term. \n• PPI deadline looms: should I claim £2,750 now? • 'MBNA cancelled my credit cards' \nNot everyone will be eligible for the card with the company weeding out those with poor credit histories. If unsuccessful, Virgin Money won’t offer applicants a shorter option. \nOnce the fee-free period is over, customers will be charged 18.9pc on balance transfers and 20.9pc on money transfers, a little above the average. \nAndrew Hagger of Moneycomms said: \"Consumers shouldn't be blinkered into opting for the deal purely based on the longest duration. They need to factor in the one-off balance transfer fee. With Virgin Money's 2.79pc fee this would cost £139.50 on a £5,000 switch.\" \nBarclaycard, with one month less of interest, charges 1.75pc for balance transfers so it would cost just £87.50. Halifax offers 20 months at 0pc with no balance transfer fee. \nMr Hagger added: \"Borrowers should be aware that if they exceed their credit limit or are late with a monthly payment the promotional 0pc deal is terminated on the spot and their balance is then charged at the go to rate which in the case of Virgin Money is 18.9pc APR representative.\" \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nHave a question for our experts?
