When managing IPF it is important that physicians discuss with their patients what to expect from treatment and which treatment is right for them, to initiate this treatment early and then to ensure the patient stays on it as long as possible.” Key results from the interim analysis of INPULSIS ® -ON INPULSIS ® -ON is an open-label single arm study. More than 90% of IPF patients participating in INPULSIS ® and eligible for open-label treatment with nintedanib in INPULSIS ® -ON opted to participate. Patients on placebo treatment in the INPULSIS ® trials newly initiated treatment with OFEV ®* in the extension trial and patients already treated with OFEV ®* in the INPULSIS trials continued to receive OFEV ®* . The effect of OFEV ®* on the mean change from baseline in FVC at week 48 of the INPULSIS ® -ON trial was comparable to the one seen at 52 weeks in the INPULSIS ® trial: In INPULSIS ® -ON: -87 mL for all patients, -96,4 mL for patients continuing treatment with OFEV ® in the extension trial and -73,1 mL for patients initiating treatment with OFEV ®1 In INPULSIS ® (pooled data): -88,9 mL (OFEV ® ) vs. -203,0 mL (placebo) 1 ​ The analysis substantiates the effects of OFEV ®* on slowing disease progression and confirms the long-term efficacy of OFEV ®* . 1 Additionally no new safety signals were identified following long-term treatment with OFEV ®* in INPULSIS ® -ON. 1 The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature with diarrhoea affecting 64% of patients but leading to drug discontinuation in only 5%. 1 Effect of OFEV ®* on a broad range of IPF patients ** New subgroup-analyses from the INPULSIS ® study presented at the congress examined whether OFEV ®* had a consistent effect on patients with IPF who were also taking commonly used medications, including anti-acids and corticosteroids, when they were enrolled in the study. 2,3 Anti-acid medications are often given to patients with IPF to manage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is common in patients with IPF and is considered to be a risk factor for IPF disease progression and acute exacerbations. 5 IPF patients are also sometimes treated with low doses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) and therefore subjects receiving low doses of corticosteroids were allowed in the INPULSIS ® trials. 6 The analyses confirm that these concomitant medications taken at baseline do not influence the beneficial effect of OFEV ®* on annual rate of FVC decline. 2,3 The two analyses provided further evidence that OFEV ®* slows disease progression in a broad range of IPF patients ** . 2,3 These data are presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress on 29 September 2015 at 14.45 CEST in Room 4.1.

The recommendation also takes into account the expected cost of treatment and potentially significant adverse effects. *Nintedanib is approved under the brand name OFEV ® in the US, EU, Japan and other territories for use in patients with IPF **Including those with preserved lung function (FVC>90%pred), no honeycombing on HRCT and concomitant emphysema *** This conditional recommendation means that clincians are encouraged to discuss preferences with their patients when making treatment decisions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:11:53.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
