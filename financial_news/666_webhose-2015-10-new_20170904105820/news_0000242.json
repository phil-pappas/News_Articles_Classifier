Clients have only really got two or three more weeks to do anything before year-end and they are not going to take big positions going into December,\" said Sean Darby, a strategist at Jefferies.\n\"On Japan, people also may have read too much into the possible crossover from the ECB.\"\nBets that Japan's already massive stimulus would be increased had risen after China's cut interest rates last week and the European Central Bank indicated it may add to its asset purchase programme in December. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which also meets this week, is also increasingly seen delaying its first rate increase for nearly a decade until next year.\nGlobal equities, which have rebounded 10 percent from the depths of September's sell-off, were broadly flat on Monday, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index down 0.3 percent. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edging up 0.1 percent.\nPoland's benchmark equity index reversed early falls and rose 0.5 percent after the main opposition party Law and Justice won weekend parliamentary elections. The party confirmed its plan to introduce a banking tax as of January 2016, which hit bank stocks like PKO BP and mBank .\nThere were some mixed updates from earnings season. French carmaker Peugeot fell 2.4 percent after a trading update and Philips slid more than 1 percent after warning that the sale of its Lumileds division was in doubt.\nThe prospect of more central bank cash was seen supporting bond markets, with Italian and Spanish bond yields at nearly their lowest levels in half a year on expectations additional ECB stimulus will lift lower-rated euro zone bonds. German Bund yields hovered just above 0.50 percent.\nThere was little respite for commodities, with crude oil prices remaining weak as a slowing demand outlook implied oversupply would remain in place for months.\nIron ore futures in China and Singapore ticked lower amid pressure from a weak steel market, though copper prices edged higher.
