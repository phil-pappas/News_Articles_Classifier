Mike Hewitt by Ian McGeechan I think we witnessed the 2015 Rugby World Cup finalists - and very possibly World Cup winners - win a brilliant Test match at Twickenham on the weekend. What a match.\nI had just covered the Scotland v Samoa game for ITV and stayed on to watch the match on the screens there. It is difficult to conceive of two more different games of rugby; all-out attack and then all-out defence. But both, in their own ways, absolutely riveting and great examples of 15-man rugby.\nI always said that I felt the winners of Pool A would go on to make the final and I am certainly not changing my mind now. After showing the world that they have arguably the best attacking backs in the world in their win against England, the Wallabies showed against Wales that they have very possibly the best defence in the world as well.\nThat was as good a defensive match as I have seen in my life. And I mean from both teams, actually. For Wales to stop Australia scoring any tries was a huge achievement in itself, all through the game, including the last 10 minutes when it looked like they might cut loose.\nWales' back row more than matched Australia's - and that is praise of the highest order. For every turnover by David Pocock, you had one from Sam Warburton. I thought he was immense, as was Toby Faletau. Any carrier that was isolated they would snaffle.\nIt was difficult to fault Wales really. They gave everything, largely nullified Australia, I thought Gareth Davies was once again tenacious and impressive. Dan Biggar did what he could considering the lack of time and space on the pitch.\nGareth Anscombe at full back also impressed me. The only thing that will disappoint Warren Gatland is their failure to score in that 10-minute period when Australia were down to 13 men.\nWales tried to keep it tight and make their extra men count by bulldozing over, then they tried to hit their big runners in the centres. But they came up against an extraordinary defensive display. That tackle by Bernard Foley to stop George North was simply incredible.\n The only thing you could fault Australia for was the ill discipline that saw two men sent to the bin. The Will Genia tackle was just stupid and could certainly have cost them the match. In fact, I was pretty sure it would. Australia clearly never lost their focus or their self-belief though.\nMichael Cheika deserves huge credit. As a coach myself it is wonderful to see what he has done with this team. In the space of 12 months he has harnessed this squad and got them playing for each other and believing in themselves.\nI spoke last week about his decision to delegate in the scrummaging department; bringing in Mario Ledesma to sort out the pack. Australia's ability now to match the very best in the world in that department has clearly given them huge self-belief and confidence.\nThere were some gripes about Pocock getting the benefit of the doubt with a few decisions, but how often have we said the same about Richie McCaw? Pocock knows just how far he can push it.\nAs for their backs, we already knew they were world class. Now watch Australia soar.\nOnce again last night, as against England, it was Australia who finished on top at scrum time. They scavenged superbly, even without Michael Hooper and Pocock - who left the field with injury.\nAnd their control of the match in the final 10 minutes was the piece de resistance .\nOnce they had got the full complement of players back on the pitch they went up to Wales' half and never left it again.\nIt was clear-headed and mighty, mighty impressive. In fact, that ability to adapt to circumstances - something all great teams have - was almost the most impressive thing about the Australian performance.\nWith no disrespect to Scotland, Australia should win that match comfortably. Their back row is just on a different level and I think the breakdown will be decisive. We do not yet know the extent of Pocock's injury but with Hooper to come back they are well stocked.\nAnd the psychological boost they will take from emerging top of that pool, in that manner, showing both their offensive and defensive attributes, will give them even more belief in themselves.\nAs for Wales, they can take a lot of positives from that performance. I don't think they will be hit by the same psychological breakdown that England suffered after losing a similarly intense battle.\nSeven days it plenty of time to recover for South Africa and I think they have every chance of winning that game.\nIt will not be easy, of course. After their opening defeat by Japan, South Africa have really hit their straps and they have dangerous players all over the pitch. My confidence in Wales stems, though, from their back row where I believe they have the edge over South Africa, who have a pretty useful back row themselves with Francois Louw, Duane Vermeulen and Schalk Burger.\nIt will be a huge physical battle again. Those South Africans are big men and they will try to make that power count.\nBut Wales have shown such reserves of self-belief in their games thus far that I have no doubt they are capable of winning. That would almost certainly lead to a clash with the All Blacks, however.\nThere is no doubt they have got the tough half of the draw now. If they make it through to the final - and possibly a rematch with Australia - it would be one of the all-time sporting achievements.\nHow I would love to see those two teams go at it hammer and tongs again, though. That was some Test match.\nIan McGeechan is a former rugby player and coach of Scotland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:16:47.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
