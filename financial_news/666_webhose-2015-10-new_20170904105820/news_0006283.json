These codeshare flights generate an additional €140 million ($159 million) turnover per year for airberlin, several German media outlets reported.\nEtihad is airberlin’s biggest single shareholder and owns 29.21% of its oneworld partner.\nMembers of airberlin´s works-council addressed a note to German chancellor Angela Merkel that without this codeshare agreement the situation could be existence-threatening for the financially troubled airline .\nAirberlin in Berlin was not able to comment.\nLuftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), the German aviation authority, checks codeshare deals every time airlines submit winter and summer schedules for flights to and from Germany.\nThe authority said that codeshare flights for Etihad-airberlin in the last winter-schedule (2014/15) and for the summer-schedule 2015 had been given temporary approval.\nAirberlin last year hoped to find a solution for permanent codeshare approval without the continued questioning.\nIn August, airberlin reported a second-quarter net loss of €37.5 million, widened from a net loss of €8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. First-half net losses were €247.6 million, widened from a €201.2 million net loss in the year-ago period. Airberlin reported a €377 million loss ($458 million) in 2014, deepened 19% from a €315.5 million loss in the year-ago period.\nAirberlin CEO Stefan Pichler told ATW in a recent interview that the partnership with Etihad remained on a positive trend. Passenger numbers on shared routes grew during 2014 to over 600,000, an increase of nearly 7%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:41:42.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
