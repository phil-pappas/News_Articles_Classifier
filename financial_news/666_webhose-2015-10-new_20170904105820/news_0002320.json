Share on twitter by Joanna Mather High-income earners would be targeted with extra taxes on superannuation and capital gains under a plan that could raise more $8 billion a year, more than enough to cut the company tax to 26 per cent.\nA report by Deloitte says it would be fairer to tax super like income, subject to progressive rates, and suggests contributions be taxed at marginal rates minus 15Â¢.\nThis would cut the contribution tax for the lowest income earners to 6 per cent while more than doubling the tax to 34 per cent for those earning between $180,000 and $300,000, raising $6 billion in 2016-17 alone.\nDeloitte's Chris Richardson proposes taxing super at personal marginal tax rates minus 15 per cent. Glenn Hunt A second measure would reduce the 50 per cent tax discount on profits from the sale of property and shares, possibly to 33.3 per cent. It is understood this would raise more than $2 billion a year.\nThe extra tax could be used to plug the budget deficit, remove harmful state taxes like stamp duties or fund hospitals, Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said.\n\"We have a progressive tax system whereby tax increases alongside earnings,\" he said. \"Yet we tax super at a flat rate of 15 per cent, which is hugely beneficial for the wealthy but actually hurts the lowest income earners.\n\"A fairer regime also comes with a pretty big silver lining. This reform would save $6 billion, which could be used to shift the company tax rate down to 26 per cent from the current 30 per cent.\"\n The government has reaffirmed its position that all ideas are on the table.\nRebuking the approach of former prime minister Tony Abbott, Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said on Sunday that it would be \"ridiculous\" to rule anything in or out.\nBut Ms O'Dwyer did echo the previous regime's claims that negative gearing benefits middle Australia, not just the rich.\n\"I think a lot of people say that only wealthy Australians take advantage of negative gearing,\" she told the ABC's Insiders program. \"When you look at the facts that's not the case. Average income earners largely are the people who get to take advantage of negative gearing.\"\nDumped treasurer Joe Hockey heaped pressure on the government when he used his valedictory speech last week to advocate a careful paring back of tax breaks on super and directing negative gearing to new homes.\nThe Turnbull government is developing a tax white paper to take to the next election. In office, Mr Hockey did not challenge Mr Abbott's pledge not to make any changes to super tax breaks and negative gearing.\nLabor: increase super tax for high earners Labor's super policy is to increase taxes on super for high-income earners, and frontbencher Jason Clare said on Sunday that he believed a bipartisan approach was possible. \"Malcolm Turnbull has almost said it himself ... that has got to be the next area we can work together,\" Mr Clare told Sky News on Sunday.\nThe Deloitte plan would take personal marginal tax rates and reduce them by 15 cents in the dollar. Tax on earnings within super would remain at 15 per cent and post-retirement money would still be tax-free.\nSomebody in the top bracket earning between $180,000 and $300,000 and paying 49 cents in the dollar (including the Medicare and budget repair levies) would pay 34 per cent on their super contributions.\nThose in the lowest bracket, earning between $18,201 and $37,000, and on an effective 21 per cent rate (including Medicare) would pay a contributions tax of 6 per cent.\nAnother Deloitte report released in September found a 15 per cent GST would generate enough money for household compensation and a company tax cut to 25 per cent, while still leaving $21 billion a year.\nThe latest report also examines negative gearing and finds it not guilty of pushing up property prices. Rather it is low interest rates, a lack of supply and the overly generous discount on capital gains that are to blame.\nThe discount means somebody on the top marginal tax rate pays half as much tax on the sale of property or shares held for more than 12 months than their income from work. The report suggests reducing the capital gains tax discount to 33.3 per cent because that is the rate at which capital gains are taxed in super funds. Another option is to double from 12 to 24 months the time an asset must be held before the discount applies.\nConsensus on bias to wealthy There is widespread consensus that the wealthy benefit disproportionately from super tax concessions. At present, everybody pays a flat 15 per cent tax on contributions and earnings in the accumulation phase, although there are annual caps on how much money can be contributed in both pre-tax and after-tax dollars.\nAlso, those with an adjusted taxable income of $300,000 or more pay 30 per cent on super contributions. Super can be accessed at the age of 60. In retirement phase, super is tax-free.\nThe Financial System Inquiry led by former banker David Murray found that only $1 in every $200 of the cost of super concessions goes to the bottom 20 per cent of income earners, whereas more than half goes to the top 20 per cent.\nLabor has promised to end the tax-free status of retirees earning more than $75,000 a year and reduce the high-income threshold to $300,000 to $250,000. But the noises coming from the Coalition indicate that any trimming of tax breaks on super would affect money going into nest eggs rather than what is spent in retirement.\nThe government has agreed to a Murray inquiry recommendation that the purpose of super be written into legislation. If that purpose disavows wealth creation and estate planning, the government will be under pressure to rethink tax settings.\nReduce reliance on pension The government wants to reduce reliance on the age pension. The Deloitte report says the super system is not at present helping achieve that goal.\n\"Because most concessions go to higher income earners, Treasury's Intergenerational Report found the share of older Australians getting pensions in 2055 will be much the same as today's,\" the report says.\nThe Deloitte report says claims that super tax concessions will soon be costing more than the pension are false. It says that by assuming the money going into super would otherwise be taxed like wages, Treasury comes up with the figure of $51 billion for tax concessions on super in 2018-19.\nThat matches the $50 billion pension bill. But when the future savings to the budget and benefits of super are taken into account, the figure comes down substantially, the report says.\nIt also takes a swipe at the phrase often used by Coalition politicians, including ex-PM Abbott and Treasurer Scott Morrison, that \"your super is your money\".\n\"At the risk of stating the obvious, lots of things are 'your money', including your wages, the interest you earn on a bank deposit and the rent you may earn from an investment property,\" the report says. \"But someone has to pay to keep Australia going.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:32:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
